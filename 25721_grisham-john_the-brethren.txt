john grisham the brethren by one for the weekly docket the court jester jester wore his standard garb of wellused and deeply faded maroon pajamas and lavender terrycloth shower shoes with no socks he wasnt the only inmate who went about his daily business in his pajamas but no one else dared wear lavender shoes his name was t karl and hed once owned banks in boston the pajamas and shoes werent nearly as troubling as the wig it parted at the middle and rolled in layers downward over his ears with tight curls coiling off into three directions and fell heavily onto his shoulders it was a bright gray almost white and fashioned after the old english magistrates wigs from centuries earlier a friend on the outside had found it at a secondhand costume store in manhattan in the village t karl wore it to court with great pride and odd as it was it had with time become part of the show the other inmates kept their distance from t karl anyway wig or not he stood behind his flimsy folding table in the prison cafeteria tapped a plastic mallet that served as a gavel cleared his squeaky throat and announced with great dignity hear ye hear ye hear ye the inferior federal court of north florida is now in session please rise no one moved or at least no one made an effort to stand thirty inmates lounged in various stages of repose in plastic cafeteria chairs some looking at the court jester some chatting away as if he didnt exist t karl continued let all ye who search for justice draw nigh and get screwed no laughs it had been funny months earlier when t karl first tried it now it was just another part of the show he sat down carefully making sure the rows of curls bouncing upon his shoulders were given ample chance to be seen then he opened a thick red leather book which served as the official record for the court he took his work very seriously three men entered the room from the kitchentwo of them wore shoes one was eating a saltine the one with no shoes was also barelegged up to his knees so that below his robe his spindly legs could be seen they were smooth and hairless and very brown from the suna large tattoo had been applied to his left calf he was from california all three wore old church robes from the same choir pale green with gold trim they came from the same store as t karls wig and had been presented by him as gifts at christmasthat was how he kept his job as the courts official clerk there were a few hisses and jeers from the spectators as the judges ambled across the tile floor in full regalia their robes flowing they took their places behind a long folding table near t karl but not too nearand faced the weekly gathering the short round one sat in the middle joe roy spicer was his name and by default he acted as the chief justice of the tribunal in his previous life judge spicer had been a justice of the peace in mississippi duly elected by the people of his little county and sent away when the feds caught him skimming bingo profits from a shriners club please be seated he said not a soul was standing the judges adjusted their folding chairs and shook their robes until they fell properly around them the assistant warden stood to the side ignored by the inmates a guard in uniform was with him the brethren met once a week with the prisons approval they heard cases mediated disputes settled little fights among the boys and had generally proved to be a stabilizing factor amid the population spicer looked at the docket a neat handprinted sheet of paper prepared by t karl and said court shall come to order to his right was the californian the honorable finn yarber age sixty in for two years now with five to go for income tax evasion a vendetta he still maintained to anyone who would listen a crusade by a republican governor whod managed to rally the voters in a recall drive to remove chief justice yarber from the california supreme court the rallying point had been yarbers opposition to the death penalty and his highhandedness in delaying every execution folks wanted blood yarber prevented it the republicans whipped up a frenzy and the recall was a smashing success they pitched him onto the street where he floundered for a while until the irs began asking questions educated at stanford indicted in sacramento sentenced in san francisco and now serving his time at a federal prison in florida in for two years and finn was still struggling with the bitterness he still believed in his own innocence still dreamed of conquering his enemies but the dreams were fading he spent a lot of time on the jogging track alone baking in the sun and dreaming of another life first case is schneiter versus magruder spicer announced as if a major antitrust trial was about to start schneiters not here beech said where is he infirmary gallstones again i just left there hatlee beech was the third member of the tribunal he spent most of his time in the infirmary because of hemorrhoids or headaches or swollen glands beech was fiftysix the youngest of the three and with nine years to go he was convinced he would die in prison hed been a federal judge in east texas a hardfisted conservative who knew lots of scripture and liked to quote it during trials hed had political ambitions a nice family money from his wifes familys oil trust he also had a drinking problem which no one knew about until he ran over two hikers in yellowstone both died the car beech had been driving was owned by a young lady he was not married to she was found naked in the front seat too drunk to walk they sent him away for twelve years jo roy spicer finn yarber hatlee beech the inferior court of north florida better known as the brethren around trumble a minimum security federal prison with no fences no guard towers no razor wire if you had to do time do it the federal way and do it in a place like trumble should we default him spicer asked beech no just continue it until next week okay i dont suppose hes going anywhere i object to a continuance magruder said from the crowd too bad said spicer its continued until next week magruder was on his feet thats the third time its been continued im the plaintiff i sued him he runs to the infirmary every time we have a docket whatre yall fightin over spicer asked seventeen dollars and two magazines t karl said helpfully that much huh spicer said seventeen dollars would get you sued every time at trumble finn yarber was already bored with one hand he stroked his shaggy gray beard and with the other he raked his long fingernails across the table then he popped his toes loudly crunching them into the floor in an efficient little workout that grated on the nervesin his other life when he had titlesmr chief justice of the california supreme court he often presided while wearing leather clogs no socks so that he could exercise his toes during the dull oral arguments continue it he said justice delayed is justice denied magruder said solemnly now thats original said beech one more week then well default schneiter so ordered spicer said with great finality t karl made a note in the docket book magruder sat down in a huff hed filed his complaint in the inferior court by handing to t karl a onepage summary of his allegations against schneiter only one page the brethren didnt tolerate paperwork one page and you got your day in court schneiter had replied with six pages of invective all of which had been summarily stricken by t karl the rules were kept simple short pleadings no discovery quick justice decisions on the spot and all decisions were binding if both parties submitted to the jurisdiction of the court no appeals there was nowhere to take one witnesses were not given an oath to tell the truth lying was completely expected it was after all a prison whats next spicer asked t karl hesitated for a second then said its the whiz case things were suddenly still for a moment then the plastic cafeteria chairs rattled forward in one noisy offensive the inmates scooted and shuffied until t karl announced thats close enough they were less than twenty feet away from the bench we shall maintain decorum he proclaimed the whiz matter had been festering for months at trumble whiz was a young wall street crook whod bilked some rich clients four million dollars had never been accounted for and legend held that whiz had stashed it offshore and managed it from inside trumble he had six years left and would be almost forty when paroled it was widely assumed that he was quietly serving his time until one glorious day when he would walk free still a young man and fly off in a private jet to a beach wherethe money was waiting inside the legend only grew partly because whiz kept to himself and spent long hours every day studying financials and technical charts and reading impenetrable economic publications even the warden had tried to cajole him into sharing market tips an ex lawyer known as rook had somehow got next to whiz and had somehow convinced him to share a small morsel of advice with an investment club that met once a week in the prison chapel on behalf of the club rook was now suing the whiz for fraud rook took the witness chair and began his narrative the usual rules of procedure and evidence were dispensed with so that the truth could be arrived at quickly whatever form it might take so i go to the whiz and i ask him what he thinks about valuenow a new online company i read about in forbes rook explained it was about to go public and i liked the idea behind the company whiz said hed check it out for me i heard nothing so i went back to him and said hey whiz what about valuenowand he said he thought it was a solid company and the stock would go through the roof i did not say that the whiz inserted quickly he was seated across the room by himself his arms folded over the chair in front yes you did i did not anyway i go back to the club and tell them that whiz is high on the deal so we decide we want to buy some stock in valuenow but little guys cant buy because the offering is closed i go back to whiz over there and i say look whiz you think you could pull some strings with your buddies on wall street and get us a few shares of valuenow and whiz said he thought he could do that thats a lie said whiz quiet said justice spicer youll get your chance hes lying whiz said as if there was a rule against it if whiz had money youd never know it at least not on the inside his eightbytwelve cell was bare except for stacks of financial publications no stereo fan books cigarettes none of the usual assets acquired by almost everyone else this only added to the legend he was considered a miser a weird little man who saved every penny and was no doubt stashing everything offshore anyway rook continued we decided to gamble by taking a big position invaluenow our strategy was to liquidate our holdings and consolidate consolidate asked justice beech rook sounded like a portfolio manager who handled billions right consolidate we borrowed all we could from friends and family and had close to a thousand bucks a thousand bucks repeated justice spicer not bad for an inside job then what happened i told whiz over there that we were ready to move could he get us the stock this was on a tuesday the offering was on a friday whiz said no problem said he had a buddy at goldman sux or some such place that could take care of us thats a lie whiz shot from across the room anyway on wednesday i saw whiz in the east yard and i asked him about the stock he said no problem thats a lie i got a witness who asked justice spicer picasso picasso was sitting behind rook as were the other six members of the investment club picasso reluctantly waved his hand is that true spicer asked yep picasso answered rook asked about the stock whiz said he would get it no problem picasso testified in a lot of cases and had been caught lying more than most inmates continue spicer said anyway thursday i couldnt find whiz anywhere he was hiding from me i was not friday the stock goes public it was offered at twenty a share the price we couldve bought it for if mr wall street over there had done what he promised it opened at sixty spent most of the day at eighty then dosed at seventy our plans were to sell it as soon as possible we couldve bought fifty shares at twenty sold them at eighty and walked away from the deal with three thousand dollars in profits violence was very rare at trumble three thousand dollars would not get you killed but some bones might be broken whiz had been lucky so far thered been no ambush and you think the whiz owes you these lost profits asked exchief justice finnyarber now plucking his eyebrows damned right we do look what makes the deal stink even worse is that whiz bought valuenow for himself thats a damned lie whiz said language please justice beech said if you wanted to lose a case before the brethren just offend beech with your language the rumors that whiz had bought the stock for himself had been started by rook and his gang there was no proof of it but the story had proved irresistible and had been repeated by most inmates so often that it was now established as fact it fit so nicely is that all spicer asked rook rook had other points he wanted to elaborate onbut the brethren had no patience with windy litigants especially ex lawyers still reliving their gory days there were at least five of them at trumble and they seemed to be on the docket all the time i guess so rook said what do you have to say spicer asked the whiz whiz stood and took a few steps toward their table he glared at his accusers rook and his gang of losers then he addressed the court whats the burden of proof here justice spicer immediately lowered his eyes and waited for help as a justice of the peace hed had no legal training hed never finished high school then worked for twenty years in his fathers country store thats where the votes came from spicer relied on common sense which was often at odds with the law any questions dealing with legal theory would be handled by his two colleagues its whatever we say it is justice beech said relishing a debate with a stockbroker on the courts rules of procedure clear and convincing proof asked the whiz could be but not in this case beyond a reasonable doubt probably not preponderance of the evidence now youre getting dose then they have no proof the whiz said waving his hands like a bad actor in a bad tv drama why dont you just tell us your side of the story said beech id love tovaluenow was a typical online offering lots of hype lots of red ink on the books sure rook came to me but by the time i could make my calls the offering was dosed i called a friend who told me you couldnt get near the stock even the big boys were shut out now how does that happen asked justiceyarber the room was quiet the whiz was talking money and everyone was listening happens all the time in ipos thats initial public offerings we know what an ipo is beech said spicer certainly did not didnt have many of those back in rural mississippi the whiz relaxed just a little he could dazzle them for a moment win this nuisance of a case then go back to his cave and ignore them the valuenow ipo was handled by the investment banking firm of bakinkline a small outfit in san francisco five million shares were offered bakinkline basically presold the stock to its preferred customers and friends so that most big investment firms never had a shot at the stock happens all the time the judges and the inmates even the court jester hung on every word he continued its silly to think that some disbarred yahoo sitting in prison reading an old copy of forbes can somehow buy a thousand dollars worth of valuenow and at that very moment it did indeed seem very silly rook fumed while his club members began quietly blaming him did you buy any of it asked beech of course not i couldnt get near it and besides most of the hightech and online companies are built with funny money i stay away from them what do you prefer beech asked quickly his curiosity getting the better of him value the long haul im in no hurry look this is a bogus case brought by some boys looking for an easy buck he waved toward rook who was sinking in his chair the whiz sounded perfectly believable and legitimate rooks case was built on hearsay speculation and the corroboration of picasso a notorious liar you got any witnesses spicer asked i dont need any the whiz said and took his seat each of the three justices scribbled something on a slip of paper deliberations were quick verdicts instantaneous yarber and beech slid theirs to spicer who announced by a vote of two to one we find for the defendant case dismissed whos next the vote was actually unanimous but every verdict was officially two to one that allowed each of the three a little wiggle room if later confronted but the brethren were well regarded around trumble their decisions were quick and as fair as they could make them in fact they were remarkably accurate in light of the shaky testimony they often heard spicer had presided over small cases for years in the back of his familys country store he could spot a liar at fifty feet beech andyarber had spent their careers in courtrooms and had no tolerance for lengthy arguments and delays the usual tactics thats all today t karl reported end of docket very well court is adjourned until next week t karl jumped to his feet his curls again vibrating across his shoulders and declared courts adjourned all rise no one stood no one moved as the brethren left the room rook and his gang were huddled no doubt planning their next lawsuit the whiz left quickly the assistant warden and the guard eased away without being seen the weekly docket was one of the better shows at trumble two though hed served in congress for fourteen years aaron lake still drove his own car around washington he didnt need or want a chauffeur or an aide or a bodyguard sometimes an intern would ride with him and take notes but for the most part lake enjoyed the tranquillity of sitting in dc traffic while listening to classical guitar on the stereo many of his friends especially those whod achieved the status of a mr chairman or a mrvice chairman had larger cars with drivers some even had limos not lake it was a waste of time and money and privacy if he ever sought higher office he certainly didnt want the baggage of a chauffeur wrapped around his neck besides he enjoyed being alone his office was a madhouse he had fifteen people bouncing off the walls answering phones opening files serving the folks back in arizona whod sent him to washington two more did nothing but raise money three interns managed to further clog his narrow corridors and take up more time than they deserved he was single a widower with a quaint little townhouse in georgetown that he was very fond of he lived quietly occasionally stepping into the social scene that had attracted him and his late wife in the early years he followed the beltway the traffic slow and cautious because of a light snow he was quickly cleared through cia security at langley and was very pleased to see a preferred parking space waiting for him along with two plainclothes security personnel mr maynard is waiting one of them said gravely opening his car door while the other took his briefcase power did have its perks lake had never met with the cia director at langley theyd conferred twice on the hill years earlier back when the poor guy could get around teddy maynard was in a wheelchair and in constant pain and even senators got themselves driven out to langley anytime he needed them hed called lake a halfdozen times in fourteen years but maynard was a busy man his lightlifting was usually handled by associates security barriers collapsed all around the congressman as he and his escorts worked their way into the depths of the cia headquarters by the time lake arrived at mr maynards suite he was walking a bit taller with just a trace of a swagger he couldnt help it power was intoxicating teddy maynard had sent for him inside the room a large square windowless place known unofficially as the bunker the director was sitting alone looking blankly at a large screen upon which the face of congressman aaron lake was frozen it was a recent photo one taken at a blacktie fundraiser three months earlier where lake had half a glass of wine ate baked chicken no dessert drove himself home alone and went to bed before eleven the photo was appealing because lake was so attractivelight red hair with almost no gray hair that was not colored or tinted a full hairline dark blue eyes square chin really nice teeth he was fiftythree years old and aging superbly he did thirty minutes a day on a rowing machine and his cholesterol was they hadnt found a single bad habit he enjoyed the company of women especially when it was important to be seen with one his steady squeeze was a sixtyyearold widow in bethesda whose late husband had made a fortune as a lobbyist both his parents were dead his only child was a schoolteacher in santa fe his wife of twentynine years had died in of ovarian cancer a year later his thirteenyearold spaniel died too and congressman aaron lake of arizona truly lived alone he was catholic not that that mattered anymore and he attended mass at least once a week teddy pushed the button and the face disappeared lake was unknown outside the beltway primarily because hed kept his ego in check if he had aspirations to higher office they were closely guarded his name had been mentioned once as a potential candidate for governor of arizona but he enjoyed washington too much he loved georgetownthe crowds the anonymity the city lifegood restaurants and cramped bookstores and espresso bars he liked theater and music and he and his late wife had never missed an event at the kennedy center on the hill lake was known as a bright and hardworking congressman who was articulate fiercely honest and loyal conscientious to a fault because his district was the home of four large defense contractors he had become an expert on military hardware and readiness he was chairman of the house committee on armed services and it was in that capacity that he had come to know teddy maynard teddy pushed the button again and there was lakes face for a fiftyyear veteran of intelligence wars teddy seldom had a knot in his stomach hed dodged bullets hidden under bridges frozen in mountains poisoned two czech spies shot a traitor in bonn learned seven languages fought the cold war tried to prevent the next one had more adventures than any ten agents combined yet looking at the innocent face of congressman aaron lake he felt a knot hethe ciawas about to do something the agency had never done before theyd started with a hundred senators fifty governors four hundred and thirtyfive congressmen all the likely suspects and now there was only one representative aaron lake of arizona teddy flicked a button and the wall went blank his legs were covered with a quilt he wore the same thing every daya vnecked navy sweater white shirt subdued bow tie he rolled his wheelchair to a spot near the door and prepared to meet his candidate during the eight minutes lake was kept waiting he was served coffee and offered a pastry which he declined he was six feet tall weighed oneseventy was fastidious about his appearance and had he taken the pastry teddy wouldve been surprised as far as they could tell lake never ate sugar never his coffee was strong though and as he sipped it he reviewed a little research of his own the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the alarming flow of black market artillery into the balkans lake had two memos eighty pages of doublespaced data hed crunched until two in the morning he wasnt sure why mr maynard wanted him to appear at langley to discuss such a matter but he was determined to be prepared a soft buzzer sounded the door opened and the director of the cia rolled out wrapped in a quilt and looking every day of his seventyfour years his handshake was firm though probably because of the strain of pushing himself around lake followed him back into the room leaving the two collegeeducated pit bulls to guard the door they sat opposite each other across a very long table that ran to the end of the room where a large white wall served as a screen after brief preliminaries teddy pushed a button and another face appeared another button and the lights grew dim lake loved it push little buttons hightech images flash instantly no doubt the room was wired with enough electronic junk to monitor his pulse from thirty feet recognize him teddy asked maybe i think ive seen the face before hes nadi chenkov a former general now a member of whats left of the russian parliament also known as natty lake said proudly thats him hardline communist close ties to the military brilliant mind huge ego very ambitious ruthless and right now the most dangerous man in the world didnt know that a flick another face this one of stone under a gaudy military parade hat this isyuri goltsin second in command of whats left of the russian army chenkov and goltsin have big plans another flick a map of a section of russia north of moscow theyre stockpiling arms in this region teddy said theyre actually stealing them from themselves looting the russian army but and more important theyre buying them on the black market wheres their money coming from everywhere theyre swapping oil for israeli radar theyre trafficking in drugs and buying chinese tanks through pakistan chenkov has close ties with some mobsters one of whom recently bought a factory in malaysia where they make nothing but assault rifles its very elaborate chenkov has a brain a very high iq hes probably a genius teddy maynard was a genius and if he bestowed that title on another then congressman lake certainly believed it so who gets attacked teddy dismissed the question because he wasnt ready to answer it see the town of vologda its about five hundred miles east of moscow last week we tracked sixty vetrov to a warehouse there as you know the vetrov is equivalent to our tomahawk cruise but two feet longer exactly that makes three hundred theyve moved in during the last ninety days see the town of rybinsk just southwest of vologda known for its plutonium yes tons of it enough to make ten thousand nuclear warheads chenkov and goltsin and their people control the entire area control yes through a web of regional mobsters and local army units chenkov has his people in place in place for what teddy squeezed a button and the wall was blank but the lights stayed dim so that when he spoke across the table he did so almost firm the shadows the coup is right around the corner mr lake our worst fears are coming true every aspect of russian society and culture is cracking and crumbling democracy is a joke capitalism is a nightmare we thought we could mcdonaldize the damned place and its been a disaster workers are not getting paid and theyre the lucky ones because they have jobs twenty percent do not children are dying because there are no medicines so are many adults ten percent of the population are homeless twenty percent are hungry each day things get worse the country has been looted by the mobsters we think at least five hundred billion dollars has been stolen and taken out of the country theres no relief in sight the time is perfect for a new strongman a new dictator wholl promise to lead the people back to stability the country is crying for leadership and mr chenkov has decided its up to him and he has the army he has the army and thats all it takes the coup will be bloodless because the people are ready for it theyll embrace chenkov hell lead the parade into red square and dare us the united states to stand in his way well be the bad guys again so the cold war is back lake said his words fading at the end therell be nothing cold about it chenkov wants to expand to recapture the old soviet union he desperately needs cash so hell simply take it in the form of land factories oil crops hell start little regional wars which hell easily win another map appeared phase one of the new world order was presented to lake teddy didnt miss a word i suspect hell roll through the baltic states toppling governments in estonia latvia lithuania etc then hell go to the old eastern bloc and strike a deal with some of the communists there the congressman was speechless as he watched russia expand teddys predictions were so certain so precise what about the chinese lake asked but teddy wasnt finished with eastern europe he flicked the map changed heres where we get sucked in poland yep happens every time poland is now a member of nato for some damned reason imagine that poland signing on to help protect us and europe chenkov solidifies russias old turf and casts a longing eye westward same as hider except he was looking to the east why would he want poland why did hitler want poland it was between him and russia he hated the poles and he was ready to start a war chenkov doesnt give a damn about poland he just wants to control it and he wants to destroy nato hes willing to risk a third world war buttons were pushed the screen became a wall again lights came on the audiovisuals were over and it was time for an even more serious conversation pain shot through teddys legs and he couldnt keep from fiowning i cant answer that he said we know a lot but we dont know what the mans thinking hes moving very quietly putting people in place setting things up its not completely unexpected you know of course not weve had these scenarios for the last eight years but theres always been hope that it wouldnt happen its happening congressman chenkov and goltsin are eliminating their opponents as we speak whats the timetable teddy shifted again under the quilt tried another position to stop the pain its difficult to say if hes smart which he certainly is hell wait until theres rioting in the streets i think that a year from now natty chenkov will be the most famous man in the world a year lake said to himself as if hed just been given his own death sentence there was a long pause as he contemplated the end of the world teddy certainly let him the knot in teddys stomach was significantly smaller now he liked lake a lot he was indeed very handsome and articulate and smarttheyd made the right choice he was electable after a round of coffee and a phone call teddy had to takeit was the vice presidentthey reconvened their little conference and moved forward the congressman was pleased that teddy had so much time for him the russians were coming yet teddy seemed so calm i dont have to tell you how unprepared our military is he said gravely unprepared for what for war perhaps if we are unprepared then we could well have a war if we are strong we avoid war right now the pentagon could not do what it did in the gulf war in were at seventy percent lake said with authority this was his turf seventy percent will get us a war mr lake a war we cannot win chenkov is spending every dime he can steal on new hardware were cutting budgets and depleting our military we want to push buttons and launch smart bombs so that no american blood is shed chenkov will have two million hungry soldiers anxious to fight and die if necessary for a brief moment lake felt proud hed had the guts to vote against the last budget deal because it decreased military spending the folks back home were upset about it cant you expose chenkov now he asked noabsolutely notwe have excellent intelligence if we react to him then hell know that we know its the spy game mr lake its too early to make him a monster so whats your plan lake asked boldly it was quite presumptuous to ask teddy about his plans the meeting had accomplished its purpose one more congressman had been sufficiently briefed at any moment lake could be asked to leave so that another committee chairman of some variety could be shown in but teddy had big plans and he was anxious to share them the new hampshire primary is two weeks away we have four republicans and three democrats all saying the same thing not a single candidate wants to increase defense spending we have a budget surplus miracle of all miracles and everyone has a hundred ideas about how to spend it a bunch of imbeciles just a few years ago we had huge budget deficits and congress spent money faster than it could be printed now theres a surplus theyre gorging themselves on the pork congressman bake looked away for a second then decided to let it pass sorry about that teddy said catching himself congress as a whole is irresponsible but we have many fine congressmen you dont have to tell me anyway the field is crowded with a bunch of clonestwo weeks ago we had different frontrunners theyre slinging mud and knifing each other all for the benefit of the countrys fortyfourth largest state its silly teddy paused and grimaced and tried to reshift his useless legs we need someone new mr lakke and we think that someone is you lakes first reaction was to suppress a laugh which he did by smiling then coughing he tried to compose himself and said you must be kidding you know im not kidding mr lake teddy said sternly and there was no doubt that aaron lake had walked into a welllaid trap lake cleared his throat and completed the job of composing himself all right im listening its very simple in fact its simplicity makes it beautiful youre too late to file for new hampshire and it doesnt matter anyway let the rest of the pack slug it out there wait until its over then startle everyone by announcing your candidacy for president many will ask who the hell is aaron lakeand thats fine thats what we want theyll find out soon enough initially your platform will have only one plank its all about military spending youre a doomsayer with all sorts of dire predictions about how weak our military is becoming youll get everybodys attention when you call for doubling our military spending doubling it works doesnt it it got your attention double it during your fouryear term but why we need more military spending but a twofold increase would be excessive not if were facing another war mr lake a war in which we push buttons and launch tomahawk missiles by the thousands at a million bucks a pop hell we almost ran out of them last year in that balkan mess we cant find enough soldiers and sailors and pilots mr lakeyou know thisthe military needs tons of cash to recruit young men were low on everythingsoldiers missiles tanks planes carriers chenkov is building now were not were still downsizing and if we keep it up through another administration then were dead teddys voice rose almost in anger and when he stopped with were dead aaron lake could almost feel the earth shake from the bombing where does the money come from he asked money for what the military teddy snorted in disgust then said same place it always comes from need i remind you sir that we have a surplus were busy spending the surplus of course you are listen mr lake dont worry about the money shortly after you announce well scare the hell out of the american people theyll think youre halfcrazy at first some kind of wacko from arizona who wants to build even more bombs but well jolt them well create a crisis on the other side of the world and suddenly aaron lake will be called a visionary timing is everything you make a speech about how weak we are in asia few people listen then well create a situation over there that stops the world and suddenly everyone wants to talk to you it will go on like that throughout the campaign well build the tension on this endwell release reports create situations manipulate the media embarrass your opponents frankly mr lake i dont expect it to be that difficult you sound like youve been here before no weve done some unusual things all in an effort to protect this country but weve never tried to swing a presidential election teddy said this with an air of regret lake slowly pushed his chair back stood stretched his arms and legs and walked along the table to the end of the room his feet were heavier his pulse was racingthe trap had been sprung hed beencaught he returned to his seat i dont have enough money he offered across the table he knew it was received by someone whod already thought about it teddy smiled and nodded and pretended to give this some thought lakes georgetown home was worth he kept about half that much in mutual funds and another in municipal bonds there were no significant debts he had in his reelection account a rich candidate would not be attractive teddy said then reached for yet another button images returned to the wall sharp and in color money will not be a problem mr lake he said his voice much lighter well get the defense contractors to pay for it look at that he said waving with his right hand as if lake wasnt sure what to look at last year the aerospace and defense industry did almost two hundred billion in business well take just a fraction of that how much of a fraction as much as you need we can realistically collect a hundred million dollars from them you also cant hide a hundred million dollars dont bet on it mr lake and dont worry about it well take care of the money you make the speeches do the ads run the campaign the money will pour in by the time november gets here the american voters will be so terrified of armageddon they wont care how much youve spent itll be a landslide so teddy maynard was offering a landslide lake sat in a stunned but giddy silence and gawked at all that money up there on the wall billion defense and aerospace last years military budget was billion double that to billion in four years and the contractors would get fat again and the workers wages soaring through the roof jobs for everyone candidate lake would be embraced by executives with the cash and unions with the votes the initial shock began to fade and the simplicity ofteddys plan became clear collect the cash from those who will profit scare the voters into racing to the polls win in a landslide and in doing so save the world teddy let him think for a moment then said well do most of it through pacs the unions engineers executives business coalitionstheres no shortage of political groups already on the books and well form some others lake was already forming them hundreds of pacs all flush with more cash than any election had ever seen the shock was now completely gone replaced by the sheer excitement of the idea a thousand questions raced through his mind whqll be my vice president wholl run the campaign chief of stag where to announce it might work he said under control oh yes itll work mr lake trust me weve been panning this for some time how many people know about it just a fewyouve been carefully chosen mr lake we examined mate potential candidates and your name kept rising to the topweve checked your background pretty dull huh i suppose although your relationship with ms valotti concerns me shes been divorced twice and likes painkillers didnt know i had a relationship with ms valotti youve been seen with her recently you guys are watching arent you you expect something less i guess not you took her to a blacktie cryathon for oppressed women in afghanistan gimme a break teddys words were suddenly short and dripping with sarcasm i didnt want to go then dont stay away from that crap leave it for hollywood valottis nothing but trouble anybody else lake asked more than a little defensive his private life had been pretty dull since hed become a widower he was suddenly proud of it not really teddy said ms benchly seems to be quite stable and makes a lovely escort oh thank you very much youll get hammered on abortion but you wont be the first its a tired issue lake said and he was tired of grappling with it hed been for abortions against abortions soft on reproductive rights tough on reproductive rights prochoice prochild antiwomen embraced by the feminists in his fourteen years on capitol hill hed been chased all over the abortion minefield getting bloodied with each new strategic move abortion didnt scare him anymore at least not at the moment he was much more concerned with the cia sniffing through his background what about greentree he asked teddy waved his right hand as if it was nothing twentytwo years ago nobody got convicted your partner went bankrupt and got himself indicted but the jury let him walk itll come up everything will come up but fiankly mr lake well keep the attention diverted elsewhere theres an advantage in jumping in at the last minute the press wont have too much time to dig up dirt im single weve elected an unmarried president only once youre a widower the husbandof a very lovely lady who was well respected both here and back home it wont be an issue trust me so what worries you nothing mr lake not a thingyoure a solid candidate very electable well create the issues and the fear and well raise the money lake stood again walked around the room rubbing his hair scratching his chin trying to clear his head i have a lot of questions he said maybe i can answer some of them lets talk again tomorrow right here same time sleep on it mr lake time is crucial but i suppose a man should have twentyfour hours before making such a decision teddy actually smiled when he said this thats a wonderful idea let me think about it ill have an answer tomorrow no one knows weve had this little chat of course not three in terms of space the law library occupied exactly one fourth of the square footage of the entire trumble library it was in a corner partitioned off by a wall of red brick and glass tastefully done at taxpayer expense inside the law library shelves of wellused books stood packed together with barely enough room for an inmate to squeeze between them around the walls were desks covered with typewriters and computers and sufficient research clutter to resemble any bigfirm library the brethren ruled the law library all inmates were allowed to use it of course but there was an unwritten policy that one needed permission to stay there for any length of time maybe not permission but at least notice justice joe roy spicer of mississippi earned forty cents an hour sweeping the floors and straightening the desks and shelves he also emptied the trash and was generally considered to be a pig when it came to his menial tasks justice hatlee beech of texas was the official law librarian and at fifty cents an hour was the highest paid he was fastidious about his volumes and often bickered with spicer about their care justice finn yarber once of the california supreme court was paid twenty cents an hour as a computer technician his pay was at the bottom of the scale because he knew so little about computers on a typical day the three spent between six and eight hours in the law library if a trumble inmate had a legal problem he simply made an appointment with one of the brethren and visited their little suite hadee beech was an expert on sentencing and appeals finn yarber did bankruptcies divorces and child support cases joe roy spicer with no formal legal training had no real specialty nor did he want one he ran the scams strict rules prohibited the brethren from charging fees for their legal work but the strict rules meant little they were after all convicted felons and if they could quietly pick up some cash on the outside then everyone would be happy sentencing was a moneymaker about a fourth of the inmates who arrived at trumble had been improperly sentenced beech could review the records overnight and find the loopholes a month earlier he had knocked four years off the sentence of a young man whod been given fifteen the family had agreed to pay and the brethren earned their biggest fee to date spicer arranged the secret deposit through their lawyer in neptune beach there was a cramped conference room in the back of the law library behind the shelves and barely visible from the main room the door to it had a large glass window but no one bothered to look in the brethren retired there for quiet business they called it their chamber spicer had just met with their lawyer and he had mail some really good letters he dosed the door and removed an envelope from a file he waved it for beech and yarber to see its yellow he said aint that sweet its for ricky whos it from yarber asked curbs from dallas the banker beech asked excitedly no curtis owns the jewelry stores listen spicer unfolded the letter also on soft yellow stationery he smiled and cleared his throat and began to read dear ricky your letter of january eighth made me cry i read it three times before i put it downyou poor boy why are they keeping you there where is he askedyarber rickys locked down in a fancy drug rehab unit his rich uncle is paying for hes been in for a year is dean and fiilly rehabbed but the terrible people who run the place wont release him until april because theyve been collecting twenty thousand dollars a month from his rich uncle who just wants him locked away and wont send any spending money do you remember any of this now i do you helped with the fiction may i proceed please do spicer continued reading im tempted to fly down there and confront those evil people myself and your uncle what a loser rich people like him think they can just send money and not get involved as i told you my father was quite wealthy and he was the most miserable person ive ever known sure he bought me thingsobjects that were temporary and meant nothing when they were gone but he never had time for me he was a sick man just like your uncle ive enclosed a check for a thousand dollars if you need anything from the commissary ricky i cant wait to see you in april ive already told my wife that there is an international diamond show in orlando that month and she has no interest in going with me april asked beech yep ricky is certain he will be released in april aint that sweet yarber said with a smile and curtis has a wife and kids curtis is fiftyeight three adult children two grandchildren wheres the check asked beech spicer flipped the sheets of stationery and went to page two we have to make certain you can meet me in orlando he read are you sure youll finally be released in april please tell me you will i think about you every hour i keep your photo hidden in my desk drawer and when i look into your eyes i know that we should be together sick sick sick beech said still smiling and hes from texas im sure there are a lot of sweet boys in texas yarber said and none in california the rest of it is just mush spicer said scanning quickly there would be plenty of time to read it later he held up the check for his colleagues to see in due course it would be smuggled out to their attorney and he would deposit it in their hidden account when are we gonna bust him yarber asked lets swap a few more letters ricky needs to share some more misery maybe one of the guards could beat him up or something like that beech said they dont have guards replied spicer its a designer rehab clinic remember they have counselors but its a lockdown facility right that means gates and fences so surely theres a guard or two around what if ricky got attacked in the shower or the locker room by some goon who wanted his body it cant be a sexual attack yarber said that might scare curtis he might think ricky caught a disease or something and so the fiction went for a few minutes as they created more misery for poor ricky his picture had been lifted from the bulletin board of a fellow inmate copied at a quick print by their lawyer and had now been sent to more than a dozen pen pals across north america the photo was of a smiling college grad in a navy robe with a cap and gown holding a diploma a very handsome young man it was decided that beech would work on the new story for a few days then write a rough draft of the next letter to curtis beech was ricky and at that moment their little tormented fictional boy was writing his tales of misery to eight different caring souls justice yarber was percy also a young man locked away for drugs but now clean and nearing release and looking for an older sugar daddy with whom to spend meamngfixl time percy had five hooks in the water and was slowly reeling them in joe roy spicer didnt write very well he coordinated the scam helped with the fiction kept the stories straight and met with the lawyer who brought the mail and he handled the money he pulled out another letter and announced this your honors is from quince everything stopped as beech and yarber stared at the letter quince was a wealthy banker in a small town in iowa according to the six letters he and ricky had swapped like the rest theyd found him through the personals of a gay magazine now hidden in the law library hed been their second catch the first having become suspicious and disappearing quinces photo of himself was a snapshot taken at a lake with the shirt off the potbelly the skinny arms the receding hairline of a fiftyoneyearoldhis family all around him it was a bad photo no doubt selected by quince because it might be difficult to identify him if anyone ever tried would you like to read it ricky boy spicer asked handing the letter to beech who took it and looked at the envelope plain white no return address typed lettering have you read it beech asked no go ahead beech slowly removed the letter a plain sheet of white paper with tight singlespaced paragraphs produced by an old typewriter he cleared his voice and read dear ricky its done i cant believe i did it but i pulled it off i used a pay phone and a money order so nothing could be tracedi think my trail is clean the company you suggested in new york was superb very discreet and helpful i have to be honest ricky it scared the hell out of me booking a gay cruise is something i never dreamed of doing and you know what it was exhilarating i am so proud of myself we have a cabin suite a thousand bucks a night and i cant wait beech stopped and glanced above his reading glasses halfway down his nose both of his colleagues were smiling savoring the words he continued we set sail on march tenth and i have a wonderful idea i will arrive in miami on the ninth so we wont have much time to get together and introduce ourselves lets meet on the boat in our suite ill get there first check in get the champagne on ice then wait for you wont that be fun ricky well have three days to ourselves i say we dont leave the room beech couldnt help but smile and he somehow managed to do so while shaking his head in disgust he continued i am so excited about our little trip i have finally decided to discover who i really am and youve given me the courage to take the first step though we havent met ricky i can never thank you enough please write me back immediately and confirm take care my ricky love quince i think im gonna vomit spicer said but he wasnt convincing there was too much to do lets bust him beech said the others quickly agreed how much askedyarber at least a hundred thousand said spicer his family has owned banks for two generationswe know his father is still active in the business so you have to figure the old man might go nuts if his boy gets outed quince cant afford to get booted from the family gravy train so hell pay whatever we demand its a perfect situation beech was already taking notes so was yarber spicer began pacing around the small room like a bear stalking prey the ideas came slowly the language the opinions the strategy but before long the letter took shape in rough draft beech read it dear quince so nice to get your letter of january fourteenth im so happy you got the gay cruise booked it sounds delightful one problem though i wont be able to make it and there are a couple of reasons for this one is that i wont be released for a few more years im in a prison not a drug treatment clinic and im not gay far from it i have a wife and two kids and right now theyre having a difficult time financially because im sitting here in prison unable to support them thats where you come in quince i need some of your money i want a hundred thousand dollars we can call it hush money you send it and ill forget the ricky business and the gay cruise and no one in bakers iowa will ever know anything about ityour wife and your children and your father and the rest of your rich family will never know about ricky if you dont send the money then ill flood your little town with copies of our letters its called extortion quince and youre caught its cruel and mean and criminal and i dont care i need money and you have it beech stopped and looked around the room for approval its beautiful said spicer already spending the loot its nasty said yarber but what if he killshimself thats a long shot said beech they read the letter again then debated whether the timing was right they did not mention the illegality of their scam or the punishment if they got caught those discussions had been laid to rest months earlier when joe roy spicer had convinced the other two to join him the risks were insignificant when weighed against the potential returns the quinces who got themselves snared were not likely to run to the police and complain of extortion but they hadnt busted anyone yet they were corresponding with a dozen or so potential victims all middleaged men whod made the mistake of answering this simple ad swm in s looking for kind and discreet gentleman in s or s to pen pal with one little personal in small print in the back of a gay magazine had yielded sixty responses and spicerhad the chore of sifting through the rubbish and identifying rich targets at first hed found the work disgusting then he became amused by it now it was a business because they were about to extort a hundred thousand bucks from a perfectly innocent man their lawyer would take a third the usual cut but a fivstrating percentage nonetheless they had no choice he was a critical player in their crimes they worked on the letter to quince for an hour then agreed to sleep on it and do a final draft the next day there was another letter from a man using the pseudonym of hoover it was his second written to percy and rambled on for four paragraphs about birdwatchingyarber would be forced to study birds before writing back as percy and professing a great interest in the subject evidently hoover was afraid of his shadow he revealed nothing personal and there was no indication of money give him some more rope the brethren decided talk about birds then try to nudge him to the subject of physical companionship if hoover didnt take the hint and if he didnt reveal something about his financial situation then theyd drop him within the bureau of prisons trumble was officially referred to as a camp such a designation meant there were no fences around the grounds no razor wire no watchtowers no guards with rifles wait ing to nail escapees a camp meant minimum security so that any inmate could simply walk away if he chose there were a thousand at trumble but few walked away it was nicer than most public schools airconditioned dorms clean cafeteria serving three squares a day a weight room billiards cards racquetball basketball volleyball jogging track library chapel ministers on duty counselors caseworkers unlimited visiting hours trumble was as good as it could get for prisoners all of whom were classified as low risk eighty percent were there for drug crimes about forty had robbed banks without hurting or really scaring anyone the rest were whitecollar types whose crimes ranged from smalltime scams to dr floyd a surgeon whose office had bilked medicare out of million over two decades violence was not tolerated at trumblethreats were rare there were plenty of rules and the administration had little trouble enforcing them if you screwed up they sent you away to a mediumsecurity prison one with razor wire and rough guards trumbles prisoners were content to behave themselves and count their days the federal way pursuing serious criminal activity on the inside was unheard of until the arrival of jot roy spicer before his fall spicer had heard stories about the angola scam named for the infamous louisiana state penitentiary some inmates there had perfected the gay extortion scheme and before they were caught they had fleeced their victims of spicer was from a rural county near the louisiana line and the angola scam was a notorious affair in his part of the state he never dreamed hed copy it but he woke up one morning in a federal pen and decided to shaft every living soul he could get close enough to he walked the track every day at p m usually alone always with a pack of marlboros he hadnt smoked for ten years before his incarceration now he was up to two packs a day so he walked to negate the damage to his lungs in thirtyfour months hed walked miles and hed lost twenty pounds though probably not from exercise as he liked to claimthe prohibition against beer was more responsible for the weight loss thirtyfour months of walking and smoking twentyone months to go ninety thousand dollars of the stolen bingo money was literally buried in his backyard a half a mile behind his house next to a toolshedentombed in a homemade concrete vault his wife knew nothing about shed helped him spend the rest of the loot altogether though the feds had traced only half of it theyd bought cadillacs and flown to las vegas first class out of new orleans and theyd been driven around by casino limos and put up in suites if he had any dreams left one was to be a professional gambler headquartered out of vegas but known and feared by casinos everywhere blackjack was his game and though hed lost a ton he was still convinced he could beat any house there were casinos in the caribbean hed never seen asia was heating up hed travel the world first class with or without his wife stay in fancy suites order room service and terrorize any blackjack dealer dumb enough to deal him cards hed take the from his backyard add it to his share of the angola scam and move to vegas with or without her she hadnt been to trumble in four months although she used to come every three weeks he had nightmares of her plowing up the backyard looking for his buried treasure he was almost convinced she didnt know about the money but there was room for doubt hed been drinking two nights before being shipped off to prison and had said something about the he couldnt remember his exact words try as he might he simply could not recall what hed told her he lit another marlboro at mile one maybe she had a boyfriend now rita spicer was an attractive woman a little chunky in places but nothing couldnt hide what if she and a new squeeze had found the money and were already spending it one of joe roys worst recurring nightmares was a scene from a bad movierita and some unknown male with shovels digging like idiots in the rain why the rain he didnt know but it was always at night in the middle of a thunderstorm and the lightning would flash and he would see them slogging their way through the backyard each time getting nearer and nearer to the tooished in one dream the new mystery boyfriend was on a bulldozer pushing piles of dirt all over the spicer farm while rita stood nearby pointing here and there with her shovel joe roy craved the money he could feel the cash in his hands he would steal and extort all he could while he counted his days at trumble then he would rescue his buried loot and head for vegas no one in his hometown would have the pleasure of pointing and whispering and saying theres old joe roy guess hes out of the pen now no sir hed be living the high life with or without her four teddy looked at his pill bottles lined along the edge of his table like little executioners ready to take away his misery york was seated across from him reading from his notes york said he was on the phone until three this morning talking to friends in arizona who bobby lander jim gallison richard hassel the usual gang his money people dale winer yes him too york said amazed at teddys recall teddy had his eyes closed now and was rubbing his temples somewhere between them somewhere deep in his brain he knew the names of lakes friends his contributors his confidants his poll workers and his old high school teachers all of it neatly tucked away ready to be used if necessary anything unusual no not really just the typical questions youd expect from a man contemplating such an unexpected move his friends were surprised even shocked and somewhat reluctant but theyll come around did they ask about money of course he was vague said it would not be a problem though they are skeptical did he keep our secrets he certainly did was he worried about us listening i dont think so he made eleven calls from his office and eight from his home none from his cell phones faxes email none he spent two hours with schiara his chief of staff right they basically planned the campaign schiara wants to run it they like nance of michigan as ve not a bad choice he looks fine were already checking him had a divorce when he was twentythree but that was thirty years ago not a problem is lake ready to commit oh yes hes a politician isnt he hes been promised the keys to the kingdom hes already writing speeches teddy removed a pill from a bottle and swallowed it without the aid of anything liquid he finwned as if it was bitter he squeezed the wrinkles in his forehead and said york tell me were not missing anything on this guy no skeletons no skeletons chief weve examined his dirty underwear for six months theres nothing that can hurt us hes not going to marry some fool is he no he dates several women but nothing serious no sex with his interns none hes clean they were repeating a dialogue theyd had many times once more wouldnt hurt no shady financial deals from another lifetime this is his life chief theres nothing back there booze drugs prescription pills gambling on the internet no sir hes very clean sober straight bright pretty remarkable lets talk to him aaron lake was once again escorted to the same room deep inside langley this time with three handsome young men guarding him as if danger lurked at every corner he walked even quicker than the day before his head even taller his back without the slightest curve his stature was rising by the hour once again he said hello to teddy and shook his calloused hand then followed the quiltladen wheelchair into the bunker and sat across the table pleasantries were exchanged york watched from a room down the hall where three monitors hooked to hidden cameras relayed every word every movement next to york were two men who spent their time studying tapes of people as they talked and breathed and moved their hands and eyes and heads and feet in an effort to determine what the speakers really meant did you sleep much last night teddy asked managing a smile yes actually lake lied good i take it youre willing to accept our deal deal i didnt know it was exactly a deal oh yes mr lake its exactly a deal we promise to get you elected and you promise to double defense spending and get ready for the russians then you have a deal thats good mr lake im very pleased youll make an excellent candidate and a fine president the words rang through lakes ears and he couldnt believe them president lake president aaron lake hed paced the floor until five that morning trying to convince himself that the white house was being offered to him it seemed too easy and as hard as he tried he couldnt ignore the trappings the oval office all those jets and helicopters the world to be traveled a hundred aides at his beck and call state dinners with the most powerful people in the world and above all a place in history oh yes teddy had himself a deal lets talk about the campaign itself teddy said i think you should announce two days after new hampshire let the dust settle let the winners get their fifteen minutes and let the losers sling more mud then announce thats pretty fast lake said we dont have a lot of time we ignore new hampshire and get ready for arizona and michigan on february twentysecond its imperative that you win those two states when you do you establish yourself as a serious candidate and youre set for the month of march i was thinking of announcing back home somewhere in phoenix michigans better its a bigger state fiftyeight delegates compared to twentyfour for arizonayoull be expected to win at home if you win in michigan on the same day then youre a candidate to be reckoned with announce in michigan first then do it again hours later in your home district an excellent idea theres a helicopter plant in flint dl trilling they have a large hangar four thousand workers the ceo is a man i can talk to book it lake said certain that teddy had already chatted with the ceo can you start filming ads day after tomorrow i can do anything lake said settling into the passengers seat it was becoming obvious who was driving the bus with your approval well hire an outside consulting group to front the ads and publicity but we have better people here and they wont cost you anything not that money will be a problem you understand i think a hundred million should cover things it should anyway well start working on the tv ads today i think youll like them theyre total gloom and doomthe miserable shape of our military all sorts of threats from abroad armageddon that sort of stuff theyll scare the hell out of people well plug in your name and face and a few brief words and in notime youll be the most famous politician in the country fame wont win the election no it wont but money will money buys television and polls and thats all it takes id like to think the message is important oh it is mr lake and our message is far more important than tax cuts and affirmative action and abortion and trust and family values and all the other silliness were hearing our message is life and death our message will change the world and protect our affluence thats all we really care about lake was nodding his agreement protect the economy keep the peace and american voters would elect anyone i have a good man to run the campaign lake said anxious to offer something who mike schiara my chief of staff hes my closest adviser a man i trust implicitly any experience on the national level teddy asked knowing full well there was none no but hes quite capable thats fine its your campaign lake smiled and nodded at the same timethat was good to hear he was beginning to wonder what about vice president teddy asked i have a couple of names senator nance of michigan is an old friend theres also governor guyce from texas teddy received the names with careful deliberation not bad selections really though guyce would never work he was a rich boy whod skated through college and golfed through his thirties then spent a fortune of his fathers money to purchase the governors mansion for four years besides they wouldnt have to worry about texas i like nance teddy said then nance it would be lake almost said they talked about money for an hour the first wave from the pacs and how to accept instant millions without creating too much suspicion then the second wave from the defense contractors then the third wave of cash and other untraceables thered be a fourth wave lake would never know about depending on the pollsteddy maynard and his organization would be prepared to literally haul boxes filled with cash into union halls and black churches and white vfws in places like chicago and detroit and memphis and throughout the deep south working with locals they were already identifying they would be prepared to buy every vote they could find the more teddy pondered his plan the more convinced he became that the election would be won by mr aaron lake trevors little law office was in neptune beach several blocks from atlantic beach though no one could tell where one beach stopped and the other started jacksonville was several miles to the west and creeping toward the sea every minute the office was a converted summer rental and fiiom his sagging back porch revor could see the beach and the ocean and hear the seagulls hard to believe hed been renting the place for twelve years now early in the lease hed enjoyed hiding on the porch away from the phone and the clients staring endlessly at the gentle waters of the atlantic two blocks away he was from scranton and like all snowbirds hed finally grown weary of gazing at the sea roaming the beaches barefoot and throwing bread crumbs to the birds now he preferred to waste time locked in his office trevor was terrified of courtrooms and judges while this was unusual and even somewhat honorable it made for a different style of lawyering it relegated trevor to paperworkreal estate closings wills leases zoningall the mundane nondazzling smalltime areas of the profession no one told him about in law school occasionally he handled a drug case never one involving a trial and it was one of his unfortunate clients at trumble whod connected him with the honorable joe roy spicer in short order hed become the official attorney for all dimespicer beech and yarber the brethren as even trevor referred to them he was a courier nothing more or less he smuggled them letters disguised as official legal documents and thus protected by the lawyerclient privilege and he sneaked their letters out he gave them no advice and they sought none he ran their bank account offshore and handled phone calls from the families of their clients inside trumble he fronted their dirty little deals and in doing so avoided courtrooms and judges and other lawyers and this suited trevor just fine he was also a member of their conspiracy easily indictable should they ever be exposed but he wasnt worried the angola scam was absolutely brilliant because its victims couldnt complain for an easy fee with potential rewards hed gamble with the brethren he eased from his office without seeing his secretary then sneaked away in his restored v w beetle no airconditioning he drove down first street toward atlantic boulevard the ocean visible through homes and cottages and rentals he wore old khakis a white cotton shirt a yellow bow tie a blue seersucker jacket all of it heavily wrinkled he passed petes bar and grill the oldest watering hole along the beaches and his personal favorite even though the college kids had discovered the place he had an outstanding and very pastdue bar tab there of almost all for coors longnecks and lemon daiquiris and he really wanted to clear the debt he turned west on atlantic boulevard and began fighting the traffic into jacksonville he cursed the sprawl and the congestion and the cars with canadian plates then he was on the bypass north past the airport and soon deep into the flat florida countryside fifty minutes later he parked at trumbleyou gotta love the federal system he told himself again lots of parking dose to the fiont entrance nicely landscaped grounds tended daily by the inmates and modern wellkept buildings he said hello mackey to the white guard at the door and hellovince to the black one rufus at the front desk xrayed the briefcase while nadine did the paperwork for his visit howre the bass he asked rufus aint biting rufus said no lawyer in the brief history of trumble had visited as much as trevor they took his picture again stamped the back of his hand with invisible ink and led him through two doors and a short hallway hello link he said to the next guard mornin trevor link said link ran the visitors area a large open space with lots of padded chairs and vending machines against one wall a playground for youngsters and a small outdoor patio where two people could sit at a picnic table and share a moment it was cleaned and shined and completely empty it was a weekday traffic picked up on saturdays and sundays but for the rest of the time link observed an empty area they went to the lawyers room one of several private cubbyholes with doors that shut and windows through which link could do his observing if he were so inclined joe roy spicer was waiting and reading the daily sports section where he played the odds on college basketball trevor and link stepped into the room together and very quickly trevor removed two twentydollar bills and handed them to link the closedcircuit cameras couldnt see them if they did this just inside the door as part of the routine spicer pretended not to see the transaction then the briefcase was opened and link made a pretense of looking through it he did this without touching a thing trevor removed a large manila envelope which was sealed and marked in bold legal papers link took it and squeezed it to make sure it held only papers and not a gun or a bottle of pills then he gave it back theyd done this dozens of times trumble regulations required a guard to be present in the room when all papers were removed and all envelopes were opened but the two twenties got link outside where he posted himself at the door because there was simply nothing else to guard at the moment he knew letters were being passed back and forth and he didnt care as long as trevor didnt traffic in weapons or drugs link wouldnt get involved the place had so many silly regulations anyway he leaned on the door with his back to it arid before long was drifting into one of his many horse naps one leg stiff the other bent at the knee in the lawyers room little legal work was being done spicer was still absorbed in point spreads most inmates welcomed their guests spicer only tolerated his got a call last night from the brother of jeff daggett trevor said the kid from coral gables i know him spicer said finally lowering his newspaper because money was on the horizon he got twelve years in a drug conspiracy yep his brother says that theres this exfederal judge inside trumble whos looked over his papers and thinks he might be able to knock off a few years this judge wants a fee so daggett calls his brother who calls me trevor removed his rumpled blue seersucker jacket and flung it on a chair spicer hated his bow tie how much can they pay have you guys quoted a fee trevor asked beech may have i dont know we try to get five thousand for a twotwofivefive reduction spicer said this as if he had practiced criminal law in the federal courts for years truth was the only time hed actually seen a federal courtroom was the day he was sentenced i know trevor said im not sure they can pay five thousand the kid had a public defender for a lawyer then squeeze whatever you can but get at least a thousand up front hes not a bad kid youre getting soft joe roy no im getting meaner and in fact he was joe roy was the managing partner of the brethren yarber and beech had the talent and the training but theyd been too humiliated by their fall to have any ambition spicer with no training and little talent possessed enough manipulative skills to keep his colleagues on track while they brooded he dreamed of his comeback joe roy opened a file and withdrew a check heres a thousand bucks to deposit came from a pen pal in texas named curtis whats his potential very good i think were ready to bust quince in iowa joe roy withdrew a pretty lavender envelope tightly sealed and addressed to quince garbe in bakers iowa how much trevor asked taking the envelope a hundred thousand wow hes got it and hell pay it ive given him the wiring instructions alert the bank in twentythree years of practicing law trevor had never earned a fee anywhere close to suddenly he could see it touch it and though he tried not to he began spending it for doing nothing but shuttling mail you really think this will work he asked mentally paying off the tab at petes bar and telling mastercard to take this check and shove it hed keep the same car his beloved beetle but he might spring for an air conditioner of course it will spicer said without a trace of doubt he had two more letters both written by justice yarber posing as young percy in rehab trevor took them with anticipation arkansas is at kentucky tonight spicer said returning to his newspaper the line is fourteen whatta you think much closer than that kentucky is very tough at home are you in are you trevor had a bookie at petes bar and though he gambled little he had learned to follow the lead of justice spicer ill put a hundred on arkansas spicer said i think i will too they played blackjack for half an hour with link occasionally glancing in and frowning his disapproval cards were prohibited during visitation but who cared joe roy played the game hard because he was training for his next career poker and gin rummy were the favorites in the rec room and spicer often had trouble finding a blackjack opponent trevor wasnt particularly good but he was always willing to play it was in spicers opinion his only redeeming quality five the announcement had the festive air of a victory party with red white and blue banners and bunting draped from the ceiling and parade music blasting through the hangar every dl trilling employee was required to be present all four thousand of them and to heighten their spirits they had been promised a full day of extra vacation eight hours paid at an average wage of but management didnt care because they had found their man the hastily built stage was also covered in banners and packed with every suit in the company all smiling broadly and clapping wildly as the music whipped the crowd into a frenzy three days earlier no one had heard of aaron lake now he was their savior he certainly looked like a candidate with a new slightly trimmer haircut suggested by one consultant and a dark brown suit suggested by another only reagan had been able to wear brown suits and hed won two landslides when lake finally appeared and strode purposefully across the stage shaking vigorously the hands ofcorporate honchos hed never see again the laborers went wild the music was carefully ratcheted up a couple of notches by a sound consultant who was a member of a sound team lakes people had hired for for the event money was of little concern balloons fell like manna some were popped by workers whod been asked to pop them so for a few seconds the hangar sounded like the first wave of a ground attack get ready for it get ready for war lake before its too late the trilling ceo clutched him as if they were fraternity brothers when in fact theyd met two hours earlier the ceo then took the podium and waited for the noise to subside working with notes hed been faxed the day before he began a longwinded and quite generous introduction of aaron lake future president on cue the applause interrupted him five times before he finished lake waved like a conquering hero and waited behind the microphone then with perfect timing stepped forward and said my name is aaron lake and i am now running for president more roaring applause more pipedin parade music more balloons drifting downward when hed had enough he launched into his speech the theme the platform the only reason for running was national security and lake hammered out theappalling statistics proving just how thoroughly the current administration had depleted our military no other issues were really that important he said bluntly lure us into a war we cant win and well forget about the tired old quarrels over abortion race gunsaffirmative action taxes concerned about family values start losing our sons and daughters in combat and youd see some families with real problems lake was very good the speech had been written by him edited by consultants polished by other professionals and the night before hed delivered it to teddy maynard alone deep inside langley teddy had approved with minor changes teddy was tucked under his quilts and watching the show with great pride york was with him silent as usual the two often sat alone staring at screens watching the world grow more dangerous hes good york saidquietly at one point teddy nodded even managing a slight smile halfway through his speech lake became wonderfully angry at the chinese over a twentyyear period we allowed them to steal forty percent of our nuclear secrets he said and the laborers hissed forty percent he shouted it was closer to fifty but teddy chose to downplay it just a littlethe cia had received its share of blame for the chinese thievery for five minutes aaron lake blistered the chinese and their looting and their unprecedented military buildup the strategy was teddys use the chinese to scare the american voters not the russians dont tip them protect the real threat until later in the campaign lakes timing was nearperfect his punch line brought down the house when he promised to double the ministration the four thousand dl trilling employees who built military helicopters exploded in a frenzy teddy watched it quietly very proud of his creation they had managed to upstage the spectacle in new hampshire by simply snubbing it lakes name had not been on the ballot and he was the first candidate in decades to be proud of that fact who needs new hampshire hed been quoted as saying ill take the rest of the country lake signed off amid thunderous applause and reshook all the hands on the stage cnn returned to its studio where the talking heads would spend fifteen minutes telling the vievers what they had just witnessed on his table teddy pushed buttons and the screen changed heres the finished product he said the first installment it was a television ad for candidate lake and it began with a brief glimpse of a row of grim chinese generals standing rigidly at a military parade watching massive hardware roll by you think the worlds a safer place a deep rich ominous voice asked off camera then glimpses of the worlds current madmen all watching their armies parade byhussein qaddafi milosevic kim in north korea even poor castro with the last of his ragtag army lumbering through havana got a split second of airtime our military could not now do what it did in during the gulf war the voice said as gravely as if another war had already been declared then a blast an atomic mushroom followed by thousands of indians dancing in the streets another blast and the pakistanis were dancing next door china wants to invade taiwan the voice continued as a million chinese soldiers marched in perfect step north korea wants south korea the voice said as tanks rolled through the dmz and the united states is always an easy target the voice changed quickly into one with a high pitch and the ad shifted to a congressional hearing of some sort with a heavily bemedaled general lecturing some subcommittee you the congress he was saying spend less on the military each year this defense budget is smaller than it was fifteen years agoyou expect us to be ready for war in korea the middle east and now eastern europe yet our budget keeps shrinkingthe situation is critical the ad went blank nothing but a dark screen then the first voice said twelve years ago there were two superpowers now there are none the handsome face of aaron lake appeared and the ad finished with the voice saying lake before its too late im not sure i like it york said after a pause why not its so negative good makes you feel uncomfortable doesnt it very much so good were going to flood television for a week and i suspect lakes soft numbers will get even softer the ads will make people squirm and they wont like them york knew what was coming the people would indeed squirm and dislike the ads then get the hell scared out of them and lake would suddenly become a visionary teddy was working on the terror there were two tv rooms on each wing at trumble two small bare rooms where you could smoke and watch whatever the guards wanted you to watch no remotetheyd tried that at first but it had caused too much trouble by far the nastiest disagreements occurred when the boys couldnt agree on what to watch so the guards made the selections rules prohibited inmates from having their own tvs the guard on duty happened to like basketball there was a college game on espn and the room was packed with inmates hadee beech hated sports and he sat alone in the other tv room and watched one banal sitcom after another when he was on the bench and working twelve hours a day he had never watched televisionwho had the time hed had an office in his home where he dictated opinions until late while everyone else was glued to prime time now watching the mindless crap he realized how lucky hed been in so many ways he lit a cigarette he hadnt smoked since college and for the first two months at trumble hed resisted the temptation now it helped with the boredom but only a pack a day his blood pressure was up and down heart disease ran in the family at fiftysix with nine years to go he would leave in a box he was certain three years one month one week and beech was still counting the days in as opposed to the days to go just four years ago hed been building his reputation as a tough young federal judge who was going places four rotten years when he traveled from one courthouse to the next in east texas he did so with a driver a secretary a clerk and a us marshal when he walked into a courtroom people stood out of respect lawyers gave him high marks for his fairness and hard work his wife had been an unpleasant woman but with her familys oil trust hed managed to live peacefully with her the marriage was stable not exactly warm but with three fine kids in college they had reason to be proud they had weathered some rough times and were determined to grow old together she had the money he had the status together theyd raised a family where was there to go certainly not to prison four miserable years the drinking came from nowhere maybe it was pressure from work maybe it was to escape his wifes bickering for years after law school hed been a light social drinker nothing serious certainly not a habit once when the kids were small his wife took them to italy for two weeks beech was left alone which suited him fine for some reason he could never determine or remember he turned to bourbon lots of it and he never stopped the bourbon became important he kept it in his study and sneaked it late at night they had separate beds so he seldom got caught the trip to yellowstone had been a threeday judicial conference hed met the young lady in a bar in jackson hole after hours of drinking they made the sad decision to take a ride while hatlee drove she took off her clothes but for no other reason than to just do it sex had not been discussed and at that point he was completely harmless the two hikers were from dc just college kids returning from the trails both died at the scene slaughtered on the shoulder of a narrow road by a drunken driver who never saw them the young ladys car was found in a ditch with beech hugging the steering wheel unable to remove himself she was naked and knocked out he remembered nothing when he awoke hours later he saw for the first time the inside of a cell better get used to it the sheriff had said with a sneer beech called in every favor and pulled every string imaginable all to no avail two young people were dead hed been caught with a naked woman his wife had the oil money so his friends ran like scared dogs in the end no one stood up for the honorable hadee beech he was lucky to get twelve years madd mothers and sadd students protested outside the courthouse when he made his first official appearance they wanted a life sentence life he himself the honorable hatlee beech was charged with two counts of manslaughter and there was no defense there was enough alcohol in his blood to kill the next guy a witness said hed been speeding on the wrong side of the road looking back hed been lucky his crime was on federal lands otherwise he would have been shipped away to some state pen where things were much tougher say what you want but the feds knew how to run a prison he smoked alone in the semidarkness watching primetime comedy written by twelveyearolds and there was a political ad one of many those days it was one beech had never seen a menacing little segment with a somber voice predicting doom if we didnt hurry and build more bombs it was very well done ran for a minute and a half cost a bundle and delivered a message no one wanted to hear lake before its too late who the hells aaron lake beech knew his politics it had been his passion in another life and at trumble he was known as a fellow who watched washington he was one of the few who cared what happened there aaron lake beech had missed the guy what an odd strategy to enter the race as an unknown after new hampshire never a shortage of clowns who want to be president beechs wife kicked him out before he pled guilty to two counts of manslaughter quite naturally she was angrier over the naked woman than the dead hikers the kids sided with her because she had the money and because hed screwed up so badly it was an easy decision on their part the divorce was final a week after he arrived at trumble his youngest had been to see him twice in three years one month and one week both visits were on the sly lest the mother find out about them she had prohibited the kids from going to trumble then he got sued two wrongful death cases brought by the families with no friends willing to step forward hed tried to defend himself from prison but there wasnt much to defend a judgment of million had been entered against him by the trial court he appealed from trumble lost from trumble and appealed again in the chair beside him next to his cigarettes was an envelope brought earlier by trevor the lawyer the court had rejected his final appeal the judgment was now written in stone didnt really matter because hed also filed for bankruptcy hed typed the papers himself in the law library and filed them with a paupers oath sent them to the same courthouse in texas where he was once a god convicted divorced disbarred imprisoned sued bankrupt most of the losers at trumble handled their time because their falls had been so short most were repeat offenders whod blown third and fourth chances most liked the damned place because it was better than any other prison theyd visited but beech had lost so much had fallen so far just four years ago hed had a wife with millions and three kids who loved him and a big home in a small town he was a federal judge appointed by the president for life making a year which was a lot less than her oil royalties but still not a bad salary he got himself called to washington twice a year for meetings at justice beech had been important an old lawyer friend had been to see him twice on his way to miami where he had kids and he stayed long enough to deliver the gossip most of it was worthless but there was a strong rumor that the ex mrs beech was now seeing someone else with a few million bucks and slender hips it was only a matter of time another ad lake before its too late again this one began with a grainy video of men with guns slithering through the desert dodging and shooting and undergoing some type of training then the sinister face of a terroristdark eyes and hair and features obviously some manner of islamic radicaland he said in arabic with english subtitles we will kill americans wherever we find them we will die in our holy war against the great satan after that quick videos of burning buildings embassy bombings a busload of tourists the remains of a jetliner scattered through a pasture a handsome face appeared mr aaron lake himself he looked directly at hadee beech and said im aaron lake and you probably dont know me im running for president because im scared scared of china and eastern europe and the middle east scared of a dangerous world scared of whats happened to our military last year the federal government had a huge surplus yet spent less on defense than we did fifteen years agowere complacent because our economy is strong but the world today is far more dangerous than we realize our enemies are legion and we cannot protect ourselves if elected i will double defense spending during my term of office no smiles no warmth just plain talk firm a man who meant what he said a voiceover said lake before its too late not bad thought beech he lit another cigarette his last of the night and stared at the envelope on the empty chair million lodged against him by the two families hed pay the money if he could never saw the kids not before he killed them the paper the next day had their happy photos a boy and a girl just college kids enjoying the summer he missed the bourbon he could bankrupt half the judgment the other half was for punitive damages nonbankruptable so it would follow wherever he went which he assumed was nowhere hed be sixtyfive when his sentence was over but hed be dead before then theyd carry him out of trumble in a box send him home to texas where theyd bury him behind the little country church where hed been baptized maybe one of the kids would spring for a headstone beech left the room without turning off the tv it was almost ten time for lightsout he bunked with robbie a kid from kentucky whod broken into houses before they caught him he sold the guns and microwaves and stereos for cocaine robbie was a fouryear veteran of tmmble and because of his seniority he had chosen the bottom bunk beech crawled into the top one said good night robbie and turned off the light night hadee came the soft response sometimes they chatted in the dark the walls were cinderblock the door was metal their words wereconfined to their little room robbie was twentyfive and would be fortyfive before he left trumble twentyfour yearsone for every ten houses the time between bed and sleep was the worst of the day the past came back with a vengeancethe mistakes the misery the couldhaves and shouldhaves try as he might hatlee could not simply close his eyes and go to sleep he had to punish himself first there was a grandchild hed never seen and he always started with her then his three kids forget the wife but he always thought about her money and the friends ah the friends where were they now three years in and with no future there was only the past even poor robbie below dreamed of a new beginning at the age of fortyfive not beech at times he almost longed for the warm texas soil layered upon his body behind the little church surely someone would buy him a headstone six for quince garbe february would be the worst day of his life it was almost the last and it wouldve been had his doctor been in town he couldnt get a prescription for sleeping pills and he didnt have the courage to use a gun on himself it began pleasantly enough with a late breakfast a bowl of oatmeal by the fire in the den alone his wife of twentysix years had already left for town for another day of charity teas and fundraising and frantic smalltown volunteerism that kept her busy and away from him it was snowing when he left their large and pretentious bankers home on the edge of bakers iowa and drove ten minutes to work in his long black mercedes eleven years old he was an important man about town a garbe a member of a family that had owned the bank for generations he parked in his reserved spot behind the bank which faced main street and made a quick detour to the post office something he did twice a week for years hed had a private box there away from his wife and especially away from his secretary because he was rich and few others were in bakers iowa he seldom spoke to people on the street he didnt care what they thoughtthey worshiped his father and that was enough to keep their business but when the old man died would he have to change his personality would he be forced to smile on the sidewalks of bakers and join the rotary club the one founded by his grandfather quince was tired of being dependent on the whims of the public for his security he was tired of relying on his father to keep their customers happy he was tired of banking and tired of iowa and tired of snow and tired of his wife and what quince wanted more than anything that morning in february was a letter from his beloved ricky a nice brief little note confirming their rendezvous what quince really wanted was three warm days on a love boat with ricky he might never come back bakers had eighteen thousand people so the central post office on main was usually busy and there was always a different clerk behind the counter thats how hed rented the boxhed waited until a new postal worker was on duty cmt investments was the official lessee he went straight to the box around a corner to a wall with a hundred others there were three letters and as he snatched them and stuffed them in his coat pocket his heart froze as he saw that one was from ricky he hurried onto main and minutes later entered his bank at exactly am his father had been there for four hours but they had long since stopped bickering over quinces work schedule as always he stopped at his secretarys desk to hurriedly remove his gloves as if important matters were waiting she handed him his mail his two phone messages and reminded him that he had lunch in two hours with a local real estate agent he locked his door behind him flung his gloves one way and his coat the other and ripped open the letter from ricky he sat on his sofa and put on his reading glasses breathing heavily not from the walk but from anticipation he was on the verge of arousal when he started reading the words hit like bullets after the second paragraph he emitted a strange painful awwww then a couple of oh my gods then a low hissing sonofabitch quiet he told himself the secretary is always listeningthe first reading brought shock the second disbelief reality began settling in with the third reading and quinces lip started to quiver dont cry dammit he told himself he threw the letter on the floor and paced around his desk ignoring as best he could the cheerful faces of his wife and children twenty years worth of class photos and family portraits were lined along his credenza just under the window he looked out and watched the snow now heavier and accumulating on the sidewalks god how he hated bakers iowa hed thought he might leave and escape to the beach where he could frolic with a handsome young pal and maybe never come home now he would leave under different circumstances it was a joke a hoax he told himself but he instantly knew better the scam was too tight the punch line was too perfect hed been set up by a professional all his life hed fought his desires somehow hed finally found the nerve to crack the closet door and now he got shot between the eyes by a con man stupid stupid stupid how could this be so difficult random thoughts hit from every direction as he watched the snow suicide was the easy answer but his doctor was gone and he really didnt want to die at least not at the moment he wasnt sure where hed find a hundred thousand bucks he could send off without raising suspicions the old bastard next door paid him a pittance and kept his thumb on every dime his wife insisted on balancing their checkbook there was some money in mutuals but he couldnt move it without her knowing the life of a rich banker in bakers iowa meant a title and a mercedes and a large mortgaged house and a wife with social activities oh how he wanted to escape hed go to florida anyway and track the letter somehow and confront this con man expose his extortion attempt find some justice he quince garbe had done nothing wrong surely a crime was being perpetrated here perhaps he could hire an investigator and maybe a lawyer and theyd protect him theyd get to the bottom of this scam even if he found the money and wired it as instructed the gate would be opened and ricky whoever in hell ricky was might want more what would stop ricky from extorting again and again if he had guts hed run off anyway run to key west or some hot spot where it never snowed and live any damn way he wanted to live and let the pitiful little people of bakers iowa gossip about him for the next halfcentury but he didnt have the guts and thats what made quince so sad his children were staring at him freckled smiles with teeth wrapped in silver braces his heart sank and he knew hed find the money and wire it precisely as directed he had to protect them they had done nothing wrong the banks stock was worth about million all of it still tightly controlled by the old man who at the moment was barking in the hallway the old man was eightyone very much alive but still eightyone when he was gone quince would have to contend with a sister in chicago but the bank would be his hed sell the damned thing as fast as he could and leave bakers with a few million in his pocket until then though hed be forced to do what hed always done keep the old man content quinces getting yanked out of the closet by some con man would devastate his father and pretty much take care of the stock sister in chicago would get all of it when the barking stopped outside he eased through the door and passed his secretary for a cup of coffee he ignored her as he returned to his room locked his door read the letter for the fourth time and collected his thoughts hed find the money and hed wire it just as instructed and hed hope and pray with a fury that ricky would go away if not if he came back for more quince would call his doctor and get some pills the real estate agent he was meeting for lunch was a highroller who took chances and cut corners probably a crook quince began to make plans the two of them would arrange a few shady loans overappraise some land lend the money sell to a strawman etc he would know how to do it quince would find the money the lake campaigns doomsday ads landed with a thud at least in public opinion massive polling through the first week showed a dramatic increase in name recognition from to percent but the ads were universally disliked they were frightening and people just didnt want to think about wars and terrorism and old nukes getting hauled across mountains in the dark people saw the ads they were impossible to miss and they heard the message but most voters simply didnt want to be botheredthey were too busy making money and spending it when issues were confronted in the midst of a roaring economy they were limited to the old standbys of family values and tax cuts candidate lakes early interviewers treated him as just another flake until he announced live on the air that his campaign had received in excess of million in less than a week we expect to have twenty million in two weeks he said without boasting and real news started to happen teddy maynard had assured him the money would be there twenty million in two weeks had never been done before and by the end of that day washington was consumed with the story the frenzy reached its peak when lake was interviewed live yet again by two of the three networks on the evening news he looked great big smile smooth words nice suit and hair the man was electable final confirmation that aaron lake was a serious candidate came late in the day when one of his opponents took a shot at him senator britt of maryland had been running for a year and had finished a strong second in new hampshire hed raised million spent a lot more than that and was forced to waste half of his time soliciting money rather than campaigning he was tired of begging tired of cutting staff tired of worrying about tv ads and when a reporter asked him about lake and his million britt shot back its dirty money no honest candidate can raise that much that fast britt was shaking hands in the rain at the entrance to a chemical plant in michigan the dirty money comment was seized with great gusto by the press and soon splattered all over the place aaron lake had arrived senator britt of maryland had other problems though hed tried to forget them nine years earlier hed toured southeast asia to find some facts as always he and his colleagues from the congress flew first class stayed in nice hotels and ate lobster all in an effort to study poverty in the region and to get to the bottom of the raging controversy brought about by nike and its use of cheap foreign labor early in the journey britt met a girl in bangkok and feigning illness decided to stay behind while his buddies continued their factfinding into laos and vietnam her name was payka and she was not a prostitute she was a twentyyearold secretary in the us embassy in bangkok and because she was on his countrys payroll britt felt a slight proprietary interest he was far away from maryland from his wife and five kids and his constituents payka was stunning and shapely and anxious to study in the united states what began as a fling quickly turned into a romance and senator britt had to force himself to return to washington two months later he was back in bangkok on as he told his wife pressing but secret business in nine months he made four trips to thailand all first class all at taxpayer expense and even the gobetrotters in the senate were beginning to whisper britt pulled strings with the state department and payka appeared to be headed for the united states she never made it during the fourth and final rendezvous payka confessed that she was pregnant she was catholic and abortion was not an option britt stiff armed her said he needed time to think then fled bangkok in the middle of the night the factfinding was over early in his senate career britt a fiscal hardliner had grabbed a headline or two by criticizing cia wastefulness teddy maynard said not a word but certainly didnt appreciate the grandstanding the rather thin file on senator britt was dusted off and given priority and when he went to bangkok for the second time the cia went with him of course he didnt know it but they sat near him on the flight first class also and they had people on the ground in bangkok they watched the hotel where the two lovebirds spent three days they took pictures of them eating in fine restaurants they saw everything britt was oblivious and stupid later when the child was born the cia obtained the hospital records then the medical records to link the blood and dna payka kept her job at the embassy so she was easy to find when the child was a year old he was photographed sitting on paykas knee in a downtown park more photos followed and by the time he was four he was beginning to remotely favor senator dan britt ўf maryland his daddy was long gone britts zeal for finding facts in southeast asia had faded dramatically and hed turned his attention to other critical areas of the world in due course he was seized with presidential ambitions the old senatorial affliction that sooner or later gets them all hed never heard from payka and that nightmare had been easy to forget britt had five legitimate children and a wife with a big mouth they were a team senator and mrs britt both leading the juggernaut of family values and weve got to save our kids together they wrote a book on how to raise children in a sick american culture though their oldest was only thirteen when the president was embarrassed by sexual misadventures senator britt became the biggest virgin in washington he and his wife struck a nerve and the money rolled in from conservatives he did well in the iowa caucuses ran a close second in new hampshire but was running out of money and sinking in the polls he would sink even more after a brutal day of campaigning his entourage settled into a motel in dearborn michigan for a short night it was there that the senator finally came face to face with child number six though not in person the agents name was mccord and hed been following britt with phony press credentials for a week he said he worked for a newspaper in tallahassee but in fact hed been a cia agent for eleven years there were so many reporters swarming around britt that no one thought to check mccord befriended a senior aide and over a late drink in the holiday inn bar he confessed that he had something in his possession that would destroy candidate britt he said it was given to him by a rival camp governor tarrys it was a notebook with a bomb on every page an affidavit from payka setting forth the broad details of their affair two photos of the child the last of which had been taken a month earlier and the child now seven looking more and more like his dad blood and dna summaries indelibly linking father and son and travel records which showed in black and white that senator britt had burned intaxpayers money to carry on his affair on the other side of the world the deal was simple and straightforward withdraw from the race immediately and the story would never be told mccord the journalist was ethical and didnt have the stomach for such trash governor tarry would keep it quiet if britt disappeared quit and not even mrs britt would know shortly after am in washington teddy maynard took the call from mccordthe package had been delivered britt was planning a press conference for noon the next day teddy had dirt files on hundreds of politicians past and present as a group they were an easy bunch to trap place a beautiful young woman in their path and you generally gathered something for the file if women didnt work money always did watch them travel watch them crawl in bed with the lobbyists watch them pander to any foreign government smart enough to send lots of cash to washington watch them set up their campaigns and committees to raise funds just watch them and the files always grew thicker he wished the russians were so easy though he despised politicians as a group he did respect a handful of them aaron lake was one hed never chased women never drank much or picked up habits never seemed preoccupied with cash never had been inclined to grandstand the more he watched lake the more he liked him he took his last pill of the night and rolled himself to bed so britt was gone good riddance too bad hecouldnt leak the story anyway the pious hypocrite deserved a good thrashing save it he told himself and use it again president lake might need britt one day and that little boy over in thailand might come in handy seven picasso was suing sherlock and other unnamed defendants for injunctive relief in an effort to stop them from urinating on his roses a little misdirected urine was not going to upset the balance of life at trumble but picasso also wanted damages in the amount of five hundred dollars five hundred dollars was a serious matter the dispute had been festering since the past summer when picasso caught sherlock in the act and the assistant warden had finally intervened he asked the brethren to settle the matter suit was filed then sherlock hired an exlawyer named ratliff yet another tax evader to stall delay postpone and file frivolous pleadings the usual routine for those practicing the art of law on the outside but ratliffs tactics didnt sit well with the brethren and neither sherlock nor his lawyer was held in high esteem by the panel picassos rose garden was a carefully tended patch of dirt next to the gym it had taken him three years of bureaucratic wars to convince some midlevel paperpusher in washington that such a hobby was and always had been therapeutic since picasso suffered from several disorders once the garden was approved the warden quickly signed off and picasso dug in with both hands he got his roses from a supplier in jacksonville which in itself took another box of paperwork his real job was that of a dishwasher in the cafeteria for which he earned thirty cents an hour the warden refused his request to be classified as a gardener so the roses were deemed a hobby during the season picasso could be seen early and late in his little patch on all fours tilling and digging and watering he even talked to his flowers the roses in question were belindas dream a pale pink rose not particularly beautiful but loved by picasso nonetheless when they arrived from the supplier everybody at trumble knew that the belindas were there he lovingly planted them in the front and center of his garden sherlock began urinating on them just for the sheer hell of it he wasnt fond of picasso anyway because he was a notorious liar and peeing on the mans roses just seemed appropriate for some reason others caught on sherlock encouraged them by assuring that they were in fact helping the roses by adding fertilizer the belindas lost their pinkness and began to fade and picasso was horrified an informant left a note under his door and the secret was out his beloved garden had become a favorite watering hole two days later he ambushed sherlock caught him in the act and the two chubby middleaged white men had an ugly wrestling match on the sidewalk the plants turned a dull yellow and picasso filed suit when it finally reached trial after months of delays by kadiff the brethren were already tired of it they had quietly preassigned the case to justice finnyarber whose mother had once raised roses and after a few hours of research he had informed the other two that urine would in fact not change the color of the plants so two days before the hearing they reached their decision they would grant the injunction to keep sherlock and the other pigs from spraying picassos roses but they would not award damages for three hours they listened to grown men bicker about who peed where and when and how often at times picasso acting as his own attorney was near tears as he begged his witnesses to squeal on their friends radiff counsel for the defense was cruel and abrasive and redundant and after an hour it was obvious he deserved his disbarment whatever his crimes may have been justice spicer passed the time by studying the point spreads on college basketball games when he couldnt contact trevor he placed makebelieve bets every game he was up in two months on paper he was on a roll winning at cards winning at sports and he had trouble sleeping at night dreaming about his next life in vegas or in the bahamas doing it as a pro with or without his wife justice beech frowned with deep judicial deliberation and appeared to be taking exhaustive notes when in fact he was drafting another letter to curtis in dallas the brethren had decided to bait him again writing as ricky beech explained that a cruel guard at the rehab unit was threatening all sorts of vile physical attacks unless ricky could produce some protection money ricky needed to secure his safety from the beast and could curtis lend it to him could we move this along beech said loudly interrupting exlawyer ratliff once again when he was a real judge beech had mastered the practice of reading magazines while halflistening to lawyers drone on before juries a blaring and welltimed admonition from the bench kept everyone sharp he wrote it is such a vicious game they play here we arrive broken into tiny pieces slowly they clean us up dry us out put us back together piece by piece they clear our heads teach us discipline and confidence and prepare us for our return to society they do a good job of this yet they allow these ignorant thugs who guard the grounds to threaten us fragile as we still are and in doing so break down what weve worked so hard to produce i am so scared of this man i hide in my room when im supposed to be tanning and lifting weights i cannot sleep i long for booze and drugs as a means of escape please curtis loan me the so i can buy this guy off so i can complete my rehab and leave here in one piece when we meet i want to be healthy and in great shape what would his friends think the honorable hadee beech federal judge writing prose like a faggot extorting money out of innocent people he had no friends he had no rules the law he once worshiped had placed him where he was which at the moment was in a prison cafeteria wearing a faded green choir robe from a black church listening to a bunch of angry convicts argue over urine youve already asked that question eight times he barked at ratliff whod obviously been watching too many bad lawyer shows on television since the case was justice yarbers he was expected to at least appear as if he were paying attention he was not nor was he concerned about appearances as usual he was naked under his robe and he sat with his legs crossed wide cleaning his long toenails with a plastic fork you think theyd turn brown if i crapped on them sherlock yelled at picasso and the cafeteria erupted with laughter language please justice beech admonished order in the court said t karl the court jester under his bright gray wig it was not his role in the courtroom to demand order but it was something he did well and the brethren let it slide he rapped his gavel said order gentlemen beech wrote please help me curtis i have no one else to turn to im breaking again i fear another collapse i fear i will never leave this place hurry spicer put a hundred dollars on indiana over purdue duke over clemson alabama over vandy wisconsin over illinois what did he know about wisconsin basketball he asked himself didnt matter he was a professional gambler and a damned good one if the was still buried behind the toolshed hed parlay it into a million within a year thats enough beech said holding up his hands ive heard enough too yarber said forgetting his toenails and leaning on the table the brethren huddled and deliberated as if the outcome might set a serious precedent or at least have some profound impact on the future of american jurisprudence they frowned and scratched their heads and appeared to even argue over the merits of the case meanwhile poor picasso sat by himself ready to cry thoroughly exhausted by ratliffs tactics justice yarber cleared his throat and said by a vote of two to one we have reached a decision we are issuing an injunction against all inmates urinating on the damned roses anyone caught doing so will be fined fifty dollars no damages will be assessed at this time with perfect timing t karl slammed his gavel and yelled courts adjourned until further notice all rise of course no one moved i want to appeal picasso yelled so do i said sherlock must be a good decision yarber said collecting his robe and standing both sides are unhappy beech and spicer stood too and the brethren paraded out of the cafeteria a guard walked into the middle of the litigants and witnesses and said courts over boys get back to work the ceo of hummand a company in seattle which made missiles and radarjamming machinery had once been a congressman whod been quite close to the cia teddy maynard knew him well when the ceo announced at a press conference that his company had raised million for the lake campaign cnn interrupted a liposuction segment to carry the story live five thousand hummand workers had written checks for each the maximum allowed under federal law the ceo had the checks in a box that he showed to the cameras then he flew with them on a hummand jet to washington where he took them to the lake headquarters follow the money and youll find your winner since lakes announcement over eleven thousand defense and aerospace workers from thirty states had contributed just over million the postal service was delivering their checks in boxes their unions had sent almost that much with another million promised lakes people hired a dc accounting firm just to process and count the money the hummand ceo arrived in washington amid as much fanfare as could be generated candidate lake was on another private jet a challenger freshly leased at a month when he landed in detroit he was met by two black suburbans both brand new both just leased at a month each lake now had an escort a group of people moving in sync with him wherever he went and though he was certain hed soon get used to it it was unnerving at first strangers around him all the time grave young men in dark suits with little microphones in their ears guns strapped to their bodies two secret service agents were on the flight with him and three more waited with the suburbans and he had floyd from his congressional office floyd was a dullwitted young man from a prominent family back in arizona who was good for nothing but running errands now floyd was a driver floyd took the wheel of one suburban lake in the front seat two agents and a secretary sitting behind two aides and three agents piled into the other and away they went headed for downtown detroit where serious local tv journalists were waiting lake had no time for stumping or walking neighborhoods or eating catfish or standing in the rain outside busy factories he couldnt hike for the cameras or stage town meetings or stand amid rubble in ghettos and decry failed policies there wasnt enough time to do all the things candidates were expected to do he was entering late with no groundwork in place no grass roots no local support of any kind lake had a handsome face a pleasant voice nice suits an urgent message and lots of cash if buying tv could buy an election aaron lake was about to get himself a new job he called washington talked to his moneyman and was given the news about the million announcement hed never heard of hummand is it a public company he asked no came the answer very private just under a billion in annual sales an innovator in radar jamming could make billions if the right man took charge of the military and started spending again nineteen million dollars was now in hand a record of course and they were revising their projections the lake campaign would collect thirty million in its first two weeks there was no way to spend money that fast he folded the cell phone handed it back to floyd who appeared to be lost in traffic from now on we use helicopters lake announced over his shoulder to the secretary who actually wrote down the directive find helicopters lake hid behind his sunglasses and tried to analyze thirty million bucks the transition from a fiscal conservative to a freewheeling candidate was awkward but the money had to be spent it wasnt squeezed from the taxpayers rather it was freely given he could rationalize once elected hed continue his fight for the workingman he thought again about teddy maynard sitting in some dark room deep inside langley legs wrapped in a quilt face squinting from pain pulling strings only he could pull making money fall from trees lake would never know the things teddy was doing on his behalf nor did he want to the director of middle east operations was named lufkin a twentyyear man teddy trusted implicitly fourteen hours earlier hed been in tel aviv now he was in teddys war room somehow looking fresh and alert his message had to be delivered in person mouth to mouth no wires or signals or satellites and what was said between them would never be repeated it had been that way for many years an attack on our embassy in cairo is now imminent lufkin said no reaction from teddy no frown no surprise no cutting of the eyes nothing hed gotten such news many times before yidal yes his top lieutenant was seen in cairo last week seen by whom the israelis theyve also followed two truckloads of explosives from tripoli everything seems to be in place when imminent how imminent within a week id guess teddy pulled an earlobe and closed his eyes lufkin tried not to stare and he knew better than to ask questions he would leave soon and return to the middle east and he would wait the attack on the embassy might proceed with no warning dozens would be killed and maimed a crater in the city would smolder for days and in washington fingers would point and accusations would fly the cia would be blamed again none of it would faze teddy maynard as lufkin had learned sometimes teddy needed the terror to accomplish what he wanted or maybe the embassy would be spared the attack thwarted by egyptian commandos working with the united states the cia would be praised for its excellent intelligence that wouldnt faze teddy either and youre certain he asked yes as certain as one can be in these situations lufkin of course had no clue that the director was now plotting to elect a president lufkin had barely heard of aaron lake frankly he didnt care who won the election hed been in the middle east long enough to know it didnt really matter who set american policy there hed leave in three hours on the concorde to paris where hed spend a day before going to jerusalem go to cairo teddy said without opening his eyes sure and do what wait wait for what wait for the ground to shake stay away from the embassy yorks initial reaction was one of horror you cant run this damned ad teddy he said its rrated ive never seen so much blood i like that teddy said pushing a button on the remote an rrated campaign ad its never been done before they watched it again it began with the sound of a bomb then footage of the marine barracks in beirut smoke rubble chaos marines being pulled from debris mangled bodies marines lying dead in a neat row president reagan addressing the press and vowing revenge but the threat sounded hollow then the photo of an american soldier standing between two masked gunmen a heavy ominous voiceover said since hundreds of americans have been murdered by terrorists around the world another bomb scene more bloody and dazed survivors more smoke and chaos we always vow revenge we always threaten to find and punish those responsible quick clips of president bush on two separate occasions angrily promising retaliationanother attack more bodies then footage of a terrorist standing in the door of a jetliner dragging off the body of an american soldier president clinton near tears his voice ready to crack saying we will not rest until we find those responsible next the handsome but serious face of aaron lake looking sincerely at the camera coming into our homes saying the fact is we dont retaliate we react with words we swagger and threaten but in reality we bury our dead then forget about them the terrorists are winning the war because we have lacked the guts to fight back when im your president we will use our new military to fight terrorism wherever we find it no american death will go unanswered i promise we will not be humiliated by ragtag little armies hiding in mountains we will destroy them the ad ran for exactly sixty seconds cost very little to make because teddy already had the footage and would start running during prime time in fortyeight hours i dont knowteddy york said its gruesome its a gruesome world teddy liked the ad and thats all that mattered lake had objected to the blood but came around quickly his name recognition was up to percent but his ads were still disliked just wait teddy kept telling himself wait until there are more bodies eight trevor was sipping a carryout double latte from beach java and debating whether to add a generous shot or two ofamaretto to help soothe away the mornings cobwebs when the call came his cramped suite had no intercom system one was not needed jan could simply yell any message down the hall and he could yell back if he wanted for eight years he and this particular secretary had been barking at each other its some bank in the bahamas she announced he almost spilled the coffee as he lunged for the phone it was a brit whose accent had been softened by the islands a substantial wire had been received from a bank in iowa how substantial he wanted to know covering his mouth so jan couldnt hear a hundred thousand dollars trevor hung up and added the amaretto three shots of it and sipped the delightful brew while smiling goofily at the wall in his career hed never come close to a fee of hed settled a car wreck once for taken a fee of and within two months had spent all of it jan knew nothing about the offshore account and the scam that diverted money to it so he was forced to wait an hour make a bunch of useless phone calls and try to look busy before announcing he had to take care of some crucial business in downtown jacksonville then he was needed at trumble she didnt care he disappeared all the time and she had some reading to keep her occupied he raced to the airport almost missed his shuttle and drank two beers during the thirtyminute flight to fort lauderdale then two more on the way to nassau on the ground he fell into the back of a cab a cadillac painted gold without airconditioning and with a driver whod also been drinking the air was hot and wet the traffic slow and trevors shirt was sticking to his back by the time they stopped downtown near the geneva trust bank building inside mr brayshears came forward eventually and led trevor to his small office he presented a sheet of paper which gave the bare details a wire originating from the first iowa bank in des moines remitter being a faceless entity named cmt investments the payee was another generic entity named boomer realty ltd boomer was the name of joe roy spicers favorite bird dog trevor signed the forms to transfer to his own separate account with geneva trust money he kept hidden from his secretary and from the irs the remaining was handed to him in a thick envelope cash he stuffed it deep into his khaki pants pocket shook brayshears soft little hand and raced out of the building he was tempted to stay a couple of days find a room on the beach get a chair by the pool and drink rum until they stopped bringing it to him the temptation grew to the point that he almost bolted from the gate at the airport and raced to get another cab but he reached deep determined not to squander his money this time two hours later he was in the jacksonville airport drinking strong coffee without liquor and making his plans he drove to trumble arriving at fourthirty and he waited for spicer for almost half an hour a pleasant surprise spicer said dryly as he stepped into the attorneyconference room trevor had no briefcase to inspect so the guard patted his pockets and stepped outside his cash was hidden under the floor mat of his beetle we received a hundred thousand dollars from iowa trevor said glancing at the door spicer was suddenly happy to see his lawyer he resented the we in trevors announcement and he resented the healthy cut he raked off the top but the scam wouldnt work without help from the outside and as usual the lawyer was a necessary evil so far trevor could be trusted its in the bahamas yes i just left there the moneys tucked away all sixtyseven thousand of it spicer breathed deeply and savored the victory a third of the loot gave him and change it was time to write some more letters he reached into the pocket of his olive prison shirt and removed a folded newspaper clipping he stretched his arms studied it for a second then said dukes at tech tonight the line is eleven put five thousand bucks on tech five thousand yep ive never put five thousand on a game before what kinda bookie you got small time look if hes a bookie he can handle the numbers call him as soon as you can he may have to make a few calls but he can do it all right all right can you come back tomorrow probably how many other clients have ever paid you thirtythree thousand bucks none right so be here at four tomorrow ill have some mail for you spicer left him and walked quickly from the administration building with only a nod at a guard in a window he walked with a purpose across the finely manicured lawn the florida sun heating the sidewalk even in february his colleagues were deep in their unhurried labors in their little library alone as always so spicer did not hesitate to announce we got the hundred thousand firm old quince in iowa beechs hands froze on his keyboard he peered over his reading glasses his jaw dropping and managed to say youre kidding nope just talked to trevor the money was wired in exactly as instructed arrived in the bahamas this morning quincy baby came through lets hit him again yarber said before the others could think of it quince sure the first hundred was easy lets squeeze him one more time what could we lose not a damned thing spicer said with a smile he wished hed said it first how much asked beech lets try fifty yarber said pulling numbers from the air as if anything was possible the other two nodded and pondered the next fifty thousand then spicer took charge and said look lets evaluate where we are now i think curtis in dallas is ripe well hit quince again this thing is working and i think we should shift gears get more aggressive know what i mean lets take each pen pal analyze them one by one and step up the pressure beech turned off his computer and reached for a file yarber cleared his small desk their little angola scam had just received a fresh infusion of capital and the smell of illgotten cash was intoxicating they began reading all the old letters and drafting new ones more victims were needed they quickly decided more ads would be placed in the back pages of those magazines trvor made it as far as petes bar and grill arriving there just in time for happy hour which atpetes began at p m and ran until the first fistfight he found prep a thirtytwoyearold sophomore at north florida shooting nineball for twenty bucks a game preps dwindling trust fund required the family lawyer to pay him a month as long as he was enrolled as a fulltime student hed been a sophomore for eleven years prep was also the busiest bookie at petes and when trevor whispered that he had serious money to place on the duke tech game prep asked how much fifteen thousand trevor said then gulped his longneck beer you serious prep asked chalking his cue stick and glancing around the smoky tabletrevor had never bet more than a hundred bucks on any game yep another long pull on the bottle he was feeling lucky if spicer had the guts to lay on the game trevor would double it hed just earned taxfree dollars so what if he lost ten that much belonged to the irs anyway ill have to make a call prep said pulling out a cell phone hurrythe game starts in thirty minutes the bartender was a local whod never left the state of florida but had somehow developed an intense passion for australian rules football a game was on from down under and it took a bribe from trevor to get the channel changed to acc basketball with riding on georgia tech there was no way duke could miss a shot at least not in the first half trevor ate french fries drank one bottle after another and tried to ignore prep who was standing near a pool table in a dark corner watching in the second half trevor almost bribed the bartender to switch back to the aussie game he was getting drunker and with ten minutes to go was openly cursing joe roy spicer to anyone who would listen what did that redneck know about acc basketball duke led by twenty with nine minutes to go when techs point guard got hot and nailed four straight threes trevor had tech and eleven the game was tied with a minute to go trevor didnt care who won hed beat the spread he paid his tab tipped the bartender another then flashed a smartass salute to prep as he walked out the door prep flipped him the bird in the cool darkness trevor skipped along atlantic boulevard away from the lights past the cheap summer rentals packed tightly together past the neat little retirement homes with their fresh paint and perfect lawns down the old wooden steps to the sand where he took off his shoes and strolled along the edge of the water the temperature was in the forties not unusual for jacksonville in february and before long his feet were cold and wet not that he felt much in one day taxfree all hidden from the government last year after expenses hed cleared and that was working practically full timehaggling with clients too poor or too cheap to pay avoiding courtrooms dealing with pennyante real estate agents and bankers bickering with his secretary cutting corners on taxes ali the joy of quick cash hed been suspicious of the brethrens little scam but now it seemed so brilliant extort from those who cant complain how thoroughly clever and since it was working so well he knew spicer would turn up the heat the mail would get heavier the visits to trumble more frequent hell hed be there every day if necessary hauling letters in and out bribing guards he splashed his feet in the water as the wind picked up and the waves roared in even more clever would be to steal from the extortionists courtcertified crooks who certainly couldnt complain it was a nasty thought one he was almost ashamed of but a valid one nonetheless all options would be kept open since when were thieves known for their loyalty he needed a million dollars nothing more or less hed done the math many times driving to trumble drinking at petes sitting at his desk with the door locked a lousy million bucks and he could close his sad little office surrender his law license buy a sailboat arid spend eternity drifting with the winds around the caribbean he was closer than he would ever be justice spicer rolled over again on the bottom bunk sleep was a rare gift in his tiny room on his tiny bed with a small smelly roommate named alvin snoring above him alvin had roamed north america as a hobo for decades but late in life had grown weary and hungry his crime had been the robbery of a rural mail carrier in oklahoma his apprehension had been aided mightily when alvin walked into the fbi office in tulsa and declared i did it the fbi scrambled for six hours to find the crime even the judge knew alvin planned it all he wanted a federal bed certainly not one provided by the state sleep was even more difficult than usual because spicer was worried about the lawyer now that the scam had hit its stride there was serious cash lying around and more on the way the more boomer realty collected in the bahamas the more tempting it would become for trevor he and he alone could steal their illgotten loot and get away with it but the scam worked only with an outside conspirator someone had to sneak the mail back and forth someone had to collect the money there had to be a way to bypass the lawyer and joe roy was determined to find it if he didnt sleep for a month he didnt care no slimy lawyer would take a third of his money then steal the rest nine defensepac or dpac as it would quickly and widely become known made a roaring entry onto the loose and murky field of political finance no politicalaction committee in recent history had appeared with as much muscle behind it its seed money came from a chicago financier named mitzger an american with dual israeli citizenship he put up the first million which lasted about a week other jewish highrollers were quickly brought into the fold though their identities were shielded by corporations and offshore accounts teddy maynard knew the dangers of having a bunch of rich jews contribute openly and in an organized fashion to lakes campaign he relied on old friends in tel aviv to organize the money in newyork mitzger was a liberal when it came to politics but no issue was as dear as the security of israel aaron lake was much too moderate on social matters but he was also dead serious about a new military middle east stability depended on a strong america at least in mitzgers opinion he rented a suite at the willard in dc one day and by noon the next he had leased an entire floor of an office building near dulles his staff from chicago worked around the clock plowing through the myriad details required to instantly outfit forty thousand square feet with the latest technology he had a am breakfast with elaine tyner a lawyerlobbyist from a gigantic washington firm one shed built with her own iron will and lots of oil clients tyner was sixty years old and currently regarded as the most powerful lobbyist in town over bagels and juice she agreed to represent dpac for an initial retainer of her firm would immediately dispatch twenty associates and that many clerks to the new dpac offices where one of her partners would take charge one section would do nothing but raise money one would analyze congressional support for lake and begin gently at first the delicate process of lining up endorsements from senators and representatives and even governors it would not be easy most were already committed to other candidates yet another section would do nothing but researchmilitary hardware its costs new gadgets futuristic weapons russian and chinese innovationsanything that candidate lake might need to know tyner herself would work on raising money from foreign governments one of her specialties she was very dose to the south koreans having been their presence in washington for the past decade she knew the diplomats the businessmen the big shots few countries would sleep easier with a beefedup united states military than south korea i feel sure theyll be good for at least five million she said confidently initially anyway from memory she made a list of twenty french and british companies that derived at least a fourth of their annual sales from the pentagon shed start working on them immediately tyner was very much the washington lawyer these days she hadnt seen a courtroom in fifteen years and every meaningful world event originated within the beltway and somehow affected her the challenge at hand was unprecedentedelecting an unknown lastminute candidate who at the moment enjoyed percent name recognition and percent positives what their candidate had though unlike the other flakes who dropped in and out of the presidential derby was seemingly unlimited cashtyner had been well paid to elect and defeat scores of politicians and she held the unwavering belief that money would always win give her the money and she could elect or beat anybody during the first week of its existence dpac buzzed with unbridled energy the offices were open twentyfour hours a day as tyners people set up shop and charged forward those raising money produced an exhaustive computerized list of hourly workers in defense and related industries then hit them hard with a slick mailout pleading for money another list had the names of twentyeight thousand whitecollar defense workers who earned in excess of a year they were mailed a different type of solicitation the dpac consultants looking for endorsements found the fifty members of congress with the most defense jobs in their districts thirtyseven were up for reelection which would make the armtwisting that much easier dpac would go to the grassroots to the defense workers and their bosses and orchestrate a massive phone campaign in support ofaaron lake and more military spending six senators from defenseheavy states had tough opponents in november and elaine tyner planned a lunch with each of them unlimited cash cannot go unnoticed for long in washington a rookie congressman from kentucky one of the lowest of the desperately needed money to fight what appeared to be a losing campaign back home no one had heard of the poor boy he hadnt said a word during his first two years and now his rivals back home had found an attractive opponent no one would give him money he heard rumors tracked down elaine tyner and their conversation went something like this how much money do you need she asked a hundred thousand dollars he flinched she did not can you endorse aaron lake for president ill endorse anybody if the price is right good well give you two hundred thousand and run your campaign its all yours most were not that easy but dpac managed to buy eight endorsements in the first ten days of its existence all were insignificant congressmen whod served with lake and liked him well enough the strategy was to line them up before the cameras a week or two before big super tuesday march the more the merrier most however had already cornxnitted to other candidates tyner hurriedly made the rounds sometimes eating three power meals a day all happily covered by dpac her goal was to let the town know that her brandnew client had arrived had plenty of money and was backing a dark horse soon to break from the pack in a city where talk was an industry in itself she had no trouble spreading her message finn yarbers wife arrived unannounced at trumble her first visit in ten months she wore fraying leather sandals a soiled denim skirt a baggy blouse adorned with beads and feathers and all sorts of old hippie crap around her neck and wrists and head she had a gray butch cut and hair under her arms and looked very much like the tired wornout refugee from the sixties that she really was finn was less than thrilled when word got to him that his wife was waiting up front her name was carmen topolskiyocoby a mouthful that she had used as a weapon all of her adult life she was a radical feminist lawyer in oakland whose speciality was representing lesbians suing for sexual harassment at work so every single client was an angry woman battling an angry employer work was a bitch she had been married to finn for thirty years married but not always living together hed lived with other women shed lived with other men once when they were newlyweds they lived with an entire houseful of others different combinations each week both came and went for one sixyear stretch they lived together in chaotic monogamy and produced two children neither of whom had amounted to much theyd met on the battlefields of berkeley in both protesting the war and all other evils both law students both committed to the high moral ground of social change they worked diligently to register voters they fought for the dignity of migrant workers they got arrested during the tet offensive they chained themselves to redwoods they fought the christians in the schools they sued on behalf of the whales they marched the streets of san francisco in every parade for any and every cause and they drank heavily partied with great enthusiasm and relished the drug culture they moved in and out and slept around and this was okay because they defined their own morality they were fighting for the mexicans and the redwoods dammit they had to be good people now they were just tired she was embarrassed that her husband a brilliant man whod somehow stumbled his way onto the california supreme court was now locked away in a federal prison he was quite relieved that the prison was in florida and not california otherwise she might visit more often his first digs had been near bakersfield but he managed to get himself transferred away they never wrote each other never called she was passing through because she had a sister in miami nice tan she said youre looking good and youre shriveling like an old prune he thought damn she looked ancient and tired hows life he asked not really caring busy im working too hard thats good good that she was working and making a living something shed done off and on for many years finn had five years to go before he could shake trumbles dust from his gnarled and bare feet he had no intention of returning to her or to california if he survived something he doubted every day hed leave at the age of sixtyfive and his dream was to find a land where the irs and the fbi and all the rest of those alphabetized government thugs had no jurisdiction finn hated his own government so much he planned to renounce his citizenship and find another nationality are you still drinking he asked he of course was not though he did manage a little pot occasionally from one of the guards im still sober thanks for asking every question was a barb every reply a retort he honestly wondered why she had stopped by then he found out ive decided to get a divorce she said he shrugged as if to say why bother instead he said probably not a bad idea ive found someone else she said male or female he asked more curious than anything else nothing would surprise him a younger man he shrugged again and almost said go for it old girl hes not the first finn said lets not go there she said fine with finn he had always admired her exuberant sexuality her stamina but it was difficult to imagine this old woman doing it with any regularity show me the papers he said ill sign them theyll be here in a week its a clean break since we own so little these days at the height of his rise to power justiceyarber and ms topolskiyocoby had jointly applied for a mortgage on a home in the marina district of san francisco the application properly sanitized to remove any hint of chauvinism or sexism or racism or ageism blandly worded by spooked california lawyers terrified of being sued by some offended soul showed a gap between assets and liabilities of almost a million dollars not that a million dollars had mattered to either one of them they were too busy fighting timber interests and ruthless farmers etc in fact theyd taken pride in the scantness of their assets california was a community property state which roughly meant an equal split the divorce papers would be easy to sign for many reasons and there was one reason finn would never mention the angola scam was producing money hidden and dirty and offlimits to any and every greedy agency ms carmen would damned sure never know about it finn wasnt certain how the tentacles of community property might reach a secret bank account in the bahamas but he had no plans to find out show him the papers hed be happy to sign they managed to chat a few minutes about old friends a brief conversation indeed because most friends were gone when they said goodbye there was no sadness no remorse the marriage had been dead for a long time they were relieved at its passing he wished her well without so much as a hug then went to the track where he stripped to his boxers and walked an hour in the sun ten lufkin was fishing his second day in cairo with dinner at a sidewalk cafe on shari elcorniche in the garden city section of the city he sipped strong black coffee and watched the merchants close their shopssellers of rugs and brass pots and leather bags and linens from pakistan all for the tourists less than twenty feet away an ancient vendor meticulously folded his tent then left his spot without a trace lufldn looked very much the part of a modern arabwhite slacks light khaki jacket a white vented fedora with the bill down close to his eyes he watched the world from behind a hat and a pair of sunshades he kept his face and arms tanned and his dark hair cut very short he spoke perfect arabic and moved with ease from beirut to damascus to cairo his room was at the hotel elnil on the edge of the nile river six crowded blocks away and as he drifted through the city he was suddenly joined by a tall thin foreigner of some breed with only passable english they knew each other well enough to trust each other and continued their walk we think tonight is the night the contact said his eyes also hidden go on theres a party at the embassy i know yes a nice setting lots of traffic the bomb will be in a van what kind of van we dont know anything else no he said then vanished in a swarming crowd lufkin drank a pepsi in a hotel bar alone and thought about calling teddy but it had been four days since hed seen him at langley and teddy had made no contact theyd been through this before teddy was not going to intervene cairo was a dangerous place for westerners these days and no one could effectively blame the cia for not stopping an attack there would be the usual grandstanding and finger pointing but the terror would quickly be shoved into the recesses of the national memory then forgotten there was a campaign at hand and the world moved fast anyway with so many attacks and assaults and mindless violence both at home and abroad the american people had become hardened twentyfourhour news nonstop flash points the world always with a crisis somewhere latebreaking stories a shock here and a shock there and before long you couldnt keep up with events lufkin left the bar and went to his room from his window on the fourth floor the city rambled forever built helterskelter over the centuries the roof of the american embassy was directly in front of him a mile away he opened a paperback louis lamour and waited for the fireworks the truck was a twoton volvo panel van loaded from floor to ceiling with three thousand pounds of plastic explosives made in romania its door happily advertised the services of a wellknown caterer in the city a company which made frequent visits to most of the western embassies it was parked near the service entrance in the basement the driver of the truck had been a large friendly egyptian called shake by the marines who guarded the embassy shake passed through often hauling food and supplies to and from social events shake was now dead on the floor of his truck a bullet in his brain at twenty minutes after ten the bomb was detonated by a remote device operated by a terrorist hiding across the street as soon as he pushed the right buttons he ducked behind a car afraid to look the explosion ripped out supporting columns deep in the basement so the embassy fell to one side debris rained for blocks most of the nearby buildings suffered structural damage windows within a quarter of a mile were cracked luflcin was napping in his chair when the quake came he jumped to his feet walked onto his narrow balcony and watched the cloud of dust the roof of the embassy was no longer visible within minutes flames were seen and the interminable sirens began he propped his chair against the railing of the balcony and settled in for the duration there would be no sleep six minutes after the explosion the electricity in garden city went out and cairo was dark except for the orange glow of the american embassy he called teddy when the technician teddys sanitizer assured lufldn the line was secure the old mans voice came through as clearly as if they were chatting from new york to boston yes maynard here im in cairo teddy watching our embassy go up in smoke when did it happen less than ten minutes ago how big hard to tell im in a hotel a mile away massive id say call me in an hour ill stay here at the office tonight done teddy rolled himself to a computer punched a few buttons and within seconds found aaron lake the candidate was en route from philadelphia to atlanta aboard his shiny new airplanethere was a phone in lakes pocket a secure digital unit as slim as a cigarette lighter teddy punched more numbers the phone was summoned and teddy spoke to his monitor mr lake its teddy maynard who else could it be lake thought no one else could use the phone are you alone teddy asked just a minute teddy waited then the voice returned im in the kitchen now lake said your plane has a kitchen a small one yes its a very nice plane mr mayhard good listen sorry to bother you but i have some news they bombed the american embassy in cairo fifteen minutes ago who dont ask that sorry the press will be all over you take a moment prepare some remarks it will be a good time to express concern for the victims and their families keep the politics to a minimum but also keep the hard line your ads are prophetic now so your words will be repeated many times ill do it right now call me when you get to atlanta yes i will forty minutes later lake and his group landed in atlanta the press had been duly notified of his arrival and with the dust just settling in cairo there was a crowd waiting no live pictures had yet emerged of the embassy yet several agencies were already reporting that hundreds had been killed in the small terminal for private aircraft lake stood before an eager group of reporters some with cameras and mikes others with slim recorders others still with just plain old notepads he spoke solemnly without notes at this moment we should be in prayer for those whove been injured and killed by this act of war our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and also with the rescue people i am not going to politicize this event but i will say that it is absurd for this country to once again suffer at the hands of terrorists when i am president no american life will go unaccounted for i will use our new military to track down and annihilate any terrorist group that preys upon innocent americans thats all i have to say he walked off ignoring the shouts and questions from the pack of shaggy dogs brilliant thought teddy watching live from his bunker quick compassionate yet tough as hell superb he once again patted himself on the back for choosing such a wonderful candidate when lufkin called again it was past midnight in cairo the fires had been extinguished and they were hauling out bodies as fast as they could many were buried in the rubble he was a block away behind an army barricade watching with thousands of others the scene was chaos smoke and dust thick in the air lufkin had been to several bomb sites in his career and this was a bad one he reported teddy rolled around his room and poured another decaf coffee the lake terror ads would begin at prime time on this very night the campaign would spend million in a coasttocoast deluge of fear and doom theyd pull the ads tomorrow and announce it beforehand out of respect for the dead and their families the lake campaign would temporarily suspend its little prophecies and theyd start polling at noon tomorrow massive polling high time candidate lakes positives shot upward the arizona and michigan primaries were less than a week away the first pictures from cairo were of a harried reporter with his back to an army barricade soldiers watching him fiercely as he might get shot if he tried once more to charge forward sirens wailed all around lights flashed but the reporter knew little a massive bomb had exploded deep in the embassy at tentwenty when a party was breaking up no idea of the casualties but thered be plenty he promised the area was cordoned off by the army and for good measure theyd sealed the airspace so dammit thered be no helicopter shots as of yet no one had claimed responsibility but for good measure he gave the names of three radical groups as the usual suspects could be one of these could be someone else he said helpfully with no carnage to film the camera was forced to stay with the reporter and since he had nothing to say he prattled on about how dangerous the middle east had become as if this were breaking news and he was there to report it lufkin called around pm dc time to tell teddy that the american ambassador to egypt could not be located and they were beginning to fear he might be in the rubble at least that was the word on the street while talking to lufkin on the phone teddy watched the muted reporter a lake terror ad appeared on another screen it showed the rubble the carnage the bodies the radicals from some other attack then the smooth but earnest voice of aaron lake promising revenge how perfect the timingteddy thought an aide woke teddy at midnight with lemon tea and a vegetable sandwich as he so often did hed napped in his wheelchair the wall of tv screens alive with images but no sound when the aide left he pushed a button and listened the sun was well up in cairo the ambassador had not been found and it was now being assumed he was somewhere in the rubble teddy had never met the ambassador to egypt an absolute unknown anyway who was now being idolized by the chattering reporters as a great american his death didnt particularly bother teddy though it would increase the criticism of the cia it would also add gravity to the attack which in the scheme of things would benefit aaron lake sixtyone bodies had been recovered so far the egyptian authorities were blaming yidal the likeliest of suspects because his little army had bombed three western embassies in the past sixteen months and because he was openly calling for war against the united states the current cia dossier on yidal gave him thirty soldiers and an annual budget of around million almost all originating from libya and saudi arabia but to the press the leaks suggested an army of a thousand with unlimited funds with which to terrorize innocent americans the israelis knew what yidal had for breakfast and where he ate it they couldve taken him out a dozen times but so far hed kept his little war away from them as long as he killed americans and westerners the israelis really didnt care it was to their benefit for the west to loathe the islamic radicals teddy ate slowly then napped some more lufkin called before noon cairo time with the news that the bodies of the ambassador and his wife had been found the count was now at eightyfour all but eleven were americans the cameras caught up with aaron lake outside a plant in marietta georgia shaking hands in the dark as the shift changed and when asked about events in cairo he said sixteen months ago these same criminals bombed two of our embassies killing thirty americans and weve done nothing to stop them theyre operating with impunity because we lack the commitment to fight when im president well declare war on these terrorists and stop the killing the tough talk was contagious and as america woke up to the terrible news in cairo the country was also treated to a brash chorus of threats and ultimatums from the other seven candidates even the more passive among them now sounded like gunslingers eleven it was snowing again in iowa a steady swirl of snow and wind that turned to slush on the streets and sidewalks and made quince garbe once again long for a beach he covered his face on main street as if to protect himself but the truth was he didnt want to speak to anyone didnt want anyone to see him darting yet again into the post office there was a letter in the box one of those letters his jaw fell and his hands froze when he saw it just lying there with some junk mail innocent like a note from an old friend he glanced over both shouldersa thief racked with guiltthen yanked it out and thrust it into his coat his wife was at the hospital planning a ball for crippled children so the house was empty except for a maid who spent her day napping down in the laundry room he hadnt given her a raise in eight years he took his time driving there fighting the snow and the drifts cursing the con man whod entered his life under the ruse of love anticipating the letter which grew heavier near his heart with each passing minute no sign of the maid as he entered the front door making as much noise as possible he went upstairs to his bedroom where he locked the door there was a pistol under the mattress he flung his overcoat and his gloves onto an armchair then his jacket and he sat on the edge of his bed and examined the envelope same lavender paper same handwriting same everything with a jacksonville postmark two days old he ripped it open and removed a single page dear quince thanks so much for the money so that you wont think im a total thug i think you should know the money went to my wife and children they are suffering so my incarceration has left them destitute my wife is clinically depressed and cannot work my four children are fed by welfare and food stamps a hundred thousand bucks should certainly fatten them up quince thought they live in government housing and have no dependable transportation so thanks again for your help another should get them out of debt and start a nice college fund same rules as before same wiring instructions same promises to expose your secret life if the money is not received quickly do it now quince and i swear this is my last letter thanks again quince love ricky he went to the bathroom to the medicine cabinet where he found his wifes valium he took two but thought about eating all of them he needed to lie down but he couldnt use the bed because it would be wrinkled and someone would ask questions so he stretched himself out on the floor on the worn but clean carpet and waited for the pills to work hed begged and scraped and even lied a little to borrow the first installment for ricky there was no way he could squeeze another from a personal balance sheet already heavily padded and still teetering on the edge of insolvency his nice large house was choked with a fat mortgage held by his father his father signed his paychecks his cars were large and imported but they had a million miles on them and little value who in bakers iowa would want to buy an elevenyearold mercedes and what if he managed to somehow steal the money the criminal otherwise known as ricky would simply thank him again then demand more it was over time for the pills time for the gun the phone startled him without thinking he scrambled to his feet and grabbed the receiver hello he grunted where the hell are you it was his father with a tone he knew so well im uh not feeling well he managed to say staring at his watch and now remembering the tenthirty meeting with a very important inspector from the fdic i dont give a damn how you feel mr colthurst from the fdic has been waiting in my office for fifteen minutes im vomiting dad he said and cringed again with the word dad fiftyone years old still using the word dad youre lying why didnt you call if youre sick gladys told me she saw you just before ten walking toward the post officewhat the hells going on here excuse me i gotta go to the toilet ill call you later he hung up the valium rolled in like a pleasant fog and he sat on the edge of his bed staring at the lavender squares scattered on the floor ideas were slow in coming hampered by the pills he could hide the letters then kill himself his suicide note would place the bulk of the blame on his father death was not an altogether unpleasant prospect no lore marriage no more bank no more dad no more bakers iowa no more hiding in the closet but he would miss his children and grandchildren and what if this ricky monster didnt learn of the suicide and sent another letter and they found it and somehow quince got himself outed anyway long after his funeral the next lousy idea involved a conspiracy with his secretary a woman he trusted marginally to begin with he would tell her the truth then ask her to write a letter to ricky and break the news of quince garbes suicide together quince and his secretary could scheme and fake their way through a suicide and in the process take some measure of revenge against ricky but hed rather be dead than tell his secretary the third idea occurred after the valium had settled in at full throttle and it made him smile why not try a little honesty write a letter to ricky and plead poverty offer another and tell him thats all if ricky was determined to destroy him then he quince would have no choice but to come after ricky hed inform the fbi let them track the letters and the wire transfers and both men would go down in flames he slept on the floor for thirty minutes then gathered his jacket gloves and overcoat he left the house without seeing the maid as he drove to town flush with the desire to confront the truth he admitted aloud that only the money mattered his father was eightyone the banks stock was worth about million someday it would be his stay in the closet until the cash was in hand then live any way he damned well pleased dont screw up the money coleman lee owned a taco but in a strip mall on the outskirts of gary indiana in a section of town now ruled by the mexicans coleman was fortyeight with two bad divorces decades earlier no children thank god because of all the tacos he was thick and slow with a drooping stomach and large fleshy cheeks coleman was not pretty but he was certainly lonely his employees were mainly young mexican boys illegal immigrants all of whom he sooner or latertried to molest or seduce or whatever youd call his clumsy efforts rarely was he successful and his turnover was high business was slow too because people talked and coleman was not well regarded who wanted to buy tacos from a pervert he rented two small boxes at the post office at the other end of the strip mallone for his business the other for his pleasure he collected porno and gathered it almost daily from the post office the mail carrier at his apartment was a curious type and it was best to keep some things as quiet as possible he strolled along the dirty sidewalk at the edge of the parking lot past the discount stores for shoes and cosmetics past a xxx video dive hed been banned from past a welfare office one brought to the suburbs by a desperate politician looking for votes the post office was crowded with mexicans taking their time because it was cold out his daily haul was two hardcore magazines sent to him in plain brown wrappers and a letter which looked vaguely familiar it was a square yellow envelope no return address postmarked in atlantic beach florida ah yes he remembered as he held it young percy in rehab back in his cramped little office between the kitchen and the utility room he quickly flipped through the magazines saw nothing new then stacked them in a pile with a hundred others he opened the letter from percy like the two before it was handprinted and addressed to walt a name he used to collect all his pornwalt lee dear walt i really enjoyed your last letter ive read it many timesyou have a nice way with words as i told you ive been here for almost eighteen months and it gets very lonely i keep your letters under my mattress and when i feel really isolated i read them over and over where did you learn to write like that please send another one as soon as possible with a little luck ill be released in april im not sure where ill go or what ill do its frightening really to think that ill just walk out of here after almost two years and have

what kinda little creep was this coleman smelled a con he ripped the letter into pieces and threw them in the trash a thousand bucks he mumbled to himself reaching for the magazines again curtis was not the real name of the jeweler in dallas curtis worked fine when corresponding with ricky in rehab but the real name was vann gates mr gates was fiftyeight years old on the surface happily married the father of three and the grandfather of two and he and his wife owned six jewelry stores in the dallas area all located in malls on paper they had million and theyd made it themselves they had a very nice new home in highland park with separate bedrooms at opposite ends they met in the kitchen for coffee and in the den for tv and grandkids mr gates ventured from the closet now and then always with excruciating caution no one had a clue his correspondence with ricky was his first attempt at finding love through the want ads and so far hed been thrilled with the results he rented a small box in a post office near one of the malls and used the name curtis v cates the lavender envelope was addressed to curtis cates and as he sat in his car and carefully opened it he at first had no clue anything was wrong just another sweet letter from his beloved ricky lightning hit though with the first words dear vann gates the partys over pal my name aint ricky and youre not curtis im not a gay boy looking for love you however have an awful secret which im sure you want to keep i want to help heres the deal wire to geneva trust bank nassau bahamas account number dxn for boomer realty ltd routingnumber do so immediately this is not a joke its ascam and youve been hooked if the money is not received within ten days i will send to your wifems glenda gates a little packet filled with copies of all letters photos etc wire the money and ill simply go away love ricky with time vann found the dallas i loop and before long he was on the i loop around fort worth then back to dallas driving at exactly fiftyfive in the righthand lane oblivious to the traffic stacked up behind him if crying would help then he wouldve certainly had a good one he had no qualms about weeping especially in the privacy of his jaguar but he was too angry to cry too bitter to be wounded and he was too frightened to waste time yearning for someone who did not exist action was neededquick decisive secretive heartache though overcame him and he finally pulled onto the shoulder and parked with the engine running all those wonderful dreams of ricky those countless hours staring at his handsome face with his crooked little smile and reading his letterssad funny desperate hopefillhow could so many emotions be conveyed with the written word hed practically memorized the letters and he was just a boy so young and virile yet lonely and in need of mature companionship the ricky hed come to love needed the loving embrace of an older man and curtisvann had been making plans for months the ploy of a diamond show in orlando while his wife was in el paso at her sisters hed sweated the details and left no tracks he did finally cry poor vann shed tears without shame or embarrassment no one could see him the other cars were flying past at eighty miles per hour he vowed revenge like any jilted lover hed track down this beast this monster whod posed as ricky and broken his heart when the sobbing began to subside he thought of his wife and family and that helped greatly in drying up the tears shed get all six stores and the million and the new house with separate bedrooms and he would get nothing but ridicule and scorn and gossip in a town that loved it so his children would follow the money and for the rest of their lives his grandchildren would hear the whispers about their grandfather back in the right lane at fiftyfive back through mesquite for the second time reading the letter again as eighteenwheelers roared past there was no one to call no banker he could trust to check out the account in the bahamas no lawyer to run to for advice no friend to hear his sorry tale for a man whod carefiflly lived a double life the money would not be insurmountable his wife watched every dime both at home and at the stores and for that reason vann had long since mastered the scheme of hiding money he did it with gems rubies and pearls and sometimes small diamonds he placed aside and later sold to other dealers for cash it was common in the business he had boxes of cashshoe boxes neatly stacked in a fireproof safe in a ministorage out in plano postdivorce cash cash for the afterlife when he and ricky would sail the world and spend it all in one endless voyage sonofabitch he said through gritted teeth and again and again why not write this con man and plead poverty or threaten to expose his little extortion scheme why not fight back because the sonofabitch knew exactly what he was doing hed tracked vann well enough to learn his real name and the name of his wife he knew vann had the money he pulled into his driveway and there was glenda sweeping the sidewalk where have you been honey she asked pleasantly running errands he said with a smile took a long time she said still sweeping he was so sick of it she timed his movements for thirty years hed been under her thumb with a stopwatch clicking in the pahn of her hand he pecked her on the cheek out of habit then went to the basement where he locked a door and began to cry again the house was his prison with a mortgage of a month it certainly felt like it she was the guard the keeper of the keys his sole means of escape had just collapsed replaced by a coldblooded extortionist twelve eighty coffins required a lot of space they were laid in perfect rows all neatly wrapped in red white and blue all the same length and width theyd arrived thirty minutes earlier aboard an air force cargo plane and were removed with great pomp and ceremony almost a thousand friends and relatives sat on folding chairs on the concrete floor of the hangar and stared in shock at the sea of flags arranged before them they were outnumbered only by the shaggy dogs all quarantined behind barricades and military police even for a country well accustomed to foreign policy boondoggles it was an impressive body count eighty americans eight brits eight germansno french because theyd been boycotting western diplomatic functions in cairo why were eighty americans still in the embassy after pm that was the question of the hour and so far no good answer had surfaced so many of those who made such decisions were now lying in their coffins the best theory buzzing around dc was that the caterer had been late and the band even later but the terrorists had proved all too well that they would strike at any hour so what difference did it make how late the ambassador and his wife and their staff and colleagues and guests wanted to party the second great question of the hour was just exactly why did we have eighty people in our embassy in cairo to begin with the state department had yet to acknowledge the question after some mournful music from an air force band the president spoke his voice broke and he managed to summon a tear or two but after eight years of such theatrics the act had worn thin hed already promised revenge many times so he dwelt on comfort and sacrifice and the promise of a better life in the hereafter the secretary of state called the names of the dead a morbid recitation designed to capture the gravity of the moment the sobbing increased then some more music the longest speech was delivered by the vice president fresh from the campaign trail and filled with a newly discovered commitment to eradicate terrorism from the face of the earth though hed never worn a military uniform he seemed eager to start tossing grenades lake had them all on the run lake watched the grim ceremony while flying from tucson to detroit late for another round of interviews on board was his pollster a newly acquired magician who now traveled with himwhile lake and his staff watched the news the pollster worked feverishly at the small conference table upon which he had two laptops three phones and more printouts than any ten people could digest the arizona and michigan primaries were three days away and lakes numbers were climbing especially in his home state where he was in a dead heat with the longestablished frontrunner governor tarry of indiana in michigan lake was ten points down but people were listening the fiasco in cairo was working beautifully in his favor governor tarry was suddenly scrambling for money aaron lake was not it was coming in faster than he could spend it when the vice president finally finished lake left the screen and returned to his leather swivel recliner and picked up a newspaper a staff member brought him coffee which he sipped while watching the flatlands of kansas eight miles below him another staff member handed him a messageone that wars supposed to require an urgent call from the candidate lake glanced around the plane and counted thirteen people pilots not included for a private man who still missed his wife lake was not adjusting well to the complete lads of privacy he moved with a group every half hour slotted by someone every action coordinated by a committee every interview preceded by written guesses about the questions and suggested responses he got six hours each night alone in his hotel room and damned if the secret service wouldnt sleep on the floor if hed allow it because of the fatigue he slept like an infant his only true moments of quiet reflection occurred in the bathroom either in the shower or on the toilet but he wasnt kidding himself he aaron lake quiet congressman from arizona had become an overnight sensation he was charging while the rest were faltering big money was aimed at him the press followed like bloodhounds his words got repeated he had very powerful friends and as the pieces were falling in place the nomination looked realistic he hadnt dreamed of such things a month earlier lake was savoring the moment the campaign was madness but he could control the tempo of the job itself reagan was a ninetofive president and hed been far more effective than carter an avid workaholic just get to the white house he told himself over and over suffer these fools gut it through the primaries endure with a smile and a quick wit and one day very soon hed sit in the oval office alone with the world at his feet and he would have his privacy teddy sat with york in his bunker watching the live scene from andrews air force base he preferred yorks company when things were rough the accusations had been brutal scapegoats were in demand and many of the idiots chasing the cameras blamed the cia because thats who they always blamed if they only knew hed finally toldyork of lufkins warnings and york understood completely unfortunately theyd been through this before when you police the world you lose a lot of cops and teddy andyork had shared many sad moments watching the flagcovered coffins roll off the cs evidence of another debacle abroad the lake campaign would be teddys final effort at saving american lives failure seemed unlikely dpac had collected more than million in two weeks and was in the process of hauling the money around washington twentyone congressmen had been recruited for lake endorsements at a total cost of million but the biggest prize so far was senator britt the excandidate the father of a little thai boy when he abandoned his quest for the white house he owed close to million with no viable plan to cover his deficit money tends not to follow those who pack up and go home elaine tyner the lawyer running dpac met with senator britt it took her less than an hour to cut the deal dpac would pay off all his campaign debts over a threeyear period and he would make a noisy endorsement of aaron lake did we have a projection of casualties york asked after a while teddy said no their conversations were never hurried why so many lots of booze happens all the time in the arab countries different culture life is dull so when our diplomats throw a party they throw a good one many of the dead were quite drunk minutes passed wheresyidal askedyork right now hes in iraqyesterdaytunisia we really should stop him we will next year itll be a great moment for president lake twelve of the sixteen congressmen endorsing lake wore blue shirts a fact that was not lost on elaine tyner she counted such things when a dc politician got near a camera odds were hed put on his best blue cotton shirt the other four wore white she arranged them before the reporters in a ballroom of the willard hotel the senior member representative thurman of florida opened things up by welcoming the press to this very important occasion working from prepared notes he offered his opinions on the current state of world events commented on things in cairo and china and russia and said that the world was a lot more dangerous than it looked he rattled off the usual statistics about our reduced military then he launched into a long soliloquy about his close friend aaron lake a man hed served with for ten years and whom he knew better than most lake was a man with a message one we didnt particularly want to hear but a very important one nonetheless thurman was breaking ranks with governor tarry and though he did so with great reluctance and no small feeling of betrayal he had become convinced through painful soulsearching that aaron lake was needed for the safety of our nation what thurman didnt say was that a recent poll showed lake becoming very popular back in tampast pete the mike was then passed to a congressman from california he covered no new territory but rambled for ten minutes anyway in his district north of san diego were fortyfive thousand defense and aerospace workers and all of them it seemed had written or called hed been an easy convert the pressure from home plus from ms tyner and dpac and he had his marching orders when the questions started the sixteen bunched together in a tight little pack all anxious to answer and say something all afraid their faces might not get wedged into the picture though there were no committee chairmen the group was not unimpressive they managed to convey the image that aaron lake was a legitimate candidate a man they knew and trusted a man the nation needed a man who could be elected the event was well staged and well covered and instantly made news elaine tyner would trot out five more the following day then save senator britt for the day before big super tuesday the letter in neds glove box was from percy young percy in rehab who got his mail through laurel ridge post office box atlantic beach fl ned was in atlantic beach had been for two days with the letter and with the determination to track down young percy because he smelled a hoax he had nothing better to do he was retired with plenty of money no family to speak of and besides it was snowing in cincinnati he had a room at the sea turtle inn on the beach and at night he hit the bars along atlantic boulevard hed found two excellent restaurants crowded little places with lots of young pretty girls and boys hed discovered petes bar and grill a block away and for the last two nights hed staggered from the place drunk on cold drafts the sea turtle was just around the corner during the day ned watched the post office a modern brick and glass government job on first street parallel to the beach a small windowless box midway from the floor was on a wall with eighty others in an area of medium traffic ned had inspected the box tried to open it with keys and wire and had even asked questions at the front desk the postal workers had been most unhelpful before leaving the first day he had stuck a twoinch strand of thin black thread to the bottom of the boxs door it was imperceptible to anyone else but ned would know if the mail was checked he had a letter in there in a bright red envelope one hed mailed three days earlier from cincinnati then raced south in it hed sent percy a check for money the boy needed for a set of artists supplies in an earlier letter ned had revealed that he had once owned a modern art gallery in greenwich village it was a lie he had not but he doubted everything percy said too ned had been suspicious from the beginning before he answered the solicitation he had tried to verify laurel ridge the fancy detox unit supposedly holding percy there was a telephone a private number hed been unable to pry out of directory assistance there was no street address percy had explained in his first letter that the place was topsecret because many of its patients were highpowered corporate executives and toplevel government officials all of whom had in one way or another succumbed to chemicals it sounded good the boy had a way with words and a very pretty face thats why ned kept writing the photo was something he admired every day the request for money had caught him by surprise and since he was bored he decided to make the drive to jacksonville from his spot in the parking lot low behind the steering wheel of his car with his back to first street he could watch the wall of boxes and the postal customers as they came and went it was a long shot but what the hell he used a small pair of foldable binoculars and on occasion caught a stare from someone walking by the task grew monotonous after two days but as the time passed he became more and more convinced that his letter would be retrieved surely someone checked the box at least once every three days a rehab clinic with patients would get plenty of mail wouldnt it or was it simply a front for a con man who dropped by once a week to check his traps the con man showed up late in the afternoon of the third day he parked a beetle next to ned then ambled into the post office he wore wrinkled khakis white shirt straw hat bow tie and had the disheveled air of a wouldbe beach bohemian trevor had enjoyed a long midday break at petes then slept off his liquid lunch with an hour nap at his desk and was just stirring about making his rounds he put the key in box and removed a handful of correspondence most of it junk mail which he threw away as he flipped through the letters on his way out of the building ned watched every move after three days of tedium he was thrilled that his surveillance had paid off he followed the beetle and when it parked and the driver walked into a small rundown law office ned drove away scratching his temple repeating out loud a lawyer he kept driving down highway ala along the shore away from the sprawl of jacksonville south through vilano beach and crescent beach and beverly beach and flagler beach and finally to a holiday inn outside port orange he went to the bar before he went to his room it wasnt the first scam hed flirted with in fact it was the second hed sniffed the other one out too before any damage was done over his third martini he swore it would be his last thirteen the day before the arizona and michigan primaries the lake campaign unleashed a media blitz the likes of which had never been seen before in presidential politics for eighteen hours the two states were bombarded with one ad after another some were fifteen seconds little softies with not much more than his handsome face and the promises of decisive leadership and a safer world others were oneminute documentaries on the dangers of the postcold war still others were macho inyourface promises to the terrorists of the worldkill people simply because they are americans and you will pay a very dear price cairo was still very fresh and the assurances hit their mark the ads were bold put together by highpowered consultants and the only downside was oversaturation but lake was too new to the scene to bore anyone not now anyway his campaign spent million on television in the two states a staggering amount they ran at a slower clip during voting hours on tuesday february and when the polls closed the exit analysts predicted lake would win his home state and run a close second in michigan governor tarry after all was from indiana another midwestern state and hed spent weeks in michigan during the previous three months evidently he hadnt spent enough time there the voters in arizona opted for their native son and those in michigan liked the new fellow too lake got percent at home and percent in michigan where governor tarry got a paltry percent the balance was divided among the noncontenders it was a devastating loss for governor tarry just two weeks before big super tuesday and three weeks before the little one lake watched the vote counting from on board his airplane en route from phoenix whered hed voted for himself an hour from washington cnn declared him the surprise winner in michigan and his staff opened the champagne he savored the moment even allowed himself two glasses history was not lost on lake no one had ever started so late and come so far so fast in the darkened cabin they watched the analysts on four screens the experts all marveling at this man lake and what hed done governor tarry was gracious but also worried about the enormous sums of money being spent by his heretofore unknown opponent lake chatted politely with the small group of reporters waiting for him at reagan national airport then rode in another black suburban to his national campaign headquarters where he thanked his yet highly paid staff and told them to go home and get some sleep it was almost midnight when he got to georgetown to his quaint little rowhouse on thirtyfourth near wisconsin two secret service agents got out of the car behind lake and two more were waiting on the front steps he had adamantly refused an official request to put guards inside his home i do not want to see you people lurking around here he said harshly at his front door he resented their presence didnt know their names and didnt care if they disliked him they had no names as far as he was concerned they were simply you people said with as much contempt as possible once he was locked inside he went upstairs to his bedroom and changed clothes he turned out the lights as if he were asleep waited fifteen minutes then eased downstairs to the den to see if anyone was looking in then down another flight to the small basement he climbed through a window and stepped into the cold night near his tiny patio he paused listened heard nothing then quietly opened a wooden gate and darted between the two buildings behind his he surfaced on thirtyfifth street alone in the dark dressed like a jogger with a running cap pulled low to his brow three minutes later he was on m street in the crowds he found a taxi and disappeared into the night teddy maynard had gone to sleep reasonably content with his candidates first two victories but he was awakened by the news that something had gone wrong when he rolled himself into the bunker at ten minutes after am he was more frightened than angry though his emotions had run the gamut in the past hour york was waiting along with a supervisor named deville a tiny nervous man whod obviously been wired for many hours lets hear it teddy growled still rolling and looking for coffee deville did the talking at twelveotwo this morning he said goodbye to the secret service and entered his house at twelveseventeen he exited through a small window in the basement we of course have wires and timers on every door and window weve leased a rowhouse across the street and we were on alert anyway he hasnt been home in six days deville waved a small pill the size of an aspirin this is a little device known as a tdec theyre in the soles of all of his shoes including his jogging shoes so if hes not barefoot we know where he is once pressure is applied from the foot the bug emits a signal that is broadcast for two hundred yards without a transmitter when pressure is relaxed it will continue to provide a signal for fifteen minutes we scrambled and picked him up on m street he was dressed in sweats with a cap over his eyes we had two cars in place when he jumped in a cab we followed him to chevy chase to a suburban shopping center while the cab waited he darted into a place called mailbox america one of these new places where you can send and receive mail outside the postal service some including this one are open twentyfour hours for mail pickup he was inside for less than a minute just long enough to open his box with a key remove several pieces of mail throw it all away then return to the cab one of our cars followed him back to m street where he got out and sneaked back home the other car stayed at the mailbox place we went through the waste can just inside the door and found six pieces of junk mail evidently his the address is al konyers box mailbox america western avenue chevy chase so he didnt find what he was looking for teddy asked it looks as though he tossed everything he took from his box heres the video a screen dropped from the ceiling as the lights faded footage from a video camera zoomed across a parking lot past the cab and onto the figure of aaron lake in his baggy sweats as he disappeared around a corner inside mailbox america seconds later he reappeared flipping through letters and papers in his right hand he stopped briefly at the door and then dumped everything in a tall wastebasket what the hells he looking for teddy mumbled to himself lake left the building and quickly ducked inside the cab the video stopped the lights became brighter deville resumed his narrative were confident we found the right papers in the trash can we were there within seconds and no one else entered the premises while we waited the time was twelve fiftyeight an hour later we entered again and keyed the lock to box so well have access anytime we need it check it every day teddy said inventory every piece of mail leave the junk but when something arrives i want to know it you got it mr lake reentered the basement window at one twentytwo and stayed at home for the rest of the night hes there now thats all teddy said and deville left the room a minute passed as teddy stirred his coffee how many addresses does he have york knew the question was coming he glanced at some notes he gets most of his personal mail at his home in georgetown he has at least two addresses on capitol hill one at his office the other at the armed services committee he has three offices back home in arizona thats six that we know about why would he need a seventh i dont know the reason but it cant be good a man who has nothing to hide does not use an alias or a secret address when did he rent the box were still working on that maybe he rented the box after he decided to enter the race hes got the cia doing his thinking for him so maybe he figures were watching everything too and he figures he might need a little privacy thus the box maybe its a girlfriend we missed somehow maybe he likes dirty magazines or videos something that is shipped through the mail after a long pauseyork said could be what if the box was rented months ago long before he entered the race then hes not hiding from us hes hiding from the world and his secret is truly dreadful they silently contemplated the dreadfulness of lakes secret neither wanting to venture a guess they decided to step up surveillance even more and to check the mailbox twice a day lake would be leaving town in a matter of hours off to do battle in other primaries and they would have the box to themselves unless someone else was also checking it for him aaron lake was the man of the hour in washington from his office on capitol hill he graciously granted live interviews to the early morning news programs he received senators and other members of congress friends and former enemies alike all bearing tidings of great joy and congratulations he had lunch with his campaign staff and followed it with long meetings on strategy after a quick dinner with elaine tyner who brought wonderful news of tons of new cash over at dpac he left the city and flew to syracuse to make plans for the newyork primary a large crowd welcomed him he was after all now the frontrunner fourteen the hangovers were becoming more frequent and as trevor opened his eyes for another day he told himself that he simply had to get a grip you cant lay out at petes every night drinking cheap longnecks with coeds watching meaningless basketball games just because youve got a thousand bucks on them last night it had been logan state and somebody some team with green uniforms who the hell cared about logan state joe roy spicer thats who spicer put on them trevor backed it up with a thousand of his own and logan won it for them in the past week spicer had picked ten out of twelve winners he was up in real cash and trevor happily following along was up for himself his gambling was proving to be much more profitable than his lawyering and someone else was picking the winners he went to the bathroom and splashed water on his face without looking at the mirror the toilet was still clogged from the day before and as he stomped around his dirty little house looking for a plunger the phone rang it was a wife from a previous life a woman he loathed and one who loathed him and when he heard her voice he knew she needed money he said no angrily and got in the shower things were worse at the office a divorcing couple had arrived in separate cars to finish the negotiations for their property settlement the assets they were fighting over were of no consequence to anyone elsepots pans a toasterbut since they had nothing they had to fight over something the fights are nastiest when the stakes are smallest their lawyer was an hour late anal they had used the time to simmer and boil until finally jan had separated them the wife was parked in trevors office when he stumbled in from the back door where the hell you been she demanded loud enough for husband to hear up front husband charged down the hall past jan who did not give chase and burst into trevors small office weve been waiting for an hour he announced shut up both of you trevor screamed and jan left the building his clients were stunned at the volume sit down he screamed again and they fell into the only empty chairs you people pay five hundred bucks for a lousy divorce and you think you own the place they looked at his red eyes and red face and decided this was not a man to mess with the phone started ringing and no one answered it nausea hit again and trevor bolted out of his office and across the hall to the bathroom where he puked as quietly as possible the toilet failed to flush the little metal chain clinking harmlessly inside the tank the phone was still ringing he staggered down the hall to fire jan and when he couldnt find her he left the building too he walked to the beach took off his shoes and socks and splashed his feet in the cool salt water two hours later trevor sat motionless at his desk door locked to keep out clients bare feet on the desk with sand still wedged between the toes he needed a nap and he needed a drink and he stared at the ceiling trying to organize his priorities the phone rang this time duly answered by jan who was still employed but secretly checking want ads it was brayshears in the bahamas we have a wire sir he said trevor was instantly on his feet how much a hundred thousand sir trevor glanced at his watch he had about an hour to catch a flight can you see me at threethirty he asked certainly sir he hung up and yelled toward the front cancel my appointments for today and tomorrow im leaving you dont have any appointments jan yelled back youre losing money faster than ever he wouldnt bicker he slammed the back door and drove away the flight to nassau stopped first in fort lauderdale though trevor hardly knew it after two quick beers he was sound asleeptwo more over the atlantic and a flight attendant had to wake him when the plane was empty the wire was from curtis in dallas as expected it was remitted by a texas bank payable to boomer realty care of geneva trust bank nassau trevor raked his one third off the top again hiding in his own secret account and taking in cash he thanked mr brayshears said he hoped to see him soon and staggered out of the building the thought of going home had not crossed his mind he headed for the shopping district where packs of heavy american tourists choked the sidewalks he needed shorts and a straw hat and a bottle of sunscreen trevor eventually made it to the beach where he found a room in a nice hotel a night but what did he care he lathered himself in oil and stretched out by the pool close enough to the bar a waitress in a thong fetched him drinks he woke up after dark sufficiently cooked but not burned a security guard escorted him to his room where he fell on the bed and returned to his coma the sun was up again before he moved after such a long period of rest he awoke surprisingly clearheaded and very hungry he ate some fruit and went looking for sailboats not exactly shopping for one but paying close attention to the details a thirtyfooter would be sufficient just large enough to live on yet manageable by a crew of one there would be no passengers just the lonely skipper hopping from island to island the cheapest one he found was and it needed some work noon found him back at the pool with a cell phone trying to placate a client or two but his heart wasnt in it the same waitress brought another drink off the phone he hid behind dark sunshades and tried to crunch the numbers but things were wonderfully dull between his ears in the past month hed earned about in taxfree graft could the pace continue if so hed have his million bucks in a year and he could abandon his office and what was left of his career and he could buy his little boat and hit the sea for the first time ever the dream almost seemed real he could see himself at the wheel shirtless shoeless cold beer at the ready gliding across the water from st barts to st kitts from nevis to st lucia from one island to a thousand others wind popping his mainsail not a damned thing in the world to worry about he closed his eyes and longed even harder for an escape his snoring woke him the thong was nearby he ordered some rum and checked his watch two days later trevor finally made it back to trumble he arrived with mixed feelings first he was quite anxious to pick up the mail and facilitate the scam anxious to keep the extortion going and the money rolling in on the other hand he was tardy and judge spicer would not be happy where the hell you been spicer growled at him as soon as the guard left the attorneyconference room it seemed to be the standard question these days ive missed three games because of you and i picked nothing but winners the bahamas we got a hundred thousand from curtis in dallas spicers mood changed dramatically it took three days to check on a wire in the bahamas he asked i needed a little rest didnt know i was supposed to visit this place every day spicer was mellowing by the second hed just picked up another it was safely tucked away with his other loot in a place no one could find and as he handed the lawyer yet another stack of pretty envelopes he was thinking of ways to spend the money arent we busy trevor said taking the letters any complaints youre making more than we are i have more to lose than you do spicer handed over a sheet of paper ive picked ten games here five hundred bucks on each great thought trevor another long weekend at petes watching one game after another oh well there could be worse thingsthey played blackjack at a dollar a hand until the guard broke up the meeting trevors increased visits had been discussed by the warden and the higherups at the bureau of prisons in washington paperwork had been created on the subject restrictions had been contemplated but then abandoned the visits were useless and besides the warden didnt want to alienate the brethren why pick a fight the lawyer was harmless after a few phone calls around jacksonville they decided that trevor was basically unknown and probably had nothing better to do than hang out in the attorneyconference room of a prison the money gave new life to beech and yarber spending it would necessarily entail getting to it and that would require they one day walk away as free men free to do whatever they wanted with their growing fortunes with or so now in the bank yarber was busy plotting an investment portfolio no sense letting it sit there at percent per annum even if it was taxfree one day very soon hed roll it over into aggressive growth finds with emphasis on the far east asia would boom again and his little pile of dirty money would be there to share in the wealth he had five years to go and if he earned between and percent on his money until then the would grow to roughly by the time he left trumble not a bad start for a man who would be sixtyfive and hopefully still in good health but if he and percy and ricky could keep adding to the principal he might indeed be rich when they turned him loose five lousy yearsmonths and weeks hed been dreading now he was suddenly wondering if he had enough time to extort all he needed as percy he was writing letters to over twenty pen pals across north america no two were in the same town it was spicers job to keep the victims separated maps were being used in the law library to make certain neither percy nor ricky was corresponding with men who appeared to live near one another when he wasnt writing lettersyarber caught himself thinking about the money thankfully the divorce papers from his wife had come and gone hed be officially single in a few months and by the time he was paroled shed have long since forgotten about him nothing would be shared hed be flee to walk away without a single string attached five years and he had so much work to do hed cut out the sugar and walk an extra mile each day in the darkness of his top bunk during sleepless nights hadee beech had done the same math as his colleagues fifty thousand dollars in hand a healthy rate of return somewhere add to the principal by squeezing from as many victims as they could catch and one day thered be a fortune beech had nine years a marathon that once seemed endless now there was a flicker of hope the death sentence theyd handed him was slowly becoming a timeof harvest conservatively if the scam netted him only a year for the next nine years plus a healthy rate of return then hed be a multimillionaire when he danced through the gates also at the age of sixtyfive two three four million was not out of the question he knew exactly what hed do since he loved texas hed go to galveston and buy one of those ancient victorians near the sea and hed invite old friends to stop by and see how rich he was forget the law hed put in twelvehour days working the money nothing but work nothing but money so that by the time he was seventy hed have more than his exwife for the first time in years hadee beech thought he might live to see sixtyfive maybe seventy he too gave up sugar and butter and he cut his cigarettes in half with the goal of going cold turkey real soon he vowed to stay away from the infirmary and stop taking pills he began walking a mile every day in the sun like his colleague from california and he wrote his letters he and ricky and justice spicer already equipped with sufficient motivation was finding it difficult to sleep he wasnt plagued by guilt or loneliness or humiliation nor was he depressed by the indignity of prison he was simply counting money and juggling rates of return and analyzing point spreads with twentyone months to go he could see the end his lovely wife rita had passed through the week before and theyd spent four hours together over two days shed cut her hair stopped drinking and lost eighteen pounds and she promised to be even skinnier when she picked him up at the front gate in less than two yearsafter four hours with her joe roy was convinced the was still buried behind the toolshed theyd move to vegas buy a new condo and say to hell with the rest of the world with the percyandricky scam working so well spicer had found a new worry hed leave trumble first happily gladly without looking back but what about the money to be made after he was gone if the scam was still printing money what would happen to his share of the future earnings money he was clearly entitled to it had been after all his idea one hed borrowed from the prison in louisiana beech and yarber had been reluctant conspirators at first he had time to devise an exit strategy just as he had time to contrive a way to get rid of the lawyer but it would cost him some sleep the letter from quince garbe in iowa was read by beech dear ricky or whoever the hell you are i dont have any more money the first was borrowed from a bank using a bogus financial statement im not sure how ill pay it back my father owns our bank and all its money why dont you write him some letters you thug i can possibly scrape together if we can agree that the extortion will stop there im on the verge of suicide so dont push youre scum you know that i hope you get caught sincerely quince garbe sounds pretty desperate yarber said looking up from his own pile of mail spicer said toothpick hanging from his bottom lip tell him well take twentyfive thousand ill write him and tell him to wire it beech said opening another envelope addressed to ricky fifteen during lunch when experience had shown that traffic picked up somewhat at mailbox america an agent nonchalantly entered the place behind two other customers and for the second time that day placed a key in box lying on top of three pieces of junk mailone from a pizza carryout one from a car wash one from the us postal servicehe noticed something new it was an envelope light orange in color five by eight with a pair of tweezers he kept on his key ring he clamped the end of the envelope slid it quickly from the box and dropped it in a small leather briefcase the junk mail was left undisturbed at langley it was carefitlly opened by experts two handwritten pages were removed and copied an hour later deville entered teddys bunker holding a file deville was in charge of what was commonly referred to deep inside langley as the lake mess he gave copies of the letter to teddy and york then scanned it to a large screen where teddy and york at first just stared at it the printing was bold inblock form easily readable as if the author had labored over each word it read dear al where you been did you get my last letter i wrote three weeks ago and i havent heard a word i guess youre busy but please dont forget about me i get very lonely here and your letters have always inspired me to keep going they give me strength and hope because i know somebody out there cares please dont give up on me al my counselor says that i might be released in two months theres a halfway house in baltimore actually a few miles from where i grew up and the people here are trying to get me a spot there it would be for ninety days enough time for me to find a job some friends etc you know get used to society again its a lockdown place at night but id be free during the day there arent many good memories al every person who ever loved me is now dead and my uncle the guy whos paying for this rehab is very rich but very cruel i need friends so desperately al by the way ive lost another five pounds and my waist is now a thirtytwo the photo i sent you is getting outdated ive never liked the way my face looks in ittoo much flesh on the cheeks im much leaner now and tanned they let us tan for up to two hours a day here weather permitting its florida but some days are too cool ill send you another photo maybe one fiiom the chest up im lifting weights like crazy i think youll like the next photo you said you would send me one of you im still waiting please dont forget me al i need one of your letters love ricky since york had had the responsibility of investigating every aspect of lakes life he felt compelled to try and speak first but he could think of nothing to say they read the letter in silence again and again finally deville broke the ice by saying heres the envelope he flashed it on the wall it was addressed to mr al konyers at mailbox america the return address was ricky aladdin north po box neptune beach fl its a front deville said theres no such place as aladdin north theres a telephone number and you get an answering service weve called ten times with questions but the operators know nothing weve called every rehab and treatment clinic in north florida and no ones heard of this place teddy was silent still staring at the wall wheres neptune beach york grunted jacksonville deville was excused but told to stand by teddy began making notes on a green legal pad there are other letters and at least one photo he said as if the problem were just part of the routine panic was a state unknown to teddy maynard we have to find them he said weve done two thorough searches of his home york said then do a third i doubt if he would keep such stuff at his office how soon do it now lake is in california looking for votes we have no time on thisyork there may be other secret boxes other men writing letters and bragging about their tans and waistlines do you confront him not yet since they had no sample of mr konyers handwriting deville made a suggestion that teddy eventually liked they would use the ruse of a new laptop one with a builtin printer the first draft was composed by deville andyork and after an hour or so the fourth draft read as follows dear ricky i got your letter of the twentysecond forgive me for not writing sooner ive been on the road a lot lately and im behind on everything in fact im writing this letter at thirtyfive thousand feet somewhere over the gulf en route to tampa and im using a new laptop one so small it almost fits in my pocket amazing technology the printer leaves something to be desired i hope you can read it okay wonderful news about your release and the halfway house in baltimore i have some business interests there and im sure i can help you find a job keep your head up only two months to go youre a much stronger person now and youre ready to live life to its fullest dont be discouraged ill help in any way possiblewhen you get to baltimore ill be happy to spend some time with you show you around you know i promise ill write sooner i cant wait to hear from you love al they decided al was in a hurry and forgot to sign his name the letter was marked up revised redrafted pored over with more care than a treaty the final version was printed on a piece of stationery from the royal sonesta hotel in new orleans and placed in a thick plain brown envelope with optic wiring hidden along the bottom edge in the lower righthand corner in a spot that looked as if it had been slightly damaged and knotted in transit a tiny transmitter the size of a pinhead was installed when activated it would send a signal a hundred yards for up to three days since al was traveling to tampa the envelope was stamped with a tampa postmark dated that day this was done in less than half an hour by a team of very strange people down in documents on the second floor at pm a green van with many miles on it stopped at the curb in front of aaron lakes townhouse near one of the many shade trees on thirtyfourth in a lovely section of georgetown its door advertised a plumbing company in the district four plumbers got out and began removing tools and equipment after a few minutes the only neighbor whod noticed grew bored and returned to her television with lake in california the secret service was with him and his home had yet to qualify for roundtheclock surveillance at least by the secret service that scrutiny would come quickly though the ploy was a clogged sewer line in the small front lawn something that could be done without entering the home an outside job one that would pacify the secret service in case they happened to drop by but two of the plumbers did indeed enter the home with their own keys another van stopped by to check on progress and to drop off a tool two plumbers from the second van mixed with those already there and a regular unit began to form inside the house four of the agents began their tedious search for hidden files they moved from room to room inspecting the obvious prying for the secrets the second van left and a third one came from the other direction and parked with its tires on the sidewalk as service vans often do four more plumbers joined the sewer cleaning and two eventually drifted inside after dark a spotlight was rigged in the front yard over the sewer cover and directed into the home so the lights inside would not be noticed the four men left outside sipped coffee and told jokes and tried to stay warm neighbors hurried by on foot after six hours the sewer was clean as was the home nothing unusual was found certainly no hidden file with correspondence from one ricky in rehab no sign of a photo the plumbers turned off their lights packed their tools and disappeared without a trace at eightthirty the next morning when the doors opened at the neptune beach post office an agent named barr walked hurriedly in as if he were late for something barr was an expert on locks and keys and hed spent five hours the previous afternoon at langley studying various boxes used by the postal service he had four master keys one of which he was certain would open number if not hed be forced to key it which might take sixty seconds or so and could possibly draw attention the third key worked and barr placed the brown envelope postmarked the day before from tampa addressed to ricky with no last name care ofaladdin north inside the box there were two other letters already there for good measure he removed a piece of junk mail then closed the door to the box wadded up the mail and threw it in the wastebasket barr and two others waited patiently in a van in the parking lot sipping coffee and videoing every postal customer they were seventy yards away from the box their handheld receiver beeped with the faint signal from the envelope a diverse group came and went with the flow black female in a short brown dress a white male with a beard and leather jacket a white female in a jogging suit a black male in jeansall agents of the cia all watching the box without a clue about who wrote the letter or where it was going their job was simply to find the person whod rented the box they found him after lunch trevor drank his lunch at petes but only two beers cold drafts with salty peanuts fiorn the community bowl consumed while losing fifty bucks on a dogsled race in calgary back at the office he napped for an hour snoring so loudly his longsuffering secretary finally had to close his door she slammed it actually but not loud enough to wake him dreaming of sailboats he made his trek to the post office this time choosing to walk because the day was beautiful he had nothing better to do and his head needed clearing he was delighted to find four of the little treasures angled neatly in aladdin norths box he placed them carefully in the pocket of his wellworn seersucker jacket straightened his bow tie and ambled forth certain that another payday was fast approaching hed never been tempted to read the letters let the brethren do the dirty work he could keep his hands clean shuttle the mail rake his third off the top and besides spicer would kill him if he delivered mail that had been tampered with seven agents watched him stroll back to his office teddy was napping in his wheelchair when deville entered york had gone home it was after pm york had a wife teddy did not deville delivered his narrative while referring to pages of scribbled notes the letter was removed from the box at onefifty pm by a local lawyer named trevor carson we followed him to his office in neptune beach where he stayed for eighty minutes its a small oneman office one secretary not a lot of clients carson is a smalltimer along the beaches does divorces real estate twobit stuff hes fortyeight divorced at least twice native of pennsylvania college at furman law school at florida state got his license suspended eleven years ago for commingling client funds then got it back all right all right teddy said at threethirty he left his office drove an hour to the federal prison at trumble florida took the letters with him we followed but lost the signal when he entered the prison since then weve gathered some information about trumble its a minimumsecurity prison commonly referred to as a camp no walls or fences very low risk inmates a thousand of them at trumble according to a source within the bureau of prisons here in washington carson visits all the time no other lawyer no other person visits as much as carson up until a month ago he went once a week now its at least three times a week sometimes four all visits are official attorneyclient conferences who is his client its not ricky he is the attorney of record for three judges three judges yes three judges in prison thats rightthey call themselves the brethren teddy closed his eyes and rubbed his temples deville let things sink in for a moment then continued carson was in the prison for fiftyfour minutes and when he exited we could not pick up the signal from the envelope by this time we were parked next to his car he walked within five feet of our receiver and were certain he did not have the letter we followed him back to jacksonville back to the beaches he parked near a place called petes bar and grill where he stayed for three hours we searched his car found his briefcase and inside there were eight letters addressed to various men all over the country all letters were outbound from the prison none were inbound evidently carson shuttles mail back and forth to his clients as of thirty minutes ago he was still in the bar quite drunk betting on college basketball games a loser very much so the loser staggered out of petes after the second overtime of a game on the west coast spicer had picked three out of four winners trevor had dutifully followed suit and was up a thousand bucks for the night drunk as he was he was smart enough not to drive his dui three years earlier was still a painful memory and besides the damned cops were all over the place the restaurants and bars around the sea turtle inn attracted the young and restless thus the cops walking was a challenge though he made it well enough to his office a straight shot south past the quiet little summer rentals and retirement cottages all dark and tucked in for the night he carried his briefcase with the letters from trumble he pressed onward searching for his house he crossed the street for no reason and half a block later recrossed it there was no traffic when he began to circle back he came within twenty yards of an agent whod ducked behind a parked car the silent army watched him suddenly fearful that the drunken fool might stumble into one of them at some point he gave up and managed to find his office again he rattled keys on the front steps dropped his briefcase and forgot about it and less than a minute after opening the door he was at his desk sprawled in his swivel rocker fast asleep the front door half open the back door had been unlocked throughout the night following orders from langley barr and company had entered the office and wired everything there was no alarm system no locks on the windows nothing of value to attract thievery in the first place tapping the phones and bugging the walls had been an easy task made so by the obvious fact that no one on the outside observed anything inside the offices of l trevor carson attorney and counseloratlaw the briefcase was emptied its contents cataloged at langleys instructions langley wanted a precise record of the letters the lawyer had taken from trumble when everything had been inspected and photographed the briefcase was placed in the hallway near his office the snoring was impressive and uninterrupted shortly before barr managed to start the beetle parked near petes he drove it down the empty street and left it innocently on the curb in front of the law office so that the drunk would rub his eyes in a few hours and pat himself on the back for such a nice job of driving or maybe he would shrink in horror at the thought of having driven while intoxicated once again either way theyd be listening sixteen thirtyseven hours before the polls opened in virginia and washington the president appeared live on national television to announce that he had ordered an air attack in and around the tunisian city of talah the yidal terrorist unit was believed to train there in a wellstocked compound on the edge of town and so the country became glued to yet another miniwar one of pushbuttons and smart bombs and retired generals on cnn prattling on about this strategy or that it was dark in tunisia thus no footage the retired generals and their clueless interviewers did a lot of guessing and waiting waiting for sunlight so the smoke and rubble could be broadcast to a jaded nation but yidal had its sources most likely the israelis the compound was empty when the smart bombs dropped in from nowhere they hit their targets shook the desert destroyed the compound but killed not a single terrorist a couple strayed however one venturing into the center oftalah where it hit a hospital another hit a small house where a family of seven was fast asleep fortunately they never knew what happened tunisian television was quick to cover the burning hospital and at daybreak on the east coast the country learned that the smart bombs werent so smart after all at least fifty bodies had been recovered all very innocent civilians at some point during the early morning the president developed a sudden uncharacteristic aversion to reporters and could not be reached for comment the vice president a man whod said plenty when the attack started was in seclusion with his staff somewhere in washington the bodies piled up the cameras kept rolling and by midmorning world reaction was swift brutal and unanimous the chinese were threatening war the french seemed inclined to join them even the brits said the united states was triggerhappy since the dead were nothing more than tunisian peasants certainly not americans the politicians were quick to politicize the debacle the usual fingerpointing and grandstanding and calls for investigations happened before noon in washington and on the campaign circuit those still in the race took a few moments to reflect on just how illfated the mission had been none of them would have engaged in such desperate retaliation without better intelligence none but the vice president who was still in seclusion as the bodies were being counted not a single candidate thought the raid was worthy of the risks all condemned the president but it was aaron lake who attracted the most attention he found it difficult to move without tripping over cameramen in a carefully worded statement he said without notes we are inept we are helpless we are feeble we should be ashamed of our inability to wipe out a ragtag little army of less than fifty cowardsyou cannot simply push buttons and run for cover it takes guts to fight wars on the ground i have the guts when i am president no terrorist with american blood on his hands will be safe that is my solemn promise in the fury and chaos of the morning lakes words found their mark here was a man who meant what he said who knew precisely what he would do we wouldnt slaughter innocent peasants if a man with guts were making the decisions lake was the man in the bunker teddy weathered another storm bad intelligence was blamed for every disaster when the raids were successful the pilots and the brave boys on the ground and their commanders and the politicians who sent them into battle got the credit but when the raids went wrong as they usually did the cia got the blame he had advised against the attack the israelis had a tenuous and very secret agreement with yidaldont kill us and we wont kill you as long as the targets were americans and an occasional european then the israelis would not get involved teddy knew this but it was information he had not shared twentyfour hours before the attack he had advised the president in writing that he doubted the terrorists would be in the compound when the bombs arrived and because of the targets proximity to talah there was an excellent chance of collateral damage hatlee beech opened the brown envelope without noticing that the right lower corner was somewhat wadded and slightly damaged he was opening so many personal envelopes these days he looked only at the return address to see who and where they came from nor did he notice the tampa postmark he hadnt heard from al konyers in several weeks he read the letter through without stopping and found little if no interest in the fact that al was using a new laptop it was perfectly believable that rickys pen pal had taken a sheet of stationery from the royal sonesta in new orleans and was pecking out the letter at thirtyfive thousand feet wonder if he was flying first class he asked himself probably so they wouldnt have computer hookups back in coach would they al had been in new orleans on business stayed at a very nice hotel then flew first class to his next destination the brethren were interested in the financial conditions of all their pen pals nothing else mattered after he read the letter he handed it to finnyarber who was in the process of writing another one as poor percy they were working in the small conference room in the corner of the law library their table littered with files and mail and a pretty assortment of soft pastel correspondence cards spicer was outside at his table guarding the door and studying point spreads whos konyers finn asked beech was flipping through some files they kept a neat folder on every pen pal complete with the letters they received and copies of all letters theyd sent dont know much beech said lives in the dc area fake name im sure uses one of those mailbox services thats his third letter i think from the konyers file beech pulled out the first two letters the one from december read dear ricky hello my name is al konyers im in my fiftiesi like jazz old movies humphrey bogart and i like to read biographies i dont smoke and dont like people who do fun is chinese takeout a little wine a blackandwhite western with a good friend drop me a line al konyers it was typewritten on plain white paper the way most of them were at first fear was stamped between every linefear of getting caught fear of starting a longdistance relationship with a complete stranger every letter of every word was typewritten he didnt even sign his name rickys first response was the standard letter beech had written a hundred times now rickys twentyeight in rehab bad family rich uncle etc and dozens of the same enthusiastic questions what kind of work do you do how about your family do you like to travel if ricky could bare his soul then he needed something in return two pages of the same crap beech had been writing for five months he wanted so desperately to simply xerox the damned thing but he couldnt he was forced to personalize each one on nice pretty paper and he sent al the same handsome photo hed sent to the others the picture was the bait that hooked almost all of them three weeks passed on january trevor had delivered a second letter from al konyers it was as clean and sterile as the first probably typed with rubber gloves dear ricky i enjoyed your letter i have to admit i felt sorry for you at first but you seem to have adjusted well to rehab and know where youre going ive never had problems with drugs and alcohol so its difficult for me to understand it sounds as though youre getting the best treatment money can buy you shouldnt be so harsh on your uncle think of where you might be if not for him you ask many questions about me im not ready to discuss a lot of personal matters but i understand your curiosity i was married for thirty years but not anymore i live in dc and work for the government my job is challenging and fulfilling i live alone i have few close friends and prefer it that way when i travel its usually to asia i adore tokyo ill keep you in my thoughts in the days to come al konyers just above the typewritten name hed scribbled the name al with a blackfelt pen fine point the letter was most unimpressive for three reasons first konyers did not have a wife or at least he said he didnt a wife was crucial for extortion threaten to tell the wife to send her copies of all the letters from the gay pen pal and the money rolled in second al worked for the government so he probably didnt have a lot of money third al was much too scared to waste time with getting information was like pulling teeth the quince garbes and curtis cateses were much more fun because theyd spent their lives in the closet and were now anxious to escape their letters were long and windy and filled with all the damning little facts an extortionist might need not al al was boring al wasnt sure what he wanted so ricky raised the stakes with his second letter another piece of boilerplate beech had perfected with practice ricky had just learned that he would be released in a few months and he was from baltimore what a coincidence and he might need some help getting a job his rich uncle was refusing to help anymore he was afraid of life on the outside without the help of friends and he really couldnt trust his old friends because they were still on drugs etc etc the letter went unanswered and beech assumed that al konyers was frightened by it ricky was on his way to baltimore just an hour from washington and that was too close for al while waiting for an answer from al the quince garbe money landed followed by the wire from curtis in dallas and the brethren found renewed energy in their scam ricky wrote al the letter that was intercepted and analyzed at langley now suddenly als third letter had a very different tone finnyarber read it twice then reread the second letter from al sounds like a different person doesnt it he said yes it does beech said looking at both letters i think the old boy is finally excited about meeting ricky i thought he worked for the government says he does then whats this about having business interests in baltimore we worked for the government didnt we sure what was your highest salary on the bench when i was chief justice i made a hundred and fifty thousand i made a hundred and forty some of those professional bureaucrats make more than that plus hes not married thats a problem yeah but lets keep pushing hes got a big job which means hes got a big boss lots of colleagues typical washington hotshot well find a pressure point somewhere what the hell finn said what the hell indeed what was there to lose so what if they pushed a little too hard and mr al got scared or got mad and decided to throw the letters awayyou cant lose what you dont have serious money was being made here it was not a time to be timid their aggressive tactics were producing spectacular results the mail was growing each week as was their offshore account their scam was foolproof because their pen pals lived double lives their victims had no one to complain to negotiations were quick because the market was ripe it was still winter in jacksonville and because the nights were chilly and the ocean was too cool to swim in the busy season was a month away there were hundreds of small rentals available along neptune beach and atlantic beach including one almost directly across the street from trevor a man from boston offered cash for two months and the real estate agent snatched it the place was furnished with odds and ends no flea market would handle the old shag carpet was well worn and emitted a permanent musty smell it was perfect the renters first chore was to cover the windows three of them faced the street and looked across to trevors and during the first few hours of surveillance it became obvious how few clients came and went there was so little business over there when work surfaced it was usually done by the secretary jan who also read a lot of magazines others quietly moved into the rental men and women with old suitcases and large duffel bags filled with electronic wizardry the fragile furnishings were shoved to the rear of the cottage and the front rooms were quickly filled with screens and monitors and listening devices of a dozen varieties trevor himself would make an interesting case study for thirdyear law students he arrived around am and spent the first hour reading newspapers his morning client seemed to always arrive at tenthirty and after an exhaustive halfhour conference he was ready for lunch always at petes bar and grill he carried a phone with him to prove his importance to the bartenders there and he usually made two or three unnecessary calls to other lawyers he called his bookie a lot then he walked back to his office past the rental where the cia monitored every step back to his desk where it was time for a nap he came to life around three and hit it hard for two hours by then he needed another longneck from petes the second time they followed him to trumble he left the prison after an hour and returned to his office about pm while he was having dinner in an oyster bar on atlantic boulevard alone an agent entered his office and found his old briefcase in it were five letters from percy and ricky the commander of the silent army in and around neptune beach was a man named klockner the best teddy had in the field of domestic street spying klockner had been instructed to intercept all mail flowing through the law office when trevor went straight home after leaving the oyster bar the five letters were taken across the street to the rental where they were opened copied then resealed and replaced in trevors briefcase none of the five was for al konyers at langley deville read the five letters as they came off the fax they were examined by two handwriting experts who agreed that percy and ricky were not the same people using samples taken from their court files it was determined without much effort that percy was really former justice finn yarber and that ricky was former us district judge hadee beech rickys address was the aladdin north box at the neptune beach post office percy to their surprise used a postal box in atlantic beach one rented to an outfit called laurel ridge seventeen for his next visit to langley the first in three weeks the candidate arrived in a caravan of shiny black vans all going too fast but who would complain they were cleared and waved onward deeper into the complex until they roared to a collective stop near a very convenient door where all sorts of grimfaced thicknecked young men were waiting lake rode the wave into the building losing escorts a she went until finally he arrived not at the usual bunker but in mr ivlaynards formal office with a view of a small forest everyone else was left at the door alone the two great men shook hands warmly and actually appeared happy to see one another important things first congratulations on virginia teddy said lake shrugged as if he wasnt sure thank you in more ways than one its a very impressive win mr lake teddy said governor tarry worked hard there for a year two months ago he had commitments from every precinct captain in the state he looked unbeatable now ithink hes fading fast its often a disadvantage to be the frontrunner early in the race momentum is a strange animal in politics lake observed wisely cash is even stranger right now governor tarry cant find a dime because youve got it all money follows momentum im sure ill say this many times mr maynard but well thanks youve given me an opportunity id hardly dreamed of are you having any fun not yet if we win the fun will come later the fun starts next tuesday mr lake with big super tuesday new york california massachusetts ohio georgia missouri maryland maine connecticut all in one day almost six hundred delegates teddys eyes were dancing as if he could almost count the votes and youre ahead in every state mr lake can you believe it no i cannot its trueyoure neck and neck in maine for some damned reason and its close in california but youre going to win big next tuesday if you believe the polls lake said as if he didnt trust them himself fact was like every candidate lake was addicted to the polls he was actually gaining in california a state with defense workers oh i believe them and i believe that a landslide is coming on little super tuesday they love you down south mr lake they love guns and tough talk and such and right now theyre falling in love with aaron lake next tuesday will be fun but the following tuesday will be a romp teddy maynard was predicting a romp and lake couldnt help but smile his polls showed the same trends but it just sounded better coming from teddy he lifted a sheet of paper and read the latest polling data om around the country lake was ahead by at least five points in every state they reveled in their momentum for a few minutes then teddy turned serious theres something you should know he said and the smile was gone he flipped a page and glanced at some notes two nights ago in the khyber pass in the mountains of afghanistan a russian longrange missile with nuclear warheads was moved by truck into pakistan it ўs now en route to iran where it will be used for god knows what the missile has a range of three thousand miles and the capability of delivering four nuclear bombs the price was about thirty million dollars us cash up fiont paid by the iranians through a bank in luxembourg its still there in an account believed to be controlled by natty chenkovs people i thought he was stockpiling not selling he needs cash and hes getting it in fact hes probably the only man we know whos collecting it faster than you teddy didnt do humor well but lake laughed out of politeness anyway is the missile operational lake asked we think so it originated from a collection of silos near kiev and we believe its of a recent make and model with so many lying around why would the iranians buy an old oneyes its safe to assume its fully operational is it the first thereve been some spare parts and plutonium to iran and iraq and india and others but i think this is the first fully assembled readytoshoot missile are they anxious to use it we dont think so it appears as if the transaction was instigated by chenkov he needs the money to buy other kinds of weapons hes shopping his wares things he doesnt need do the israelis know it no not yet you have to be careful with them everything is give and take someday if we need something from them then we might tell them about this transaction for a moment lake longed to be president and immediately he wanted to know everything teddy knew then he realized he probably never would there was after all a sitting president right then at that moment albeit a lame duck and teddy wasnt chatting with him about chenkov and his missiles what do the russians think about my campaign he asked at first they werent concerned now theyre watching closely but you have to remember there is no such thing as a russian voice anymore the free marketers speak favorably of you because they fear the communists the hardliners are scared of you its very complex and chenkov im ashamed to say were not that close to him yet but were working on it we should have some ears in the vicinity soon teddy tossed his papers onto his desk and rolled himself closer to lake the many wrinkles in his forehead pinched closer together downward his bushy eyebrows fell hard on his sad eyes listen to me mr lake he said his voice much more somber you have this thing won there will be a bump or two in the road things we cannot foresee and even if we could wed be powerless to prevent them well ride them out together the damage will be slight youre something brand new and the people like youyoure doing a marvelous job and communicating keep the message simpleour security is at risk the world is not as safe as it looks ill take care of the money and ill certainly keep the country firightenedthat missile in the khyber pass we couldve detonated it five thousand people wouldve been killed five thousand pakistanis nuclear bombs exploding in the mountainsyou think wed wake up and worry about the stock market not a chance ill take care of the fear mr lakeyou keep your nose dean and run hard im running as hard as i can run harder and no surprises okay certainly not lake wasnt sure what he meant by surprises but he let it pass just a bit of grandfatherly wisdom perhaps teddy lolled away again he found his buttons and a screen dropped from the ceiling they spent twenty minutes viewing rough cuts of the next series of lake ads then said their goodbyes lake sped away from langley two vans in front and one behind all racing to reagan national airport where the jet was waiting he wanted a quiet night in georgetown at home where the world was held at bay where he could read a book in solitude with no one watching or listening he longed for the anonymity of the streets the nameless faces the arab baker on m street who made a perfect bagel the usedbook dealer on wisconsin the coffeehouse where they roasted beans from africa would he ever be able to walk the streets again like a normal person doing whatever he pleased something told him no that those days were gone probably forever when lake was airborne deville entered the bunker and announced to teddy that lake had come and gone without trying to check the mailbox it was time for the daily briefing on the lake mess teddy was spending more time than hed planned worrying about what his candidate might do next the five letters klockner and his group intercepted from trevor had been thoroughly researched two had been written by yarber as percy the other three by beech as ricky the five pen pals were in different states four were using fictitious names one was bold enough not to hide behind an alias the letters were basically the same percy and ricky were troubled young men in rehab trying desperately to pull their lives together both talented and still able to dream big dreams but in need of moral and physical support from new friends because the old ones were dangerous they freely divulged their sins and foibles their weaknesses and heartaches they rambled about their lives after rehab their hopes and dreams of all the things they wanted to do they were proud of their tans and their muscles and seemed anxious to show their new hardened bodies to their pen pals only one letter asked for money ricky wanted a loan of from a correspondent named peter in spokane washington he said the money was needed to cover some expenses his uncle was refusing to pay teddy had read the letters more than once the request for money was important because it began to shed light on the brethrens little game perhaps it was just a twobit enterprise someone taught them some other con whod finished his time at trumble and was now roaming at large stealing anew but the size of the stakes was not the issue it was a flesh gamethinner waists and bronze skin and firm bicepsand their candidate was in the middle of it there were still questions but teddy was patient they would watch the mail the pieces would fall into place with spicer guarding the door to the conference room and daring anyone to use the law library beech and yarber labored away with their mail to al konyers beech wrote dear al thanks for your last letter it means so much to me to hear from you i feel like ive been living in a cage for months and im slowly seeing daylight your letters help to open the door please dont stop writing im sorry if ive bored you with too much personal stuff i respect your privacy and hope i havent asked too many questionsyou seem like a very sensitive man who enjoys solitude and the finer things of life i thought about you last night when i watched key largo the old bogart and bacall film i could almost taste the chinese carryout the food here is pretty good i guess but they simply cant do chinese i have a great idea in two months when i get out of here lets rent casablanca and african queen get the carryout get a bottle of nonalcoholic wine and spend a quiet evening on the sofa god i get excited just thinking about life on the outside and doing real things again forgive me if im going too fast al its just that ive done without a lot of things here and not just booze and good food know what i mean the halfway house in baltimore is willing to take me if i can find a parttime job of some type you said you had some interests there i know im asking a lot because you dont know me but can you arrange this i will be forever grateful please write me soon al your letters and the hopes and dreams of leaving here in two months with a job on the outside sustain me in my darkest hours thanks friend love ricky the one to quince garbe had a very different tone beech and yarber had kicked it around for several days the final draft read dear quince your father owns a bank yet you say you can only raise another i think youre lying quince and it really ticks me off im tempted to send the file to your father and wife anyway ill settle for immediately same wiring instructionsand dont threaten suicide i really dont care what you do well never meet and i think youre a sicko anyway wire the damned money quince and now love ricky klockner worried that trevor might visit trumble one day before noon then drop off the mail at some point along the way before returning to his office or his home there was no way to intercept it while en route it was imperative that he haul it back and leave it overnight so they could get their hands on it he worried but at the same time trevor was proving to be a late starter he showed few signs of life until after his two oclock nap so when he informed his secretary that he was about to leave for trumble at am the rental across the street sprang into action a call was immediately placed to trevors office by a middleaged woman claiming to be a mrs beltrone who explained to jan that she and her rich husband were in dire need of a quick divorce the secretary put her on hold and yelled down the hallway for trevor to wait a second trevor was gathering papers from his desk and placing them in his briefcase the camera in the ceiling above him caught his look of displeasure at having been interrupted by a new client she says shes rich jan yelled and trevors frown disappeared he sat down and waited mrs beltroneunloaded on the secretary she was wife number three the husband was much older they had a home in jacksonville but spent most of their time at their home in bermuda also had a home in vail theyd been planning the divorce for some time everything had been agreed upon no fighting at all very amicable just needed a good lawyer to handle the paperwork mr carson had come highly recommended but they had to act fast for some undisclosed reason trevor took over and listened to the same story mrs beltrone was sitting across the street in the rental working from a script the team had put together just for this occasion i really need to see you she said after fifteen minutes of baring her soul well im awfully busy trevor said as if he were flipping pages in half a dozen daily appointment books mrs beltrone was watching him on the monitor his feet were on the desk his eyes closed his bow tie crooked the life of an awfully busy lawyer please she begged we need to get this over with i must see you today wheres your husband hes in france but hell be here tomorrow well uh lets see trevor mumbled playing with his bow tie whats your fee she asked and his eyes flew open well this is obviously more complicated than your simple nofault id have to charge a fee of ten thousand dollars he grimaced when he said it holding his breath for the response ill bring it today she said can i see you at one he was on his feet hovering over the phone how about onethirty he managed to say ill be there do you know where my office is my driver can find it thanks mr carson just call me trevor he almost said but she was gone they watched as he wrung his hands together then pumped his fists gritted his teeth said yes hed hooked a big one jan appeared from the hall and said well shell be here at onethirty get this place cleaned up a little im not a maid can you get some money up front i need to pay bills ill get the damned money trevor attacked his bookshelves straightening volumes he hadnt touched in years dusting the planks with a paper towel stung files in drawers when he charged his desk jan finally felt a twinge of guilt and began vacuuming the reception area they labored through lunch their bitching and straining making for great amusement across the street no sign of mrs beltrone at onethirty where the hell is she trevor barked down the hall just after two maybe she checked around got some more references jansaid what did you say he yelled nothing boss call her he demanded at twothirty she didnt leave a number you didnt get a number thats not what i said i said she didnt leave a number at threethirty trevor stormed out of his office still trying desperately to uphold his end of a raging argument with a woman hed fired at least ten times in the past eight years they followed him straight to trumble he was in the prison for fiftythree minutes and when he left it was after five too late to drop off mail in either neptune beach or atlantic beach he returned to his office and left his briefcase on his desk then predictably he went to petes for drinks and dinner eighteen the unit from langley flew to des moines where the agents rented two cars and a van then drove forty minutes to bakers iowa they arrived in the quiet snowbound little town two days before the letter by the time quince picked it up at the post office they knew the names of the postmaster the mayor the chief of police and the shortorder cook at the pancake house next to the hardware store but no one in bakers knew them they watched quince hurry to the bank after leaving the post office thirty minutes later two agents known only as chap and wes found the corner of the bank where mr garbe jr did business and they presented themselves to his secretary as inspectors from the federal reserve they certainly looked official dark suits black shoes short hair long overcoats clipped speech efficient manners quince was locked inside and at first seemed unwilling to come out they impressed upon his secretary the urgency of their visit and after almost forty minutes the door opened slightly mr garbe looked as though hed been crying he was pale shaken unhappy with the prospect of entertaining anyone but he showed them in anyway too unnerved to ask for identification he didnt even catch their names he sat across the massive desk and looked at the twins facing him what can we do for you he asked with a very faint smile is the door locked chap asked why yes it is the twins got the impression that most of mr garbes day was spent behind locked doors can anyone hear us wes asked no quince was even more rattled now were not reserve officials chap said we lied quince wasnt sure if he should be angry or relieved or even more frightened so he just sat there for a second mouth open frozen waiting to be shot its a long story wes said youve got five minutes actually we have as long as we want this is my office get out not so fast we know some things ill call security no you wont weve seen the letter chap said the one you just got from the post office i picked up several but only one from ricky quinces shoulders sagged his eyes closed slowly then they opened again and looked at the tormentors in total absolute defeat who are you he mumbled were not enemies youre working for him arent you him ricky or whoever the hell he is no wes said hes our enemy too lets just say that we have a client whos in the same boat youre in more or lessweve been hired to protect him chap pulled a thick envelope from his coat pocket and tossed it on the desk theres twentyfive thousand cash send it to ricky quince stared at the envelope his mouth open wide his poor brain was choked with so many thoughts he was dizzy so he closed his eyes again and squinted fiercely in a vain effort to organize things forget the question of who they were how did they read the letter why were they offering him money how much did they know he sure as hell couldnt trust them the moneys yours wes said in return we need some information who is ricky quince asked his eyes barely open what do you know about him chap asked his names not ricky true hes in prison true chap said again says he has a wife and children partially true the wife is now an exwife the children are still his says theyre destitute and thats why hes scamming people not exactly his wife is quite wealthy and his children have followed the money were not sure why hes scamming people but wed like to stop him chap added we need your help quince suddenly realized that for the first time in his life in all of his fiftyone years he was sitting in the presence of two living breathing people who knew he was a homosexual the knowledge terrified him for a second he wanted to deny it to concoct some story of how he carne to know ricky but invention failed him he was too scared to be inspired then he realized that these two whoever they were could ruin him they knew his little secret and they had the power to wreck his life and they were offering cash poor quince covered his eyes with his knuckles and said what do you want chap and wes thought he was about to cry they didnt particularly care but there was no need for it heres the deal mr garbe said chap you take the money lying there on your desk and you tell us everything about ricky show us your letters show us everything if you have a file or a box or some secret place where youve hidden everything wed like to see it once weve gathered all we need then well leave well disappear as quickly as weve come and youll never know who we are or who were protecting and youll keep the secrets absolutely theres no reason for us to tell anyone about you wes added can you make him stop quince asked staring at them chap and wes paused and glanced at each other their responses had been perfect so far but this question had no clear answer we cant promise mr garbe wes said but well try our best to put this ricky character out of business as we said hes upsetting our client too youve got to protect me on this well do all we can suddenly quince stood and leaned forward with his palms flat on the desk then i have no choice he announced he didnt touch the money but walked a few steps to an ancient glass bookcase filled with weathered and peeling volumes with one key he unlocked the case and with another he opened a small hidden safe on the second shelf fiom the floor carefully he withdrew a thin lettersized folder which he delicately placed next to the envelope filled with cash just as he opened the file an offensive highpitched voice squawked through the intercom mr garbe your father would like to see you immediately quince bolted upright in horror his cheeks instantly pale his face contorted in panic uh tell him im in a meeting he said trying to sound reassuring but coming off as a hopeless liar you tell him she said and the intercom clicked excuse me he said actually trying to smile he picked up the receiver punched three numbers and turned his back on wes and chap so that maybe they wouldnt hear dad its mewhats up he said head law a long pause as the old man filled his ear then no no theyre not from the federal reserve theyre uh theyre lawyers from des moines they represent the family of an old college buddy of mine thats all a shorter pause uh franklin delaney you wouldnt remember him he died four months ago without a will a big mess no dad uh it has nothing to do with the bank he hung up not a bad piece of lyingthe door was locked thats all that mattered wes and chap stood and moved in tandem to the edge of the desk where they leaned forward together as quince opened the file the first thing they noticed was the photo paperclipped to the inside flap wes gently removed it and said is this supposed to be ricky thats him quince said ashamed but determined to get through it a nicelooking young man chap said as if they were staring at a playboy centerfold all three were immediately uncomfortable you know who ricky is dont you quince asked yes then tell me no its not part of the deal why cant you tell me im giving you everything you want thats not what we agreed on i want to kill the bastard relax mr garbe we have a deal you get the money we get the file nobody gets hurt lets go back to the beginning chap said looking down at the fragile and suffering little man in the oversized chair how did it all start quince moved some papers around in the file and produced a thin magazine i bought this at a bookstore in chicago he said sliding it around so they could read it the tide was out and about and it described itself as a publication for mature men with alternative lifestyles he let them take in the cover then flipped to the back pages wes and chap didnt try to touch it but their eyes took in as much as possible very few pictures lots of small print it wasnt pornography by any means on page fortysix was a small section of personals one was circled with a red pen it read swm in s looking for kind and discreet gentleman in s or s to pen pal with wes and chap leaned lower to read it then came back up together so you answered this ad chap said i did i sent a little note and about two weeks later i heard from ricky do you have a copy of your note no i didnt copy my letters nothing left this office i was afraid to make copies around here wes and chap fiowned in disbelief then great disappointment what kind of dumb ass were they dealing with here sorry quince said tempted to grab the cash before they changed their minds moving things along he removed the first letter from ricky and thrust it at them just lay it down wes said and they leaned in again inspecting without touching they were very slow readers quince noticed and they read with incredible concentration his mind was beginning to clear and a glimmer of hope emerged how sweet it was to have the money and not have to worry about another crooked loan another pack of lies to cover his trail and now he had allies wes and chap here and god knows who else working against ricky his heart slowed a little and his breathing was not as labored the next letter please chap said quince laid them out in sequence one beside the other three lavender in color one a soft blue one yellow all written in the tedious block handwriting of a person with plenty of time when they finished one page chap would carefully arrange the next one with a pair of tweezers their fingers touched nothing the odd thing about the letters as chap and wes would whisper to each other much later was that they were so thoroughly believable ricky was wounded and tortured and in dire need of someone to talk to he was pitiful and sympathetic and there was hope because the worst was over for him and he would soon be free to pursue new friendships the writing was superb after a deafening silence quince said i need to make a phone call to whom its business wes and chap looked at each other with uncertainty then nodded quince walked with the phone to his credenza and watched main street below while talking to another banker at some point wes began making notes no doubt in preparation for the crossexamination to come quince loitered by the bookcase trying to read a newspaper trying to ignore the notetaking he was calm now thinking as clearly as possible plotting his next move the one after these goons left him did you send a check for a hundred thousand dollars chap asked i did wes the grimmerfaced of the two glared at him with contempt as if to say what a fool they read some more took a few notes whispered and mumbled between themselves how much money has your client sent quince asked just for the hell of it wes got even grimmer and said we cant say no surprise to quince the boys had no sense of humor they sat down after an hour and quince took his seat in his bankers chair just a couple of questions chap said and quince knew theyd be talking for another hour howd you book the gay cruise its in the letter there this thug gave me the name and number of a travel agency in new york i called then sent a money order it was easy easy have you done it before are we here to talk about my sex life no so lets stick to the issues quince said like a real ass and he felt good again the banker in him boiled for a moment then he thought of something he simply couldnt resist with a straight face he said the cruise is still paid foryou guys wanna go fortunately they laughed it was a quick flash of humor then back to business chap said did you consider using a pseudonym yes of course it was stupid not to but id never done this before i thought the guy was legitimate hes in florida im in podunk iowa it never crossed my mind the guy was a fraud well need copies of all this wes said that could be a problem why where would you copy it the bank doesnt have a copier it does but youre not copying that file in this bank then well take it to a quick print somewhere this is bakerswe dont have a quick print do you have an office supply store yes and the owner owes my bank eighty thousand dollars he sits next to me at the rotary cubyoure not copying it there im not going to be seen with that file chap and wes looked at each other then at quince wes said okay look ill stay here with you chap will take the file and find a copier where the drugstore wes said youve found the drugstore sure we needed some tweezers that copiers twenty years old no they have a new one you must be careful okay the pharmacist is my secretarys second cousin this is a very small town chap took the file and walked to the door it clicked loudly when he unlocked it and when he stepped through he was immediately under scrutiny the secretarys desk was crowded with older women all busy doing nothing until chap emerged and they froze and gawked old mr garbe was not far away holding a ledger pretending to be busy but himself consumed with curiosity chap nodded to them all and eased away passing as he went virtually every employee of the bank the door clicked loudly again as quince locked the damned thing before anyone could barge in he and wes chatted awkwardly about this and that for a few minutes the conversation almost dying at times for lack of common ground forbidden sex had brought them together and they certainly had to avoid that subject life in bakers was of little interest quince could ask nothing about wes background finally he said what should i say in my letter to ricky wes warmed to the idea immediately well i would wait first of all wait a month let him sweat if you hurry back with a response and with the money he might think its too easy what if he gets mad he wont he has plenty of time and he wants the money do you see all his mail we think we have access to most of it quince was overcome with curiosity sitting with a man who now knew his deepest secret he felt as though he could prod how will you stop him and wes for no reason he would ever understand said simply well probably just kill him a radiant peace broke out around the eyes of quince garbe a warm calming glow that spread through his tortured countenance his wrinkles softened his lips spread into a tiny smile his inheritance would be safe after all and when the old man was gone and the money was his hed flee this life and live as he pleased how nice he said softly how very nice chap took the file to a motel room where a leased color copier was waiting with other members of the unit three sets were made and thirty minutes later he was back at the bank quince inspected his originals everything was in order he carefully relocked the file then said to his guests i think its time for you to go they left without shaking hands or the usual goodbyeswhat was there to say a private jet was waiting at the local airport whose runway was barely long enough three hours after leaving quince chap and wes reported to langley their mission was a resounding success a summary of the account in the geneva trust bank was procured with a bribe of to a bahamian banking official a man theyd used before boomer realty had a balance of its lawyer had about in his account the summary listed all the transactionsmoney wired in money taken out devilles people were trying desperately to track down the originators of the wires they knew about mr garbes remitting bank in des moines and they knew that another wire of had been sent from a bank in dallas they could not however find out whod originated that wire they were scrambling on many fronts when teddy summoned deville to the bunkeryork was with him the table was covered with copies of garbes file and copies of the bank summaries deville had never seen his boss so dejected york too had little to say york was bearing the brunt of the lake screwup though teddy was blaming himself the latest teddy said softly deville never sat while in the bunker were still tracking the money weve made contact with the magazine out and about its published in new haven a very small outfit and im not sure if well be able to penetrate our contact in the bahamas is on retainer and well know if and when any wires are received we have a unit ready to search lakes offices on capitol hill but thats a long shot im not optimistic we have twenty people on the ground in jacksonville how many of our people are shadowing lake weve just gone from thirty to fifty he must be watched we cannot turn our backs he is not the person we thought he was and if we lose sight of him for one hour he might mail a letter or buy another magazine we know were doing the best we can this is our highest domestic priority i know what about planting someone inside the prison teddy asked it was a new idea one hatched by york within the past hour deville rubbed his eyes and chewed his nails for a moment then said ill go to work on itwell have to pull strings weve never pulled before how many prisoners are in the federal system york asked one hundred thirtyfive thousand give or take deville said surely we could slip in another couldnt we ill give it a look do we have contacts at the bureau of prisons its new territory but were working on it were using an old friend at justice im optimistic deville left them for a while hed get called back in an hour or soyork and teddy would have another checklist of questions and thoughts and errands for him to tend to i dont like the idea of searching his office on capitol hill york said its too risky and besides it would take a week those guys have a million files i dont like it either teddy said softly lets get our guys in documents to write a letter from ricky to lake well wire the envelope track it maybe it will lead us to his file thats an excellent idea tell deville york made a note on a pad filled with many other notes most of which had been scratched through he scribbled to pass the time then asked the question hed been saving will you confront him not yet when maybe never lets gather the intelligence learn all we can he seems to be very quiet about his other life perhaps it came about after his wife diedwho knows maybe he can keep it quiet but he has to know that you know otherwise he might take another chance if he knows were always watching hell behave himself maybe meanwhile the worlds going to hell nuclear arms are bought and sold and sneaked across borders were tracking seven small wars with three more on the brink a dozen new terrorist groups last month alone maniacs in the middle east building armies and hoarding oil and we sit here hour after hour plotting against three felonious judges who are at this very moment probably playing gin rummy theyre not stupid york said no but theyre clumsy their nets have snared the wrong person i guess we picked the wrong person no they did nineteen the memo arrived by fax from the regional supervisor bureau of prisonswashington it was directed to m emmitt broon the warden of trumble in terse but standard language the supervisor said hed reviewed the logs from trumble and was bothered by the number of visits by one trevor carson attorney for three of the inmates lawyer carson had reached the point of logging in almost every day while every inmate certainly had a constitutional right to meet with his attorney the prison likewise had the power to regulate the traffic begirming immediately attorneyclient visits would be restricted to tuesdays thursdays and saturdays between the hours of and pm exceptions would be granted liberally for good cause shown the new policy would be utilized for a period of ninety days after which time it would be reviewed fine with the warden he too had grown suspicious of trevors almost daily appearances hed questioned the front desk and the guards in a vain effort to determine what exactly was the nature of all this legal work link the guard who usually escorted trevor to the conference room and who usually pocketed a couple of twenties on each visit told the warden that the lawyer and mr spicer talked about cases and appeals and such just a bunch of law crap link said and you always search his briefcase the warden had asked always link had replied out of courtesy the warden dialed the number of mr trevor carson in neptune beach the phone was answered by a woman who said rudely law office mr trevor carson please whos calling this is emmitt broon well mr broon hes taking a nap right now i see could you possibly wake him im the warden at the federal prison at trumble and i need to speak with him just a minute he waited for a long time and when she returned she said im sorry i couldnt wake him up could i have him return your call no thank you ill just fax him a note the idea of a reverse scam was hatched by york while playing golf on a sunday and as his game progressed occasionally on the fairways but more often in the sand and trees the scheme grew and grew and became brilliant he abandoned his pals after fourteen holes and called teddy they would learn the tactics of their adversaries and they could divert attention away from al konyers there was nothing to lose the letter was created by york and assigned to one of the top forgers in documents the pen pal was christened brant white and the first note was handwritten on a plain white but expensive correspondence card dear ricky saw your ad liked it im fiftyfive in great shape and looking for more than a pen pal my wife and i just bought a home in palmvalley not far from neptune beach well be down in three weeks with plans to stay for two monthsif interested send photo if i like what i seethen ill give more details brant the return address was from brant po box upper darby pa to save two or three days a philadelphia postmark was applied in documents and the letter was flown to jacksonville where agent klockner himself delivered it to aladdin norths little box in the neptune beach post office it was a monday after his nap the following day trevor picked up the mail and headed west out of jacksonville along the familiar route to trumble he was greeted by the same guards mackey and vince at the front door and he signed the same logbook rufus shoved in fiont of him he followed link into the visitors area and to a corner where spicer was waiting in one of the small attorneyconference rooms im catchin some heat link said as they stepped into the room spicer did not look up trevor handed two twenties to link who took them in a flash from who trevor asked opening his briefcase spicer was reading a newspaper the warden hell hes cut back on my visits what else does he want dont you understand spicer said without lowering the newspaper link here is upset because hes not collecting as much right link you got that right i dont know what kinda funny business you boys are runnin here but if i tightened up on my inspections youd be in trouble wouldnt you youre being paid well trevor said thats what you think how much do you want spicer said staring at him now a thousand a month cash he said looking at trevor ill pick it up at your office a thousand bucks and the mail doesnt get checked spicer said yep and not a word to anybody yep its a deal now get outta here link smiled at both of them and left the room he positioned himself outside the door and for the benefit of the closedcircuit cameras looked through the window occasionally inside the routine varied little the exchange of mail happened first and took only a second from a worn manila folder the same one every tune joe roy spicer removed the outgoing letters and handed them to trevor who took the incoming mail from his briefcase and gave it to his client there were six letters to be mailed some days there were as many as ten seldom less than five though trevor didnt keep records or copies or documents in a file that would serve as proof that he had anything whatsoever to do with the brethrens little scam he knew there had to be twenty or thirty potential victims currently being set up he recognized some of the names and addresses twentyone to be exact according to spicers precise records twentyone serious prospects with another eighteen who were marginal almost forty pen pals currently hiding in their various closets some terrified of their shadows others getting bolder by the week still others on the verge of kicking down the door and dashing off to meet ricky or percy the difficult part was being patient the scam was working money was changing hands the temptation was to squeeze them too quickly beech and yarber were proving to be workhorses laboring over their letters for hours at a time while spicer directed operations it took discipline to hook a new pen pal one with money then ply him with enough pretty words to earn his trust arent we due for a bust trevor said spicer was flipping through the new letters dont tell me youre broke he said youre making more than we are my moneys tucked away just like yours id just like to have some more of it so would i spicer looked at the envelope from brant in upper darby pa ah a new one he mumbled to himself then opened it he read it quickly and was surprised by its tone no fear no wasted words no peeking around corners this man was ready for action wheres palm valley he asked ten miles south of the beaches why what kinda place is it its one of the gated golf communities for rich retirees almost all from up north how much are the houses well ive never been there okay they keep the damned gate locked guards everywhere like somebody might break in and steal their golf carts but how much are the houses nothing less than a million ive seen a couple advertised for three million wait here spicer said gathering his file and walking to the door where you going trevor asked to the library ill be back in half an hour i got things to do no you dont read the newspaper spicer said something to link who escorted him through the visitors area and out of the administration building he walked quickly along the manicured grounds the sun was warm and the gardeners were earning their fifty cents an hour so were the keepers of the law library beech and yarber were hiding in their little conference room taking a break from their writings with a game of chess when spicer entered in a rush with an uncharacteristic smile boys weve finally hooked the big one he said and tossed brants letter on the table beech read it aloud palmvalley is one of the golf communities for rich folks spicer explained proudly houses go for about three million the boys got plenty of dough and he aint much for letters he does seem anxious yarber observed we need to move fast spicer said he wants to come down in three weeks whats the upside potential beech asked he loved the jargon of those who invested millions at least a half a million spicer said lets do the letter now trevor is waiting beech opened one of his many files and displayed his wares sheets of paper in soft pastels i think ill try the peach he said oh definitely spicer said gotta do peach ricky wrote a scaleddown version of the initial contact letter twentyeight years old college graduate locked down in rehab but on the verge of release probably in ten days very lonely looking for a mature man to start a relationship how convenient that brant would be living nearby because ricky had a sister in jacksonville and hed be staying with her there were no obstacles no hurdles to cross hed be ready for brant when he came south but hed like a photo first was brant really married would his wife be living at palm valley too or would she stay up there in pennsylvania wouldnt it be great if she did they enclosed the same color photo theyd used a hundred times it had proved to be irresistible the peach envelope was taken by spicer back to the attorneyconference room where trevor was napping mail this immediately spicer barked at him they spent ten minutes on their basketball bets then said goodbye without a handshake driving back to jacksonville trevor called his bookie a new one a bigger bookie now that he was a player the digital line was indeed more secure but the phone wasnt agent klockner and his band of operatives were listening as usual and tracking trevors bets he wasnt doing badly up in the past two weeks by contrast his law firm had put on the books during the same period in addition to the phone there were four mikes in the beetle most of them of little value but operational nonetheless and under each bumper was a transmitter both wired to the cars electrical system and checked every other night when trevor was either drinking or sleeping a powerful receiver in the rental across the street tracked the beetle wherever it went as trevor puttered down the highway talking on his phone like a big shot tossing money around like a vegas high roller sipping scalded coffee from a quickstop grocery he was emitting more signals than most private jets march big super tuesday aaron lake bounced triumphantly across the stage in a large banquet room of a manhattan hotel while thousands cheered and music roared and balloons fell from above hed taken newyork with percent of the vote governor tarry had a rather weak percent and the other alsoraps got the rest lake hugged people hed never seen before and waved to people hed never see again and he delivered without notes a stirring victory speech then he was off on his way to la for another victory celebration for four hours in his new boeing jet that would hold a hundred and leased for million a month and flew at a speed of five hundred miles per hour thirtyeight thousand feet above the country he and his staff monitored the returns from the twelve states participating in big super tuesday along the east coast where the polls had already closed lake barely won in maine and connecticut but put up big margins in new york massachusetts maryland and georgia he lost rhode island by eight hundred votes and won vermont by a thousand as he was flying over missouri cnn declared him the winner of that state by four percentage points over governor tarry ohio was just as close by the time lake reached california the rout was over of the delegates at stake hed captured hed also solidified the momentum and most important aaron lake now had the money governor tarry was falling hard and fast and all bets were on lake twenty six hours after claiming victory in california lake awoke to a frenzied morning of live interviews he suffered through eighteen in two hours then flew to washington he went straight to his new campaign headquarters on the ground floor of a large office building on h street a stones throw from the white house he thanked his workers almost none of whom were volunteers he worked his crowd shook their hands all the while asking himself where did these people come from were gonna win he said over and over and everybody believed it why not he met for an hour with his top people he had million no debt tarry had less than million on hand and he was still trying to count the money he owed in fact the tarry campaign had missed a federal filing deadline because its books were in such a mess all cash had vanished contributions had stopped lake was getting all the money the names of three potential vice presidents were debated with great enthusiasm it was an exhilarating exercise because it meant the nomination was in the bag lakes first choice senator nance from michigan was drawing fire because hed had some shady business deals in another life his partners had been of italian extraction from detroit and lake could close his eyes and see the press peeling skin off nance a committee was appointed to explore the issue finther and a committee was appointed to begin planning lakes presence at the convention in denver lake wanted a new speechwriter now and he wanted him working on the acceptance speech lake secretly marveled at his own overhead his campaign chairman was getting for the year not for twelve months but until christmas there was a chairman of finance of policy of media relations of operations and of strategic planning and all had contracts for for about ten months of work each chairman had two or three immediate underlings people lake hardly knew and they earned apiece then there were the campaign assistants or cas not the volunteers that most candidates attracted but real employees who earned each and kept the offices in a frenzy there were dozens of them and dozens of clerks and secretaries and hell nobody made less than and on top of all this waste lake kept telling himself if i make it to the white house then ill have to find jobs for them there every damned one of them kids now running around with lake buttons on every lapel will expect to have west wing clearances and jobs paying a year its a drop in the bucket he kept reminding himself dont get hung up on the small stuff when so much more is at stake negatives were pushed to the end of the meeting and given short shrift a reporter for the post had been digging into lakes early business career without too much effort hed stumbled upon the greentree mess a failed land development twentytwo years in the past lake and a partner had bankrupted greentree legally shafting creditors out of the partner had been indicted for bankruptcy fraud but a jury let him walk no one laid a glove on lake and seven times after that the people of arizona elected him to congress ill answer any question about greentree lake said it was just a bad business deal the press is about to shift gears said the chairman of media relations youre new and you havent been subjected to enough scrutiny its time for them to get nasty its already started lake said i have no skeletons for an early dinner he was whisked away to mortimers the current power place to be seen just down pennsylvania where he met elaine tyner the lawyer running dpac over fruit and cottage cheese she laid out the current financials of the newest pac on the block cash in hand of million no significant debt money being churned around the clock coming in from all directions from everywhere in the world spending it was the challenge since it was considered soft money or money that couldnt go directly to the lake campaign it had to be used elsewhere tyner had several targets the first was a series of generic ads similar to the doomsday ads teddy had put together dpac was already buying primetime spots for the fall the second and by far the most enjoyable were the senate and congressional races theyre lining up like ants she said with great amusement its amazing what a few million bucks can do she told the story of a house race in a district in northern california where the incumbent a twentyyear veteran lake knew and despised started the year with a fortypoint lead against an unknown challenger the unknown found his way to dpac and surrendered his soul to aaron lake weve basically taken over his campaign she said were writing speeches polling doing all his print and tv ads we even hired a new staff for him so far weve spent onepointfive million and our boy has cut the lead to ten points and we have seven months to go in all tyner and dpac were meddling in thirty house races and ten in the senate she expected to raise a total of million and spend every dime of it by november her third area of focus was taking the pulse of the country dpac was polling nonstop every day fifteen hours a day if labor in western pennsylvania was bothered by an issue dpac would know it if the hispanics in houston were pleased with a new welfare policy dpac would know it if the women in greater chicago liked or disliked a lake ad dpac knew yes or no and by what percentage we know everything she boasted were like big brother always watching the polling cost a day a bargain no one could touch it for the important matters lake was nine points ahead of tarry in texas even in florida a state lake had yet to visit and very close in indiana tarrys home state tarrys tired she said morale is low because he won in new hampshire and the money was rolling in then you came from nowhere a fresh face no baggage new message you start winning and suddenly the money finds you tarry cant raise fifty bucks at a church bake sale hes losing key people because he cant pay them and because they smell another winner lake chewed a piece of pineapple and savored the words they werent new hed heard them from his own people but coming from a seasoned insider like tyner they were even more reassuring what are the vice presidents numbers lake asked he had his own set but for some reason trusted her more hell squeak out the nomination she said offering nothing new but the convention will be bloody right now youre only a few points behind him on the big question who will you vote for in november november is far away it is and it isnt a lot can change lake said thinking of teddy and wondering what sort of crisis hed create to terrify the american people the dinner was more of a snack and from mortimers lake was driven to a small dining room at the hayadams hotel it was a long late dinner with friends two dozen of his colleagues from the house few of them had rushed to endorse him when hed entered the race but now they were all wildly enthusiastic about their man most had their own pollsters the bandwagon was rolling down the mountain take had never seen his old pals so happy to be around him the letter was prepared in documents by a woman named bruce one of the agencys three best counterfeiters tacked to the corkboard just above the worktable in her small lab were letters written by ricky excellent samples much more than she needed she had no idea who ricky was but there was no doubt his handwriting was contrived it was fairly consistent with the more recent samples clearly showing an ease that came only with practice his vocabulary was not remarkable but then she suspected he was trying to downplay it his sentence structure showed few mistakes bruce guessed him to be between the ages of forty and sixty with at least a college education but it wasnt her job to make such inferences at least not in this case with the same pen and paper as ricky she wrote a nice little note to al the text had been prepared by someone else she did not know who nor did she care it was hey al where have you been why havent you written dont forget about me that kind of letter but with a nice little surprise since ricky couldnt use the phone he was sending al a cassette tape with a brief message from deep inside rehab bruce fit the letter onto one page then worked for an hour on the envelope the postmark she applied was from neptune beach florida she didnt seal the envelope her little project was inspected then taken to another lab the tape was recorded by a young agent whod studied drama at northwestern in a soft accentless vice he said hey al this is ricky hope youre surprised to hear my voice they wont let us use the phones around here i dont know why but for some reason we can send tapes back and forth i cant wait to get out of this place then he rambled for five minutes about his rehab and how much he hated his uncle and the people who ran aladdin north but he did concede that they had rid him of his addictions he was certain he would look back and not judge the place too harshly his entire narrative was nothing but babble no plans were discussed for his release no hint of where he might go or what he might do only a vague reference about seeing al one day they were not yet ready to bait al konyers the sole purpose of the tape was to hide within its casing a transmitter strong enough to lead them to lakes hidden file a tiny bug in the envelope was too risky al might be smart enough to find it at mailbox america in chevy chase the cia now controlled eight boxes duly rented for one year by eight different people each of whom had the same twentyfourhour access that mr konyers had they came and went at all hours checking their little boxes picking up mail theyd sent themselves occasionally taking a peek at als box if no one was looking since they knew his schedule better than he knew it himself they waited patiently until hed made his rounds they felt certain hed sneak out as before dressed like a jogger so they held the envelope with the tape until almost ten one night then they placed it in his box four hours later with a dozen agents watching every move lake the jogger jumped from a cab in front of mailbox america darted inside his face hidden by the long bill of a running cap went to his box pulled out the mail and hurried back into the cab six hours later he left georgetown for a prayer breakfast at the hilton and they waited he addressed an association of police chiefs at nine and a thousand high school principals at eleven he lunched with the speaker of the house he taped a stressful qa session with some talking heads at three then returned home to pack his itinerary called for him to depart reagan national at eight and fly to dallas they followed him to the airport watched the boeing take off then called langley when the two secret service agents arrived to check the perimeter of lakes townhouse the cia was already inside the search ended in the kitchen ten minutes after it began a handheld receptor caught the signal firm the cassette tape they found it in the wastebasket along with an empty halfgallon milk jug two torn packages of oatmeal some soiled paper towels and that mornings edition of the washington post a maid came twice a week lake had simply left the garbage for her to take care of they couldnt find lakes file because he didnt have one smart man he tossed away the evidence teddy was almost relieved when he got word the team was still in the townhouse hiding and waiting for the secret service to leave whatever lake did in his secret life he worked hard not to leave a trail the tape unnerved aaron lake reading rickys letters and looking at his handsome face had given him a nervous thrillthe young man was far away and odds were theyd never meet they could be pen pals and play tag at a distance and move slowly at least thats what lake had contemplated initially but hearing rickys voice had brought him much closer and lake was rattled what had begun a few months earlier as a curious little game now held horrible possibilities it was much too risky lake trembled at the thought of getting caught it still seemed impossible though he was well hidden behind the mask of al konyers ricky had not a clue it was al this and al that on the tape the post office box was his shield but he had to end it at least for now the boeing was packed with lakes wellpaid people they didnt make an airplane big enough to haul his entire entourage if he leased a within two days it would be filled with cas and advisers and consultants and pollsters not to mention his own growing army of bodyguards from the secret service the more primaries he won the heavier his plane became it might be wise to lose a couple of states so he could jettison some of the baggage in the darkness of the plane lake sipped tomato juice and decided to write a final letter to ricky al would wish him the best and simply terminate the correspondencewhat could the boy do he was tempted to write the note right then sitting in his deep recliner his feet in the air but at any moment an assistant of some variety would emerge with another breathless report that the candidate had to hear immediately he had no privacy he had no time to think or loaf or daydream every pleasant thought was interrupted by a new poll or a late breaking story or an urgent need to make a decision surely hed be able to hide in the white house loners had lived there before twentyone the case of the stolen cell phone had fascinated the inmates at trumble for the past month mr tbone a wiry street kid from miami serving twenty for drugs had taken original possession of the phone by means that were still unclear cell phones were strictly prohibited at trumble and the method by which he got one had created more rumors than t karls sex life the few whod actually seen it had described it not in court but around the camp as being no larger than a stopwatch mr tbone had been seen lurking in the shadows hunched at the waist chin to his chest back to the world mumbling into the phone no doubt he was still directing street operations in miami then it disappeared mr tbone let it be known that he might kill whoever took it and when the threats of violence didnt work he offered a reward of cash suspicion soon fell upon another young drug dealer zorro from a section of atlanta just as rough as mr tbones a killing seemed likely so the guards and the suits up front intervened and convinced the two that theyd be shipped away if things got out of hand violence was not tolerated at trumble the punishment was a trip to a mediumsecurity pen with inmates who understood violence someone told mr tbone about the weekly dockets the brethren held and in due course he found t karl and filed suit he wanted his phone back plus a million bucks in punitive damages when it was first set for trial an assistant warden appeared in the cafeteria to observe the proceedings and the matter was quickly postponed by the brethren the same thing happened just before the second trial allegations of who did or did not have possession of an outlawed cell phone could not be heard by anyone in administration the guards who watched the weekly shows wouldnt repeat a word justice spicer finally convinced a prison counselor that the boys had a private matter to reconcile without interference from the front were trying to settle a little matter he whispered and we need to do it in private the request worked its way upward and at the third trial date the cafeteria was packed with spectators most of whom were hoping to see bloodshed the only prison official in the room was a solitary guard sitting in the back half asleep neither of the litigants was a stranger to courtrooms so it was no surprise that mr tbone and zorro acted as their own attorneys justice beech spent most of the first hour trying to keep the language out of the gutter he finally gave up wild accusations spewed forth from the plaintiff charges that couldnt have been proved with the aid of a thousand fbi agents the denials were just as loud and preposterous from the defense mr tbone scored heavy blows with two affidavits signed by inmates whose names were revealed only to the brethren which contained eyewitness accounts of seeing zorro trying to hide while talking on a tiny phone zorros angry response described the affidavits in language the brethren had never before encountered the knockout punch came from nowhere mr tbone in a move that even the slickest lawyer would admire produced documentation his phone records had been smuggled in and he showed the court in black and white that exactly fiftyfour calls had been made to numbers in southeast atlanta his supporters by far the majority but whose loyalty could vanish in an instant whooped and hollered until t karl slammed his plastic gavel and got them quiet zorro had trouble regrouping and his hesitation killed him he was ordered to immediately turn over the phone to the brethren within twentyfour hours and to reimburse mr tbone for longdistance charges if twentyfour hours passed with no phone the matter would be referred to the warden along with a finding of fact from the brethren that zorro did indeed possess an illegal cell phone the brethren further ordered the two to maintain a distance of at least fifty feet from one another at all times even when eating t karl rapped a gavel and the crowd began a noisy exit he called the next case another petty gambling dispute and waited for the spectators to leave quiet he shouted and the racket only grew louder the brethren went back to their newspapers and magazines quiet he barked again slamming his gavel shut up spicer yelled at t karl youre making more noise than they are its my job t karl snapped back the curls of his wig bouncing in all directions when the cafeteria was empty only one inmate remained t karl looked around and finally asked him are you mr hooten no sir the young man said are you mr jenkins no sir i didnt think so the case of hooten versus jenkins is hereby dismissed for failure to show t karl said and made a dramatic entry into his docket book who are you spicer asked the young man who was sitting alone and glancing around as if he wasnt sure he was welcome the three men in the pale green robes were now looking at him as was the clown with the gray wig and the old maroon pajamas and the lavender shower shoes no socks who were these people he slowly got to his feet and moved forward with great apprehension until he stood before the three im looking for some help he said almost afraid to speak do you have business before the court t karl growled from the side no sir then youll have to shut up spicer said courts adjourned leave t karl slammed his docket book kicked back his folding chair and stormed out of the room his shower shoes sliding on the tile his wig bouncing behind him the young man appeared ready to cry what can we do for you yarber asked he was holding a small cardboard box and the brethren knew from experience that it was filled with the papers that had brought him to trumble i need some help he said again i got here last week and my roommate said you guys could help with my appeals dont you have a lawyer beech asked i did he wasnt very good hes one reason im here why are you here asked spicer i dont know i really dont know did you have a trial yes a long one and you were found guilty by a jury yes me and a bunch of others they said we were part of a conspiracy a conspiracy to do what import cocaine another druggie they were suddenly anxious to get back to their letter writing how long is your sentence asked yarber fortyeight years fortyeight years how old are you twentythree the letter writing was momentarily forgotten they looked at his sad young face and tried to picture it fifty years later released at the age of seventyone it was impossible to imagine each of the brethren would leave trumble a younger man than this kid pull up a chair yarber said and the kid grabbed the nearest one and placed it in front of their table even spicer felt a little sympathy for him whats your name yarber asked i go by buster okay buster whatd you do to get yourself fortyeight years the story came in torrents balancing his box on his knees and staring at the floor he began by saying hed never been in trouble with the law nor had his father they owned a small boat dock together in pensacola they fished and sailed and loved the sea and running the dock was the perfect life for themthey sold a used fishing boat a fiftyfooter to a man from fort lauderdale an american who paid them in cash the money went in the bank or at least buster thought it did a few months later the man was back for another boat a thirtyeightfooter for which he paid cash for boats was not unusual in florida a third and fourth boat followedbuster and his dad knew where to find good used fishing boats which they overhauled and renovated they enjoyed doing the work themselves after the fifth boat the narcs came calling they asked questions made vague threats wanted to see the books and records busters dad refused initially then they hired a lawyer who advised them not to cooperate nothing happened for months buster and his father were arrested at am on a sunday morning by a pack of goons wearing vests and enough guns to hold pensacola hostage they were dragged halfdressed from their small home near the bay lights flashing all over the place the indictment was an inch thick pages eightyone counts of conspiracy to smuggle cocaine he had a copy of it in his box buster and his dad were barely mentioned in the pages but they were nonetheless named as defendants and lumped together with the man theyd sold the boats to along with twentyfive other people theyd never heard of eleven were colombians three were lawyers everybody else was from south florida the us attorney offered them a dealtwo years each in return for guilty pleas and cooperation against the other codefendants pleading guilty to what theyd done nothing wrong they knew exactly one of their twentysix coconspirators theyd never seen cocaine busters father remortgaged their home to raise for a lawyer and they made a bad selection at trial they were alarmed to find themselves sitting at the same table with the colombians and the real drug traffickers they were on one side of the courtroom all the coconspirators sitting together as if theyd once been a welloiled drug machine on the other side near the jury were the government lawyers groups of pompous little bastards in dark suits taking notes glaring at them as if they were child molesters the jury glared at them too during seven weeks of trial buster and his father were practically ignored three times their names werementioned the governments principal charge against them was that they had conspired to procure and rebuild fishing boats with soupedup engines to transport drugs from mexico to various dropoffs along the florida panhandle their lawyer who complained that he wasnt getting paid enough to handle a sevenweek trial proved inefective at rebutting these loose charges still the government lawyers did little damage and were much more concerned with nailing the colombians but they didnt have to prove muchthey had done a superior job of picking the jury after eight days of deliberation the jurors obviously tired and frustrated found every conspirator guilty of all charges a month after they were sentenced busters father killed himself as the narrative wound down the kid looked as if he might cry but he stuck out his jaw gritted his teeth and said i did nothing wrong he certainly wasnt the first inmate at trumble to declare his innocence beech watched and listened and remembered a young man hed sentenced once to forty years for drug trafficking back in texas the defendant had a rotten childhood no education a long record as a juvenile offender not much of a chance in life beech had lectured him from the bench high and lordly from above and had felt good about himself for handing down such a brutal sentence gotta get these damned drug dealers off the streets a liberal is a conservative whos been arrested after three years on the inside of a prison hadee beech agonized over many of the people hed thrown the book at people far guiltier than buster here kids who just needed a break finn yarber watched and listened and felt immense pity for the young man everybody at trumble had a sad story and after a month or so of hearing them hed learned to believe almost nothing but buster was believable for the next fortyeight years he would wither and decline all at taxpayer expense three meals a day a warm bed at night a year was the latest guess of what a federal inmate cost the government such a waste half the inmates at trumble had no business being there they were nonviolent men who shouldve been punished with stiff fines and community service joe roy spicer listened to busters compelling story and he sized the boy up for future use there were two possibilities first in spicers opinion the telephones were not being properly utilized in the angola scam the brethren were old men writing letters as if they were young it would be too risky to call quince garbe in iowa for example and pretend to be ricky a robust twentyeightyearold but with a kid like buster working for them they could convince any potential victim there were plenty of young guys at trumble and spicer had considered several of them but they were criminals and he didnt trust them buster was fresh off the streets seemingly innocent and he was coming to them for helpthe bay could be manipulated the second possibility was an offshoot of the first if buster joined their conspiracy he would be in place when joe roy was released the scam was proving too profitable to simply walk away from beech andyarber were splendid at writing the letters but they had no business sense perhaps spicer could train young buster here to fill his shoes and to divert his share to the outside just a thought do you have any money spicer asked no sir we lost everything no family no uncles aunts cousins friends who could help you with your legal fees no sir what kinds legal fees we usually charge for reviewing cases and helping with the appeals im dead broke sir i think we can help beech said spicer didnt work on the appeals anyway the man never finished high school sort of a pro bono case wouldnt you say yarber said to beech a pro what spicer asked pro bono whats that free legal work beech said free legal work done by whom by lawyers yarber explained every lawyer is expected to donate a few hours of his time to help people who cant afford to hire him its part of the old english common law beech added further clouding the issue it never caught on over here did it spicer said well review your case yarber said to buster but please do not be optimistic thank you they left the cafeteria in a group three ex judges in green choir robes followed by a scared young inmate frightened but also quite curious twentytwo brants reply from upper darby pa had an urgent tone to it dear ricky wow what a photo im coming down even sooner ill be there on april are you available if so well have the house to ourselves because my wife will stay here for another two weeks poor woman weve been married for twentytwo years and she doesnt have a clue heres a picture of me thats my learjet in the background one of my favorite toys well buzz around in it if you want write me immediately please sincerely brant there was still no last name not that that was a problem they would dig for it soon enough spicer inspected the postmark and for a passing moment thought about how quickly the mail was running between jacksonville and philadelphia but the photo kept his attention it was a fourbysix candid shot very similar to an ad for a getrichquick scheme where the huckster is pictured with a proud smile flanked by his jet his rolls and possibly his latest wife brunt was standing beside a plane smiling dressed neatly in tennis shorts and a sweater with no rolls in sight but with an attractive middleaged woman next to him it was the first photo in their growing collection in which one of their pen pals had included his wife odd thought spicer but then brunt had mentioned her in both letters nothing surprised him anymore the scam would work forever because there was an endless supply of potential victims willing to ignore the risks brunt himself was fit and tanned short dark hair with shades of gray and a mustache he was not particularly handsome but what did spicer care why would a man with so much be so careless because hed always taken chances and never been caught because it was a way of life and after they squeezed him and took his money brunt would slow down for a while hed avoid the personal ads and the anonymous lovers but an aggressive type like brunt would soon return to his old ways spicer figured the thrill of finding random partners overshadowed the risks he was still bothered by the fact that he of all people spent time each day trying to think like a homosexual beech and yarber read the letter and studied the photo the small cramped room was completely silent could this be the big one reckon how much that jet cost spicer said and all three laughed it was nervous laughter as if they werent sure they could believe it a couple of million beech said since he was from texas and had been married to a rich woman the other two assumed he knew more about jets than they its a small lear spicer would settle for a small cessna anything that would lift him off the ground and take him away yarber didnt want a plane he wanted tickets in first class where they brought you champagne and two menus and you had your choice of movies first class over the ocean far away from this country lets bust him yarber said how much asked beech still staring at the photo at least a half a million spicer said and if we get that well go back for more they sat in silence each playing with his portion of half a million dollars trevors third was suddenly getting in the way hed take off the top leaving each of them not bad for prisoners but it should be a helluva lot more why was the lawyer making so much were going to cut trevors fee spicer announced ive been thinking about this for some time beginning now the money will be split four ways he takes an equal share he wont do it yarber said he has no choice its only fair beech said were doing the work and hes getting more than each of us i say we cut it ill do it thursday two days later trevor arrived at trumble just after four with a particularly bad hangover one deadened by neither the twohour lunch nor the onehour nap joe roy seemed particularly edgy he passed across the outgoing mail but held a large red oversized envelope were getting ready to bust this guy he said tapping it on the table who is he brant somebody near philadelphia hes hiding behind the post office so you need to flush him out how much a half a million bucks trevors red eyes narrowed and his dry lips fell open he did the math in his pocket his sailing career was suddenly drawing closer perhaps he didnt need a full million bucks before he slammed his office door and left for the caribbean maybe half that would do it and he was getting so close youre kidding he said knowing that spicer was not spicer had no sense of humor and he certainly took his money seriously no and were changing your percentage ill be damned if we are a deals a deal deals can always be changed from now on you get the same piece we do one fourth no way then youre fired you cant fire me i just did what you think we cant find another crooked lawyer to run mail for us i know too much trevor said his cheeks flashing pink and his tongue suddenly parched dont overestimate yourselfyoure not that valuable yes i am i know everything thats going on here and so do we hotshot difference is were already in jailyoure the one with the most to loseyou play hardball with me and youll be sittin on this side of the table bolts of pain shot through trevors forehead and he closed his eyes he was in no condition to argue why had he stayed at petes so late last night he had to be sharp when he met with spicer instead he was tired and halfdrunk his head spun and he thought he might be sick again he did the math they were arguing over the difference between and frankly both sounded good to trevor he couldnt run the risk of being fired because hed managed to alienate what few clients he had he spent less time in the office he wouldnt return their calls hed found a far richer source of income so to hell with the smalltime foot traffic along the beaches and he was no match for spicer the man had no conscience he was mean and conniving and desperate to stash away as much money as possible are beech and yarber in favor of this he asked knowing damned well they were and knowing that even if they werent hed never know the difference sure theyre doing all the work why should you make more than them it did seem a little unfair okay okay trevor said still in pain theres a good reason youre in prison are you drinking too much no why do you ask ive known drunks lots of them you look like hell thanks you take care of your business ill take care of mine its a deal but nobody wants a drunk for a lawyer youre handling all our money in an enterprise thats very illegal a little loose talk in a bar and somebody starts asking questions i can handle myself good watch your back too were squeezing a couple making them hurt if i were on the other end of our little sting id be tempted to come down and trv to get some answers before i coughed up the money theyre too scared keep your eyes open anyway its important for you to stay sober and alert thank you very much anything else yeah i got some games for you on to the important stuff spicer opened a newspaper and they began making their bets trevor bought a quart of beer at a country store on the edge of trumble and sipped it slowly as he puttered back to jacksonville he tried his best not to think of their money but his thoughts were out of control between his account and their account there was just over sitting offshore money he could take anytime he wanted add a half a million bucks to it and well he just couldnt stop adding hed never get caught stealing dirty money that was the beauty of it the victims of the brethren werent complaining now because they were too ashamed they werent breaking any laws they were just scared the brethren on the other hand were committing crimes so who would they run to if their money disappeared he had to stop thinking such thoughts but how could they the brethren catch him hed be on a sailboat drifting between islands theyd never heard of and when they were finally released would they have the energy and money and willpower to track him dawn of course not they were old men beech would probably die at trumble stop it he yelled at himself he walked to beach java for a tripleshot latte and returned to his office determined to do something productive he went online and found the names of several private investigators in philadelphia it was almost six when he began calling the first two went to answering machines the third to the offices of ed pagnozzi was answered by the investigator himself trevor explained that he was a lawyer in florida and needed a quick job in upper darby okay what kinds job im trying to track some mail here trevor said glibly hed done this enough to have it well rehearsed pretty big divorce case i got the wife and i think the husbands hiding money anyway i need somebody up there to find out whos renting a certain post office box you gotta be kiddin well no im pretty serious about this you want me to go snoopin around a post office its just basic detective work look pal im very busy call somebody else pagnozzi was gone off to more important matters trevor cursed him under his breath and punched the next number he tried two more and hung up on both when the machines answered hed try again tomorrow across the street klockner listened to the brief chat with pagnozzi one more time then called langley the final piece of the puzzle had just fallen into place and mr deville would want to know it immediately while dependent on fancy words and smooth talk and compelling photos the scam was basic in its operation it preyed on human desire and it paid off by sheer terror its mechanics had been solved by mr garbes file and by the brant wbite reverse scam and by the other letters theyd intercepted only one question had gone unanswered when aliases were used to rent post office boxes how did the brethren find the real names of their victims the phone calls to philadelphia had just given them their answer trevor simply hired a local private detective evidently one with less business than mr pagnozzi it was almost ten when deville was finally cleared to see teddy the north koreans had shot another american soldier in the dmz and teddy had been dealing with the fallout since noon he was eating cheese and crackers and sipping a diet coke when deville entered the bunker after a quick briefing teddy said thats what i thought his instincts were uncanny especially with hindsight this means of course that the lawyer could hire a local here to somehow uncover the real identity of al konyers deville said but how we can think of several ways first is surveillance the same way we caught lake sneaking to his box watch the post office thats somewhat risky because theres a good chance youll get noticed second is bribery five hundred bucks cash to a postal clerk will work in a lot of places third is computer records this is not highly classified material one of our guys just hacked his way into the central post office in evansville indiana and got the list of all box leases it was a random test took him about an hour thats high tech low tech is to simply break into the post office at night and have a look around how much does he pay for this dont know but well find out soon when he hires an investigator he has to be neutralized eliminated not yet id rather buy him first he is our window if hes working for us then we know everything and we keep him away from konyers put together a plan and for his removal go ahead and plan it but were in no hurry not yet anyway twentythree the south did indeed like aaron lake with his love of guns and bombs and tough talk and military readiness he flooded florida mississippi tennessee oklahoma and texas with ads that were even bolder than his first ones and teddys people flooded the same states with more cash than had ever changed hands the night before an election the result was another rout with lake getting of the delegates at stake on little super tuesday after the votes were counted on march of the total delegates had been decided lake held a commanding lead over governor tarry to the race was over barring an unforeseen catastrophe busters first job at trumble was running a weed eater for which he earned a starting wage of twenty cents an hour it was either that or mopping floors in the cafeteria he chose the weed eating because he liked the sun and vowed that his skin would not turn as pale as some of the bleachedout inmates hed seen nor would he get fat like some of them this is prison he kept telling himself how can they be so fat he worked hard in the bright sun kept his tan vowed to keep his flat stomach and tried gamely to go through the motions but after ten days buster knew he would not last for fortyeight years fortyeight years he couldnt begin to comprehend such timewho could hed cried for the first fortyeight hours thirteen months earlier he and his father were running their dock working on boats fishing twice a week in the gulf he worked slowly around the concrete edge of the basketball court where a rowdy game was in progress then to the big sandbox where they sometimes played volleyball in the distance a solitary figure was walking around the track an old looking man with his long gray hair in a ponytail and with no shirt he looked vaguely familiar buster worked both edges of a sidewalk making his way to the track the lone walker was finnyarber one of the judges who was trying to help him he moved around the oval at a steady pace head level back and shoulders stiff and erect not a picture of athleticism but not bad for a sixtyyearold man he was barefoot and barebacked sweat rolling off his leathery skin buster turned off the weed eater and placed it on the ground when yarber drew near he saw the kid and said hello buster hows it goin im still here the kid said mind if i walk with you not at all finn said without breaking stride they did an eighth of a mile before buster could find the courage to say so how about my appeals judge beech is lookin at it the sentencing appears to be in order which is not good news a lot of guys get here with flaws in their sentencing and we can usually file a couple of motions and knock off a few years not so with you im sorry thats okay whats a few when you have fortyeight twentyeight thirtyeight fortyeight what does it matter you still have your appeals theres a chance the decision can be overturned a slim chance you cant give up hope buster yarber said without the slightest trace of conviction keeping some measure of hope meant keeping some faith in the systemyarber certainly had none hed been framed and railroaded by the same law hed once defended but at leastyarber had enemies and he could almost understand why they came after him this poor boy had done nothing wrongyarber had read enough of his file to believe buster was completely innocent another victim of an overzealous prosecutor it appeared at least from the record that the kids father may have been hiding some cash but nothing serious nothing to warrant a page conspiracy indictment hope he felt like a hypocrite for even thinking the word the appeals courts were now packed with rightwing law and order types and it was a rare drug case that got reversed theyd slamdunk the kids appeal with a rubber stamp and tell themselves they were making the streets safer the biggest coward had been the trial judge prosecutors are expected to indict the world but the judges are supposed to weed out the fringe defendants buster and his father shouldve been separated from the colombians and their cohorts and sent home before the trial began now one was dead the other was ruined and nobody in the federal criminal system gave a damn it was just another drug conspiracy at the first curve of the oval yarber slowed then stopped he looked off in the distance beyond a grassy field to the edge of a treeline buster looked too for ten days hed been looking at the perimeter of trumble and seeing what wasnt therefences razor wire guard towers last guy who left here yarber said gazing at nothing left through those trees theyre thick for a few miles then you come to a country road who was he a guy named tommy adkins he was a banker in north carolina got caught with his hand in the cookie jar what happened to him he went crazy and walked away one day he was gone six hours before anybody knew it a month later they found him in a motel room in cocoa beach not the cops but the maids he was curled in the fetal position on the floor naked suckin his thumb his mind completely gone they put him in some mental joint six hours huh yeah it happens about once a year somebody just walks away they notify the cops in your hometown put your name in the national computers the usual drill how many get caught almost all almost yeah but they get caught because they do dumb things get drunk in bars drive cars with no taillights go see their girlfriends so if you had a brain you could pull it off sure careful planning a little cash it would be easy they began walking again a bit slower tell me something mryarber buster said if you were facing fortyeight years would you take a walk yes but i dont have a dime i do then youll help me well see give it some time settle in here theyre watchin you a bit closer because youre new but with time theyll forget about you buster actually smiled his sentence had just been reduced dramatically you know what happens if you get caught yarber said yeah they add some more years big deal maybe ill get fiftyeight no sir if i get caught i blow my brains out thats what id do you have to be prepared to leave the country and go where go someplace where you look like the locals and where they dont extradite to the us anyplace in particular argentina or chileyou speak any spanish no start learnin we have spanish lessons here you know some of the miami boys teach them they walked a lap in silence as buster reconsidered his future his feet were lighter his shoulders straighter and he couldnt keep a grin off his face why are you helping me he asked because youre twentythree years old too young and too innocentyouve been screwed by the system buster you have the right to fight back any way you can do you have a girlfriend sort of forget about her shell only get you in trouble besides you think shell wait fortyeight years she said she would shes lyin shes already playin the field forget about her unless you want to get caught yeah hes probably right thought buster hed yet to get a letter from her and though she lived only four hours away she hadnt made it to trumble theyd talked twice on the phone and all she seemed to care about was whether hed been attacked any kids askedyarber no not that i know of what about your mother she died when i was very young my dad raised me it was just the two of us then youre the perfect guy to walk away id like to leave now be patient lets plan it carefully another lap and buster wanted to sprint he couldnt think of a damned thing hed miss in pensacola hed made as and bs in spanish in high school and while he couldnt remember any of it he hadnt struggled with the material hed pick it up fast hed take the courses and hang out with the latins the more he walked the more he wanted his conviction to be affirmed and the quicker the better if it got reversed hed be forced to have another trial and he had no confidence in the next jury buster wanted to run starting over there in the grassy field to the treeline through the woods to the country road where he wasnt sure what to do next but if an insane banker could walk away and make it to cocoa beach so could he why havent you walked away he askedyarber ive thought about it but in five years theyll let me go i can last that long ill be sixtyfive in good health with a life expectancy of sixteen years thats what im livin for buster the last sixteen years i dont wanna be lookin over my shoulder where will you go dont know yet maybe a little village in the italian countryside maybe the mountains of peru ive got the whole world to choose from and i spend hours every day just dreamin about it so you have plenty of money no but im gettin there that raised a number of questions but buster let them pass he was learning that in prison you kept most of your questions to yourself when buster was tired of walking he stopped near his weed eater thanks mryarber he said no problem just keep it between the two of us sure im ready whenever you are finn was off pacing another lap his shorts now soaked with sweat his gray ponytail dripping with moisture buster watched him go then for a second looked across the grassy field into the trees at that moment he could see all the way to south america twentyfour for two long hard months aaron lake and governor tarry had gone head to head toe to toe coast to coast in twentysix states with almost million votes cast theyd pushed themselves with eighteenhour days brutal schedules relentless travel the typical madness of a presidential race yet theyd worked just as hard to avoid a facetoface debate tarry didnt want one in the early primaries because he was the frontrunner he had the organization the cash the favorable polls why legitimize the opposition lake didnt want one because he was a newcomer to the national scene a novice at highstakes campaigning and besides it was much easier to hide behind a script and a friendly camera and make ads whenever needed the risks of a live debate were simply too high teddy didnt like the thought of one either but campaigns change frontrunners fade small issues become big ones the press can create a crisis simply out of boredom tarry decided he needed a debate because he was broke and losing one primary after another aaron lake is trying to buy this election he said over and over and i want to confront him man to man it sounded good and the press had beaten it to death hes running from a debate tarry declared and the pack liked that too the governors been dodging a debate since michigan was lakes standard response and so for three weeks they played the hesrunningfiiomme game until their people quietly worked out the details lake was reluctant but he also needed a forum though he was winning week after week he was rolling over an opponent whod been fading for a long time his polls and dpacs polls showed a great deal of voter interest in him but mainly because he was new and handsome and seemingly electable unknown to outsiders the polls also showed some very soft areas the first was on the question of lakes singleissue campaign defense spending can excite the voters for only so long and there was great concern in the polls about where lake stood on other issues second lake was still five points behind the vice president in their hypothetical november matchup the voters were tired of the vice president but at least they knew who he was lake remained a mystery to many also the two would debate several times prior to november lake who had the nomination in hand needed the experience tarry didnt help matters with his constant query who is aaron lake with some of his few remaining funds he authorized the printing of bumper stickers with the now famous questionwho is aaron lake it was a question teddy asked himself almost every hour but for a different reason the setting of the debate was in pennsylvania at a small lutheran college with a cozy auditorium good acoustics and light a controllable crowd even the smallest of details were haggled over by the two camps but because both sides now needed a debate agreements were eventually reached the precise format had nearly caused fistfights but once ironed out it gave everybody something the media got three reporters on the stage to ask direct questions during one segment the spectators got twenty minutes to ask about anything with nothing screened tarry a lawyer wanted five minutes for opening remarks and a tenminute closing statement lake wanted thirty minutes of oneonone debate with tarry no holds barred no one to referee just the two of them slugging it out without rules this had terrified the tarry camp and had almost broken the deal the moderator was a local public radio figure and when he said good evening and welcome to the first and only debate between governor wendell tarry and congressman aaron lake an estimated million people were watching tarry wore a navy suit his wife had selected with the standard blue shirt and the standard red and blue tie lake wore a dashing light brown suit a white shirt with a spread collar and a tie of red and maroon and a halfdozen other colors the entire ensemble had been put together by a fashion consultant and was designed to complement the colors of the set lakes hair had received a tinting his teeth had been bleached hed spent four hours in a tanning bed he looked thin and fresh and anxious to be onstage governor tarry was himself a handsome man though he was only four years older than lake the campaign was taking a heavy toll his eyes were tired and red hed gained a few pounds especially in his face when he began his opening remarks beads of sweat popped up along his forehead and glistened in the lights conventional wisdom held that tarry had more to lose because hed already lost so much early in january hed been declared by prophets as prescient as time magazine to have the nomination within his grasp hed been running for three years his campaign was built on grassroots support and shoe leather every precinct captain and poll worker in iowa and new hampshire had drunk coffee with him his organization was impeccable then came lake with his slick ads and singleissue magic tarry badly needed either a stunning performance by himself or a major gaffe by lake he got neither by a flip of the coin he was chosen to go first he stumbled badly in his opening remarks as he moved stiffly around the stage trying desperately to look at ease but forgetting what his notes said sure hed once been a lawyer but his specialty had been securities as he forgot one point after another he returned to his common thememr lake here is trying to buy this election because he has nothing to say a nasty tone developed quickly lake smiled handsomely water off a ducks back tarrys weak beginning emboldened lake gave him a shot of confidence and convinced him to stay behind the podium where it was safe and where his notes were he began by saying that he wasnt there to throw mud that he had respect for governor tarry but they had just listened to him speak for five minutes and eleven seconds and hed said nothing positive he then ignored his opponent and briefly covered three issues that needed to be discussedtax relief welfare reform and the trade deficit not a word about defense the first question from the panel of reporters was directed at lake and it dealt with the budget surplus what should be done with the money it was a soft pitch lobbed by a friendly reporter and lake was all over it save social security he answered then in an impressive display of financial straight talk he outlined precisely how the money should be used he gave figures and percentages and projections all from memory governor tarrys response was simply to cut taxes give the money back to the people whod earned it few points were scored during the questioning both candidates were well prepared the surprise was that lake the man who wanted to own the pentagon was so well versed in all other issues the debate settled into the usual give and take the questions from the spectators were thoroughly predictable the fireworks began when the candidates were allowed to quiz one another tarry went first and as expected asked lake if he was trying to buy the election you werent concerned about money when you had more than everybody else lake shot back and the audience came to life i didnt have fifty million dollars tarry said neither do i lake said its more like sixty million and its coming in faster than we can count it its coming from working people and middleincome folks eightyone percent of our contributors are people earning less than forty thousand dollars a year something wrong with those people governor tarry there should be a limit on how much a candidate should spend i agree and ive voted for limits eight different times in congressyou on the other hand never mentioned limits until you ran out of money governor tarry looked quaylelike at the camera the frozen stare of a deer in headlights a few of lakes people in the audience laughed just loud enough to be heard the beads of sweat returned to the governors forehead as he shuffled his oversized notecards he wasnt actually a sitting governor but he still preferred the title in fact it had been nine years since the voters of indiana sent him packing after only one term lake saved this ammo for a few minutes tarry then asked why lake had voted for fiftyfour new taxes during his fourteen years in congress i dont recall fiftyfour taxes lake said but a lot of them were on tobacco and alcohol and gambling i also voted against increases in personal income taxes corporate income taxes federal withholding taxes and social security taxes im not ashamed of that record and speaking of taxes governor duringyour four years in indiana how do you explain the fact that individual tax rates increased by an average of six percent no quick response was forthcoming so lake plowed ahead you want to cut federal spending yet in your four years in indiana state spending increased eighteen percent you want to cut corporate income taxes yet during your four years in indiana corporate income taxes went up three percentyou want to end welfare yet when you were governor forty thousand people were added to the welfare rolls in indiana how do you explain this each blow from indiana drew blood and tarry was on the ropes i disagree with your figures sir he managed to say we created jobs in indiana is that so lake said sardonically he pulled up a sheet of paper from his podium as if it were a federal indictment against governor tarry maybe you did but during your four years almost sixty thousand exworkers signed up for unemployment he announced without looking at the paper sure tarry had had a bad four years as governor but the economy had gone south on him he had explained all this before and hed love to do it again but gosh he had only a few short minutes on national television surely he shouldnt waste it splitting hairs about the past this race is not about indiana he said managing a smile its about all fifty states its about working people everywhere wholl be expected to pay more taxes to finance your goldplated defense projects mr lakeyou cant be serious about doubling the pentagons budget lake looked hard at his opponent im very serious about it and if you wanted a strong military youd be serious too he then rattled off a string of statistics that went on and on each building on the other it was conclusive proof of our military unreadiness and when he finally finished our armed forces wouldve been hardpressed to invade bermuda but tarry had a study to the contrary a thick glossy manuscript produced by a think tank run by exadmirals he waved it for the cameras and argued such a buildup was unnecessary the world was at peace with the exception of a few civil and regional wars disputes in which we had no national interest and the united states was by far the only superpower left standing the cold war was history the chinese were decades away from achieving anything remotely resembling parity why burden the taxpayers with tens of billions in new hardware they argued for a while about how to pay for it and tarry scored minor points but they were on lakes turf and as the issue dragged on it became evident that lake knew far more than the governor lake saved his best for last during his tenminute recap he returned to indiana and continued the miserable list of tarrys failures there during his sole term the theme was simple and very effective if he cant run indiana how can he run the entire nation im not knocking the people of indiana lake said at one point in fact they had the wisdom to return mr tarry to private life after only one term they knew he was doing a terrible job thats why only thirtyeight percent of them voted for him when he asked for four more years thirtyeight percent we should trust the people of indiana they know this man theyve seen him govern they made a mistake and they got rid of him it would be sad if the rest of the country now made the same mistake the instant polls gave a solid win to lake dpac called a thousand voters immediately after the debate almost percent thought lake was the better of the two on alate flight from pittsburgh to wichita several bottles of champagne were opened on air lake and a small party began the debate poll results were flowing in each better than the last and the mood was victorious lake hadnt banned alcohol on his boeing but he had discouraged it if and when a member of his staff took a drink it was always a quick one and always on the sly but some moments called for a little celebration he enjoyed two glasses of champagne himself only his closest people were present he thanked them and congratulated them and just for fun they watched the highlights of the debate while another bottle was opened they paused the video each time governor tarry looked particularly puzzled and the laughs grew louder but the party was brief fatigue hit hard these were people whod been sleeping five hours a night for weeks most had slept even less the night before the debate lake himself was exhausted he finished a third glass the first time in many years hed drunk that much and settled into his massive leather recliner with a heavy quilt bodies sprawled everywhere in the darkness of the cabin he couldnt sleep he seldom did on airplanes there were too many things to think and worry about it was impossible not to savor the victory in the debate and as he kicked around under the quilt lake repeated his best lines of the night he had been brilliant something hed never admit to anyone else the nomination was his he would be showcased at the convention then for four months he and the vice president would slug it out in the grandest of american traditions he turned on the small overhead reading light someone else was reading down the aisle near the flight deck another insomniac with the only other light on in the cabin people were actually snoring under their blankets the sleep of hurried young people running on fumes lake opened his briefcase and pulled out a small leather folder filled with his personal correspondence cards they were four by six heavy stock offwhite in color and in light black old english print had the name ofaaron lake printed at the top with a thick antique mont blanc pen lake scribbled a brief word to his college roommate now a professor of latin at a small college in texas he wrote a thankyou to the moderator of the debate and one to his oregon coordinator lake loved clancy novels hed just finished the latest one the thickest yet and he wrote the author a complimentary note sometimes his notes ran long and for this reason he had plain cards same size and color but without his name he looked around to make sure everyone was sound asleep and he quickly wrote dear ricky i think its best if we end our correspondence i wish you well with your rehab sincerely al he addressed an unmarked envelopethe address of aladdin north came from memory then he returned to his personalized cards and wrote a series of thankyou notes to serious contributors he wrote twenty of them before fatigue finally settled in with the cards still in front of him and his reading light still on he yielded to exhaustion and within minutes was napping hed slept less than an hour when panicked voices awakened him lights were on people were moving and there was smoke in the cabin a buzzer of some sort was ringing loudly from the cockpit and once he got his bearings lake realized the nose of the boeing was pointed downward total panic set in quickly as the air masks dropped from above after years of halfwatching flight attendants give their routine demonstrations before takeoff the damned masks were actually going to be used lake snapped his into place and inhaled mightily the pilot announced they were making an emergency landing in st louis the lights flickered and someone actually screamed lake wanted to move about the cabin and reassure everyone but the mask wouldnt move with him in the section behind him were two dozen reporters and about that many secret service people maybe the air masks didnt drop back there he thought then felt guilty the smoke got thicker and the lights faded after the onset of panic lake managed a rational thought or two if only for a brief second he quickly gathered the correspondence cards and envelopes the one to ricky got his attention just long enough to place it in the envelope to aladdin north he sealed it and stuffed the folder back into his briefcase the lights flickered again then went out for good the smoke burned their eyes and warmed their faces the plane was descending at a rapid pace warning bells and sirens shrieked from the flight deck this cant be happening lake told himself as he gripped his armrests im about to be elected president of the united states he thought of rocky marciano buddy holly otis redding thurman munson senator tower of texas mickey leland from houston a friend of his and jfk jr and ron brown the air suddenly turned cold and the smoke dissipated rapidly they were below ten thousand feet and the pilot had somehow managed to vent the cabin the plane leveled and from the windows they could see lights on the ground please continue to use the oxygen masks the pilot said in the darkness well be on the ground in a few minutes the landing should be uneventful uneventful he must be kidding thought lake he needed to find the nearest toilet relief settled uneasily through the plane just before it touched down lake saw the flashing lights of a hundred emergency vehicles they bounced a little a typical landing and when they stopped at the end of the runway the emergency doors flew open a controlled stampede occurred and within minutes they were grabbed by rescue personnel and rushed to ambulances the fire in the luggage area of the boeing was still spreading when they landed as lake jogged away from the plane firemen rushed toward it smoke boiled from under the wings just a few more minutes lake said to himself and we would be dead that was a close one sir a paramedic said as they raced away lake clutched his briefcase with his little letters inside and for the first time went rigid with horror the near miss and the obligatory nonstop media barrage after it probably did little to boost lakes popularity but the publicity certainly didnt hurt he was everywhere on the morning news one moment talking about his decisive victory over governor tarry in the debate and the next giving details of what couldve been his last flight i think ill take the bus for a while he said with a laugh he used as much humor as he could muster and took the high road of awshucksitwasnothing his staff members had different stories of breathing oxygen in the dark while the smoke grew thicker and hotter and the reporters on board were eager sources of information providing detailed narratives of the terror teddy maynard watched it all from his bunker three of his men were on the plane and one had called him from the hospital in st louis it was a perplexing event on the one hand he still believed in the importance of a lake presidency the security of the nation depended on it on the other hand a crash wouldnt have been a catastrophe lake and his double life would be gone a huge headache wiped out governor tarry had learned firsthand the power of unlimited cash teddy could cut a deal with him in time to win in november but lake was still standing taller than ever now his tanned face was on the front of every newspaper and close to every camera his campaign had progressed far faster than teddy had dreamed so why was there so much angst in the bunker why was teddy not celebrating because he had yet to solve the puzzle of the brethren and he couldnt simply start killing people twentyfive the team in documents used the same laptop theyd used to write the last letter to ricky this letter was composed by deville himself and approved by mr maynard it read dear ricky good news about your release to the halfway house in baltimore give me a few days and i think ill have a fulltime job lined up for you there its a clerical position not a lot of money but a pretty good place to start i suggest we go a bit slower than you want maybe a nice lunch at first then well see where things go im not the type to rush in hope youre doing well ill write you next week with the details of the job hang in there only the al was handwritten a dc postmark was applied and the letter was flown and hand delivered to mockner in neptune beach trevor happened to be in fort lauderdale oddly enough tending to legitimate legal business and so the letter sat in the aladdin north box for two days when he returned exhausted he stopped by his office just long enough to commence a nasty argument with jan then stormed out got back in his car and went straight to the post office to his delight the box was full he sorted out the junk mail then drove a half mile to the atlantic beach post office and checked the box for laurel ridge percys fancy rehab spa once all the mail was collected and much to the dismay of klockner trevor left for trumble he made one call en route to his bookie hed lost in three days on hockey a sport spicer knew nothing about and refused to bet on trevor was picking his own favorites with predictable results spicer didnt answer the page at the courtyard at trumble so beech met with trevor in the attorneyconference room they did their mail swapeight letters going out fourteen coming in what about brant in upper darby beech asked flipping through the envelopes what about him who is he were ready to bust him im still searching ive been out of town for a few days get it done okay this guy could be the biggest fish yet ill do it tomorrow beech had no vegas lines to ponder and he didnt want to play cards trevor left after twenty minutes long after they shouldve eaten dinner and long after the library shouldve been closed the brethren remained locked in their little room saying little avoiding eye contact with one another each staring at the walls deep in thought on the table were three letters one was from als laptop postmarked two days earlier in d c one was als handwritten note ending his correspondence with ricky postmarked from st louis three days earlier these two conflicted sharply and were obviously written by different people someone was tampering with their mail the third letter had stopped them cold theyd read it over and over one by one collectively in silence in unison theyd picked at its corners held it up to the light even smelled it there was a very faint smoky odor same as the envelope and the note from al to ricky handwritten in ink it was dated april at am and addressed to a woman named carol dear carol what a great night the debate couldnt have gone better thanks in part to you and the pennsylvania volunteers many thanks lets push harder and win this thing were ahead in pennsylvania lets stay there see you next week it was signed by aaron lake the card had his name personalized across the top the handwriting was identical to that on the terse note al had sent ricky the envelope was addressed to ricky at aladdin north and when beech opened it he did not notice the second card stuck behind the first then it fell on the table and when he picked it up he saw the name aaron lake engraved in black that had happened sometime around pm not long after trevor had left for almost five hours theyd studied the mail and they were now almost certain that a the laptop letter was a fake with the name al signed by someone who was quite good at forging b the forged al signature was virtually identical to the original al so the forger at some point had gained access to rickys correspondence with al c the notes to ricky and carol were handwritten by aaron lake and d the one to carol had obviously been sent to them by mistake above all al konyers was really aaron lake their little scam had snared the most famous politician in the country other less important pieces of evidence also pointed toward lake his front was a mailbox service in the dc area a place where congressman lake spent almost all of his time being a highprofile elected official subject to the whims of voters every so often he would certainly hide behind an alias and hed use a machine with a printer to hide his handwriting al had not sent a photograph another sign that he had a lot to conceal theyd checked recent newspapers in the library to get the dates straight the handwritten notes had been mailed from st louis the day after the debate when lake was there because his airplane had caught fire the timing seemed perfect for lake to call off the letters hed started the correspondence before he entered the race in three months hed taken the country by storm and become very famous now he had so much to lose slowly with no concern for time they built their case against aaron lake and when it looked airtight they tried to break it down the most compelling counterpoint came from finnyarber suppose he said someone on lakes staff had access to his stationery not a bad question and one theyd kicked around for an hour wouldnt al konyers do such a thing in order to hide himself what if he lived in the dc area and worked for lake suppose lake a very busy man trusted this assistant to write personal notes for him yarber couldnt remember allowing an assistant such authority back when he was chief justice beech had never let anyone write his personal notes spicer had never fooled with such nonsense thats what phones were for but yarber and beech had never known the stress and fury of anything remotely similar to a presidential campaign theyd been busy men in their times they reflected with sadness but nothing like lake say it was an assistant to lake so far he had a perfect cover because hed told them almost nothing no photo only the vaguest details about career and family he liked old movies and chinese food and that was about all theyd extracted konyers was on their list of pen pals to soon dispose of because he was too timid why then would he call off the relationship at this moment there was no ready answer and the argument was a long shot anyway beech and yarber concluded that no man in lakes position someone with a good chance of becoming president of the united states would allow anyone else to write and sign personal notes lake had a hundred staff members to type letters and memos all of which could be signed by him at a rapid clip spicer had posed a more serious question why would lake run the risk of a handwritten note his prior letters had been typed on plain white paper and mailed in a plain white envelope they could spot a coward by his choice of stationery and lake was as fainthearted as anyone whod answered their ad the campaign rich as it was had plenty of word processors and typewriters and laptops no doubt the latest in technology to find the answer they went back to the little evidence they had the letter to carol had been written at am according to a newspaper the emergency landing happened around less than an hour later he wrote it on the plane yarber said it was late the plane was filled with people almost sixty according to the paper these people were exhausted and maybe he couldnt get his hands on a computer then why not wait asked spicer hed proved to be excellent at asking questions no one especially hirn could answer he made a mistake he thought he was being smart and he probably was somehow the mail got mixed look at the big picture beech said the nomination is in the bag hes just wiped out his only opponent before a national audience and hes finally convinced that his name will be on the ballot in november but hes got this secret hes got ricky and hes been thinking for weeks about what to do with ricky the boys going to be released he wants to have a rendezvous etc lake feels the pressure on both frontsfrom ricky and from the realization that he might just be elected president so he decides to stiff ricky he writes a note that has one chance in a billion of getting screwed up then the plane catches on fire he makes a small mistake but it turns into a monster and he doesnt know it yarber added yet beechs theory settled in they absorbed it in the heavy stillness of their little room the gravity of their discovery weighed down their words and thoughts the hours passed and it slowly sank in for the next great question they grappled with the baffling reality that someone was meddling with their mail who and why would anyone want to how had they intercepted the letters the puzzle seemed hopeless again they argued the scenario that the culprit was someone very dose to lake perhaps an assistant with access whod stumbled across the letters and maybe he was trying to protect lake from ricky by commandeering the correspondence with the goal of somehow someday ending the relationship but there were too many unknowns to build any evidence they scratched their heads and bit their nails and finally admitted they would have to sleep on itthey couldnt plot the next move because the situation before them had more riddles than answers they slept little and they were redeyed and unshaved when they reconvened just after am with black coffee steaming from styrofoam cups they locked the door pulled out the letters placed them exactly where theyd been the night before and began thinking i think we should scope out the box in chevy chase said spicer its easy safe usually quick trevors been able to do it almost everywhere if we know whos renting it then a lot of questions will be answered its hard to believe a man like aaron lake would be renting a box so he could hide letters like these beech said its not the same aaron lake yarber said when he rented the box and began writing to ricky he was just a simple congressman one of four hundred and thirtyfiveyoud never heard of him now things have changed dramatically and thats exactly why hes trying to end the relationship spicer said things are very different now he has much more to lose the first step would be to get trevor to investigate the post office box in chevy chase the second step was not as clear they were concerned that lake and they assumed that lake was al and al was lake might realize his screwup with the letters he had tens of millions of dollars a fact they had certainly not overlooked and he could easily use some of it to track down ricky given the enormity of the stakes lake if he did realize his mistake would do almost anything to neutralize ricky so they debated whether to write him a note in which ricky would beg al not to slam the door like this ricky needed his friendship nothing more etc the purpose would be to give the impression that everything was fine nothing out of the ordinary they hoped lake would read it and scratch his head and wonder to himself just where exactly did that damned card to carol get off to such a note was unwise they decided because someone else was also reading the letters until they knew who they couldnt risk any more contact with al they finished their coffee and walked to the cafeteria they ate alone cereal and fruit and yogurt healthy stuff because they would now live again on the outside they walked four smokefree laps together at a leisurely pace then returned to their chamber to finish the morning deep in thought poor lake he was scrambling from one state to the next with fifty people in tow late for three engagements at once a dozen aides whispering in both ears he had no time to think for himself and the brethren had all day hours upon hours to sit with their thoughts and their schemes it was not an equal match twentysix there were two types of phones at trumble secured and unsecured in theory all calls made on unsecured lines were taped and subject to review by little elves in a booth somewhere who did nothing but listen to a million hours of useless chatter in reality about half the calls were actually taped at random and only about percent were ever heard by anybody working for the prison not even the federal government could hire enough elves to handle all the listening drug dealers had been known to direct their gangs from unsecured lines mafia bosses had been known to order hits on their rivals the odds were very high against getting caught the secured lines were fewer in number and by law could not be wired for surveillance the secured calls went only to lawyers and always with a guard posted nearby when spicers turn finally came to make a secured call the guard had drifted away law office came the rude hello from the free world yes this is joe roy spicer calling from the trumble prison and i need to speak with trevor hes asleep it was pm then wake the sonofabitch up spicer growled hang on would you please hurry im on a prison phone joe roy glanced around and wondered not for the first time what kind of lawyer theyd crawled in bed with why are you calling were trevors first words never mind wake your ass up and get to work we need something done quickly by now the rental across from trevors office was buzzing this was the fast call firm trumble what is it we need a box checked out quickly and we want you to go supervise it dont leave until its finished why me just do it darnmit okay this could be the biggest one yet where is it chevy chase maryland write this down al konyers box mailbox america western avenue chevy chase be very careful because this guy could have some friends and theres a good chance someone else is already watching the box take some cash and hire a couple of good investigators im pretty busy around here yeah sorry i woke you up do it now trevor leave today and dont come back until you know who rented the box all right all right spicer hung up and trevor put his feet back on his desk and appeared to return to his nap but he was just contemplating matters a moment later he yelled for jan to check the flights to washington in fourteen years as a field supervisor klockner had never seen so many people watch one person do so little he made a quick call to deville at langley and the rental sprang into action it was time for the wes and chap show wes walked across the street and entered the creaking and peeling door of mr l trevor carson attorney and counseloratlaw wes was dressed in khakis and a pullover knit loafers no socks and when jan offered him her customary sneer she couldnt tell if he was a native or a tourist what can i do for you she asked i really need to see mr carson wes said with an air of desperation do you have an appointment she asked as if her boss was so busy she couldnt keep track of his meetings well no its sort of an emergency hes very busy she said and wes could almost hear the laughter from the rental please ive got to talk to him she rolled her eyes and didnt budge what kind of matter is it ive just buried my wife he said on the verge of tears and jan finally cracked a bit im very sorry she said poor guy she was killed in a car wreck on i just north of jacksonville jan was standing now and wishing shed made fresh coffee im so sorry she said when did this happen twelve days ago a friend recommended mr carson not much of a friend she wanted to say would you like some coffee she asked putting the top on her nail polish twelve days ago she thought like all good legal secretaries she read the newspapers with a keen eye on the accidents who knows one might walk in the door never trevors door until now no thanks wes said she was hit by a texaco truck the driver was drunk oh my god she exclaimed hand over her mouth even trevor could handle this one serious money big fees right here in the reception area and that fool back there snoring off his lunch hes in a deposition she said let me see if i can disturb him please have a seat she wanted to lock the front door so he couldnt escape the names yates yates newman he said trying to help her oh yes she said racing down the hall she knocked politely on trevors door then stepped inside wake up asshole she hissed through clenched teeth loud enough for wes to hear up front what is it trevor said standing ready for a fistfight he wasnt sleeping after all hed been reading an old people surprise you have a client who is it a man whose wife got run over by a texaco truck twelve days ago he wants to see you right now hes here yep hard to believe isnt it three thousand lawyers in jacksonville and this poor guy falls through the cracks said a friend recommended you whatd you tell him i told him he needed to find new friends no really what did you tell him that youre in a deposition i havent had a deposition in eight years send him back be cool ill make him some coffee act like youre finishing some important stuff back here why dont you straighten this place up you just make sure he cant get out the texaco driver was drunk she said opening the door dont screw this up trevor froze slack jawed glassyeyed his deadened mind suddenly springing to life one third of million million hell million if he was really drunk and punitive damages kicked in he wanted to at least straighten his desk but he couldnt move wes stared out the front window stared at the rental where his buddies were staring at him he kept his back to the ruckus down the hall because he was struggling to keep a straight face footsteps then jan said mr carson will see you in just a moment thanks he said softly without turning around poor guys still grieving she thought then walked to the dirty kitchen to make coffee the deposition was over in a flash and the other participants miraculously vanished without a trace wes followed her down the hall to mr carsons cluttered office introductions were made she brought them flesh coffee and when she was finally gone wes made an unusual request is there any place to get a strong latte around here why certainly yes of course trevor said the words jumping across the desk theres a place called beach java just a few blocks away could you send her to get me one absolutely anything yes of course tall or grande talls fine trevor bounced out of his office and a few seconds later jan hit the front door and practically ran down the street when she was out of sight chap left the rental and walked to trevors the front door was locked so he opened it with a key of his own inside he latched the chain so poor jan would be stuck on the porch with a cup of scalding latte chap eased down the hall and made a sudden entrance into the lawyers office excuse me trevor said its okay wes said hes with me chap closed and locked the door then he yanked a millimeter pistol from his jacket and almost pointed it at poor trevor whose eyes bulged and heart froze what he managed to emit in a highpitched painful voice just shut up okay said chap handing the pistol to wes who was sitting trevors wild eyes followed it from one to the other then it disappeared what have i done who are these thugs all my gambling debts are paid he was very happy to shut up whatever they wanted chap leaned on the wall pretty damned close to trevor as if he might lunge at any moment we have a client he began a wealthy man who has been snagged in the little scam run by you and ricky oh my god trevor mumbled his worst nightmare its a wonderful idea wes said extorting from rich gay men who are still hiding in the closet they cant complain rickys already in prison so what does he have to lose almost perfect chap said until you hook the wrong fish which is exactly what youve done its not my scam trevor said his voice still two octaves above normal his eyes still searching for the pistol yes but it wouldnt work without you would it wes asked there has to be a crooked lawyer on the outside to shuttle mail and ricky needs someone to direct the money and do a little investigative work youre not cops are you trevor asked no were private thugs chap said because if youre cops then im not sure i wanna talk anymore were not cops okay trevor was breathing and thinking again the breathing going much faster than the thinking but his training kicked in i think ill record this he said just in case youre cops i said were not cops i dont trust cops especially the fbi the fibbies would walk in here just like the two of you wave a gun around and swear that they werent fibbies i just dont like cops i think ill get this on tape dont worry pal they wanted to say it was all being recorded live and in highdensity digital color from a tiny camera in the ceiling a few feet behind where they were sitting and there were mikes planted all around trevors littered desk so that when he snored or burped or even cracked his knuckles somebody across the street heard it the pistol was back wes held it with both hands and examined it carefully youre not recording anything chap said as i told you were private boys and were calling the shots right now he took a step closer along the wall trevor watched him with one eye and with the other helped wes examine the pistol in fact we come in peace chap said we have some money for you wes said and put the damned thing away again money for what trevor asked we want you on our side we want to retain your services to do what to help us protect our client chap said heres the way we see ityoure a conspirator in an extortion scheme operating from inside a federal prison and youve been discovered by uswe could go to the feds get you and your client busted youd be sent away for thirty months probably to trumble where youd fit right in youd be automatically disbarred which means youd lose all this chap casually waved his right hand dismissing the clutter and dust and heaps of old files untouched in years wes jumped right in were prepared to go to the feds right now and we could probably stop the mail out of trumble our client would probably be spared any embarrassment but theres an element of risk our client is not willing to takewhat if ricky has another cohort either inside or out of trumble somebody we havent found yet and he somehow manages to expose our client in retaliation chap was already shaking his head its too risky wed rather work with you trevor wed rather buy you off and kill the scam from this office i cannot be bought trevor said with only a trace of conviction then well lease you for a while how about that wes said arent all lawyers leased by the hour anyway i suppose but youre asking me to sell out a client your client is a felon whos committing crimes every day from inside a federal prison and youre just as guilty as he is lets not get too sanctimonious here when you become a criminal trevor chap said gravely you lose the privilege of being selfrighteous dont preach to us we know its just a question of how much money trevor forgot about the gun for a moment and he forgot about his law license hanging on the wall behind him slightly crooked as he so often did these days when faced with yet another unpleasantry from the practice of law he closed his eyes and dreamed of his fortyfoot schooner anchored in the warm still waters of a secluded bay topless girls on the beach a hundred yards away and himself barely clad sipping a beverage on the deck he could smell the salt water feel the gentle breeze taste the rum hear the girls he opened his eyes and tried to focus on wes across the desk who is your client he asked not so fast chap said lets cut the deal first what deal we give you some money and you work as a double agent we get access to everything we wire you when you talk to ricky we see all the mailyou dont make a move until we discuss it why dont you just pay the extortion money trevor asked itd be a whole lot easier weve thought of that wes said but ricky doesnt play fair if we paid him then hed come back for more and more no he wouldnt really what about quince garbe in bakers iowa oh my god thought trevor and he almost said it aloud how much do they know all he could manage was a very weak whos he come on trevor chap said we know where the money is hidden in the bahamas we know about boomer realty and about your little account currently with a balance of almost seventy thousand bucks weve dug as far as we can dig trevor wes said jumping in with perfect timing trevor was watching tennis back and forth back and forth but weve finally hit a rockthats why we need you truthfully trevor had never liked spicer he was a cold ruthless nasty little man whod had the gall to cut trevors percentage beech and yarber were okay but what the hell it wasnt as if trevor had a lot of choices here how much he asked our client is prepared to pay a hundred thousand dollars cash chap said of course its cash trevor replied a hundred thousand is a joke that would be rickys first installment myselfrespect is worth a helluva lot more than a hundred thousand two hundred thousand wes said lets do it this waytrevor said trying to willfully suppress his racing heart how much is it worth to your client to have his little secret buried and youre willing to bury it wes asked yep give me a second chap said yanking a tiny phone from his pocket he punched numbers as he opened the door and stepped into the hallway then mumbled several sentences trevor could barely hear wes stared at a wall the gun lying peacefully bide his chair trevor couldnt see it though he tried chap returned and stared hard at wes as if his eyebrows and wrinkles could somehow deliver a crucial message in the brief hesitation trevor rushed in i think its worth a million bucks he said it could be my last case youre asking me to divulge confidential client information a rather egregious act for a lawyer it would get me disbarred in an instant disbarment would be a step up for old trevor but wes and chap let it pass nothing good could come from an argument about how valuable his law license might be our client will pay a million dollars chap said and trevor laughed he couldnt help it he cackled as if hed just heard the perfect punch line and across the street in the rental they laughed because trevor was laughing trevor managed to control himself he stopped chuckling but couldnt wipe off the smile a million bucks cash taxfree hidden offshore in another bank of course away from the clutches of the irs and every other branch of the government then he managed to arrange a lawyerly frown a little embarrassed that hed reacted so unprofessionally he was about to say something important when three sharp raps on glass came from the front oh yes he said that would be the coffee shes gotta go chap said ill send her home trevor said standing for the first time a little lightheaded no permanently get her out of the office how much does she know wes asked shes dumb as a rock trevor said happily its part of the deal chap said she goes and now we have a lot to discuss and we dont want her around the knocking grew louder jan had unlocked the door but was caught by the security chain trevor its me she shouted through the twoinch crack trevor walked slowly down the hall scratching his head searching for words he came face to face with her through the window of the front door and he looked very confused open up she growled this coffee is hot i want you to go home he said why why yes why because well uh words failed him for a second then he thought of the money her exit was part of the deal because youre fired he said what i said youre fired he yelled loud enough for his new pals in the back to hear you cant fire me you owe me too much money i dont owe you a damned thing how about a thousand bucks in back salary the windows of the rental were crowded with faces hidden by oneway shading the voices echoed down the quiet street youre crazy trevor screamed i dont owe you a dime one thousand forty bucks to be exact youre nuts you sonofabitch i stick with you for eight years making minimum wage then you fmally get the big case and you fire me is that what youre doing trevor something like that now leave open the door you little coward leave jan not until i get my things come back tomorrow im meeting with mr newman with that trevor took a step back when she saw he wasnt opening the door she lost it you sonofabitch she screamed even louder then hurled the tall latte at the door the thin rickety window shook but didnt break and was instantly covered with creamy brown liquid trevor safe on the inside flinched anyway and watched in horror as this woman he knew so well lost her mind she stormed away redfaced and cursing and took a few steps until a rock caught her attention it was a remnant of alongforgotten lowbudget landscaping project hed once okayed at her insistence she grabbed it gritted her teeth cursed some more then launched it toward the door wes and chap had done a masterful job of playing it straight but when the rock crashed through the door window they couldnt help but laugh trevor yelled you crazy bitch they laughed again and looked away from each other trying gamely to tighten up silence followed peace had broken out in and around the reception area trevor appeared in the doorway of his office unscathed no visible injuries sorry about that he said softly and went to his chair you okay chap asked sure no problem how about plain coffee he asked wes forget about it the details were hammered out during lunch which trevor insisted they enjoy at petes they found a table in the back near the pinball machines wes and chap were concerned with privacy but they soon realized that nobody listened because nobody conducted business at petes trevor knocked down three longnecks with his french fries they had soft drinks and burgers trevor wanted all the money in hand before he betrayed his client they agreed to deliver a hundred thousand cash that afternoon and immediately start a wire transfer for the balance trevor demanded a different bank but they insisted on keeping geneva trust in nassau they assured him their access was limited only to observing the account they could not tamper with the funds besides the money would arrive there by late afternoon if they changed banks then it might take a day or two both sides were anxious to complete the deal wes and chap wanted full immediate protection for their client trevor wanted his fortune after three beers he was already spending it chap left early to fetch the moneytrevor ordered a longneck to go and they got into wes car for a ride around townthe plan was to meet chap at some spot and take possession of the cash as they rode south on highway ala along the beach trevor began talking isnt it amazing he said his eyes hidden behind cheap sunglasses his head back on the headrest whats amazing the risks people are willing to take your client for example a rich man he could hire all the young boys he wanted yet he answers an ad in a gay magazine and starts writing letters to a complete stranger i dont understand it wes said and the two straight boys bonded for a second its not my job to ask questions i suppose the thrill is in the unknown trevor said and took a small sip yeah probably so whos ricky ill tell you when i get the money which ones your client which one how many victims are you working on right now rickys been busy lately probably twenty or so in the works how many have you extorted two or three its a nasty business howd you get involved im rickys lawyer hes very bright very bored somehow he cooked up this scheme to put the squeeze on gays still in the closet against my better judgment i signed on is he gay wes asked wes knew the names of beechs grandchildren he knew yarbers blood type he knew who spicers wife was dating back in mississippi no said trevor hes a sicko then no hes a nice guy so whos your client al konyers trevor nodded and tried to remember how many letters hed handled between ricky and al what a coincidence i was making plans to go to washington todo some background work on mr konyers not his real name of course of course not do you know his real name no we were hired by some of his people how interesting so none of us knows the real al konyers thats correct and im sure itll stay that way trevor pointed to a convenience store and said pull in there i need a beer wes waited near the gas pumps it had been determined that they would not say anything about his drinking until the money changed hands and hed told them everything they would build some trust then gently try to nudge him closer to sobriety the last thing they needed was trevor at petes every night drinking and talking too much chap was waiting in a matching rental car in front of a laundromat five miles south of ponte vedra beach he handed trevor a thin cheap briefcase and said its all there a hundred thousand ill meet you guys back at the office trevor didnt hear him he opened the briefcase and began counting the money wes turned around and headed north ten stacks of all in bills trevor closed it and crossed over to the other side twentyseven chaps first task as trevors new paralegal was to organize the front desk and rid it of anything remotely female he put jans things in a cardboard box everything from lipstick tubes and nail files to peanut candy and several xrated romance novels there was an envelope with eighty dollars and change the boss claimed it for himself said it was petty cash chap wrapped her photos in old newspapers and placed them carefully in another box along with the breakable knickknacks you find on most front desks he copied her appointment books so they would know who was scheduled to appear in the futurethe traffic would be light he saw with little surprise not a single court date anywhere on the horizon two office appointments this week two the next then nothing as chap studied the calendars it was obvious that trevor had shifted to a slower gear at about the time the money arrived from quince garbe they knew trevors gambling had picked up in recent weeks and probably his drinking several times jan had told friends on the phone that trevor was spending more time at petes than at the office as chap busied himself in the front room packing her junk rearranging her desk dusting and vacuuming and throwing away old magazines the phone rang occasionally his job description covered the phone and he stayed close to it most of the calls were for jan and he politely explained that she no longer worked there good for her seemed to be the general feeling an agent dressed as a carpenter arrived early to replace the front door trevor marveled at chaps efficiency howd you find one so quick he asked you just have to work the yellow pages chap said another agent posing as a locksmith followed the carpenter and changed every lock in the building their agreement included the provision that trevor would see no new clients for at least the next thirty days hed argued long and hard against this as if he had a stellar reputation to protect think of all the people who might need him hed complained but they knew how slow the last thirty days had been and they pressed him until he conceded they wanted the place to themselves chap called those clients with scheduled appointments and told them that mr carson would be tied up in court on the day they were supposed to stop by rescheduling would be difficult chap explained but hed give them a call when there was a break in the action i didnt think he went to court one of them said oh yes chap said its a really big case when the client list was pared to the core only one case required an office visit it was an ongoing child support matter and trevor had represented the woman for three years he couldnt simply give her the boot jan stopped by to cause trouble and brought with her a boyfriend of sorts he was a wiry young man with a goatee polyester pants white shirt and tie and chap figured he probably sold used cars no doubt he could have easily thrashed trevor but he wanted no part of chap id like to speak to trevor jan said her eyes darting around her newly organized desk sorry hes in a meeting and who the hell are you im a paralegal yeah well get your money up front thank you your things are in those two boxes over there chap said pointing she noticed the magazine racks were purged and neat the wastebasket was empty the furniture had been polished there was a smell of antiseptic as if theyd fumigated the place where shed once sat she was no longer needed tell trevor he owes me a thousand dollars in unpaid salary she said i will chap replied anything else yeah that new client yesterday yates newmantell trevor i checked the newspapers in the past two weeks theres been no accident deaths on i no record of a female named newman getting killed either somethings up thank you ill tell him she looked around for the last time and smirked again when she saw the new door her boyfriend glared at chap as if he might just step over and break his neck anyway but the glaring was done as he headed for the door they left without breaking anything each of them carrying a box as they lumbered down the sidewalk chap watched them leave then began preparing for the challenge of lunch dinner the night before had been nearby at a crowded new seafood place two blocks from the sea turtle inn given the size of the portions the prices were outrageous and that was exactly why trevor the newest millionaire in jacksonville had insisted they eat there of course the evening was on him and he spared no expense he was drunk after the first martini and didnt remember what he ate wes and chap had explained that their client did not allow them to drink they sipped designer water and kept his wineglass full id find me another clienttrevor said laughing at his own humor guess ill have to drink for all three of us he said halfway through dinner then proceeded to do just that much to their relief they learned that he was a docile drunk they kept pouring in an effort to see how far he would go he got quieter and lower in his seat and long after dessert he tipped the waiter in cash they helped him to their car and drove him home he slept with the new briefcase across his chest when wes turned off his light trevor was lying on his bed in his rumpled pants and white cotton shirt bow tie undone shoes still on snoring and clutching the briefcase tightly with both arms the wire had arrived just before five the money was in place klockner had told them to get him drunk see how he behaved in that condition then start working in the morning at am they returned to his house unlocked the door with their key and found him pretty much as theyd left him one shoe was off and he was curled on his side with the briefcase tucked away like a football lets go lets go chap had yelled while wes turned on lights and raised shades and made as much noise as possible trevor to his credit scrambled from bed raced to the bathroom took a quick shower and twenty minutes later walked into his den with a fresh bow tie and not a wrinkle anywhere his eyes were slightly swollen but he was smiling and determined to tackle the day the million dollars helped in fact hed never conquered a hangover as quickly they had a quick muffin and strong coffee at beach java then attacked his little office with vigor while chap took care of the frontwes kept trevor in his office some of the pieces had fallen into place over dinner the names of the brethren had finally been extracted from trevor and wes and chap had done a splendid job of being surprised three judges theyd both repeated in apparent disbelief trevor had smiled and nodded with great pride as if he and he alone had been the architect of this masterful scheme he wanted them to believe that hed had the brains and skill to convince three former judges that they should spend their time writing letters to lonely gay men so he trevor could rake off a third of their extortion hell he was practically a genius other pieces of the puzzle remained unclear and wes was determined to keep trevor locked away until he had answers lets talk about quince garbe he said his post office box was rented to a fake corporation howd you learn his true identity it was easy trevor said very proud of himself not only was he a genius now but he was a very rich one he had awakened yesterday morning with a headache and had spent the first half hour in bed worrying about his gambling losses worrying about his dwindling law practice worrying about his increasing reliance on the brethren and their scam twentyfour hours later hed awakened with a worse headache but one soothed with the balm of a million bucks he was euphoric giddy and anxious to finish the task at hand so he could get on with life i found a private investigator in des moines he said sipping coffee his feet on his desk where they belonged sent him a check for a thousand bucks he spent two days in bakers you been to bakers yep i was afraid id have to gothe scam works best if you can snare some prominent guy with money hell pay anything to keep you quiet anyway this investigator found a postal clerk who needed some money she was a single mother houseful of kids old car small apartment you get the picture he called her at night and said hed give her five hundred dollars cash if she could tell him who was renting box in the name of cmt investments next morning he called her at the post office they met in a parking lot during her lunch break she gave him a piece of paper with the name of quince garbe and he gave her an envelope with five onehundreddollar bills she never asked who he was is that a typical method it worked with garbe curds cates the guy in dallas the second one we scammed was a little more complicated the investigator we hired there couldnt find anyone on the inside so he had to watch the post office for three days cost eighteen hundred dollars but he finally saw him and got his license number whos next probably this guy in upper darby pennsylvania his alias is brant white and he appears to be a hot prospect do you ever read the letters never i dont know whats being said back and forth dont wanna know when theyre ready to bust somebody theyll tell me to scope out the box and get a real name thats if their pen pal is using a front like your client mr konyersyoud be amazed how many men use their real names unbelievable do you know when they send the extortion letters oh yeah they tell me so i can alert the bank in the bahamas that a wire might be on the way the bank calls me as soon as the money hits tell me about this brant white in upper darby wes said he was taking pages of notes as if something might be missed every word was being recorded on four different machines across the street theyre ready to bust him thats all i know he seems hot to trot because theyve just swapped a couple of letters some of these guys its like pulling teeth judging by the number of letters but you dont keep track of the letters there are no records here i was afraid the feds would show up one day with a search warrant and i wanted no evidence of my involvement smart very smart trevor smiled and savored his shrewdness yeah well ive done a lot of criminal law after a while you start thinking like a criminal anyway ive been unable to find the right investigator in the philadelphia area still working on it though brant white was a langley creation trevor could hire every investigator in the northeast and theyd never fmd a real person behind the post office box in fact he continued i was preparing to go up there myself when i got the call from spicer telling me to go to washington and track down al konyers then you guys showed up and well the rest is history his words trailed away as he once again thought of the money sure it was a coincidence that wes and chap entered his life just hours after he was supposed to go searching for their client but he didnt care he could hear the seagulls and feel the hot sand he could hear the reggae from the island bands and feel the wind pushing his little boat is there another contact on the outside wes asked oh no he said vainly i dont need any help the fewer people involved the easier the operation works very smart wes said trevor leaned back even deeper in his chair the ceiling above him was cracked and peeling and in need of a fresh coat of enamel a couple of days ago that might have worried him now he knew it would never get painted not if they expected him to foot the bill hed walk out of the place one day very soon once wes and chap here had finished with the brethren hed spend a day or two boxing up his files to store for what reason he was not certain and hed give away his outdated and unused law books hed find some broke rookie fresh out of law school and looking for a few crumbs around city court and hed sell him the furniture and computer for a very reasonable price and when all the loose ends were covered he l trevor carson attorney and counseloratlaw would walk out of the office and never look back what a glorious day that would be chap interrupted the brief daydream with a sack of tacos and soft drinks lunch had not been discussed among the three but trevor had already been checking his watch in anticipation of another long meal at petes he grudgingly took a taco and seethed for a moment he needed a drink i think its a good idea to lay off the booze during lunch chap said as they huddled around trevors desk and tried not to spill black beans and ground beef do as you please trevor said i was talking to you chap said at least for the next thirty days that wasnt part of our deal it is now you need to be sober and alert why exactly because our client wants you that way and hes paying you a million dollars does he want me to floss twice a day and eat my spinach ill ask him tell him to kiss my ass while youre at it dont overreact trevor wes said just cut back on the drinking for a few days itll be good for you if the money had set him free these two were beginning to choke him theyd now spent twentyfour hours together and they showed no signs of leaving in fact the opposite was happening they were moving in chap left early to collect the mail theyd convinced trevor that hed been very sloppy in his habits and thats how theyd tracked him so easily suppose other victims were lurking out there trevord had little trouble in finding the real names of their victims why couldnt the victims do the same to the person behind aladdin north and laurel ridge from now on wes and chap would take turns collecting the mail theyd mix things up visit the post offices at different times use disguises real cloakanddagger stuff trevor eventually agreed they seemed to know what they were doing there were four letters for ricky waiting in the neptune beach post office and two for percy in atlantic beach chap quickly made the rounds with a team behind him watching anyone who might be watching him the letters were taken to the rental where they were quickly opened and copied then put back together the copies were read and analyzed by agents anxious to have something to do klockner read them too of the six theyd seen five of the names before all were lonely middleaged men trying to muster the nerve to take the next step with ricky or percy none seemed particularly aggressive one wall in a converted bedroom of the rental had been painted white and a large map of the fifty states had been stenciled on it red pushpins were used to mark rickys pen pals green for percy the names and hometowns of the correspondents were printed in black under the pins the nets were getting wider ricky had twentythree men actively writing him percy eighteen thirty states were representedthe brethren were finetuning their venture with each passing week they were now running ads in three magazines as far as klockner could tell they held firm to their profile and by the third letter they usually knew if a new guy had any money or a wife it was a fascinating game to watch and now that they had complete access to trevor they wouldnt miss a letter the days mail was summarized in two pages then given to an agent who took off to langley deville had it in hand by pm the first call of the afternoon at threeten came when chap was washing windows wes was still in trevors office grilling him with one question after another trevor was weary hed missed his nap and he desperately needed a drink law office chap answered is this trevors office the caller asked it is whos calling who are you im chap the new paralegal what happened to the girl she no longer works here what can i do for you this is joe roy spicer im a client of trevors and im calling from trumble calling from where trumble its a federal prison is trevor there no sir hes in washington and he should be back here in a couple of hours okay tell him ill call back at five yes sir chap hung up and took a deep breath as did klockner across the street the cia had just had its first live contact with one of the brethren the second call came at exactly five chap answered the phone and recognized the voice trevor was waiting in his office hello trevor this is joe roy spicer hello judge whatd you find in washington were still working on it its gonna be a tough one but well find him there was a long pause as if spicer didnt like this news and was uncertain about how much to say are you comin tomorrow ill be there at three bring five thousand dollars cash five thousand dollars thats what i said get the money and bring it here all in twenties and fifties what are you gonna do dont ask stupid questions trevor bring the damned money put it in an envelope with the other mailyouve done it before all right spicer hung up without another word then trevor spent an hour discussing the economics of trumble cash was prohibited every inmate had a job and his wages were credited to his account expenditures such as longdistance calls commissary charges copying expenses stamps were all debited against his account but cash was present though seldom seen it was smuggled in and hidden and it was used to pay gambling debts and bribe guards for small favors trevor was afraid of it if he as the attorney got caught sneaking it in his visiting privileges would be permanently eliminated hed smuggled on two previous occasions both times in tens and twenties he couldnt imagine what they wanted with twentyeight after three days of stepping over and around wes and chap trevor needed a break they wanted breakfast lunch and dinner together they wanted to drive him home and pick him up for work very early in the morning they were running what was left of his practicechap the paralegalwes the office manager both of them drilling him with endless questions because there was precious little lawyering to be done so it was no surprise when they announced they would drive him to trumble he didnt need a driver he explained hed made the trip many times in his trusty little beetle and hed go it alone this upset them and they threatened to call their client for guidance call the damned client for all i care trevor yelled at them and they backed down your client is not running my life but the client was and they all knew it only the money mattered now trevor had already performed his judas act he left neptune beach in his beetle alone followed by wes and chap in their rental car and behind them was a white van occupied by people trevor would never see nor did he want to see them just for the hell of it he made a sudden turn into a convenience store for a sixpack and laughed when the rest of the caravan slammed on brakes and barely avoided a wreck once out of town he drove painfully slow sipping his beer savoring his privacy telling himself he could suffer through the next thirty days he could suffer through anything for a million bucks as he neared the village oftrumble he had the first pangs of guilt could he pull this off he was about to face spicer a client who trusted him a prisoner who needed him a partner in crime could he keep a straight face and act as if things were fine while every word was being captured by a highfrequency mike in his briefcase could he swap letters with spicer as if nothing had changed knowing that the mail was being monitored plus he was throwing away his law career something hed worked hard to attain and had once been proud of he was selling his ethics his standards even his morals for money was his soul worth a million bucks too late now the money was in the bank he took a sip of beer and washed away the fading twinges of guilt spicer was a crook and so were beech and yarber and he trevor carson was just as culpable theres no honor among thieves he kept repeating silently link got a whiff of the beer wafting off trevor as they walked down the hall and into the visitors area at the lawyers mom trevor looked inside he saw spicer partially hidden by a newspaper and was suddenly nervous what kind of lowlife lawyer carries an electronic listening device into a confidential meeting with a client the guilt hit trevor like a brick but there was no turning back the mike was almost as big as a golf ball and had been meticulously installed by wes in the bottom of trevors beatenup and scruffy black leather briefcase it was extremely powerful and would easily transmit everything to the faceless boys in the white van wes and chap were there too ready with their earphones anxious to hear it all afternoon joe roy trevor said same to you spicer said lemme see the briefcase link said he gave a cursory look then said it looks fine trevor had warned wes and chap that link sometimes took a peek into the briefcase the mike was covered by a pile of papers heres the mail trevor said how many link asked eight you got any link asked spicer no none today spicer replied ill be outside link said the door closed feet shuffled and suddenly there was silence a very long silence nothing not a word between lawyer and client they waited in the white van for an eternity until it was obvious something had gone wrong as link stepped from the small room trevor quickly and deftly set the briefcase outside the door on the floor where it rested benignly during the remainder of the attorneyclient conference link noticed it and thought nothing about it whatd you do that for spicer asked its empty trevor said shrugging let the closed circuit see itwe have nothing to hide trevor had had one final brief attack of ethics maybe hed bug the next chat with his client but not this one hed simply tell wes and chap that the guard took his briefcase something that happened occasionally whatever spicer said rifing through the mail until he came to two envelopes that were slightly thicker is this the money it is i had to use some hundreds why i plainly said twenties and fifties thats all i could find okay i didnt anticipate needing that much cash joe roy studied the addresses on the other letters then he asked rather caustically so what happened in washington its a tough one one of those rentabox outfits in the suburbs open twentyfour hours seven days a week always somebody on duty lots of traffic security is tight well figure it out who are you using some outfit in chevy chase gimme a name whatta you mean gimme a name give me the name of the investigator in chevy chase trevor drew a blank invention failed him spicer was on to something his dark liquid eyes gloving with intensity i cant remember trevor said whered you stay what is this joe roy give me the name of your hotel why i have the right to know im the client im paying for your expenses where did you stay ritzcanton which one i dont know the ritzcanton there are twowhich one was it i dont know not downtown what flight did you take come on joe roy what is this what airline delta the flight number i dont remember you got back yesterday less than twentyfour hours ago what was your flight number i dont recall are you sure you went to washington of course i went trevor said but his voice broke a little from a lack of sincerity he had not planned his lies and they were breaking down as fast as he put them up you dont know your flight number which hotel you stayed in or the name of the investigator you spent the last two days withyou must think im stupid trevor didnt answer he could only think of the mike in the briefcase and how lucky he was to have it outside getting flogged like this was something hed rather wes and chap not hear youve been drinking havent you spicer asked on the attack yes trevor said a temporary pause in the lying i stopped and bought a beer or two yes two spicer leaned on his elbows his face halfway across the table i got some bad news for you trevoryoure fired what terminated sacked gone for good you cant fire me i just did effective immediately by unanimous vote of the brethren were notifying the warden so your name will be removed from the list of attorneys when you leave today trevor dont come back why lying drinking too much sloppy habits a general lack of trust on behalf of your clients it sounded true enough but trevor nevertheless took it hard it had never crossed his mind that theyd have the guts to fire him he clenched his teeth and asked what about our little enterprise its a clean breakyou keep your money well keep ours wholl run it on the outside well worry about that you can pursue an honest living if youre able what would you know about an honest living why dont you just leave trevor get up walk out its been lovely sure he mumbled his thoughts a blur but two coming to the forefront first spicer had brought no letters the first time that had happened in many weeks second the cash what did they need the five grand for probably to bribe their new lawyer theyd planned their ambush well which was always an advantage they held because they had so much time on their hands three very bright men with lots of idle time it wasnt fair pride made him stand he extended a hand and said sorry it had to happen spicer shook it reluctantly just get out of here he wanted to say when they made eye contact for the last time trevor said almost in a whisper konyers is the man very richvery powerful he knows about you spicer leapt up like a cat with their faces just inches apart he said also in a whisper is he watching you trevor nodded and winked then he grabbed the door he picked up his briefcase without a word to link what was he supposed to say to the guard sorry old boy but the thousand bucks a month in cash you were getting under the table just got cut off sad about it then ask judge spicer here why it happened but he let it pass he was reeling and almost dizzy and the alcohol didnt help what would he tell wes and chap that was the question of the moment they would hammer him as soon as they could catch him he said goodbye to link and vince mackey and rufus up front same as always but now for the last time and walked into the hot sun wes and chap were parked three cars down they wanted to talk but played it safe trevor ignored them as he tossed his briefcase into the passengers seat and got in the beetle the caravan followed him away from the prison and slowly down the highway toward jacksonville their decision to dispose of trevor had been reached with a maximum of judicial deliberation theyd spent hours hiding in their little room studying the konyers file until every word of every letter was memorized theyd walked miles around the track just the three of them playing one scenario against another they ate together played cards together all the while whispering new theories of who might be watching their mail trevor was the nearest culprit and the only one they could control if their victims got sloppy they could do nothing about it but if their lawyer had failed to watch his trail then he had to be fired he was not the type to evoke a lot of trust in the first place how many good busy lawyers would be willing to risk their careers in a gay extortion scheme the only hesitation in ridding themselves of trevor was the fear of what he might do with their money they expected him to steal it frankly and they couldnt stop him but they were willing to run that risk in return for a bigger score with mr aaron lake to get to lake they felt they had to eliminate trevor spicer gave them the details of their meeting word for word trevors muted message at the end stunned them konyers was watching trevor konyers knew about the brethren did that mean lake knew about the brethren who was really konyers now why did trevor whisper this and why did he leave his briefcase outside the door with the scrutiny that only a team of bored judges could generate the questions poured forth and then the strategies trevor was making coffee in his newly cleaned and shined kitchen when wes and chap made their quiet entry and came straight at him what happened wes asked they were frowning and gave the impression theyd been fretting for some time what do you mean trevor asked as if things were splendid what happened to the mike oh that the guard took the briefcase and kept it outside they frowned at each other some more trevor poured the water into his coffee machinethe fact that it was almost five and he was making coffee was duly noted by the agents why did he do that its routine about once a month the guard will keep the briefcase during the visit did he search it trevor busied himself by watching the coffee drip absolutely nothing was wrong he made his usual quick exam which i think he does with his eyes closed he removed the ingoing letters then took it the mike was safe did he notice the thick envelopes of course not relax and the meeting went well it was routine except that spicer had no outgoing mail which is a bit unusual these days but it happens ill go back in two days and hell have a stack of letters and the guard will not even touch the briefcaseyoull get to hear every word want some coffee they relaxed in unison thanks but wed better go chap said there were reports to make questions to answer they started for the door but trevor stopped them look fellas he said very politely im perfectly capable of getting dressed by myself and of having a quick bowl of cereal alone the way ive done it for many years and i like to open my office here no earlier than nine since its my office well open at nine and not a minute sooneryoure welcome to be here at that unholy hour but not at eight fiftynine stay away from my house and stay away from this office until nine understood sure one of them said and they were gone it didnt really matter to them they had bugs crawling all over the office the house the car even the briefcase now they knew where he bought his toothpaste trevor drank the entire pot of coffee and sobered up then he began his movements all carefully planned hed started preparing the moment he left trumble he assumed they were watching back there with the boys from the white van they had the gadgets and the toys the mikes and the bugs and wes and chap certainly knew how to use them money was no object he told himself to believe they knew everything just let his imagination run wild and assume they heard every word followed every turn and knew exactly where he was at all times the more paranoid he was the better his chances of escape he drove to a mall sixteen miles away near orange park in the sprawl south of jacksonville he roamed and windowshopped and ate pizza in a nearempty food court it was difficult not to dart behind a rack of clothes in a store and wait for the shadows to walk by but he resisted in a radio shack he bought a small cell phone one month of long distance with a local service came with the package and trevor had what he needed he returned home after nine certain that they were watching he turned the television on full volume and made more coffee in the bathroom he stuffed his cash into pockets at midnight with the house dark and quiet and trevor evidently asleep he slipped out the back door and into the night the air was brisk the moon full and he tried his best to look as though he was simply going for a walk on the beach he wore baggy cargo pants with pockets from the waist down two denim shirts and an oversized windbreaker with money stuffed inside the liner in all trevor had hidden on himself as he wandered aimlessly south along the edge of the water just another beachcomber out for a midnight stroll after a mile his pace quickened when hed gone three miles he was exhausted but he was in a desperate hurry sleep and rest would have to wait he left the beach and walked into the grungy lobby of a rundown motel there was no traffic along highway ala nothing was open except for the motel and a convenience store in the distance the door rattled enough for the clerk to come to life a television was on somewhere in the back a chubby young man of no more than twenty emerged and said good evening need a room no sirtrevor said as he slowly drew a hand from a pocket and produced a thick roll of bills he began peeling them off and placing them in a neat row on the counter i need a favor the clerk stared at the money then rolled his eyes the beach attracted all kinds these rooms aint that expensive he said whats your name trevor asked oh i dont know lets say its sammy sosa all right sammy theres a thousand bucks its yours if youll drive me to daytona beach take you ninety minutes itll take me three hours because i have to drive back whatever thats more than three hundred bucks an hour whens the last time you made three hundred bucks an hour its been a while i cant do it i run the night shift you see my job is to be on duty from ten until eight whos the boss hes in atlanta whens the last time he stopped by ive never met him of course you havent if you owned a dump like this would you stop by its not that bad we have free color tvs and most of the airconditioning works its a dump sammy you can lock that door drive away and come back three hours later and no one will ever know it sammy looked at the money again you runnin from the law or something no and im not armed im just in a hurry so whats up a bad divorce sammy i have a little money my wife wants it all and she has some pretty nasty lawyers i gotta get out of town you got money but no car look sammyyou want the deal or not if you say no then ill walk down the street to the convenience store and find somebody smart enough to take my cash two thousand youll do it for two thousand yep the car was worse than trevor had expected it was an old honda uncleaned by sammy or any of the previous five owners but ala was deserted and the trip to daytona beach took exactly ninetyeight minutes at am the honda stopped in front of an allnight waffle grill and trevor got out he thanked sammy said goodbye and watched him drive away inside he drank coffee and chatted with the waitress long enough to persuade her to go fetch a local phone directory he ordered pancakes and used his new radio shack cell phone to find his way around town the nearest airport was daytona beach international a few minutes after four his cab stopped at the general aviation terminal dozens of small planes sat in neat rows on the tarmac he stared at them as the cab drove away surely he told himself one of them was available for a quick charter he just needed one preferably a twinengine twentynine the back bedroom of the rental had been converted into the meeting room with four folding tables pushed together to make one large one it was covered with newspapers magazines and doughnut boxes every morning at seventhirty klockner and his team met over coffee and pastries to review the night and plan the day wes and chap were always there and six or seven others joined them depending on who was in town from langley the technicians from the front room sometimes sat in though klockner did not require their attendance now that trevor was on their side they needed fewer people to track him or so they thought surveillance detected no movement inside his home before seventhirty which was not altogether unusual for a man who often went to bed drunk and woke up late at eight while klockner was still meeting in the back a technician called the house under the ruse of a wrong number after three rings the recorder came on and trevor announced he was not in please leave a message this happened occasionally when he was trying to sleep late but it usually worked well enough to roust him fmm bed klockner was notified at eightthirty that the house was completely still no shower no radio no television no stereo not a sound from the normal routine it was entirely possible hed gotten drunk at home by himself but they knew he had not spent last night at petes hed gone to a mall and arrived home apparently sober he could be sleeping klockner said unconcerned wheres his car in his driveway at nine wes and chap knocked on trevors door then opened it when there was no answer the rental sprang to life when they reported there was no sign of him and that his car was still there without panic klockner sent people to the beach to the coffee shops near the sea turtle even to petes which was not yet open they canvassed the area around his house and office by foot and by car and saw nothing at ten klockner called deville at langley the lawyers missing was the message every flight to nassau was checked nothing turned up no sign of a trevor carson devilles contact in bahamian customs could not be located nor could he find the banking supervisor theyd been bribing teddy maynard was in the middle of a briefing on north korean troop movements when he was interrupted by an urgent message that trevor carson their drunken lawyer in neptune beach florida was missing how can you lose a fool like him teddy growled at deville in a rare display of anger i dont know i dont believe this sorry teddy teddy shifted his weight and grimaced from the pain find him dammid he hissed the plane was a beech baron a twinengine owned by some doctors and chartered by eddie the pilot trevor had coaxed out of bed at six in the morning with the promise of cash on the spot and more under the table the official quote was for a roundtrip between daytona beach and nassautwo hours each way total of four at an hour plus some fees for landing and immigration and pilot downtime trevor kicked in another for eddies pocket if the trip took place immediately the geneva trust bank in downtown nassau opened at est and trevor was waiting when the doors were unlocked he barged into the office of mr brayshears and demanded immediate assistance he had almost a million dollars in his account from mr al konyers through wes and chap about from his dealings with the brethren with one eye on the door he pressed brayshears to help him move the money and quickly the money was owned by trevor carson and no one else brayshears had no choice there was a bank in bermuda managed by a friend of his which suited trevor just fine he didnt trust brayshears and he planned to keep moving the money until he felt safe for a moment trevor cast a lustful eye at the account of boomer realty currently with a balance of and change it was within his power during that fleeting moment to snatch their money too they were nothing but felons beech yarber the odious spicer all crooks and theyd had the arrogance to fire him they had forced him to run he tried to hate them enough to take their money but as he wavered back and forth he felt a soft spot for them three old men wasting away in prison a million was enough besides he was in a hurry if wes and chap suddenly charged in with guns it wouldnt have surprised him he thanked brayshears and ran from the building when the beech baron lifted off the runway at nassau international trevor couldnt help but laugh he laughed at the heist at the getaway at his luck at wes and chap and their rich client now minus a million at his shabby little law office now mercifully idle he laughed at his past and at his glorious future at three thousand feet he gazed downward at the still blue waters of the caribbean a lonely sailboat rocked along its captain at the wheel a scantily clad lady nearby that would be him down there in just a few short days he found a beer in a carryon cooler he drank it and fell sound asleep they landed on the island of eleuthera a place trevor had seen in a travel magazine hed bought the night before there were beaches and hotels and all the water sports he paid eddie in cash then waited an hour at the small airport for a taxi to happen by he bought clothes at a tourist shop in governors harbour then walked to a hotel on the beach he was amused at how quickly he stopped watching the shadows sure mr konyers had plenty of money but no one could afford a secret army big enough to track someone through the bahamas his future would be one of sheer delight he would not ruin it by looking over his shoulder he drank rum by the pool as fast as the bar maid could bring it at the age of fortyeighttrevor carson welcomed his new life in pretty much the same condition hed left his old one the law office of trevor carson opened on time and things proceeded as if nothing was amiss its owner had fled but its paralegal and office manager were on duty to take care of any business that might unexpectedly develop they listened in all the right places and heard nothing the phone rang twice before noon two misguided inquiries from souls lost in the yellow pages not a single client needed trevor not a single friend called to say hello wes and chap busied themselves by going through the few drawers and files they had not yet inspected nothing of consequence was found another crew combed every inch of trevors house primarily looking for the cash hed been paid not surprisingly they didnt find it the cheap briefcase was in a closet empty there was no trail trevor had just walked away with his cash the bahamian banking official was tracked to new york where he was visiting on government business he was reluctant to get involved from such a long distance but he eventually made his calls around pm it was confirmed that the money had been moved its owner had done so in person and the official would divulge nothing else where did the money go it was moved by wire and thats all he would tell deville his countrys banking reputation depended upon secrecy and he could reveal only so much he was corrupt but he did have his limits uscustoms cooperated after some initial reluctance trevors passport had been scanned at nassau international early that morning and so far he had not left the bahamas at least not officially his passport was redlisted if he used it to enter another country us customs would know it within two hours deville delivered a quick update to teddy andyork his fourth of the day then hung around for finther instructions hell make a mistake york said hell use his passport somewhere and well catch him he doesnt know whos chasing him teddy seethed but said nothing his agency had toppled governments and killed kings yet he was constantly amazed at how the little things often got botched one bumbling and witless lawyer from neptune beach slipped through their net while a dozen people were supposed to be watching he thought he was beyond surprises the lawyer was to be their link their bridge to the inside of trumble for a million dollars they thought they could trust him thered been no contingency plan for his sudden flight now they were scrambling to develop one we need someone inside the prison teddy said were close deville answered were working with justice and the bureau of prisons how close well in light of whats happened today i think we can have a man there inside trumble within fortyeight hours who is he his name is argrow eleven years with the agency age thirtynine solid credentials his story hell transfer into trumble from a federal prison in the virgin islands his paperwork will be cleared by the bureau here in washington so the warden down there wont ask any questions hes just another federal prisoner who requested a transfer and hes ready to go almost fortyeight hours do it now deville left again with the burden of a difficult task that suddenly had to be done overnight we have to find out how much they know teddy said almost in a mumble yes but we have no reason to believe they suspect anything york said ive read all their mail theres nothing to indicate they are particularly excited about konyers hes just one of their potential victims we bought the lawyer to stop him from snooping around behind konyers post office box hes off in the bahamas now drunk with his money so hes not a threat but we still dispose of him teddy said it was not a question of course ill feel better when hes gone teddy said a guard with a uniform but no gun entered the law library in midafternoon he first encountered joe roy spicer who was by the door to the chamber the warden would like to see you the guard said you andyarber and beech whats this about spicer asked he was reading an old copy of field stream none of my business he wants you now up front tell him were busy i aint tellin him nothin lets go they followed him to the administration building picking up other guards along the way until a regular entourage emerged from the elevator and stood before the wardens secretary she and she alone somehow managed to escort the brethren into the big office where emmitt broon was waiting when she was gone he said abruptly i have been notified by the fbi that your lawyer is missing no visible response from the three but each instantly thought about the money hidden offshore he continued he disappeared this morning and theres some money missing i dont have the details whose money they wanted to ask no one knew about their hidden funds had trevor stolen from someone else why are you telling us beech asked the real reason was that the justice department in washington had asked broon to inform the three of the latest news but the reason he gave was just thought youd want to know in case you needed to call him theyd fired trevor the day before and had not yet informed the administration that he was no longer their attorney of record whatre we gonna do for a lawyer spicer asked as if life couldnt go on thats your problem frankly id say you gentlemen have had enough legal counsel to last you many years what if he contacts us yarber asked knowing full well theyd never hear from trevor again you are to notify me immediately they agreed to do so whatever the warden wanted he excused them busters escape was less complicated than a trip to the grocery they waited until the next morning until breakfast was over and most of the inmates were busy with their menial jobsyarber and beech were on the track walking an eighth of a mile apart so that one was always watching the prison while the other watched the woods in the distance spicer loitered near the basketball court on the lookout for guards with no fences or towers or pressing security concerns guards were not that critical at trumble spicer saw none buster was lost in the whining noise of his weed eater which he slowly worked toward the track he took a break to wipe his face and look around spicer from fifty yards away heard the engine die he turned and quickly gave a thumbsup the sign to do it quickly buster stepped onto the track caught up with yarber and for a few steps they walked together are you sure you want to do this yarber asked yes im positive the kid appeared calm and ready then do it now pace yourself be cool thanks finn dont get caught son no way at the turn buster kept walking off the track across the freshly cut grass a hundred yards to some brush then he was gone beech and yarber saw him go then turned to watch the prison spicer was calmly walking toward them there was no sign of alarm around the courtyards or dorms or any of the other buildings on the prison grounds not a guard in sight they walked three miles twelve laps at the leisurely pace of fifteen minutes per mile and when theyd had enough they retired to the coolness of the chamber to relax and listen for news of the escape it would be hours before they heard a word busters pace was much faster once into the woods he began to jog without looking backwatching the sun he moved due south for half an hour the woods were not thick the undergrowth was thin and did not slow him he passed a deer stand twenty feet up in an oak tree and soon found a trail that ran to the southwest in his left front pants pocket he had cash given to him by finnyarber in his other front pocket he had a map beech had drawn by hand and in his rear pocket he had a yellow envelope addressed to a man named al konyers in chevy chase maryland all three were important but the envelope had received the most attention from the brethren after an hour he stopped to rest and to listen highway was his first landmark it ran east and west and beech figured he would find it within two hours he heard nothing and started running again he had to pace himself there was a chance his absence would be noticed just after lunch when the guards sometimes walked the grounds in a very casual inspection if one of them thought to look for buster then other questions might follow but after two weeks of watching the guards neither buster nor any of the brethren thought this was a possibility so he had at least four hours and probably a lot more because his workday ended at five when he turned in his weed eater when he didnt show theyd start looking around the prison after two hours of that theyd notify the surrounding police agencies that another one had walked away from trumble they were never armed and dangerous and no one got too excited no search parties no bloodhounds no helicopters hovering over the woods the county sheriff and his deputies would patrol the main roads and warn the citizens to lock their doors the escapees name went into a national computer they watched his home and watched his girlfriend and they waited for him to do something stupid after ninety minutes of freedom buster stopped for a moment and heard the whine of an eighteenwheeler not far away the woods stopped abruptly at a rightofway ditch and there was the highway according to beechs map the nearest town was several miles to the west the plan was to hike along the highway dodging traffic by using ditches and bridges until civilization in some form was found buster wore the standard prison issue of khaki pants and an olivecolored shortsleeve shirt both darkened with sweat the locals knew what the prisoners wore and if he were spotted walking down highway someone would call the sheriff get to town beech and spicer had told him and find different clothes then pay cash for a bus ticket and never stop running it took him three hours of ducking behind trees and jumping over roadside ditches before he saw the first buildings he moved away from the highway and cut through a hay field a dog growled at him as he stepped onto a street lined with house trailers behind one of them he noticed a clothesline with someones laundry hanging in the windless air he took a red and white pullover and threw away his olive shirt downtown was nothing more than two blocks of stores a couple of gas stations a bank some sort of town hall and a post office he bought denim shorts a tee shirt and a pair of boots at a discount store and changed in the employee restroom he found the post office inside the town hall he smiled and thanked his friends at trumble as he dropped their precious envelope into the outoftown slot buster caught a bus to gainesville where he purchased for the right to ride a bus anywhere in the united states for sixty days he headed west he wanted to get lost in mexico thirty the pennsylvania primary on april was to be governor tarrys last mighty effort undaunted by his dismal showing in the debate there two weeks earlier he campaigned with great enthusiasm but with very little money lake has it all he proclaimed at every stop feigning pride at being the pauper he did not leave the state for eleven straight days reduced to traveling in a large winnebago camper he ate his meals in the homes of supporters stayed in cheap motels and worked himself ragged shaking hands and walking neighborhoods lets talk about the issues he pleaded not about money lake too worked very hard in pennsylvania his jet traveled ten times faster than tarrys rv lake shook more hands made more speeches and he certainly spent more money the result was predictable lake received percent of the vote a landslide so embarrassing to tarry that he openly talked about quitting but he vowed to hang on for at least another week until the indiana primary his staff had left him he was million in debt hed been evicted from his campaign headquarters in arlington yet he wanted the good people of indiana to have the opportunity to see his name on the ballot and who knew lakes shiny new jet might catch on fire just like the previous one tarry licked his rather deep wounds and the day after the primary he promised to fight on lake almost felt sorry for him and he sort of admired his determination to endure until the convention but lake along with everybody else could do the math lake needed just forty more delegates to lock up the nomination and there were almost five hundred still out there the race was over after pennsylvania newspapers across the country confirmed his nomination his happy handsome face was everywhere a political miracle he was praised by many as a symbol of why the system worksan unknown with a message who came from nowhere and captured the attention of the people lakes campaign gave hope to every person who dreamed of running for president it didnt take months of pounding the back roads of iowa skip new hampshire it was such a small state anyway and he was condemned for buying his nomination before pennsylvania it was estimated hed spent million a more precise number was difficult because the money was being burned on so many fronts another million had been spent by dpac and half a dozen other highpowered lobbying groups all working on lakes behalf no other candidate in history had spent anything close the criticism stung lake and it dogged him day and night but hed rather have the money and the nomination than suffer the alternative big money was hardly taboo online entrepreneurs were making billions the federal government of all bumbling entities was showing a surplus nearly everybody had a job and an affordable mortgage and a couple of cars lakes nonstop polling led him to believe that the big money was not yet an issue with the voters in a november matchup against the vice president lake was now practically even he once again returned to washington from the wars of the west as a triumphant hero aaron lake lowly congressman from arizona was now the man of the hour over a quiet and very long breakfast the brethren read the jacksonville morning paper the only one allowed inside trumble they were very happy for aaron lake in fact they were thrilled with his nomination they were now among his most ardent supporters run aaron run the news of busters walk to freedom had created hardly a stir good for him the inmates were saying he was just a kid with a long sentence run buster run the escape wasnt mentioned in the morning paper they passed it around reading every word but the want ads and the obituaries they were waiting now no more letters would be written none would be brought in because theyd lost their courier their little scam was on hold until they heard from mr lake wilson argrow arrived at trumble in an unmarked green van handcuffed with two marshals pulling at his elbows hed flown with his escorts from miami to jacksonville of course at the expense of the taxpayers according to his paperwork he had served four months of a sixtymonth sentence for bank fraud he had requested a transfer for reasons that were not clear but his reasons were of no concern to anyone at trumble he was just another lowsecurity prisoner in the federal system they moved around all the time he was thirtynine years old divorced collegeeducated and his home address for prison records was in coral gables florida his real name was kenny sands an elevenyear veteran of the cia and though hed never seen the inside of a prison hed had much tougher assignments than trumble hed be there a month or two then request another transfer argrow maintained the cool facade of an old prison hand as he was processed but his stomach churned hed been assured that violence was not tolerated at trumble and he could certainly take care of himself but prison was prison he suffered through a onehour orientation by an assistant warden then was given a quick tour of the grounds he began to relax when he saw trumble for himself the guards had no guns and most of the inmates looked rather harmless his cell mate was an old man with a spotty white beard a career criminal whod seen many prisons and loved trumble he told argrow he planned to die there the man took argrow to lunch and explained the vagaries of the menu he showed him the game room where groups of thick men bunched around folding tables studying their cards every one with a cigarette stuck to the lips gamblings illegal his cell mate said with a wink they walked to the lifting area outdoors where the younger men sweated in the sun polishing their tans while their muscles expanded he pointed to the track in the distance and said you gotta love the federal government he showed argrow the library a place he never visited and he pointed to a corner and said thats the law library who uses it argrow asked we usually have some lawyers here right now we have some judges too judges three of em the old man had no interest in the library argrow followed him to the chapel then around the grounds again argrow thanked him for the tour then excused himself and returned to the library which was empty except for an inmate mopping a floor argrow went to the corner and opened a door to the law library joe roy spicer glanced up from his magazine and saw a man hed never seen before lookin for something he asked with no effort at being helpful argrow recognized the face from the file an exjustice of the peace caught stealing bingo profits what a lowlife im new he said forcing a smile just got here this is the law library it is i guess anybody can use it huh i guess spicer said you a lawyer nope a banker a few months earlier spicer wouldve hustled him for some legal work under the table of course but not now they no longer needed the nickelanddime stuff argrow looked around and did not see beech and yarber he excused himself and returned to his room contact was made lakes plan to rid himself of any memories of ricky and their illfated correspondence depended upon someone else he lake was simply too scared and too famous to sneak away again in the middle of the night in a disguise in the back of a taxi dashing through the suburbs to an allnight mailbox the risks were too great plus he seriously doubted if he could shake the secret service anymore he couldnt count the number of agents now assigned to protect him count hell he couldnt see them all the young ladys name was jayne shed joined the campaign in wisconsin and had quickly worked her way into the inner circle a volunteer at first she now earned a year as a personal aide to mr lake who trusted her completely she seldom left his side and theyd already had two little chats about jaynes future job in the white house at the right moment lake would give jayne the key to the box rented by mr al konyers and instruct her to get the mail close out the rental and leave no forwarding address he would tell her it was a box hed rented in an effort to monitor the sale of classified defense contracts back when he was convinced the iranians were buying data they should never see or some such tale she would believe him because she wanted to believe him if he were incredibly lucky there would be no letter from ricky the box would be forever closed and if a letter was waiting for jayne and if she was the least bit curious lake would simply tell her he had no idea who the person was she would ask nothing further blind allegiance was her strong suit he waited for the right moment he waited too long thirtyone it arrived safely with a million other letters tons of paperwork shipped into the capital to sustain the government for one more day it was sorted by zip code then by street three days after buster dropped it off rickys last letter to al konyers made it to chevy chase a routine check of mailbox america by a surveillance team found it the envelope was examined then quickly taken to langley teddy was between briefings alone for a moment in his office when deville rushed in holding a thin file we got this thirty minutes ago he said as he handed over three sheets of paper its a copy the original is in the file the director adjusted his bifocals and looked at the copies before he began reading there was the florida postmark same as always the handwriting was too familiar he knew it was serious trouble before he began reading dear al in your last letter you tried to end our correspondence sorry it wont be that easy ill get right to the point im not ricky and youre not al im in a prison not some fancy drug rehab clinic i know who you are mr lake i know youre having a great year just wrapped up the nomination and all and you have all that money pouring in they give us newspapers here at trumble and weve been following your success with great pride now that i know who al konyers really is im sure youd like for me to keep quiet about our little secret ill be happy to remain silent but it will cost you dearly i need money and i want out of prison i can keep secrets and i know how to negotiate the money is the easy part because you have so much of it my release will be more complicated but youre collecting all sorts of very powerful friends im sure youll think of something i have nothing to lose and im willing to ruin you if you dont negotiate with me my name is joe roy spicer im an inmate at trumble federal prisonyou figure out a way to contact me and do it quickly i will not go away sincerely joe roy spicer the next briefing was canceled deville foundyork and ten minutes later they were locked away in the bunker killing them was the first option discussed argrow could do it with the right tools pills and poisons and such yarber could die in his sleep spicer could drop dead on the track beech the hypochondriac could get a bad prescription from the prison pharmacy they were not particularly fit or healthy and certainly no match for argmw a nasty fall a broken neck there were many ways to make it look natural or accidental it would have to be done quickly while they were still waiting for a reply from lake but it would be messy and unduly complicated three dead bodies all at once in a harmless little prison like trumble and the three were close friends who spent most of their time together and they would each die in different ways within a very short period of time it would create an avalanche of suspicion what if argrow became a suspect his background was hidden to begin with and the trevor factor frightened them wherever he was there was the chance he would hear of their deaths the news would scare him even more but it might also make him unpredictable there was a chance he knew more than they thought deville would work on plans to take them out but teddy was very reluctant he had no qualms about killing the three but he was not convinced it would protect lake what if the brethren had told someone else there were too many unknowns make the plans deville was told but they would be used only when every other option was gone all scenarios were on the tableyork suggested for the sake of argument that the letter be returned to the box so lake could find it it was his screwup to begin with he wouldnt know what to do teddy said do we not yet the thought of aaron lake reacting to this ambush and somehow trying to silence the brethren was almost amusing but there was a strong element of justice to it lake had created this mess let him handle it actually we created this mess teddy said and well deal with it they couldnt predict and thus they couldnt control what lake would do somehow the fool had avoided their net long enough to drop something in the mail to ricky and hed been so stupid that the brethren now knew who he was not to mention the obvious lake was the type of person who secretly swapped letters with a gay pen pal he was living a double life and didnt deserve a lot of confidence confronting lake was discussed for a momentyork had been advocating a showdown since the first letter from trumble but teddy wasnt convinced the sleep hed lost fretting over lake was always filled with thoughts and hopes of stopping the mail long before now quietly take care of the problem then have a chat with the candidate oh how hed love to confront lake hed love to sit him in a chair over there and start flashing copies of all those damned letters up on a screen and a copy of the ad from out and about hed tell him about mr quince garbe in bakers iowa another idiot who fell for the scam and curtis vann gates in dallas how could you be so stupid he wanted to scream at aaron lake but teddy kept his eye on the bigger picture the problems with lake were small when compared to the urgency of national defense the russians were coming and when natty chenkov and the new regime seized power the world would change forever teddy had neutralized men far more powerful than three felonious judges rotting away in a federal prison meticulous planning was his strong suit patient tedious planning the meeting was interrupted by a message from devilles office trevor carsons passport had been scanned at a departure checkpoint at the airport in hamilton bermuda he left on a flight to san juan puerto rico that was scheduled to land in about fifty minutes did we know he was in bermuda york asked no we did not deville answered evidently he entered without using his passport maybe hes not as drunk as we thought do we have someone in puerto rico teddy asked his voice only a shade more excited of course said york lets pick up the scent have the plans changed for ole trevor deville asked no not at all teddy said not at all deville left to deal with the latest trevor crisis teddy called an assistant and ordered mint tea york was reading the letter again when they were alone he asked what if we separate them yes i was thinking of that do it quickly before they have time to confer send them to three prisons far apart put them in isolation for a period of time make sure they have no phone privileges no mail then what they still have their secret any one of them could conceivably ruin lake im not sure we have the contacts within the bureau of prisons it can be done if necessary ill have a chat with the attorney general since when did you become friends with the attorney general its a matter of national security three crooked judges sitting in a federal prison in florida can somehow affect national security id like to hear that conversation teddy sipped his tea with his eyes closed all ten forgers on the cup its too risky he whispered we make them mad they become even more erratic we cant take chances here suppose argrow can find their records york said think about itthese are con men convicted criminals no one will believe their story about lake unless they have proof the proof is documentation pieces of paper originals and copies of the correspondence the proof exists somewhere we find it take it from them then who will listen another small sip with his eyes closed another long pause teddy shifted slightly in his chair and grimaced from the pain true he said softly but im worried about somebody on the outside somebody we know nothing about these guys are a step ahead of us and they always will be were trying to figure out what theyve known for some time im not sure well ever catch up maybe theyve thought about losing their htde files im sure the prison has rules against maintaining such paperwork so theyre already hiding things the lake letters are much too valuable not to copy again and stash on the outside trevor was their mailman weve seen every letter hes carried out of trumble for the past month we think we have but we dont know for certain but who spicer has a wife shes been to see him yarbers getting a divorce but who knows what theyre doing shes visited in the past three months or maybe theyre bribing guards to run mail for them these people are bored and theyre smart and theyre very creative we cant just assume we know everything theyre up to and if we make a mistake here if we assume too much then mr aaron lake gets himself shoved out of the closet how how would they do it probably contact a reporter feed him one letter at a time until he was convinced it would work the press would go insane it cant happenyork we simply cannot allow it to happen deville returned in a rush us customs had been notified by the authorities in bermuda ten minutes after the flight departed for san juan trevor would be landing in eighteen minutes trevor was just following his money he had quickly grasped the fundamentals of wire transfers and was now perfecting the art in bermuda he had sent half of it to a bank in switzerland and the other half to a bank in grand cayman east or west that had been the great question the quickest flight out of bermuda went to london but the idea of sneaking through heathrow scared him he was not a wanted man at least not by the government no charges were filed or pending but the brits were so efficient at customs hed go west and take his chances in the caribbean he landed in san juan and went straight to a bar where he ordered a tall draft and studied the flights no hurry no pressure a pocket full of cash he could go anywhere do anything and take as long as he wanted he had another draft and decided to spend a few days in grand cayman with his money he went to the air jamaica counter and bought a ticket then back to the bar because it was almost five and he had thirty minutes before boarding of course he flew first class he boarded early so he could get another drink and as he watched the other passengers file by he saw a face hed seen before where was it now just moments ago somewhere in the airport a long thin face with a saltandpepper goatee and little narrow slits for eyes behind square glasses the eyes glanced at him just long enough to meet trevors then looked away down the aisle as if nothing had been seen it had been near the airline counter as trevor was turning to leave after buying his ticket the face was watching him the man was standing nearby studying the departure notices when youre on the run the stray glances and second looks and drifting eyes all seem more suspicious see a face once and you dont even know it see it again a half hour later and somebody is watching every move you make stop drinkingtrevor ordered himself he asked for coffee after takeoff and drank it quickly he was the first passenger off the plane in kingston and he walked quickly through the terminal through immigration no sign of the man behind him he grabbed his two small bags and raced for the taxi stand thirtytwo the jacksonville paper arrived at trumble each morning around seven four copies were taken to the game room where they were to be read and left behind for any of the inmates who cared about life on the outside most of the time joe roy spicer was the only one waiting at seven and he usually took one paper for himself because he needed to study the vegas lines throughout the day the scene rarely changed spicer with a tall styrofoam cup of coffee feet on a card table waiting for roderick the guard to bring the papers so spicer saw the story first at the bottom of the front page trevor carson a local lawyer whod been missing for some vague reason found dead outside a hotel in kingston jamaica shot twice in the head last night just after dark the story had no picture of trevor spicer noticedwhy would the paper have one on file why would anyone care if trevor died according to jamaican officials carson was a tourist whod apparently been robbed an unidentified source close to the scene had tipped the police as to the identity of mr carson since his wallet was missing the source seemed to know a lot the paragraph recapping trevors legal career was quite briefa former secretaryjan something or other had no comment the story had been thrown together and placed on the front page only because the victim was a murdered lawyer finn was at the far end of the track rounding the turn walking at a rapid clip in the damp early morning air his shirt already off spicer waited at the homestretch and handed him the paper without a word they found beech waiting in line in the cafeteria holding his plastic tray and staring forlornly at the crude piles of freshly scrambled eggs they sat together in a corner away from everyone else picking at their food talking in muted voices if he was running who the hell was he running from maybe lake was after him he didnt know it was lake he didnt have a clue did he okay then he was running from konyers the last time he was here he said konyers was the big one he said konyers knew about us then he disappeared the next day maybe he was just scared konyers confronted him threatened to expose his role in our scam and so trevor who wasnt the most stable guy to begin with decided to steal all he could and disappear whose money was missing thats what i want to know nobody knows about our money how could it be missing trevor probably stole from everybody he could then vanished happens all the time lawyers get in trouble crack up they raid their clients trust funds and bolt really asked spicer beech could think of three examples and yarber added a couple more for good measure so who killed him theres a good chance he was just in the wrong part of town outside the sheraton hotel i dont think so okay what if konyers iced him thats possible konyers somehow smoked out trevor learned he was the outside contact for ricky he put pressure on trevor threatened to nail him or whatever and trevor ran off to the caribbean trevor didnt know konyers was aaron lake and lake certainly has the money and power to track down a drunken lawyer what about us by now lake knows ricky aint ricky that joe roy here is the man and that he has friends with him in prison question is can he get to us i guess ill find out first spicer said with a nervous laugh and theres always the chance that trevor was down there in jamaica hanging around in the wrong part of town probably drunk and trying to pick up a woman and he got himself shot they all agreed on this that trevor was perfectly capable of getting himself killed may he rest in peace but only if he didnt steal their money they scattered for an hour or so beech went to the track to walk and think yarber was on the clock twenty cents an hour trying to fix a computer in the chaplains office spicer went to the library where he found mr argrow reading law books the law library was open no appointments were necessary but the unwritten rule was that you should at least ask one of the brethren before using their books argrow was new and obviously had not yet learned the rules spicer decided to give him a break they acknowledged each other with a nod then spicer got busy clearing tables and straightening books rumor has it you guys do legal work argrow said from across the room no one else was present you hear a lot of rumors around here my case is on appeal what happened at trial jury nailed me on three counts of bank fraud hiding money offshore in the bahamas the judge gave me sixty months ive served four im not sure im gonna last for fiftysix more i need some help with my appeals what court virgin islands i worked for a big bank in miami lots of drug money argrow was glib and fast and very anxious to talk and this irritated spicer but only slightly the reference to the bahamas had his attention for some reason i developed a fascination for money laundering i dealt with tens of millions every day and it was intoxicating i could move dirty money quicker than any banker in south florida still can but i made some bad friends and bad choices you admit youre guilty sure that puts you in the distinct minority around here no i was wrong but i think the sentence was too harsh somebody said you guys can get some time knocked off spicer was no longer concerned with the untidy tables and disorganized books he took a chair nearby and had time to talk we can take a look at your papers he said as if hed handled a thousand appeals you idiot argrow wanted to say you dropped out of high school in the tenth grade and stole a car when you were nineteenyour father pulled some strings and got the charges dropped you got yourself elected justice of the peace by voting dead people and stuffing absentee ballots and now youre stuck in a federal pen and trying to play the big shot and argtow conceded you mr spicer now have the power to bring down the next president of the united states what will it cost argrow asked how much do you have spicer asked just like a real lawyer not much i thought you knew how to hide money offshore oh i do believe me and at one point i had a nice bundle but i let it get away so you cant pay anything not much maybe a couple of thousand or so what about your lawyer he got me convicted i dont have enough to hire a new one spicer pondered the situation for a moment he realized he did indeed miss trevor things had been much simpler when they had him on the outside collecting money you still got contacts in the bahamas i have contacts all over the caribbean why because youll have to wire the money cash is forbidden around here you want me to wire two thousand dollars no i want you to wire five thousand dollars thats our minimum fee wheres your bank in the bahamas argrows eyes narrowed his eyebrows pushed together and while he was deep in thought so was spicer the minds were in the process of meeting why the bahamas argxow asked same reason you used the bahamas thoughts rattled around in both heads lemme ask you something spicer said you said you could move dirty money quicker than anybody else argrow nodded and said no problem can you still do it you mean from in here yes from here argrow laughed and shrugged as if nothing could be easier sure i still have some friends meet me here in an hour i might have a deal for you an hour later argrow returned to the law library and found the three judges already in position behind a table with papers and law books scattered about as if the supreme court of florida were in session spicer introduced him to beech and yarber and he took a seat across the table no one else was present they talked for a moment about his appeal and he was sufficiently vague on the details his file was en route from the other prison and they couldnt do much without it the appeal was a preliminary topic of conversation and both sides of the table knew it mr spicer tells us youre an expert on moving dirty money beech said i was until i got caught argrow said modestly i take it you have some we have a little account offshore money weve earned doing legal work and a few other things we cant be too open about as you know we cant charge for legal work but we do anyway added yarber and we get paid for it how much is in the account argrow asked knowing yesterdays closing balance to the exact penny lets wait on that spicer said theres a good chance the money may have disappeared argrow let the words hang for a second and managed to appear confused im sorry he said we had a lawyer beech said slowly each word measured he disappeared and he may have taken the money i see and this account is in a bank in the bahamas it was were not sure if it still is we doubt the money is still there yarber added but wed like to know for sure beech added which bank argrow asked geneva trust in nassau spicer answered glancing at his colleagues argrow nodded smugly as if he knew dark little dirty secrets about the bank you know the bank beech asked sure he said and let them hang for a long second and spicer said argrow was overcome with smugness and insider knowledge so he stood rather dramatically and walked around the small library for a moment deep in thought then moved closer to the table again look what do you guys want me to do lets cut to the chase the three looked at him then at each other and it was obvious they werent sure of two things a how much they trusted this man theyd just met and b what they really wanted from him but they figured the money was gone anyway so what was there to loseyarber said were not too sophisticated when it comes to moving dirty money that was not our original calling you understand forgive our lack of knowledge but is there any way to verify if the money is still where it once was were just not sure if the lawyer stole it beech added you want me to verify the balance of a secret account argrow asked yes thats it saidyarber we figure that maybe you still have some friends in the business spicer said treading water and were just curious as to whether theres any way to do this youre lucky argrow said and allowed the words to settle hows that beech asked you picked the bahamas actually the lawyer picked the bahamas spicer said anyway the banks are pretty loose there lots of secrets get told lots of officials get bribed most of the serious money launderers stay away from the bahamas panama is the current hot spot and of course grand cayman is still rock solid of course of course they all three nodded offshore was offshore wasnt it just another example of trusting an idiot like trevor argrow watched them with their puzzled faces and thought how truly clueless they were for three men with the ability to totally wreck the american electoral process they seemed awfully naive you havent answered our question spicer said anythings possible in the bahamas so you can do it i can try no guarantees heres the deal spicer said you verify the account and well do your appeals for free thats not a bad deal argrow said we didnt think so agreed agreed for an awkward second they just looked at one another proud of their mutual agreement but not sure who moved next finally argrow said ill need to know something about the account such as beech asked such as a name or a number the account name is boomer realty ltd the account number is dxn argrow scribbled some notes on a sheet of scrap paper just curious spicer said as they watched him closely how do you plan to communicate with your contacts outside phone argrow said without looking up not these phones beech said these phones are not secure yarber said you cant use these phones spicer said with an edge argrow smiled and acknowledged their concerns then he glanced over his shoulder and removed from his pants pocket an instrument of some sort not much larger than a pocketknife he held it between his thumb and index finger and said this is a phone gentlemen they stared in disbelief then watched as he quickly unfolded it from the top and the bottom and from one side so that when properly opened itstill looked much too small for any meaningful conversation its digital he said very secure who gets the monthly bill asked beech i have a brother in boca raton the phone and the service were gifts from him he snapped it back smartly and it vanished before their eyes then he pointed to the small conference room behind them to their chamber whats in there he asked just a conference room spicer said it has no windows right none except for that small one in the door all right what if i go in there get on the phone and go to workyou three stay here and watch out for me if anyone enters the library come knock on the door the brethren readily agreed though they did not believe argrow could pull it off the call went to the white van parked a mile and a half from trumble on a gravel road sometimes maintained by the county the road was next to a hay field farmed by a man theyd yet to meet the property line for the acreage owned by the federal government was a quarter of a mile away but from where the van was sitting there was no sign of a prison only two technicians were in the van one fully asleep in the front seat the other half asleep in the back with a headset on when argrow pressed the send button on his fancy little gadget a receiver in the van was activated and both men came to life hello he said this is argrow yes argrow chevy one here go ahead said the technician in the back im near the three stooges going through the motions supposedly making calls to friends on the outside to verify the existence of their account offshore so far things are progressing even faster than id hoped sounds like it roger ill check in later he pushed the end button but kept the phone at his head and appeared to be deep in conversation he sat on the edge of the table then he walked around some glancing occasionally at the brethren and beyond spicer couldnt help but sneak a look through the window of the door hes making calls he said excitedly what do you expect him to be doing asked yarber who was actually reading recent court decisions relax joe roy beech said the money disappeared with trevor twenty minutes passed and things became dull as usual while argrow worked the phones the judges killed time waiting at first then returning to more pressing business it had been six days since buster had left with their letter no word from buster meant hed walked away clean dropped off the note to mr konyers and was now somewhere far away give it three days to travel to chevy chase and the way they had it figured mr aaron lake should now be scrambling with a plan to deal with them prison had taught them patience only one deadline worried them lake had the nomination which meant he would be vulnerable to their blackmail until november if he won they would have four years in which to torment him but if he lost he would fade quickly away like all the losers wheres dukakis now beech had asked they had no plans to wait until november patience was one thing release was another lake was their one fleeting opportunity to walk away with enough money to coast forever they intended to give it a week then write another letter to mr al konyers in chevy chase they werent sure how to smuggle it out but they would think of something link the guard up front whom trevor had been bribing for months was their first prospect argrows phone presented an option if hell let us use it spicer said then we can call lake call his campaign office his congressional office call every damned number we can get from directory assistance leave the message that ricky in rehab really needs to see mr lake thatll scare the hell out of him but argrow will have a record of our calls or at least his brother will yarber said so well pay him for the calls and so what if they know were trying to call aaron lake right now half the country is trying to call him argrow wont have a clue why were doing it a brilliant idea one they pondered for a long time ricky in rehab could make the calls and leave the messages spicer in trumble could do the same poor lake would get hounded poor lake the man had money pouring in so fast he couldnt count it after an hour argrow emerged from the chamber and announced he was making progress i need to wait an hour then make a few more calls he said what about lunch they were anxious to continue their discussion and they did so over sloppy joes and coleslaw thirtythree pursuant to mr lakes precise instructions jayne drove alone to chevy chase she found the shopping center on western avenue and parked in front of mailbox america with mr lakes key she opened the box removed eight pieces of junk mail and placed them in a folder there were no personal letters she walked to the counter and informed the clerk that she wished to close the box on behalf of her employer mr al konyers the clerk pecked a few times on a keyboard the records indicated that a man named aaron l lake had rented the box in the name of al konyers about seven months earlier the rental had been paid for twelve months so nothing was owed that guy running for president the clerk asked as she slid a form across the counter yes jayne said signing where indicated no forwarding address no she left with the folder and headed south back into the city she had not stopped to question lakes storyabout renting the box in a clandestine effort to expose fraud at the pentagon it didnt matter to her nor did she have time to ask a lot of questions lake had them sprinting eighteen hours a day and she had far more important things to worry about he was waiting in his campaign office alone for the moment the offices and hallways around him were choked with assistants of a dozen varieties all running back and forth as if war were imminent but lake was enjoying a lull in the action she gave him the folder and left lake counted eight pieces of junk mailtaco delivery longdistance service a car wash coupons for this and for that and nothing from ricky the box was closed there was no forwarding address the poor boy would have to find someone else to help him through his new life lake fed the junk mail and the cancellation agreement through a small shredder under his desk then paused a moment to count his blessings he carried little baggage in life and hed made few mistakes writing to ricky had been a stupid thing to do yet he was walking away unscathed what a lucky man he smiled and almost giggled to himself then he bounced from his chair grabbed his jacket and rounded up his entouragethe candidate had meetings to attend then a lunch with defense contractors oh what a lucky man back in the corner of the law library with his three new friends guarding the perimeter like sleepy sentries argrow fiddled with the phone long enough to convince them hed pulled strings all through the dark and murky world of offshore banking two hours of pacing and mumbling and holding the phone to his head like a frantic stockbroker and he finally came out of the room good news gentlemen he said with a tired smile they huddled around eager for the results its still there he said then the great question the one theyd been planning the one that would verify whether argrow was a fraud or a player how much asked spicer a hundred and ninety thousand and small change he said and they exhaled in unison spicer smiled beech looked away yarber looked at argrow with a quizzical frown but a rather pleasant one according to their figures the balance was plus whatever paltry rate of interest the bank was paying he didnt steal it beech mumbled and they shared a pleasant memory of their dead lawyer who suddenly was not the devil theyd made him out to be i wonder why not spicer mused almost to himself well its still there argrow said thats a lot of legal work it certainly appeared to be and since neither of the three could think of a quick fib they just let it pass i suggest you move it if you dont mind my saying so argrow said this bank is known for its leaks move it where beech asked if the money were mine id move it to panama immediately this was a new issue a train of thought they had not pursued because they had been obsessed with trevor and his certain theft but they weighed it carefully anyway as if the matter had been discussed many times why would you move it beech asked its safe isnt it i guess argrow answered quick with a response he knew where he was going they did not but you see how loose the confidentiality can be i wouldnt use banks in the bahamas these days especially this one and we dont know if trevor told anyone about it spicer said always anxious to nail the lawyer if you want the money protected move it argrow said it takes less than a day and you wont have to worry about it and put the money to work this account is just sitting there drawing a few pennies in interest put it with a fund manager and let it earn fifteen or twenty percent youre not gonna be using it any time soon thats what you think pal they thought but he made perfect sense and i assume you can move it yarber said of course i can do you doubt me now all three shook their heads no sir they did not doubt him i have some nice contacts in panama think about it argrow glanced at his watch as if he had lost interest in their account and had a hundred pressing matters elsewhere a punch line was coming and he didnt want to push weve thought about it spicer said lets move it now he looked at three sets of eyes all looking back at him theres a fee involved he said like a seasoned money launderer what kinda fee spicer asked ten percent for the transfer who gets ten percent i do thats rather steep said beech its a sliding scale anything under a million pays ten percent anything over a hundred million pays one percent its pretty common in the business and its exactly the reason im wearing an olive prison shirt and not a thousanddollar suit thats pretty sleazy said spicer the man whod skimmed bingo profits from a charity lets not preach okay were talking about a small cut from money thats already tainted both here and there take it or leave it his tone was aloof an icy veteran whod cut much larger deals it was only and this from a stash theyd been certain was gone after his percent they still had roughly each and it wouldve been more if treacherous trevor hadnt raked so much off the top and besides they were confident of greener pastures just around the corner the loot in the bahamas was pocket change its a deal spicer said as he looked at the other two for approval they both nodded slowly all three were thinking the same thing now if the shakedown of aaron lake proceeded as they dreamed it would then serious money was coming their way they would need a place to hide it and maybe someone to help them they wanted to trust this new guy argrow lets give him the chance plus you do my appeals argrow said yes well do the appeals argrow smiled and said not a bad deal lemme make some more calls theres one thing you should know beech said okay the lawyers name was trevor carson he set up the account directed the deposits did everything really and he was murdered night before last in kingston jamaica argrow searched their faces for more yarber handed him a copy of the newspaper which he read very deliberately why was he missing he asked after a long silence we dont know beech said he left town and we got word through the fbi that he was missing we just assumed that hed stolen our money argrow handed the paper back to yarber and crossed his arms over his chest he cocked his head narrowed his eyes and managed to look suspicious let them sweat how dirty is this money he asked as if he might not want to get involved with it after all its not drug money spicer said quickly on the defensive as if all other money was clean we really cant say beech replied youve got a deal yarber said take it or leave it good move old boy argrow said to himself the fbi is involved he asked only with the lawyers disappearance beech said the fells know nothing about the offshore account let me get this straightyou got a dead lawyer the fbi an offshore account hiding dirty money right whatve you boys been up to you dont wanna know beech said i think youre right no ones forcing you to get involvedyarber said so a decision had to be made for argrow the red flags were up the minefield was marked if he went forward then he did so armed with sufficient warnings that his three new friends could be dangerous this of course meant nothing to argrow but to beech spicer and yarber the opening in their tight little partnership however slight it might be meant they were admitting another conspirator they would never tell him about their scam and certainly not about aaron lake nor would he share in any more of their loot unless he earned it with his wiring prowess but he already knew more than he should they had no choice desperation played no small role in their decision with trevor theyd had access to the outside something theyd taken for granted now that he was gone their world had shrunk considerably though they had yet to admit it firing him had been a mistake with perfect hindsight they shouldve warned him and told him everything about lake and the tampered mail hed been far from perfect but they needed all the help they could get perhaps they wouldve hired him back a day or two later but they never had the chance trevor bolted and now he was gone forever argrow had access he had a phone and friends he had guts and he knew how to get things done perhaps they might need him but they would take it slowly he scratched his head and frowned as if a headache was coming dont tell me anything else he said i dont wanna know he returned to the conference room and closed the door behind him then perched on the edge of the table and once again seemed to be firing calls all over the caribbean they heard him laugh twice probably a joke with an old friend surprised to hear his voice they heard him swear once but had no idea at whom or for what reason his voice rose and fell and try as they might to read court decisions and dust off old books and study vegas odds they couldnt ignore the noise from the room argrow put on quite a show and after an hour of useless chatter he came out and said i think i can finish it tomorrow but we need an affidavit signed by one of you stating that you are the sole owners of boomer realty who sees the affidavit beech asked only the bank in the bahamas theyre getting a copy of the story about mr carson and they want verification about the ownership of the account the idea of actually signing any type of document in which they admitted they had anything to do with the dirty money terrified them but the request made sense is there a fax machine around here argrow asked no not for us beech replied im sure the warden has one spicer said just trot up there and tell him you need to send a document to your offshore bank it was unnecessarily sarcastic argrow glared at him then let it pass okay tell me how to get the affidavit from here to the bahamas how does the mail run the lawyer was our mail runner yarber said everything else is subject to inspection how close do they inspect the legal mail they glance at it spicer said but they cant open it argrow paced around a bit deep in thought then for the benefit of his audience he stepped between two racks of books so that he could not be seen from outside the law library he deftly unfolded his gadget punched numbers and stuck it to his ear he said yes wilson argrow here is jack in yes tell him its important he waited who the hells jack spicer asked from across the room beech and yarber listened but watched for passersby my brother in boca argrow said hes a real estate lawyer hes visiting me tomorrow then into the phone he said hey jack its me you comin tomorrow good can you come in the morning good around ten ill have some mail going out good hows mom good ill see you in the morning the prospect of the resumption of mail intrigued the brethren argrow had a brother who was a lawyer and he had a phone and brains and guts he slid the gadget back into his pocket and walked from the racks ill give the affidavit to my brother in the morning hell fax it to the bank by noon the next day the money will be in panama safe and sound and earning fifteen percent piece of cake were assuming we can trust your brother yarber said with your life argrow said almost offended by the question he was walking to the door ill see you guys later i need some fresh air thirtyfour treyors mother arrived from scranton she was with her sister trevors aunt helen they were both in their seventies and in reasonably good health they got lost four times between the airport and neptune beach then meandered through the streets for an hour before stumbling on trevors house a place his mother hadnt seen in six years she hadntseen trevor in two years aunt helen hadnt seen him in at least ten not that she particularly missed him his mother parked the rental car behind his little beetle and had a good cry before getting out what a dump aunt helen said to herself the front door was unlocked the place had been abandoned but long before its owner fled the dishes had collected in the sink the garbage had gone unattended the vacuum hadnt left the closet the odor drove aunt helen out first and trevors mother soon followed they had no clue what to do his body was still in jamaica in a crowded morgue and according to the unfriendly young man shed talked to at the state department it would cost to ship him home the airlines would cooperate but the paperwork was tied up in kingston it took a half hour of bad driving to find his office by then word was out chap the paralegal was waiting at the reception desk trying to look sad and busy at the same time wes the office manager was in a back room just to listen and observe the phone had rung constantly the day the news broke but after a round of condolences from fellow lawyers and a client or two it went silent again on the front door was a cheap wreath paid for by the cia aint that nice his mother said as they waddled up the sidewalk another dump thought aunt helen chap greeted them and introduced himself as trevors paralegal he was in the process of trying to close the office a most difficult task wheres the girl his mother asked her eyes red from grieving she left some time back trevor caught her stealing oh dear would you like some coffee he asked that would be nice yes they sat on the dusty and uneven sofa while chap fetched three coffees from a pot that just happened to be fresh he sat across from them in an unstable wicker chair the mother was bewildered the aunt was curious her eyes darting around the office looking for any sign of prosperity they were not poor but at their ages affluence would never be attained im very sorry about trevor chap said its just awful mrs carson said her lip quivering her cup shook and coffee splashed onto her dress she didnt notice it did he have a lot of clients aunt helen asked yes he was very busy a good lawyer one of the best ive ever worked with and youre a secretary mrs carson asked no im a paralegal i go to law school at night are you handling his affairs aunt helen asked well not really chap said i was hoping thats why the two of you were here oh were too old his mother said how much money did he leave asked the aunt chap stepped it up a notch this old bitch was a bloodhound i have no idea i didnt handle his money who did i guess his accountant whos his accountant i dont know trevor was very private about most things he certainly was his mother said sadly even as a boy she splashed her coffee again this time on the sofa you pay the bills around here dont you asked the aunt notrevor took care of his money well listen young man they want six hundred dollars to fly him home from down in jamaica why was he down there his mother interrupted it was a short vacation chap said and she doesnt have six hundred dollars helen finished yes i do oh theres some cash here chap said and aunt helen looked satisfied how much she asked a little over nine hundred dollars trevor liked to keep plenty of petty cash give it to me aunt helen demanded do you think we should asked his mother youd better take it chap said gravely if not it will just go into his estate and the irs will get it all what else will go into his estate asked the aunt all this chap said waving his arms at the office while he walked to the desk he removed a wrinkled envelope stuffed with bills of all denominations money theyd just transferred from the rental across the street he gave it to helen who snatched it and counted the money nine twenty and some change chap said which bank did he use helen asked i have no idea like i said he was very private about his money and in one respect chap was telling the truth trevor had wired the from the bahamas to bermuda and from there the trail had disappeared the money was now hidden in a bank somewhere in a numbered account accessible only by trevor carson they knew he was headed for grand cayman but the bankers there were famous for their secrecy two days of intense digging had revealed nothing the man who shot him took his wallet and room key and while the police were inspecting the crime scene the gunman searched the hotel room there was about in cash hidden in a drawer and nothing else of any significance not a clue as to where trevor had parked his money it was the collective wisdom at langley that trevor for some reason suspected he was being followed closely the bulk of the cash was missing though he could have deposited it in a bank in bermuda his hotel room had been secured without a reservationhe simply walked in from the street and paid cash for one night a person on the run chasing from one island to the next would have somewhere on his body or in his effects evidence of banking activities trevor had none while aunt helen riffled through what would surely be the only cash theyd net from the estate wes thought about the fortune lost somewhere in the caribbean what do we do now trevors mother asked chap shrugged and said i guess you need to bury him can you help us thats not really something i do i should we take him back to scranton helen asked thats up to you how much would that cost helen asked i have no idea ive never had to do anything like this but all his friends are here his mother said touching her eyes with a tissue he left scranton a long time ago helen said her eyes cutting in all directions as if there was a long story behind trevors leaving scranton no doubt thought chap im sure his friends here will want a memorial service mrs carson said actually one is already planned chap said it is she said thrilled yes its tomorrow at four oclock where a place called petes just down the street a few blocks petes helen said its well its sort of a restaurant a restaurant what about a church i dont think he went he did when he was a boy his mother said in defense in memory of trevor the five oclock happy hour would begin at four and run until midnight fiftycent longneckstrevors favorite should we go asked helen sensing trouble i wouldnt think so why not asked mrs carson it could be a rough crowda bunch of lawyers and judges you know the scene he frowned at helen and she got the message they asked about funeral parlors and cemetery lots and chap felt himself getting dragged deeper and deeper into their problems the cia killed trevorwas it expected to send him off with a proper burial klockner thought not after the ladies left wes and chap finished the removal of the cameras wires mikes and phone taps they tidied up the place and when they locked the doors for the last time trevors office had never been so orderly half of klockners team had already left town the other half monitored wilson argrow inside trumble and they waited when the forgers at langley finished with argrows court file it fit in a cardboard box and was flown to jacksonville on a small jet along with three agents it contained among many other things a fiftyonepage indictment handed down by a grand jury in dade county a correspondence file filled with letters from argrows defense lawyer and the us attorneys office a thick file of motions and other pretrial maneuverings research memos a list of witnesses and summaries of their testimonies a trial brief jury analysis an abstract of the trial presentencing reports and the final sentence itself it was reasonably well organized though not too neat to arouse suspicion copies were smudged and pages were missing and staples were hanging off little touches of reality carefully added by the good folks in documents to create authenticity ninety percent of it would not be needed by beech andyaxber but its sheer heft made it impressive even the cardboard box had some age on it the box was delivered to trumble by jack argrow a semiretired real estate lawyer in boca raton florida and brother of the inmate lawyer argrows state bar certification had been faxed to the proper bureaucrat at trumble and his name was on the approved list of attorneys jack argrow was roger lyter a thirteenyear man with a law degree from texas hed never met kenny sands who was wilson argrow the two shook hands and said hello while link looked suspiciously at the cardboard box sitting on the table whats in there he asked its my court records wilson said just paperwork jack said link stuck a hand in the box and moved some files around and in a few seconds the search was over and he stepped out of the room wilson slid a paper across the desk and said this is the affidavit wire the money to the bank in panama then get me written verification so ill have something to show them less ten percent yes thats what they think the geneva trust bank in nassau had not been contacted to do so wouldve been futile and risky no bank would release funds under the circumstances argrow was creating and questions would be raised if he tried the wire transfer going to panama was new money langley is quite anxious the lawyer said im ahead of schedule the banker replied the box was emptied on a table in the law library beech and yarber began sifting through its contents while argrow their new client watched with feigned interest spicer had better things to do he was in the middle of his weekly poker game wheres the sentencing report beech asked scratching through the pile i want to see the indictment yarber mumbled to himself they found what they wanted and both settled into their chairs for a long afternoon of reading beechs choice was quite dull yarbers however was not the indictment read like a crime narrative argrow along with seven other bankers five accountants five securities brokers two lawyers eleven men identified only as drug traffickers and six gentlemen from colombia had organized and run an elaborate enterprise designed to take drug proceeds in the form of cash and turn them into respectable deposits at least million had been laundered before the ring was infiltrated and it appeared as though their man argrow was right in the thick of things yarber admired him if half the allegations were true then argrow was a very smart and talented financier argrow became bored with the silence and left to stroll around the prison when yarber finished reading the indictment he interrupted beech and made him read it beech enjoyed it too surely he said hes got some of the loot buried somewhere you know he does yarber agreed four hundred million bucks and thats just what they could find what about his appeal doesnt look good the judge followed the guidelines i see no error poor guy poor guy my ass hell be out four years before me i dont think so mr beech weve spent our last christmas in prison do you really believe that hadee asked indeed i do beech placed the indictment back on the table then stood and stretched and paced around the room we shouldve heard something by now he said very softly though no one else was there patience but the primaries are almost over hes back in washington most of the time hes had the letter for a week he cant ignore it hadee hes trying to figure out what to do thats all the latest memo from the bureau of prisons in washington baffled the warden who in hells name up there had nothing better to do than to stare at a map of the federal prisons and decide which one to meddle with that day he had a brother making selling used cars and there he was making half that much running a prison and reading idiotic memos from pencilpushers making and not doing a productive damned thing he was so sick of it re attorney visitation trumble federal prison disregard prior order said order restricting attorney visitation to tuesdays thursdays and saturdays from pm to pm attorneys are now permitted to visit seven days a week from am to pm it takes a dead lawyer to get the rules changed he mumbled to himself thirtyfive deep in a basement garage they rolled teddy maynard into his van and locked the doors york and deville sat with him a driver and a bodyguard handled the van which had a television a stereo and a small bar with bottled water and sodas all of which were ignored by teddy he was subdued and dreading the next hour he was tiredtired of his work tired of the fight tired of forcing himself through another day then another fight it six more months he kept telling himself then give it up and let someone else worry about saving the world hed go quietly to his small farm in west virginia where hed sit by the pond watch the leaves fall into the water and wait for the end he was so tired of the pain there was a black car in front of them and a gray one behind and the little convoy made its way around the beltway then east across the roosevelt bridge and onto constitution avenue teddy was silent so therefore york and deville were too they knew how much he loathed what he was about to do he talked to the president once a week usually on wednesday morning always by phone if teddy had his way they last saw each other nine months earlier when teddy was in the hospital and the president needed to be briefed the favors usually fell to an equal level but teddy hated to be on the same footing with any president hed get the favor he wanted but it was the asking that humiliated him in thirty years hed survived six presidents and his secret weapon had been the favors gather the intelligence hoard it rarely tell the president everything and occasionally giftwrap a small miracle and deliver it to the white house this president was still pouting over the humiliating defeat of a nuclear test ban treaty teddy had helped sabotage the day before the senate killed it the cia leaked a classified report raising legitimate concerns about the treaty and the president got flattened in the stampede he was leaving office a lame duck more concerned with his legacy than with the pressing matters of the country teddy had dealt with lame ducks before and they were impossible since they wouldnt face the voters again they dwelt on the big picture in their waning days they liked to travel with lots of their friends to foreign lands where they held summits with other lame ducks they worried about their presidential libraries and their portraits and their biographies so they spent time with historians as the clock ticked they became wiser and more philosophical and their speeches became grander they talked of the future of the challenges and the way things ought to be conveniently ignoring the fact that theyd had eight years to do all the things that needed to be done there was nothing worse than a lame duck and lake would be just as bad if and when he had the chance lake the very reason teddy was trekking to the white house hat in hand to grovel for a while they were cleared through the west wing where teddy suffered the indignity of having his wheelchair examined by a secret service agent then they rolled hint to a small office next to the cabinet morn a busy appointment secretary explained with no apology that the president was running late teddy smiled and waved her off and mumbled something to the effect that this president had never been on time for anything hed suffered a dozen fussy secretaries just like her in the same position she was now in and the others were long gone she led york and deville and the others away down to the dining room where they would eat by themselves teddy waited as he knew he would he read a thick report as if time meant nothing ten minutes passed they brought him coffee two years ago the president had visited langley and teddy had made him wait for twentyone minutes he needed a favor then the president did needed a little matter kept quiet the only advantage to being crippled was that he didnt have to jump to his feet when the president entered the room he finally arrived in a rush with aides scrambling behind him as if this would impress teddy maynard they shook hands and made the required greetings as the aides got rid of themselves a waiter appeared and placed small green salads before them its good to see you the president said with a soft voice and drippy smile save it for television teddy thought and he couldnt bring himself to return the lie youre looking well he said only because it was partially truethe president had a new tint to his hair and he looked younger they ate their salads and a quietness settled around them neither wanted a long lunch the french are selling toys to the north koreans again teddy said offering a crumb what kinds of toys the president asked though he knew precisely about the trafficking and teddy knew he knew its their version of stealth radar which is quite stupid because they havent perfected it yet but the north koreans are even dumber because theyre paying for it theyll buy anything from france especially if the french try to hide it the french of course know this so its all cloak and dagger and the north koreans pay top dollar the president pushed a button and the waiter appeared to remove their plates another brought chicken and pasta hows your health the president asked about the same ill probably leave when you do this pleased them both the prospect of the other leaving for no apparent reason the president then launched into a windy narrative about his vice president and what a wonderful job he would do in the oval office he ignored his lunch and became very earnest in his opinions of what a fine human being and brilliant thinker and capable leader the man was teddy played with his chicken how do you see the race the president asked i honestly dont care teddy said lying again as i told you im leaving washington when you do mr president im retiring to my little farm where theres no television no newspapers nothing but a little fishing and a lot of rest im tired sir aaron lake scares me the president said you dont know the half of it teddy thought why he asked taking a bite eat and let him talk a single issue nothing but defense you give the pentagon unlimited resources and theyll waste enough to feed the third world and all this money worries me it never worried you before the last thing teddy wanted was a long useless conversation about politics they were wasting time the sooner he finished his business the sooner he could return to the safety of langley im here to ask a favor he said slowly yes i know what can i do for you the president was smiling and chewing enjoying both the chicken and the rare moment of having the upper hand its a little out of the ordinary id like clemency for three federal prisoners the chewing and smiling stopped not out of shock but out of confusion clemency was usually a simple matter unless it involved spies or terrorists or infamous politicians spies the president asked no judges one from california one from texas one from mississippi theyre serving their time together in a federal prison in florida judges yes mr president do i know these people i doubt it the one from california was once the chief justice of the supreme court out there he got himself recalled then had a little trouble with the irs i think i remember that he was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to seven years hes served two the one from texas was a trial judge a reagan appointee he got drunk and killed a couple of hikers inyellowstone i do remember that but vaguely it was several years ago the one from mississippi was a justice of the peace who got caught embezzling bingo profits i mustve missed that one there was a long pause as they considered the questions the president was bewildered and not certain where to start teddy wasnt sure what was coming so they finished eating in silence neither wanted dessert the request was an easy one at least for the president the felons were virtually unknown as were their victims any fallout would be quick and painless especially for a politician whose career was less than seven months from being over hed been pressured to grant far more difficult pardons the russians always had a few spies they lobbied to get back there were two mexican businessmen locked away in idaho for drug trafficking and every time a treaty of some sort was on the table their clemency became an issue there was a canadian jew serving a life sentence for spying and the israelis were determined to get him out three unknown judges the president could sign his name three times and the matter would be over teddy would owe him it would be a simple matter but that was no reason to make things easy for teddy im sure theres a good reason for this request he said of course a matter of grave national security not really just a few favors for old friends old friends do you know these men no but i know their friends the lie was so obvious the president almost jumped at it how could teddy know the friends of three judges who just happened to be serving time together nothing would come from grilling teddy maynard nothing but frustration and the president would not stoop that low he would not beg for information hed never get whatever teddys motives were he would take them to his grave this is a bit confiising the president said with a shrug i know lets leave it at that whats the fallout not muchthe families of the two kids who were killed in yellowstone might squawk and i wouldnt blame them how long ago was it three and a half years you want me to pardon a republican federal judge hes not a republican now mr president they have to swear off politics once they take the bench now that hes been convicted he cant even vote im sure if you granted clemency hed become a big fan of yours im sure he would if itll make matters easier these gentlemen will agree to leave the country for at least two years why it might look bad if they return home folks will know that they somehow got out early this can be kept very quiet did the judge from california pay the taxes he tried to evade he did and did the guy from mississippi repay the money he stole yes sir all the questions were superficial he had to ask something the last favor had dealt with nuclear spying the cia had a report documenting widespread infiltration of chinese spies in and through virtually all levels of the us nuclear arms program the president learned of the report just days before he was scheduled to visit china for a highly touted summit he asked teddy to come have lunch and over the same chicken and pasta he asked that the report be held for a few weeksteddy agreed later he wanted the report modified to place more blame on prior administrations teddy rewrote it himself when it was finally released the president deflected most of the blame chinese spying and national security versus three obscure ex judges teddy knew he would get the pardons if they leave the country where will they go the president asked were not sure yet the waiter brought coffee when he was gone the president asked will this in any way hurt the vice president and with the same expressionless face teddy said no how could it you tell me i have no clue what youre doing theres nothing to worry about mr president im asking for a small favor with a little luck this will not be reported anywhere they sipped their coffee and both wanted to leave the president had a full afternoon with more pleasant matters teddy needed a nap the president was relieved it was such a benign request teddy was thinking if you only knew give me a few days to do the background the president said these requests are pouring in as you might guess seems everybody wants something now that my days are numbered your last month here will be your happiest teddy said with a rare grin ive seen enough presidents to know after forty minutes together they shook hands and promised to talk in a few days there were five exlawyers at trumble and the newest one was using the library when argrow entered poor guy was up to his elbows in briefs and legal pads working feverishly no doubt pursuing his last feeble appeal spicer was rearranging law books and managing to look sufficiently busy beech was in the chamber writing somethingyarber was absent argrow removed a folded sheet of white paper from his pocket and gave it to spicer i just saw my lawyer he whispered what is it spicer asked holding the paper its a wire confirmation your money is now in panama spicer looked at the lawyer across the room but he was oblivious to everything except his legal pad thanks he whispered argrow left the room and spicer took the paper to beech who examined it carefully their loot was now safely guarded by the first coast bank of panama thirtysix joe roy had dropped eight more pounds was down to ten cigarettes a day and averaging twentyfive miles a week around the track argrow found him there walking and pacing in the late afternoon heat mr spicer we need to talk argrow said two more laps joe roy said without breaking stride argrow watched him for a few seconds then jogged fifty yards until he caught up mind if i join he asked not at all they went into the first turn stride for stride i just met with my lawyer again argrow said your brother spicer asked breathing heavily his paces were not nearly as graceful as argrows a man twenty years younger yes hes talked to aaron lake spicer stopped as if hed hit a wall he glared at argrow then looked at something in the distance like i said we need to talk i suppose we do spicer said ill meet you in the law library in half an hour argrow said and walked away spicer watched him until he disappeared there was no jack argrow attorneyatlaw in the boca raton yellow pages and this initially caused concern finnyarber frantically worked the unsecured phone seeking directory assistance all over south floridawhen he asked for pompano beach the operator said one moment please and finn actually smiled he scribbled down the number then dialed it a recorded voice said youve reached the law offices of jack argrow mr argrow keeps hours by appointment only so please leave your name and number and a brief description of the real estate youre interested in and well get in touch with you finn hung up and walked quickly across the lawn to the law library where his colleagues were waitingargrow was already ten minutes late a moment before he arrived the same exlawyer entered the room carrying a bulky file evidently ready to spend hours trying to save himself to ask him to leave would cause a fight and create suspicion and besides he wasnt the type who respected judges anyway one by one they retired to the small conference room where argrow joined them the room was cramped when beech andyarber worked there writing their letters with argrow as the fourth man in and bringing no small amount of pressure the room had never felt so crowded they sat around the small table each able to reach and touch the other three i know only what ive been told argrow began my brother is a semiretired lawyer in boca raton he has some money and for years hes been active in republican politics in south floridayesterday he was approached by some people who work for aaron lake they had investigated matters and knew that i was his brother and that i was here in trumble along with mr spicer they made promises swore him to secrecy and now hes sworn me to secrecy now that everything is nice and confidential i think you can connect the dots spicer had not showered his shirt and face were still wet but his breathing had slowed not the slightest sound from either beech or yarber the brethren were in a collective trance keep going they said with their eyes argrow looked at the three faces and pushed onward he reached into his pocket and removed a sheet of paper which he unfolded and laid before them it was a copy of their last letter to al konyers the outing letter the extortion demand signed by joe roy spicer current address of trumble federal prison they had the words memorized so there was no need to read it again they recognized the handwriting that of poor little ricky and they realized that it had now come full circle from the brethren to mr lake from mr lake to argrows brother from argrows brother back to trumble all in thirteen days spicer finally picked it up and glanced at the words i guess you know everything dont you he asked i dont know how much i know tell us what theyve told you youre running a scam the three of you you advertise in gay magazines you develop relationships with older men by mail you somehow learn their true identities then you extort money from them thats a pretty fair summary of the game beech said and mr lake made the mistake of answering one of your ads i dont know when he did this and i dont know how you found out who he was there are some gaps in the plot as far as im concerned its best to keep it that way yarber said fair enough i didnt volunteer for this job what will you get out of it spicer asked early release ill spend a few more weeks around here then theyll move me again ill walk by the end of the year and if mr lake gets elected then ill get a full pardon not a bad deal my brother gets a huge favor from the next president so youre the negotiator beech said no im the messenger then shall we begin the first move belongs to you youve got the letter we want some money and we want out of this place how much money two million each spicer said and it was obvious this had been discussed many times already all six eyes watched argrow waiting for the twitch the fiown the shock but there was no reaction just a pause as he returned their stares i have no authority here okay i cant say yes or no to your demands all i do is relay the details to my brother we read the newspaper every day beech said mr lake has more money than he can spend right now six million is a drop in the bucket he has seventyeight million on hand with no debt yarber added whatever argrow said im just the courier the mail runner sort of like trevor they froze again with the mention of their dead lawyer they glared at argrow whose fingernails had caught his attention and they wondered if the trevor comment had been laid across the table as some sort of warning how deadly had their game become they were giddy with thoughts of money and freedom but how safe were they now how safe would they be in the future they would always know lakes secret and the terms of the money argrow asked very simple spicer said all of it up front all of it wired to some delightful little place probably panama okay now what about your release argrow asked what about it asked beech any suggestions not really we thought mr lake could take care of that he has lots of friends these days yes but hes not the president yet he cant lean on the right people yet were not waiting until january when hes inaugurated yarber said in fact were not waiting until november to see if he wins so you want to be released now pretty damned quick spicer said does it matter how youre released they thought for a moment then beech said it has to be clean were not running for the rest of our lives were not looking over our shoulders do you leave together yes yarber said and we have some definite plans on how we want to do it first though we need to agree on the important thingsmoney and exactly when we walk out of here fair enough from this side of the table theyll want your files all of the letters and notes and records from your scam obviously mr lake has to receive assurances that the secrets will be buried if we get what we want beech said he has nothing to worry about well gladly forget we ever heard of aaron lake but we must warn you so you can warn mr lake that if anything happens to us his story will be told anyway we have an outside contact yarber said its a delayed reaction spicer added as if he were helping explain the unexplainable something happens to us like for instance the same thing that happened to trevor and a few days later a little delay bomb goes off mr lake gets himself outed anyway that wont happen argnow said youre the messenger you dont know what will or will not happen beech said lecturing these are the same people who killed trevor youre not sure of that no but we have our opinions lets not argue something we cant prove gentlemen argrow said ending the session ill see my brother at nine in the morning lets meet here at ten argrow left the room left them sitting trancelike deep in thought counting their money but afraid to start spending it he headed for the track but turned away when he saw a group of inmates jogging he roamed the grounds until he found a secluded spot behind the cafeteria then he called klockner within an hour teddy was briefed thirtyseven the am bell shrieked through trumble through the corridors of the dorms across the lawns around the buildings into the surrounding woods it lasted for exactly thirtyfive seconds most inmates could tell you and by the time it quit no one was left asleep it jolted them to life as if important events were planned that day and they had to hurry and get ready but the only pressing matter was breakfast the bell startled beech spicer and yarber but it didnt wake them sleep had been elusive the reasons obvious they lived in different dorms but not surprisingly they met in line for coffee at ten minutes after six with their tall cups and without a word they walked to the basketball court where they sat on a bench and sipped in the early dawn they watched the prison grounds the track was behind them how many more days would they wear their olive shirts and sit in the florida heat getting paid pennies by the hour for doing nothing just waiting dreaming drinking endless cups of coffee would it be a month or two were they talking days now the possibilities had robbed them of sleep there are only two possible ways beech was saying he was the federal judge and they listened carefully though it was familiar ground the first is to go back to the sentencing jurisdiction and file a motion for reduced time under very narrow circumstances the trial judge has the authority to release an inmate its rarely done though did you ever do it spicer asked no asshole for what reasons yarber asked only when the prisoner has provided new information about old crimes if the prisoner provides substantial assistance to the authorities then he might get a few years off thats not encouraging yarber said whats number two spicer asked were shipped out to a halfway house a really nice one where they dont expect us to live by the rules the bureau of prisons has sole authority in placing inmates if the right pressure is applied by our new friends in washington then the bureau could move us out and basically forget about us dont you have to live in a halfway house spicer asked yes in most of them but theyre all different some are locked down at night with strict rules others are very laid backyou can phone in once a day or once a week its all up to the bureau but well still be convicted felons spicer said doesnt bother me yarber said ill never vote again i have an idea beech said it came to me last night as part of our negotiations we make lake agree to pardon us if hes elected i thought of that too spicer said so did i saidyarber but who cares if we have a record the only thing that matters is that we get out it wont hurt to ask beech replied they concentrated on their coffee for a few minutes argrows making me nervous finn finally said hows that well he drops in here from nowhere and suddenly becomes our best friend he does a magic trick with our money gets it wired to a safer bank now hes the point man for aaron lake keep in mind somebody out there was reading our mail and it wasnt lake he doesnt bother me spicer said lake had to find somebody to talk to us he pulled some strings did some research found out that argrow was here and that he had a brother they could talk to thats awfully convenient dont you think beech asked you too huh maybe finns got a point we know for a fact that somebody else got involved who thats the big question finn said thats why i havent slept in a week theres somebody else out there do we really care spicer asked if lake can get us outta here fine if somebody else can get us outta here whats wrong with that dont forget trevor beech said two bullets in the back of the head this place might be safer than we think spicer was not convinced he finished a drink and said do you really think that aaron lake a man about to be elected president of the united states would order a hit on a worthless lawyer like trevor no repliedyarber he would not its much too risky and he wouldnt kill us but the mystery man would the guy who killed trevor is the same guy who read our mail im not convinced they wee together where argrow expected to find them in the law library and they seemed to be waiting he entered in a rush and when he was sure they were alone he said i just met with my brother again lets talk they scurried into their little conference room closed the door and crowded around the table things are about to happen very fast argrow said nervously lake will pay the money itll be wired anywhere you want it i can help if you want otherwise you can handle it any way you wish spicer cleared his throat thats two million each thats what you asked for i dont know mr lake but evidently he moves fast argrow glanced at his watch then looked over his shoulder at the door there are some people from washington here to meet with you big shots he yanked some papers from his pocket unfolded them and laid a single sheet before each of the three these are presidential pardons signed yesterday with great reserve they reached forward took the papers and tried to read them the copies certainly looked official they gawked at the bold letters across the top the paragraphs of fussy prose the compact signature of the president of the united states and not a single word could be summoned they were just stunned weve been pardoned yarber finally managed to ask his voice dry yes by the president of the united states they kept reading they fidgeted and chewed their lips and clenched their jaws and tried to quietly hide their shock theyre gonna come get you take you to the wardens office where the big shots fiom washington will deliver the good news act surprised okay no problem that should be easy how did you get these copies yarber asked they were given to my brother i have no idea how lake has powerful friends anyway heres the deal youll be released within the hour a van will take you to jacksonville to a hotel where my brother will meet youyou will wait there until the wire transfers are confirmed then you will hand over all of your dirty little files everything understood they nodded in unison for two million bucks they could have it all you will agree to leave the country immediately and not to return for at least two years how can we leave the country beech asked we have no passports no papers my brother will have all of thatyou will be given new identities with a complete set of papers including credit cards its all waiting for you two years spicer asked and yarber looked at him as if hed lost his mind thats right two years its part of the deal agreed i dont know spicer said his voice shaking spicer had never left the united states dont be foolish yarber snapped at him a complete pardon a million bucks a year for two years to live abroad hell yes well take the deal a sudden knock on the door terrified them two guards were looking in argrow grabbed the copies of the pardons and stuffed them in his pocket do we have a deal gentlemen they nodded yes and all three shook hands with him good he said remember act surprised they followed the guards to the wardens office where they were introduced to two very sternfaced men from washington one from justice one from the bureau of prisons the warden completed the stiff introductions without getting any of the names confused then he handed each of the three a legalsized document they were the originals of what argrow had just shown them gentlemen the warden announced with as much drama as he could muster youve just been pardoned by the president of the united states he smiled warmly as if he were responsible for this good news they stared at their pardons still in shock still dizzy with a thousand questions the biggest of which was how in the world did argrnw scoop the warden and show them the documents first i dont know what to say spicer managed to mumble then the other two mumbled something else the man from justice said the president reviewed your cases and he felt that you have served enough time he feels very strongly that you have more to offer your country and your communities by once again becoming productive citizens they stared blankly at him this fool didnt know they were about to assume new names and flee their country and their communities for at least two years who was on which side here and why was the president granting them clemency when they had enough dirt to destroy aaron lake the man who was primed to defeat the vice president it was lake who wanted them silenced not the president right how could lake convince the president to pardon them how could lake convince the president to do anything at this stage of the campaign they clutched their pardons and sat speechless their faces drawn tight as the questions hammered away inside the man from the bureau said you should feel honored clemency is very rare yarber managed to acknowledge him with a quick nod but even then he was thinkingwhos waiting for us on the outside i think were in shock beech said it was a first for trumble inmates so important that the president decided to pardon them the warden was quite proud of the three but uncertain as to how the moment should be commemorated when would you like to leave he asked as if they might want to stick around for a party immediately spicer said very well well drive you to jacksonville no thanks well have someone pick us up okay then well theres some paperwork make it quick spicer said they were each given a duffel bag to collect their things in as they walked rather briskly across the grounds all still very close together and in perfect step with a guard trailing behind beech said under his breath so who got us the damned pardons it wasnt lake yarber said just barely loud enough to be heard of course it wasnt lake beech said the president wouldnt do a damned thing aaron lake asked him to they walked faster what difference does it make spicer asked it doesnt make any sense yarber said so whatre you gonna do finn spicer asked without looking stay here for a few days and ponder the situation and then if you figure out whos responsible for the pardon then maybe you wont accept it gimme a break somebody else is behind this beech said then i love this somebody else okay spicer said im not sticking around to ask questions they ransacked their rooms in a mad rush never slowing to say goodbye to anyone most of their friends were scattered around the camp anyway they had to hurry before the dream was over or before the president changed his mind at elevenfifteen they walked through the front door of the administration building the same door theyd each entered years ago and waited on the hot sidewalk for their ride none of the three looked back the van was driven by wes and chap though they gave other names they used so many joe roy spicer lay down on the backseat and covered his eyes with a forearm determined not to see anything until he was far away he wanted to cry and he wanted to scream but he was numb with euphoriasheer uncut unabashed euphoria he hid his eyes and smiled a goofy smile he wanted a beer and he wanted a woman preferably his wife hed call her soon the van was rolling now the suddenness of the release had them rattled most inmates count the days and in doing so know with some measure of accuracy when the moment will come and they know where theyre going and whos waiting for them there but the brethren knew so little and the few things they knew they didnt really believe the pardons were a hoax the money was nothing but bait they were being taken away to be slaughtered same as poor trevor the van would stop any minute and the two goons up front would search their bags find their dirty files then murder them in a roadside ditch maybe but at the moment they did not miss the safety of trumble finn yarber sat behind the driver and watched the road ahead he held his pardon ready to present it to anyone who might stop them and tell them the dream was over next to him was hadee beech who after a few minutes on the road began to cry not loud but with his eyes tightly closed and his lips quivering beech had reason to cry with almost eight and a half years to go clemency meant more to him than to his two colleagues combined not a word was uttered between trumble and jacksonville as they approached the city and the roads became wider and the traffic heavier the three watched the scenery with great curiosity people were driving moving about planes overhead boats on the riversthings were normal again they inched through the traffic on atlantic boulevard thoroughly enjoying every moment of the congestion the weather was hot the tourists were out ladies with long bronze legs they saw the seafood restaurants and bars with signs advertising cold beer and cheap oysters when the street ended the beach began and they pulled under the veranda of the sea turtle they followed one of their escorts through the lobby where they caught a look or two because they were still dressed alike up to the fifth floor and off the elevator before chap said your rooms are right here these three he was pointing down the hall mr argrow would like to see you as soon as possible where is he spicer asked chap pointed again over there in the corner suite hes waiting lets go spicer said and they followed chap into the corner their duffel bags bouncing against one another jack argrow looked nothing like his brother he was much shorter and his hair was blond and wavy where his brothers was dark and thinning it was just a casual observation but the three noticed it and mentioned it later he shook their hands quickly but only to be polite he was edgy and talked very fast hows my brother he asked hes doing well beech said we saw him this morning yarber added i want him out of prison jack snapped as if theyd put him there in the first place thats what ill get outta this deal you know ill get my brother out of prison they glanced at each other nothing could be said have a seat argrow said look i dont know how or why im in the middle of this you understand it makes me very nervous im here on behalf of mr aaron lake a man i believe will be elected and make a great president i suppose i can then get my brother outta prison but anyway ive never met mr lake some of his people approached me about a week ago and asked me to get involved in a very secret anddelicate matter thats why im here its a favor okay i dont know everything you understand the sentences were clipped and rapid he talked with his hands and his mouth and he couldnt be still the brethren offered no response none was really expected two hidden cameras captured the scene and sent it immediately to langley where teddy york and deville watched it on a wide screen in the bunker the ex judges now exinmates looked like freshly released pows dazed and subdued still in uniform sdll in disbelief they sat close together watching agent lyter give a splendid performance after trying to outthink and outmaneuver them for three months it was fascinating to finally see them teddy studied their faces and grudgingly admitted a little admiration theyd been shrewd and lucky enough to hook the right victim now they were free and about to be well compensated for their ingenuity okay look the first thing is the money argrow barked two million each where do you want it it was not the sort of question theyd had much experience with what are the options asked spicer you have to wire it somewhere argrow snapped back how about london yarber asked london wed like the money all of it all six million to be wired at one time to one account to a bank in london yarber said we can wire it anywhere which bank can you help us with the details yarber asked im told we can do anything you want ill have to make a few calls why dont you go to your rooms take a shower change clothes give me fifteen minutes we dont have any clothes beech said there are some things in your rooms chap led them down the hall and gave them their keys spicer stretched out on his kingsized bed and stared at the ceiling beech stood in the window of his room and looked north for miles along the beach the blue water gently rolling onto the white sand children played near their mothers couples strolled hand in hand a fishing boat inched along on the horizon free at last he said to himself free at last yarber took a long hot showercomplete privacy no time limit plenty of soap thick towels someone had placed a selection of toiletries on the vanitydeodorant shaving cream razors toothpaste toothbrush floss he took his time then changed into a pair of bermuda shorts sandals and a white tee shirt hed be the first to leave and he needed to find a clothing store twenty minutes later they reconvened in argrows suite and they brought with them their collection of files wrapped neatly in a pillowcase argrow was just as anxious as before theres a large bank in london called metropolitan trust we can send the money there then you can do with it whatever you want thats fine yarber said the account will be in my name only argrow looked at beech and spicer and they nodded their approval very well i assume you have a plan of some sort we do spicer said mryarber here will leave for london this afternoon and when he gets there hell go to the bank and take care of the money if all goes well then well leave soon afterward i assure you things will go well and we believe youwere just being careful argrow handed two sheets of paper to finn i need your signature to start the wire and open the account yarber scribbled his name have you had lunch he asked they shook their heads lunch was certainly on their minds but they werent sure how to proceed youre free men now there are some nice restaurants just a few blocks from here go enjoy yourselves give me an hour to start the wire lets meet here at twothirty spicer was holding the pillowcase he sort of waved it at argrow and said here are the files right just throw them on the sofa there thirtyeight they left the hotel on foot without escorts without restrictions but with their pardons in their pockets just in case and though the sun was warmer near the beach the air was certainly lighter the sky was dearer the world was pretty again hope filled the air they smiled and laughed at almost anything they strolled along atlantic boulevard and mixed easily with the tourists lunch was steak and beer at a sidewalk cafe under an umbrella so they could watch the foot traffic little was said as they ate and drank everything was seen though especially the younger ladies in shorts and skimpy tops prison had turned them into old men now they felt the urge to party especially hadee beech hed had wealth and status and ambition and as a federal judge hed had what was all but impossible to losea lifetime appointment hed fallen hard lost everything and during his first two years at trumble hed existed in a state of depression he had accepted the fact that he would die there and hed seriously considered suicide now at the age of fiftysix he was emerging from the darkness in a rather splendid fashion he was fifteen pounds lighter nicely tanned in good health divorced from a woman who had money but not much else to offer and about to collect a fortune not a bad middleaged rally he told himself he missed his children but theyd followed the money and forgotten about him hadee beech was ready for some fun spicer was also looking for a party preferably one at a casino his wife had no passport so it would be a few weeks before she could join him in london or wherever he might land did they have casinos in europe beech thought soyarber had no idea and didnt care finn was the most reserved of the three he drank a soda instead of beer and he wasnt as interested in the flesh passing by finn was already in europe hed never leave never return to his native land he was sixty very fit now with lots of money and was about to bum around italy and greece for the next ten years across the street they found a small bookstore and bought several travel books in a shop specializing in beachwear they found just the right sunglassesthen it was time to see jack argrow again and finish the deal klockner and company watched them stroll back to the sea turtle klockner and company were weary of neptune beach and petes and the sea turtle and the crowded rental six agents including chap and wes were still there all very anxious for another assignment the unit had discovered the brethren plucked them from inside trumble brought them to the beach and now they just wanted them to leave the country jack argrow had not touched the files or at least they appeared untouched they were still wrapped in the pillowcase on the sofa in the exact spot spicer had left them the wire is under way argrow said as they settled into his suite teddy was still watching from langley the three were now wearing all manner of beach garb yarber had a fishing cap with a sixinch bill spicer had a straw hat and a yellow tee shirt of some variety beech the republican wore khaki shorts a knit pullover and a golf cap there were three large envelopes on the dining table argrow handed one to each of the brethren inside youll find your new identities birth certificates credit cards social security cards what about passports askedyarber we have a camera set up in the next room the passports and drivers licenses will need photos itll take thirty minutes theres also five thousand dollars cash in those small envelopes there im harvey moss spicer asked looking at his birth certificate yesyou dont like harvey i guess i do now you look like a harvey beech said and who are you well im james nunley nice to meet you james argrow never cracked a smile never relaxed for a second i need to know your travel plans the people in washington really want you out of the country i need to check flights to london yarber said weve already done that a flight to atlanta leaves jacksonville in two hours at seventen tonight theres a flight leaving atlanta for london heathrow that arrives early tomorrow morning can you get me a seat its already done first class finn closed his eyes and smiled and what about you argrow asked looking at the other two i kinda like it here spicer said sorry we have a deal well take the same flights tomorrow beech said assuming all goes well with mryarber do you want us to handle the reservations yes please chap eased into the room without making a sound and took the pillowcase from the sofa he left with the files lets do the photos argrow said finn yarber now traveling as a mr william mccoy of san jose california flew to atlanta without incident for an hour he walked the concourses of the airport rode the underground shuttles and thoroughly enjoyed the frenzy and chaos of being in the midst of a million people in a hurry his firstclass seat was a massive leather recliner after two glasses of champagne he began to drift and to dream he was afraid to sleep because he was afraid to wake up he was certain he would be back on his top bunk staring at the ceiling counting off another day at trumble from a pay phone next to beach java joe roy finally caught his wife at first she thought the call was a hoax and refused to accept the collect charges who is this she asked its me dear im no longer in prison joe roy yes now listen im out of prison okay are you there i think sowhere are you im staying at a hotel near jacksonville florida i was released from prison this morning released but how dont ask okay ill explain

pass a deep breath a glance down the street im going away he said i have no choice just come home she said i cant ill explain it later an explanation would be nice ill call you tomorrow beech and spicer ate seafood in a restaurant crowded with people much younger they roamed the sidewalks and eventually found their way to petes bar and grill where they watched the braves and enjoyed the noise finn was somewhere over the atlantic following their money the customs agent at heathrow barely glanced at finns passport which was a marvel of forgery it was well used and had accompanied mr william mccoy around the world aaron lake did indeed have powerful friends finn took a taxi to the basil street hotel in knightsbridge and paid cash for the smallest room available he and beech had selected the hotel at random from a travel guide it was an oldfashioned place filled with antiques and it rambled from floor to floor at the small restaurant upstairs he had breakfast of coffee eggs and black sausage then went for a walk at ten his taxi stopped in front of the metropolitan trust in the city the receptionist didnt care for his attirejeans and a pulloverbut when she realized he was an american she shrugged and seemed to tolerate it they made him wait for an hour but he didnt mind it at all finn was nervous but didnt show it hed wait for days weeks months to get the money hed learned how to be patient the mr macgregor who was in charge of the wire finally came for him the money had just arrived sorry for the delay all six million bucks had crossed the atlantic safely and was now on british soil but not for long id like to wire it to switzerland finn said with the proper dose of confidence and experience that afternoon beech and spicer flew to atlanta like yarber they roamed the airport with unrestrained freedom while waiting for their london flight they sat together in first class ate and drank for hours watched movies tried to sleep as they crossed the ocean much to their surprise yarber was waiting when they cleared customs at heathrow he delivered the wonderful news that the money had come and gone it was hidden in switzerland he surprised them again with the idea of leaving immediately they know were here he said over coffee in an airport bar lets shake them you think theyre following us beech asked lets assume they are but why spicer asked they discussed it for half an hour then began looking for flights alitalia to rome caught their attention first class of course do they speak english in rome spicer asked as they were boarding actually they speak italian yarber said you think the pope will see us hes probably busy thirtynine buster zigzagged westward for days until he made his final bus stop in san diegothe ocean attracted him the first water hed seen in months he hung around the docks looking for odd jobs and chatting with the regulars a charter boat captain hired him as a gopher and he jumped ship in los cabos mexico at the southern tip of the baja the harbor there was filled with expensive fishing boats much nicer than the ones he and his father once traded he met a few of the captains and within two days had a job as a deckhand the customers were wealthy americans from texas and california and they spent more time drinking than fishing he earned no wages or salary but worked for tips which invariably got larger the more the clients drank a slow day would net him a good day all cash he lived in an inexpensive motel and after a few days stopped looking over his shoulder los cabos quickly became his home wilson argrow was suddenly transferred out of trumble and sent to a halfway house in milwaukee where he stayed exactly one night before walking away since he didnt exist he couldnt be found jack argrow met him at the airport with tickets and they flew together to dc two days after leaving florida the argrow brothers kenny sands and roger lyter reported to langley for their next assignment three days before he was scheduled to depart dc for the convention in denver aaron lake arrived at langley for lunch with the director it was to be a joyful occasion the conquering candidate once again thanking the genius whod asked him to run his acceptance speech had been written for a month but teddy had a few suggestions he wanted to discuss he was escorted to teddys office where the old man was waiting under his quilt as always he looked so pale and tired lake thoughtthe aides vanished the door was closed and lake noticed that no table had been prepared they sat away from the desk face to face very close together teddy liked the speech and made just a few comments your speeches are getting too long he said quietly but lake had so much to say these days were still editing he said this election belongs to you mr lake teddy said quite feebly i feel good but it will be a brawl youll win by fifteen points lake stopped smiling and listened hard thats uh quite a margin youre up slightly in the polls next month the vice president will be up it will go back and forth until the middle of october then there will be a nuclear situation that will terrify the world and you mr lake will become the messiah the prospect frightened even the messiah a war lake asked quietly no there will be casualties but they wont be americans natty chenkov will get the blame and the good voters of this republic will flock to the pollsyou could win by as much as twenty points lake breathed deeply he wanted to ask more questions even perhaps object to the bloodshed but it would be futile whatever terror teddy had planned for october was already in the works there was nothing lake could say or do to stop it keep beating the same drum mr lake the same message the world is about to become a lot crazier and we have to be strong to protect our way of life the message has worked so far your opponent will become desperate hell attack you for the single issue and hell whine about the money hell beat you up and score some points dont panic the world will be turned upside down in october trust me i do youve got this thing won mr lake keep preaching the same message oh i will good teddy said and closed his eyes for a moment as if he needed a quick nap then he opened them and said now on an entirely different topic im a little curious about your plans once you get to the white house lake was puzzled and his face showed it teddy continued the ambush you need a partner mr lake a first lady someone to grace the white house with her presence someone to entertain and decorate a pretty woman one young enough to have children its been a long time since we had children in the white house mr lake you must be kidding lake was flabbergasted i like this jayne cordell on your staff shes thirtyeight smart articulate quite pretty though she needs to drop fifteen pounds her divorce was twelve years ago and its forgotten i think shed make a fine first lady lake cocked his head to one side and was suddenly angry he wanted to lash out at teddy but for the moment words failed him he managed to mumble have you lost your mind we know about ricky teddy said very coolly with his eyes penetrating lakes the wind was sucked out of lakes lungs and as he exhaled he said oh my god he studied his feet for a moment his entire body frozen in shock to make matters worse teddy handed over a sheet of paper lake took it and instantly recognized it as a copy of his last note to ricky dear ricky i think its best if we end our correspondence i wish you well with your rehab sincerely al lake almost said that he could explain things they were not as they seemed but he decided to say nothing at least not for a while the questions flooded his thoughtshow much do they know how in hell did they intercept the mail who else knows teddy let him suffer in silence there was no hurry when his thoughts cleared somewhat the politician in lake came to the surface teddy was offering a way out teddy was saying just play ball with me son and things will be fine do it my way and so lake swallowed hard and said i actually like her of course you do shes perfect for the job yes shes very loyal are you sleeping with her no

weakness lake said never mind lake take care of jayne get her a new wardrobe she works too hard and she looks tired ease up on her shes going to make a wonderful first lady yes sir teddy was at the door no more surprises lake no sir teddy opened the door and rolled himself away by late november they had settled in monte carlo primarily because of its beauty and warm weather but also because so much english was spoken there and there were casinos a must for spicer neither beech nor yarber could tell if he was winning or losing but he was certainly enjoying himself his wife was still tending to her mother whod yet to die things were tense because joe roy wouldnt go home and she wouldnt leave mississippi they lived in the same small but handsome hotel on the edge of town and they usually had breakfast together twice a week before scattering as the months passed and they settled into their new lives they saw less and less of each other they had differing interests spicer wanted to gamble and drink and spend time with the ladies beech preferred the sea and enjoyed fishing yarber traveled and studied the history of southern france and northern italy but each always knew where the others were if one disappeared the other two wanted to know it theyd read nothing about their pardons beech andyarber had spent hours in a library in rome reading american newspapers just after they fled not a word about them theyd had no contact with anyone from home spicers wife claimed to have told no one that he was out of prison she still thought hed escaped on thanksgiving day finn yarber was enjoying an espresso at a sidewalk caf in downtown monte carlo it was warm and sunny and he was only vaguely aware that it was an important holiday back home he didnt care because he would never go back beech was asleep in his hotel mom spicer was in a casino three blocks away a vaguely familiar face appeared from nowhere in a flash the man sat across from yarber and said hello finn remember me yarber calmly took a sip of coffee and studied the face hed last seen it at trumble wilson argrow from prison the man said and yarber put down his cup before he dropped it good morning mr argrow finn said slowly calmly though there were many other things he wanted to say i guess youre surprised to see me yes as a matter of fact wasnt that exciting news about aaron lakes landslide i suppose what can i do for you i just want you to know that were always close by just in case you need us finn actually chuckled then said that doesnt seem likely it had been five months since their release they had moved from country to country from greece to sweden from poland to portugal slowly heading south as the weather changed how on earth could argrow track them down it was impossible argrow pulled a magazine from inside his jacket i ran across this last week he said handing it over the magazine was turned to a page in the back where a personal ad was circled with a red marker swm in s looking for kind and discreet american gentleman in s or s to pen pal with yarber had certainly seen it before but he shrugged as if he hadnt a clue looks familiar doesnt it argrow asked they all look the same to me finn said he tossed the magazine on the table it was the european edition of out and about we traced the address to the post office here in monte carlo argrow said a brandnew box rental with a fake name and everything what a coincidence look i dont know who you work for but i have a very strong hunch that were not in your jurisdiction we havent broken a single law why dont you bug off sure finn but two million bucks isnt enough finn smiled and looked around the lovely cafe he took a sip of coffee and said you gotta keep busy ill see you around argrow said then jumped to his feet and vanished yarber finished his coffee as if nothing had happened he watched the street and the traffic for a while then left to gather his colleagues
