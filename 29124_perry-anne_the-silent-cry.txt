anne perry the silent cry the eighth book in the william monk series for simon nikki jonathan and angus chapter one john evan stood shivering as the january wind whipped down the alley pc shotts held his bullseye lantern high so they could see both the bodies at once they lay crumpled and bloody about seven feet apart on the icy cobbled alleyway does anybody know what happened evan asked his teeth chattering no sir shotts replied bleakly woman found them and op briggs came an told me evan was surprised in this area he glanced around at the grimy walls the open gutter and the few windows blacked with dirt the doors he could see were narrow straight onto the street and stained with years of damp and soot the only lamppost was twenty yards away gleaming balefully like a lost moon he was unpleasantly aware of movement just beyond the perimeter of light of hunched figures watching and waiting the myriad beggars thieves and unfortunates who lived in this slum of st giles only a stones throw from regent street in the heart of london shotts shrugged looking down at the bodies well they obviously int drunk or starved or freezin all that blood i reckon as she likely screamed then were afraid someone carder an she dint wanter get blamed so she went on screamin an other folk came he shook his head they aint always bad about lookin arter their own around ere i dare say as shed a kept walkin if shed ad the nerve an thought of it quick enough evan bent down to the body nearer to him shotts lowered the light a little so it showed the head and upper torso more clearly he was a man evan guessed to be in his middle fifties his hair was grey thick his skin smooth when evan touched it with his finger it was cold and stiff his eyes were still open he had been too badly beaten for evan to gather anything but a very general impression of his features he might well have been handsome in life certainly his clothes though torn and stained had been of excellent quality as far as evan could judge he was of average height and solid build it was not easy to tell when someone was so doubled up his legs splayed and half under his body who in gods name did this to him he asked under his breath dunno sir shotts answered shakily i int never seen anyone beat this bad before even ere must a bin a lunatic thats all i can say is e robbed i spose e must a bin evan moved the body very slightly so he could reach into the pocket of the coat there was nothing in the outside one he tried the inside and found a handkerchief clean folded linen rollhemmed excellent quality there was nothing else he tried the trouser pockets and found a few coppers button oles torn shotts observed staring down at the waistcoat looks like they ripped orff is watch an chain wonder wot e was doin ere this is a bit rough fer the likes of a gent plenty o tarts an dolly mops no moren a mile west aymarkets full of em an no danger take yer pick wy come ere i dont know evan replied unnecessarily perhaps if we can find the reason well know what happened to him he stood up and moved across to the other body this was a younger man perhaps barely twenty although his face also was so badly beaten only the clean line of his jaw and the fine texture of his skin gave any indication of age evan was racked with pity and a terrible blind anger when he saw the clothes on the lower part of the torso soaked in blood which still seeped out from under him on to the cobbles god in heaven he said huskily what happened here shotts what kind of creature does this he did not use the name of the deity lightly he was the son of a country parson brought up in a small rural community where everyone knew each other for better or worse and the sound of church bells rang out over manor house farm labourers cottage and publicans inn alike he knew happiness and tragedy kindness and all the usual sins of greed and envy shotts raised near this uglier darker slum of london found his imagination less challenged but he still looked down at the young man with a shiver of compassion and fear for whoever could do this dunno sir but i ope we catch the bastard and then i trust theyll ang im will if i ave anything ter do with it mind catchin im wont be that easy dont see nothin ter go on so far an we cant count on much elp from them round ere evan knelt beside the second body and felt in the pockets to see if there was anything left which might at least identify him his fingers brushed against the mans neck he stopped a shiver of incredulity going through him almost horror it was warm was it conceivable he was still alive if he was dead then he had not been so for as long as the older man he might have lain in this freezing alley bleeding for hours what is it shotts demanded staring at him his eyes wide evan held his hand in front of the mans nose and lips he felt nothing not the faintest warmth of breath shotts bent and held the lamp closer evan took out his pocket watch polished the surface clean on the inside of his sleeve then held it to the mans lips what is it shotts repeated his voice high and sharp i think hes alive evan whispered he drew the watch away and looked at it under the light there was the faintest clouding of breath on it he is alive he said jubilantly look shotts was a realist he liked evan but he knew he was the son of a parson and he made allowances maybe ejus died after the other one he said gently es urt pretty dreadful hes warm and hes still breathing evan insisted bending closer have you called a doctor get an ambulance shotts shook his head you cant save im mr evan es too far gorn kinder ter let im slip away now without knowin anything about it i dont suppose e knows oo dun im anyway evan did not look up i wasnt thinking of what he could tell us he replied and it was the truth if hes alive weve got to do what we can theres no choice to make find someone to fetch a doctor and an ambulance go now shotts hesitated looking around the deserted alley ill be all right evan said abruptly he was not sure he did not wish to be alone in this place he did not belong here he was not one of these people as shotts was he was aware of fear and wondered if it was audible in his voice shotts obeyed reluctantly leaving the bulls eye behind evan saw his solid form disappear around the corner and felt a moments panic he had nothing with which to defend himself if whoever had committed these murders returned but why should they that idea was a fallacy he knew better he had been in the police long enough in fact over five years since halfway through the crimean war he remembered his first murder that had been when he had met william monk the best policeman he knew if also the most ruthless the bravest the most instinctively clever evan was the only one who had realised also how vulnerable he was he had lost his entire memory in a carriage accident but of course he dared tell no one he had no knowledge of who he was what his skills were his conflicts his enemies or even his friends he lived from one threat to another clue after clue unfolding and then meaning little or nothing just fragments but monk would not have been afraid to be alone in this alley even the poor and the hungry and the violent of this miserable area would have thought twice before attacking him there was something dangerous in his face with its smooth cheekbones broad aquiline nose and brilliant eyes evans gentler features full of humour and imagination threatened no one he started as there was a sound at the farther end at the main street but it was only a rat running along the gutter someone shifted weight in a doorway but he saw nothing a rumble of carriage wheels fifty yards away sounded like another world where there was life and wider spaces and the broadening daylight would give a little colour he was so cold he was shaking he ought to take his coat off and put it over the boy who was still alive in fact he should have done it straight away he did it now gently tucking it around him and feeling the cold bite into his own flesh till his bones ached it seemed an endless wait until shotts returned but he brought the doctor with him a gaunt man with bony hands and a thin patient face his high hat was too large for him and slid close to the tops of his ears riley he introduced himself briefly then bent to look at the young man his fingers felt expertly and evan and shotts stood waiting staring down it was now full daylight although in the alley between the high grimy walls it was still shadowed youre right riley said after a moment his voice strained his eyes dark hes still alive just he climbed to his feet and turned towards the hearselike outline of the ambulance as the driver backed the horses to bring it to the end of the alley help me lift him he requested as another figure leaped down from the box and opened the doors at the back evan and shotts hastened to obey lifting the cold figure as gently as they could riley superintended their efforts until the youth was lying on the floor inside wrapped in blankets and evan had his coat back bloodstained filthy and damp from the wet cobbles riley looked at him and pursed his lips youd better get some dry clothes on and a stiff tot of whisky and then a dish of hot gruel he said shaking his head or youll have pneumonia yourself and probably for nothing i doubt we can save the poor devil pity altered his face in the lantern light making him look gaunt and vulnerable nothing i can do for the other one hes the undertakers job and yours of course good luck to you youll need it around here god knows what happened or perhaps it would be more appropriate to say the devil does and with that he climbed in behind his patient mortuary vanll come for the other one he added as if an afterthought im taking this one to st thomass you can enquire after him there i dont suppose you have any idea who he is not yet evan answered although he knew they might never have riley closed the door and banged on the wall for the driver to proceed and the ambulance pulled away the mortuary van took its place and the other body was removed leaving evan and shotts alone in the alley its light enough to look evan said grimly i suppose we might find something then well start searching for witnesses what happened to the woman who raised the alarm daisy mott i know where ter finder daytime in the match factry nights in that block o rooms over there number sixteen he gestured with his left arm dont suppose she can tell us much if them what done this d bin ere when she come theyd a killed er too no doubt yes i suppose so evan agreed reluctantly since she screamed theyd have silenced her at least what about old briggs who fetched you e dont know nothin i askedim evan began to widen his search further away from where the two bodies had been walking very slowly eyes down on the ground he did not know what he was looking for anything someone might have dropped a mark a further bloodstain there must be other bloodstains int rained shotts said grimly those two fought like tigers fer their lives gotter be more blood not that i know what itll tell us if there is cept that someone else is urt an that i can work out ferme self theres blood here evan answered him seeing the dark stain over the cobbles towards the central gutter he had to put his finger into it to be sure if it was red and not the brown of excrement and here this must be where at least some of the struggle took place i got some ere too shotts added i wonder ow many of them there was more than two evan replied quietly if it had been anything like an equal fight thered have been four bodies here whoever else was here was in good enough shape to leave unless of course someone else took them away but that isnt likely no i think were looking for two or three men at the least armed shotts looked at him i dont know the doctorll tell us how he died i didnt see any knife wounds or club or bludgeon wounds either and he certainly wasnt gar rotted he shuddered as he said it st giles particularly was known for the sudden and vile murders by wire around the throat any dirty and downatheel vagrant had been suspected there was one notable occasion when two such men had suspected each other and had almost ended up in mutual murder thats funny shotts stood still unconsciously pulling his coat a little tighter around him in the cold thieves wot set out ter rob someone in a place like this usually carry a shiv or a wire they int lookin fera fight they wants profits and a quick getaway wino urt to their selves exactly evan agreed a wire around the throat or a knife in the side silent effective no danger take the money and disappear into the night so what happened here shorts i dunno sir the more i look at it the less i know but there int no weapon ere if there was one they took it with them an wots more there int no trail o blood as i can see so if they was urt their selves it werent nothing like as bad as these two poor souls the doc and the mortuary van took away i know they was dead or as near as makes no difference wot i mean is i know what you mean evan agreed it was a very onesided affair a hansom went by at the far end of the street closely followed by a wagon piled with old furniture somewhere in the distance came the mournful cry of a rag and bone man a beggar holding half an old coat around himself hesitated at the mouth of the alley then thought better of it and went on his way behind the grimy windows there was more movement voices were raised a dog barked you have to hate a man very much to beat him to death evan said in little more than a whisper unless youre completely insane they didnt belong around ere shotts shook his head they were clean under the surface well fed an their clothes was good they was both from somewhere else up west for certain or in from the country city evan corrected city boots city skins country men would have had more colour then up west they wasnt from any were near ere thats for certain positive so oo around ere would know em to ate em that much evan pushed his hands into his pockets there were more people passing the end of the alley now men going to work in factories and warehouses women to sweat shops and mills the unknown numbers who worked in the streets themselves were appearing pedlars dealers in one thing and another scavengers sellers of information petty thieves and gobetweens what does a man come here for evan was talking to himself something he cant buy in his own part of the city slummin shotts said succinctly cheap women money lenders card sharps fence a bit o sum mink stolen get sum mink forged exactly evan agreed wed better find out which of these and with whom shotts shrugged and gave a hollow laugh he had no need to comment on their chances of success the woman daisy mott evan began starting towards the street he was so cold he could hardly feel anything below his ankles the smell of the alley made him shrink tighter and feel queasy he had seen too much violence and pain in a short space of hours the doc were right shotts remarked catching up with him an of cup o tea wi a drop o gin wouldnt do yer no arm nor me neither agreed evan did not argue and a pie or a sandwich then well find the woman but when they did find her she would tell them nothing she was small and fair and very thin she could have been any age between eighteen and thirtyfive it was impossible to tell she was tired and frightened and only spoke to them at all because she could see no way of avoiding it the match factory was busy already the hum of machinery a background to everything the smells of sawdust oil and phosphorus thick in the air everyone looked pallid evan saw several women with swollen suppurating scabs or skin eaten away by the necrosis of the bone known as phossie jaw to which match workers were so susceptible they stared at him with only minimal curiosity what did you see evan asked gently tell me exactly what happened she took a deep breath but said nothing int nobody cares were yer was comin from shotts interposed helpfully or goin evan made himself smile at her i come inter the alley she started tentatively it were still mostly dark i were near on im well i saw im first i reckoned as e werejus drunk an sleepin it orff appens orften down ere im sure evan nodded aware of other eyes staring at them and of the supervisors grim face a dozen yards away what made you realise he was dead blood she said with contempt but her voice was hoarse all that blood i ad a lantern an i saw is eyes starin up at me that were well i yelled couldnt elp it of course anyone would what then i dunno me eart were goin like the clappers an i felt sick i fink as i jus stood there and yelled who heard you wot who heard you he repeated someone must have come she hesitated afraid again she did not dare implicate someone else he could see it in her eyes monk would have known what to do to make her speak he had a sense of peoples weaknesses and how to use them without breaking them he did not lose sight of the main purpose the way evan too often did he was not sidetracked by irrelevant pity imagining himself in their place which was false he did not know how they felt he would have said evan was sentimental evan could hear monks voice in his mind even as he thought it it was true and people did not want pity they would have hated him for it it was the ultimate indignity who came he said more sharply do you want me to go around every door pulling people out and asking them would you like to be arrested for lying to the police get you noticed get you a bad name he meant it would make people think she was a police informer and she knew that jimmy elders she said looking at him with dislike an is woman they both come e lives alfway along the alley be and the wood door wif the lock on it but e don know wot appened any moren i do then ol briggs e went for the rozzer thank you he knew it was a waste of time asking but he had to go through the motions had you ever seen either of the two men before when they were alive no she answered without even thinking it was what he had expected he glanced around and saw the supervisor had moved a little closer he was a large blackhaired man with a sullen face evan hoped she was not going to be docked pay for the time he had taken but he thought she probably would he would waste no more of it thank you goodbye she said nothing but returned silently to her work evan and shotts went back to the alley and spoke to jimmy elders and his commonlaw wife but they had nothing to offer beyond corroborating what daisy mott had told them he denied having seen either of the men alive or knowing what they might have been doing there the leer in his face suggested the obvious but he refrained from putting words to it briggs was the same they spent all day in and around the alley which was known as water lane going up and down narrow and rotting stairs into rooms where sometimes a whole family lived others where palefaced young prostitutes conducted their business when it was too wet or too cold outside they went down to cellars where women of all ages sat in candlelight stitching and children of two or three years old played in straw and tied waste bits of rag into dolls older children unpicked old clothes for the fabric to make new ones no one admitted to having seen or heard anything unusual no one knew anything of two strangers in the area there were always people coming and going there were pawn shops fencers of stolen goods petty forgers of documents doss houses gin mills and wellhidden rooms where it was safe for a wanted man to lie for a while the two men could have come to do business with any of these or none they may simply have been entertaining themselves by looking on at a way of life different from their own and immeasurably inferior they could even have been misguided preachers come to save sinners from themselves and been attacked for their presumption and their interference if anyone knew anything at all they were more afraid of the perpetrators or of their peers than of the police at least in the form of evan and pc shotts at four oclock as it was growing dark again and bitterly cold shotts said he would make one or two more enquiries in the public house where he had a few acquaintances and evan took his leave to go to the hospital and see what dr riley had to say he had been dreading it because he did not want to have to think of the younger man again the one who had been still alive in that dreadful place the memory of it made him feel cold and sick he was too tired to find the strength inside himself to overcome it he said goodday to shotts and walked briskly in the general direction of regent street where he knew he could find a hansom in st thomass hospital he went straight to the morgue he would look at the bodies and deduce what he could for himself and then ask riley to explain to him what else there was to learn he hated morgues but everyone he knew felt the same his clothes always seemed to smell of vinegar and lye afterwards and he never felt as if the damp were out of them yes sir the attendant said dutifully when he had identified himself doc riley said as youd be ere some time probly today i only got one body for yer other one int dead yet doc says as e might pull through never know poor devil still i suppose yer want ter see the one i got it was not a question he had been here long enough to know the answer young policemen like evan never came for anything else thank you evan accepted feeling a sudden surge of relief that the young man was still alive he realised now how much he had been hoping he would be and yet at the same time it meant he would wake up to so much pain and a long slow fight to recover and evan dreaded that and his own necessity for being part of it he followed the attendant along the rows of tables sheet covered some with the stark outline of corpses beneath others empty his feet rang in the silence on the stone floor the light was harsh beaming back from bare walls it was as if no one but the dead inhabited the place there were no concessions to the living they were intruders here the attendant stopped by one of the tables and pulled the sheet off slowly uncovering the body of a middleaged slightly plump man of average height riley had cleaned him up very little perhaps so evan could make his own deductions but with his clothes absent it was possible to see the terrible extent of his injuries his entire torso was covered in contusions black and dull purple where they had bled internally while he was still alive on some the skin was torn from the misshapen ribs several of them were obviously broken poor devil the attendant repeated between his teeth put up one ell of a fight afore they got im evan looked down at the hand nearer him the knuckles were burst open and at least two fingers were dislocated all but one of the nails were torn other ands the same the attendant offered evan leaned over and picked it up gently the attendant was correct that was the right hand and if anything it was worse will you be wanting to see his clothes the attendant asked after a moment yes please they might tell him something possibly something he could not already guess most of all he wanted to know the mans name he must have family perhaps a wife wondering what had happened to him would they have any idea where he had gone or why probably not he would have the wretched duty not only of informing them of his death and the dreadful manner in which it had happened but where he had been at the time ere they are sir the attendant turned and walked towards a bench at the farther end of the room all kept for yer but otherwise just as we took em orff im good quality they are but youll see that for yerself he picked up underwear socks then a shirt which had originally been white but was now heavily soiled with blood and mud and effluent from the gutter in the alley the smell of it was noticeable even here the jacket and trousers were worse evan undid them and laid them out on the bench he searched them carefully taking his time he explored pockets folds seams cuffs the fabric was wool not the best quality but one he would have been happy to wear himself it was warm a rather loose weave a nondescript brown just what a gentleman might have chosen in which to conduct an expedition into an unseemly quarter of the city not perhaps one as dangerous as st giles no doubt for his normal business he wore something better the linen of the shirt would suggest that both his taste and his pocket allowed a greater indulgence all that told him was that the man was exactly what he thought from somewhere else seeking either pleasure or a dishonest business in one of londons worst slums the suit had been damaged on the knees presumably when he had fallen during the fight one knee was actually torn the threads raw the other only pulled out of shape a few fibres broken there was also a badly scuffed patch on the seat and it was still wet from the gutter and deeply stained the jacket was worse both elbows were torn one almost completely gone there was a rent in the left side and a pocket all but ripped off however even the most thorough search inch by inch revealed no damage which could have been done by a knife or a bullet there was a considerable amount of blood far more than was accounted for by the nature of the injuries to the dead man anyway it appeared to come from someone else being darker and wetter on the outside of the garment and having barely soaked through to the inside at least one of his assailants must have been pretty badly hurt dyer know wot appened the attendant asked no evan said miserably no idea so far the attendant grunted come in from st giles didnt e reckon as yerll never find out then nobody from there says nothin on their own poor devil ad a few ga rotters in from there e must a crossed someone proper ter get beat like that dont need ter do that ter no one just ter rob im gambler maybe maybe the name of the tailor was on the inside of the jacket he had made a note of that and the address it might be sufficient to identify him where is dr riley up on the wards i spec if e int bin called out again fair make use of im you rozzers do not of my choice i promise you evan said wearily id much rather not have the need the attendant sighed and ran his fingers through his hair he said nothing evan went up the stairs and along the corridors asking until he found riley coming out of one of the operating theatres jacket off shirt sleeves rolled up his arms spattered with blood just taken out a bullet he said cheerfully damn fool accident marvellous thing this new anaesthetic never saw anything like it in my youth best thing to happen in medicine since i dont know what maybe its just the best thing straight and simple i suppose youve come about your corpse from st giles he shoved his hands into his pockets he looked tired there were fine lines crisscrossing his face and a smear of blood over his brow and another on his cheek where he had rubbed his hand without realising it evan nodded a medical student walked past them whistling between his teeth until he recognised riley then he stopped and straightened his shoulders beaten to death riley said pursing his lips no wound with any weapon unless you count fists and boots as weapons no knife no gun no cudgel as far as i can judge nothing to the head more than a flat concussion from falling on to the cobbles wouldnt have killed him probably not even knocked him senseless probably just stunned and a little dizzy died of internal haemorrhage ruptured organs sorry could one man alone have done that to him riley thought for quite a long time before he replied standing still in the middle of the passage oblivious of blocking the way for others hard to say wouldnt like to commit myself taking that body alone without considering the circumstances id guess more than one assailant if it was only one man then he was a raving lunatic to do that to another man he must have gone berserk and with considering the circumstances evan pressed stepping to one side to allow a nurse to pass with a bundle of laundry well the boys still alive and if he survives tonight he might recover riley answered too soon to say but to take on both of them and do that much damage id say two assailants who were both big and well used to violence or possibly even three or else again two complete lunatics could they have fought each other riley looked surprised and left themselves damn near dead on the pavement not very likely but possible evan insisted riley shook his head dont think youll find the answer is that easy sergeant the younger man is taller the older one was a bit plump he was well muscled quite powerful hed have taken a lot of beating considering he was fighting for his life and there was no weapon to give the advantage can you tell if the wounds were made attacking or defending mostly defending as well as i can judge but its only a deduction made from their position on forearms as if he were putting up his arms to protect his head he may have begun by attacking he certainly landed a few blows judging from his knuckles someone else is going to be badly marked whether it is anywhere that shows or not there was blood on the outside of his clothes evan told him someone elses blood he watched rileys face closely riley shrugged could be the younger mans could be someone elses ive no way of knowing what condition is he in now the younger man what are his injuries riley was distressed he looked overwhelmed by his knowledge as if it were something he would have gladly put down very bad he said almost under his breath hes still senseless but definitely alive if he pulls through tonight hell need a lot of careful nursing many weeks maybe months hes badly injured internally but its hard to tell exactly what cant see inside a body without cutting it open as much as i can feel the major organs are terribly bruised but not ruptured if they were hed be dead by now luckier than the other man where the blows landed both his hands are badly broken but that hardly matters compared nothing in his clothes to say who he is i suppose evan asked without any real hope yes riley said quickly his eyes wide apparently he had a receipt for socks with the name r duff on it must be his cant think why youd carry a receipt for another mans socks and he has the same tailor as the dead man theres a very slight physical resemblance about the shape of head way the hair grows and particularly the ears do you notice a mans ears sergeant evan some people dont youd be surprised how many ears are very distinctive i think you might find our two men are related duff evan could hardly believe his good fortune r duff thats right no idea what the r stands for but maybe hell be able to tell us himself tomorrow anyway you can try the tailor in the morning a man often knows his own handiwork yes yes ill take a piece of it to show him can i see the boys clothes theyre by his bed over in the next ward ill take you he turned and led the way along the wide bare corridor and into a ward lined with beds grey blanketed each showing the outline of a figure lying or propped up at the farther end a potbellied stove gave off quite a good heat and even as they walked up a nurse staggered past them with a bucketful of fresh coals to keep it stoked evan was reminded sharply of hester latterly the young woman he had met so soon after his first encounter with monk she had gone out to the crimea and nursed with florence nightingale he could not even imagine the courage it must have taken to do that to face that raging disease the carnage of the battlefield the constant pain and death and to find within oneself the resources to keep on fighting to overcome to offer help and to give some kind of comfort to those you were powerless even to ease let alone to save no wonder such an anger still burned inside her at what she perceived to be incompetence in medical administration how she and monk had quarrelled he smiled even as he thought of it monk loathed her sharp tongue at the same time as he admired her and she despised the hardness she thought she saw in him the arrogance and disregard for others and yet when he had faced the worst crisis in his life it had been she who had stood beside him she who had refused to let him give in had fought for him when it looked as if he could not win and worst of all did not deserve to how she rebelled against rolling bandages sweeping floors and carrying coals when she was capable of so much more and had done it in the field surgeons tents when all the doctors were already doing all they could she had wanted to reform so much and the eagerness had got in her way they were at the end of the ward now and riley had stopped by a bed where a young man lay whitefaced motionless only the clouding of his breath on a glass could have told if he was still alive there was nothing for the eye to see evan recognised him from the alley the features were the same the curve of eyelid the almost black hair rather long nose sensitive mouth the bruising did not hide that and the blood had been cleared away evan found himself willing him to live aching with the tension in his own body as if by strength of his feeling he could make it happen and yet at the same time terrified of the pain of it when he woke and felt his broken body and his memory returned who was he r duff was the older man related to him and what had happened in that alley why had they been there what appetite had taken them to such a place on a january night give me the trousers evan whispered a wave of horror and revulsion returning to him ill take them to the tailor youd be better with the coat riley replied its got the label on it and theres less blood less blood the other mans coat was soaked in it i know riley shrugged his thin shoulders with this one its the trousers maybe they all went down together in a scrum but if you want the tailor to be fit for anything take the jacket no need to give the poor man a turn evan took it after he had examined them both like the dead mans they were torn in several places filthy with mud and effluent from the gutter and stained with blood on coat sleeves and tails and the trousers were sodden evan left the hospital horrified exhausted in mind and spirit as well as body and now so cold he could not stop shivering he took a hansom home to his rooms he would not get in an omnibus with that dreadful jacket and he had no wish to sit among other people decent people at the end of their days work who had no idea of what he had seen and felt and of the young man who lay invisible in st thomass and who might or might not awaken again he found the tailor at nine oclock he spoke personally to mr jiggs of jiggs muldrew a rotund man who needed all his own art to disguise his ample stomach and rather short legs what may i do for you sir he said with some distaste as he saw the parcel under evans arm he disapproved of gentlemen who bundled up clothes it was no way to treat a highly skilled piece of workmanship evan had no time or mood for catering to anyones sensitivities do you have a client by the name of r duff mr jiggs he asked bluntly my client list is a matter of confidence sir this is a case of murder evan snapped sounding more like monk than his own usually softspoken manner the owner of this suit is lying at deaths door in st thomass another man also wearing a suit with your label in it is in the morgue i do not know who they are other than this he ignored jiggss pasty face and wide eyes if you can tell me then i demand that you do so he spilled out the jacket on to the tailors table jiggs started backwards as if it had been alive and dangerous will you look at it please evan commanded oh my god mr jiggs put a clammy hand to his brow whatever happened i dont know yet evan answered a trifle more gently will you please look at that jacket and tell me if you know for whom you made it yes yes of course i always know my gentlemen sir gingerly mr jiggs unfolded the coat only sufficiently to see his own label he glanced at it touched the cloth with his forefinger then looked at evan i made that suit for young mr rhys duff of ebury street sir he looked extremely pale i am very sorry indeed that he seems to have met with a disaster it truly grieves me sir evan bit his lip im sure did you also make a suit in a brown wool for another gentleman possibly related to him this man would be in his middlefifties average height quite solidly built he had grey hair rather fairer than rhys duffs i should think yes sir jiggs took a shaky breath i made several suits for mr leighton duff hes master rhyss father i fear it may be he you are describing was he injured also i am afraid he is dead mr jiggs can you tell me the number in ebury street i am obliged to inform his family oh why of course how very terrible i wish there were some way i could assist he stepped back as he said it but there was a look of acute distress in his face and evan was disposed to believe him at least in part the number in ebury street he repeated yes yes i think it is thirtyfour if my memory serves but ill look in my books yes of course i will however evan did not go straight to ebury street rather he returned first to st thomass there was a sense in which it would be kinder to the family if he could tell them at least that rhys duff was still alive perhaps conscious and if he could speak maybe he could tell what had happened and evan would have to ask fewer questions and there was part of him which was simply not ready yet to go and tell some woman that her husband was dead and her son may or may not survive and no one knew yet in what degree of injury pain or disability he found riley straight away looking as if he had been there all night certainly he seemed to be wearing the same clothes with precisely the same wrinkles and bloodstains on them hes still alive he said as soon as he saw evan and before evan could ask he stirred a bit about an hour ago lets go and see if hes come around and he set off with a longlegged stride as if he too were eager to know the ward was busy two young doctors were changing bandages and examining wounds a nurse who looked no more than fifteen or sixteen was carrying buckets of slops her shoulders bent as she strove to keep them off the floor an elderly woman struggled with a bucket of coals and evan offered to take them from her but she refused looking nervously at riley another nurse gathered up soiled laundry and brushed past them with her face averted riley seemed hardly to notice his attention was solely upon the patients evan followed him to the end of the ward where he saw with a rush of relief overtaken instantly by anxiety that rhys duff lay motionless on his back but his eyes were open large dark eyes which stared up at the ceiling and seemed to see only horror riley stopped by the bed and looked at him with some concern good morning mr duff he said gently you are in st thomass hospital my name is riley how are you feeling rhys duff rolled his head very slightly until his eyes were focusing on riley how are you feeling mr duff riley repeated rhys opened his mouth his lips moved but there was no sound whatever does your throat hurt riley asked with a frown it was obviously not something he had expected rhys stared at him does your throat hurt riley asked again nod if it does very slowly rhys shook his head he looked faintly surprised riley put his hand on rhyss slender wrist above the bandaging of his broken hand the other similarly splinted and bound lay on the cover can you speak mr duff riley asked very softly rhys opened his mouth again and again no sound came riley waited rhyss eyes were filled with terrible memory fear and pain held him transfixed momentarily his head moved from side to side in denial he could not speak riley turned to evan im sorry youll get nothing from him yet he may be well enough for yes and no tomorrow but he may not at the moment hes too shocked for you to bother him at all for certain he cant talk to you or describe anyone and it will be weeks before he can hold a pen if his hands mend well enough ever evan hesitated he needed desperately to know what had happened but he was torn with pity for this unbearably injured boy he wished he had his fathers faith to help him understand how such things could happen why was there not some justice to prevent it he did not have a blind belief to soothe either his anger or his pity nor did he have hesters capacity to provide practical help which would have eased the aching helplessness inside him perhaps the nearest he could strive for was monks dedication to pursuing truth do you know who did this to you mr duff he asked speaking over riley rhys shut his eyes and again shook his head if he had any memory he was choosing to close it out as too monstrous to bear i think you should leave now sergeant riley said with an edge to his voice he cant tell you anything evan acknowledged the truth of it and with one last look at the ashen face of the young man lying in the bed he turned and went about the only duty he dreaded more ebury street was quiet and elegant in the cold morning air there was a slick of ice on the pavements and housemaids were indisposed to linger in gossip the two or three people evan saw were all keeping moving whisking dusters and mop heads out of windows and in again as quickly as possible an errand boy scampered up steps and rang a bell with fingers clumsy with cold evan found number thirtyfour and unconsciously copying monk he went to the front door anyway news such as he had should not go through the kitchens first the bell was answered by a parlour maid in a smart uniform her starched linen and lace immediately proclaimed a household of better financial standing than the clothes worn by the dead man suggested yes sir good morning i am police sergeant evans does a mr leighton duff live here yes sir but he isnt home at the moment she said it with some anxiety it was not a piece of information she would normally have offered to a caller even though she knew it to be true she looked at his face and perhaps read the weariness and sadness in it is everything all right sir no im afraid it isnt is there a mrs duff her hand flew to her mouth her eyes filled with alarm but she did not scream you had better warn her ladys maid and perhaps the butler i am afraid i have very bad news silently she opened the door wider and let him in a butler with thin greying hair came from the back of the hallway frowning who is the gentleman janet he turned to evan good morning sir may i be of assistance to you i am afraid mr duff is not at home at present and mrs duff is not receiving he was less sensitive to evans expression than the maid had been i am from the police evan repeated i have extremely bad news to tell mrs duff im very sorry perhaps you should remain in case she needs some assistance possibly you might send a messenger for your family doctor what what has happened now he looked thoroughly horrified i am afraid that mr leighton duff and mr rhys duff have met with violence mr rhys is in st thomass hospital in a very serious condition the butler gulped and and mr mr leighton duff i am afraid he is dead oh dear i he swayed a little where he stood in the magnificent hallway with its curved staircase aspidistras in stone urns and brass umbrella stand with silvertopped canes in it youd better sit down a minute mr wharmby janet said with sympathy wharmby straightened himself up but he looked very pallid certainly not whatever next it is my duty to look after poor mrs duff in every way possible as it is yours go and get alfred to fetch dr wade i shall inform madam that there is someone to see her you might return with a decanter of brandy just in case some restorative is needed but it was not sylvestra duff sat motionless in the large chair in the morning room her face bloodlessly white under her dark hair with its pronounced widows peak she was not immediately beautiful her face was too long too aquiline her nose delicately flared her eyes almost black but she had a distinction which became more marked the longer one was with her her voice was low and very measured in other circumstances it would have been lovely now she was too shattered by horror and grief to speak in anything but broken fractions of sentences how she started where where did you say in one of the back streets of an area known as st giles evan answered gently moderating the truth a little he wished there were some way she would never have to know the full facts st giles it seemed to mean very little to her he studied her face the smooth highboned cheeks and curved brow he thought he saw a slight tightening but it could have been no more than a change in the light as she turned towards him it is a few hundred yards off regent street towards aldgate aldgate she said with a frown where did he say he was going mrs duff he asked he didnt say perhaps you would tell me all you can recall of yesterday she shook her head very slowly no no that can wait first i must go to my son i must i must be with him you said he is very badly hurt i am afraid so but he is in the best hands possible he leaned a little towards her you can do no more for him at present he said earnestly it is best he rests he is not fully sensible most of the time no doubt the doctor will give him herbs and sedatives to ease his pain and help him to heal are you trying to spare my feelings sergeant i assure you it is not necessary i must be where i can do the most good that is the only thing which will be of any comfort to me she looked at him very directly she had amazing eyes their darkness almost concealed her emotions and made her a peculiarly private woman he imagined the great spanish aristocrats might have looked something like that proud secretive hiding their vulnerability no mrs duff he denied i was trying to find out as much as i can from you about what occurred yesterday while it is fresh in your mind before you are fully occupied with your son at the moment it is dr rileys help he needs i need yours you are very direct sergeant he did not know if it was a criticism or simply an observation her voice was without expression she was too profoundly shocked from the reality of what he had told her to touch anything but the surface of her mind she sat upright her back rigid shoulders stiff her hands unmoving in her lap he imagined if he touched them he would find them locked together unbending i am sorry it seems not the time for niceties this matters far too much did your husband and son leave the house together no no rhys left first i did not see him go and your husband yes yes i saw him leave of course did he say where he was going no no he quite often went out in the evening to his club it is a very usual thing for a gentleman to do business as well as pleasure depends upon social acquaintances he did not say specifically he was not sure why but he did not entirely believe her was it possible she was aware that he frequented certain dubious places perhaps even that he used prostitutes it was tacitly accepted by many even though they would have been shocked if anyone had been vulgar and insensitive enough to speak it everyone was aware of bodily functions no one referred to them it was both indelicate and unnecessary how was he dressed maam her arched eyebrows rose dressed presumably as you found him sergeant what do you mean did he have a watch mrs duff a watch yes oh i see he was robbed yes he had a very fine gold watch it was not on him no was he in the habit of carrying much money with him i dont know i can ask bridlaw his valet he could probably tell you does it matter it might evan was puzzled do you know if he was wearing his gold watch yesterday when he left it seemed a strange and rather perverse thing to go into st giles for whatever reason wearing a conspicuously expensive article like a gold watch so easily visible it almost invited robbery was he lost was he even taken there against his will did he mention meeting anyone no she was quite certain and the watch he prompted yes i believe he was wearing it she stared at him intently he almost always did he was very fond of it i think i would have noticed were he without it i remember now he wore a brown suit not his best at all in fact rather an inferior one he had it made for the most casual wear weekends and so forth and yet the night he went out was a wednesday evan reminded her then he must have been planning a casual evening she replied bluntly why do you ask sergeant what difference does it make now he was not murdered because of what he wore i was trying to deduce where he intended to go mrs duff st giles is not an area where we would expect to find a gentleman of mr duffs means and social standing if i knew why he was there or with whom i would be a great deal closer to knowing what happened to him i see i suppose it was foolish of me not to have understood she looked away from him the room was comfortable beautifully proportioned there was no sound but the crackle of flames in the fireplace and the soft rhythmic ticking of the clock on the mantel everything about it was gracious serene different in every conceivable way from the alley in which its owner had perished quite probably st giles was beyond the knowledge or even the imagination of his widow your husband left shortly after your son mrs duff he leaned a little forward as he spoke as if to attract her attention she turned towards him slowly i suppose you want to know how my son was dressed also yes please i cannot remember in something very ordinary grey or navy i think no a black coat and grey trousers it was what he had been wearing when he was found evan said nothing he said he was going out to enjoy himself she said her voice suddenly dropping and catching with emotion he was angry with whom he tried to picture the scene rhys duff was probably no more than eighteen or nineteen still immature rebellious she lifted her shoulder very slightly it was a gesture of denial as if the question were incapable of answer was there a quarrel maam a difference of opinion she sat silent for so long he was afraid she was not going to reply of course it was bitterly painful it was their last meeting they could never now be reconciled the fact that she did not deny it instantly was answer enough it was trivial she said at last it doesnt matter now my husband was dubious about some of the company rhys chose to keep oh not anyone who would hurt him sergeant i am speaking of female company my husband wished rhys to make the acquaintance of reputable young ladies he was in a position to make a settlement upon him if he chose to marry not a good fortune many young men can count upon indeed not evan agreed with feeling he knew dozens of young men and indeed older ones who would dearly like to marry but could not afford it to keep an establishment suitable for a wife cost more than three or four times the amount necessary to live a single life and then the almost inevitable children added to that greatly rhys duff was an unusually fortunate young man why had he not been grateful for that as if answering his thought she spoke very softly perhaps he was too young he might have done it willingly if if it had not been his fathers wish for him the young can be so so wilful even against their own interests she seemed barely to be able to control the grief which welled up inside her evan hated having to press any questions at all but he knew that now she was more likely to tell him an unguarded truth tomorrow she could be more careful more watchful to conceal anything which damaged or revealed he struggled for anything to say which could be of comfort and there was nothing in his mind he saw so clearly the pale bruised face of the young man lying first in the alley crumpled and bleeding and then in st thomass his eyes filled with horror which was quite literally unspeakable he saw again his mouth open as he struggled and failed even to ut tera word what could anyone say to comfort his mother he made a resolve that however long it took him however hard it was he would find out what had happened in that alley and make whoever was responsible answer for it he said nothing of where he might go he resumed had he any usual haunts he left in some heat she replied she seemed to have steadied herself again i believe his father had an idea as to where he frequented perhaps it is known to men in general there are places it was only an impression i cannot help you sergeant but both men were in some temper when they left yes how long apart in time was that i am not sure because rhys left the room and it was not until about half an hour after that when we realised he had also left the house my husband then went out immediately i see they were found together again her voice wavered and she had to make a visible effort to control herself yes it looks as if perhaps your husband caught up with your son and some time after that they were set upon maybe they were lost she looked at him anxiously quite possibly he agreed hoping it was true of all the explanations it would be the kindest the easiest for her to bear it would not be hard to become lost in such a warren of alleys and passages merely a few yards in the wrong direction he left the rest unsaid he wanted to believe it almost as much as she did because he knew so much more of the alternatives there was a knock on the door an unusual thing for a servant to do it was normal for a butler simply to come in and then await a convenient moment either to serve whatever was required or to deliver a message come in sylvestra said with a lift of surprise the man who entered was lean and dark with a handsome face deepset eyes and a nose perhaps a trifle small now his expression was one of acute concern and distress he all but ignored evan and went immediately to sylvestra but his manner was professional as well as personal presumably he was the doctor wharmby had sent for my dear i cannot begin to express my sorrow naturally anything i can do you have but to name i shall remain with you as long as you wish certainly i shall prescribe something to help you sleep and to calm and assist you through these first dreadful days eglantyne says if you wish to leave here and stay with us we shall see that you have all the peace and privacy you could wish our house will be yours thank you you are very kind i she gave a little shiver i dont even know what i want yet what there is to be done she rose to her feet swayed a moment and grasped for his arm which he gave instantly first i must go to st thomass hospital and see rhys do you think that is wise the doctor cautioned you are in a state of extreme shock my dear allow me to go for you i can at least see that he is given the very best professional help and care i will see that he is brought home as soon as it is medically advisable in the meantime i shall care for him myself i promise you she hesitated torn between love and good sense let me at least see him she pleaded take me i promise i shall not be a burden i am in command of myself he hesitated only a moment of course take a little brandy just to revive yourself then i shall accompany you he glanced at evan i am sure you are finished here sergeant anything else you need to know can wait until a more opportune time it was dismissal and evan accepted it with a kind of relief there was little more he could learn here now perhaps later he would speak to the valet and other servants the coachman might know where his master was in the habit of going in the meantime there were people he knew in st giles informers men and women upon whom pressure could be placed judicious questions asked and a great deal might be learned of course he conceded rising to his feet i shall try to bother you as little as possible maam he took his leave as the doctor was taking the decanter of brandy from the butler and pouring a little into a glass outside in the street where it was beginning to snow he turned up his coat collar and walked briskly he wondered what monk would have done would he have thought of some brilliant and probing questions whose answers would have revealed a new line of truth to follow and unravel would he have felt any less crippled by pity and horror than evan did had there been something obvious which his emotion had prevented him from seeing surely the obvious thing was that father and son had gone whoring in st giles and been careless perhaps paid less than the asking price perhaps been too highhanded or arrogant showing off their money and their gold watches and some ruffian afire with drink had attacked them and then like a dog at the smell of blood run amok either way what could the widow know of it he was right not to harry her now he put his head down against the east wind and increased his pace chapter two rhys duff was kept in hospital for a further two days and on the monday the fifth day after the attack he was brought home in great pain and still without having spoken a word dr corriden wade was to call every day or as he progressed every second day but of course it would be necessary to have him professionally nursed at the recommendation of the young policeman on the case and having made appropriate enquiries as to her abilities wade agreed to the employment of one of the women who had gone out to the crimea with florence nightingale a miss hester latterly she was of necessity used to caring for young men who had suffered near mortal injuries in combat she was considered an excellent choice to hester herself it was an agreeable change after having nursed an elderly and extremely trying lady whose problems were largely matters of temper and boredom only slightly exacerbated by two broken toes she could probably have managed just as well with a competent ladys maid but she felt more dramatic with a nurse and impressed her friends endlessly by likening her plight to that of the war heroes hester had nursed before her hester kept a civil tongue with difficulty and only because she required the employment in order to survive her fathers financial ruin had meant she had no inheritance her elder brother charles would always have provided for her as men were expected to provide and care for their unmarried female relations but such dependence would be suffocating to a woman like hester who had tasted an extraordinary freedom in the crimea and a responsibility at once both exhilarating and terrifying she was certainly not going to spend the rest of her days in quiet domesticity being obedient and grateful to a rather unimaginative if kindly brother it was infinitely preferable to bite ones tongue and refrain from telling miss golightly she was a fool for the space of a few weeks she thought as she settled herself in the hansom that was to take her to this new position that there were other very considerable advantages to her independent situation she could make friends where and with whom she chose charles would not have had any objection to lady callandra daviot well not any severe objection she was well bred and had been highly respectable while her army surgeon husband was alive now as a fairly wealthy widow she was becoming rather less so indeed some might have considered her a trifle eccentric she had made a pact with a private agent of enquiry that she would support him financially during his lean times as long as he shared with her his more interesting cases that was not in any sense respectable but it was enormously diverting at times tragic and always absorbing frequently it accomplished if not happiness at least a resolution and some kind of justice the hansom was moving at a brisk pace through the traffic she shivered in the cold and there was the agent of enquiry himself charles would never have approved of william monk how could society possibly accept a man without a memory he could be anyone he could have done anything the possibilities were endless and almost all of them unpleasant had he been a hero an aristocrat or a gentleman someone would have recognised him and owned him since the one thing he knew about himself for certain was that he was a policeman that automatically placed him in a social category somewhere beneath even the most regrettable trade and of course trade was beneath any of the professions younger sons of the gentry went into the army or the church or the law those who did not marry wealth and relieve themselves of the necessity of having to do anything elder sons naturally inherited land and money and lived accordingly not that hesters friendship with monk could easily be categorised pressing through the traffic in the rain she thought of it with a mixture of emotions all of them disturbingly powerful it had lurched from an initial mutual contempt to a kind of trust which was unique in her life and she believed in his also and then as if suddenly afraid of such vulnerability they had been quick to quarrel to find fault and keep little rein on temper but in times of need and the mutual caring for some cause they had worked together in an understanding that ran deeper than words or the need or time for explanations in one fearful hour in edinburgh when they had believed they faced death it had seemed to be that kind of love which touches only a few lives a depth of unity which is of the heart and mind and soul and for one aching moment of the body also in the lurching of the cab and the hiss of wheels in the rain she could remember edinburgh as if it had been yesterday but the experience had been too dangerous to the emotions too demanding for either of them to dare again or had it only been he who would not dare that was a question she did not want to ask herself she had not meant to allow the thought into her mind and there it was hard and painful now she refused to express it she did not know she did not want to anyway it was all irrelevant there were parts of monk she admired greatly his courage his strength of will his intelligence his loyalty to his beliefs his passion for justice his ability to face almost any kind of truth no matter how dreadful and the fact that he was never ever a hypocrite she also hated the streak of cruelty she knew in him the arrogance the frequent insensitivity and he was a fool where judgement of character was concerned he could no more read a womans wiles than a dog could read spanish he was consistently attracted to the very last sort of woman who could ever make him happy unconsciously she was clenching her hands as she sat in the cold he was bewitched taken in again and again by pretty softly spoken outwardly helpless women who were shallow of nature manipulative and essentially searching for comfortable lives far from turmoil of any kind he would have been bored silly by any one of them within months but their femininity flattered him their agreement to his wildest assertions had seemed like good nature and good sense and their charming manners pleased his notion of feminine decorum he fancied himself comfortable with them whereas in truth he was only soothed unchallenged and in the end bored imprisoned and contemptuous but still he made the same mistake his recent visit to one of the smaller german principalities was the perfect example he had fallen under the spell of the extremely shallow and utterly selfish countess evelyn von seidlitz she was deliciously pretty with her enormous brown eyes and dimpling laugh she had a wicked sense of humour and knew precisely how to charm flatter and entertain she was lovely to look at and fun to be with she was also cold manipulative and greedy they were pressed in on all sides by hansoms drays carriages drivers were shouting a horse squealed monk had seen through the countess eventually of course but it had required unarguable evidence to convince him and then he was angry above all it seemed with hester she did not know why she recalled their last meeting with twinges of pain which took her unexpectedly it had been highly acrimonious but then so had a great many of their meetings normally it caused her irritation that she had not managed to think of a suitable retaliation at the right moment or satisfaction that she had she was frequently furious with him and he with her it was not unpleasant in fact at times it was exhilarating there was a kind of honesty in it and it was without real hurt she would never have struck at any part of him she felt might be genuinely vulnerable so why did their last encounter leave her this ache this feeling of being bruised inside she tried to recall exactly what he had said she could not now even remember what the quarrel had been about something to do with her arbitrariness a favourite subject with him he had said she was autocratic that she judged people too harshly and only according to her own standards which were devoid of laughter or humanity the hansom lurched forward again he said she knew how to nurse the sick and reform the dilatory the incompetent or the feckless but she had no idea how to live like an ordinary woman how to laugh or cry and experience the feelings of anything but a hospital matron endlessly picking up the disasters of other peoples lives but never having one of her own her ceaseless minding of other peoples business the fact that she thought she always knew better made her a bore the sum of it had been that he could do very well without her and while her qualities were admirable and socially very necessary they were also personally unattractive that was what had hurt criticism was fair it was expected and she could certainly give him back as much in quality and quantity as she received but rejection was another thing altogether and it was completely unfair for once she had done nothing to warrant it she had remained in london nursing a young man desperately damaged by paralysis apart from that she had been occupied trying to save oliver rathbone from himself in that he had undertaken the defence in a scandalous slander case and very nearly damaged his own career beyond repair as it was it had cost him his reputation in certain circles had he not been granted a knighthood shortly before the affair he could certainly abandon all hope of one now he had shed too ugly a light on royalty in general to find such favour any more he was no longer considered as sound as he had been all his life until then now he was suddenly questionable but she found herself smiling at the thought of him their last meeting had been anything but acrimonious theirs was not really a social acquaintance rather more a professional friendship he had surprised her by inviting her to accompany him to dinner and then to the theatre she had accepted and enjoyed it so much she recalled it now with a little shiver of pleasure at first she had felt rather awkward at the sudden shift in their relationship what should she talk about for once there was no case in which they had a common interest it was years since she had dined alone with a man for other than professional reasons but she had forgotten how sophisticated he was she had seen the vulnerable side of him in the slander case at dinner and at the theatre he was utterly different here he was in command as always he was immaculately dressed in the understated way of a man who knows he does not need to impress his position is already assured he had talked easily of all manner of things art politics travel a little philosophy and a touch of trivial scandal he had made her laugh she could picture him now sitting back in his chair his eyes looking at her very directly he had unusual eyes very dark in his lean narrow face with its fairish hair long nose and fastidious mouth she had never known him so relaxed before as if for a space of time duty and the law had ceased to matter he had mentioned his father once or twice a man hester had met several times and of whom she was extraordinarily fond he even told her a few stories about his student days and his first disastrous cases she had not been sure whether to sympathise or be amused she had looked at his face and ended laughing he had not seemed to mind in the least they had nearly been late for the theatre and had taken their seats almost as the curtain rose it was a melodrama a terrible play she had sat trying not to acknowledge to herself how bad it was she must keep facing the stage rathbone sitting beside her would be bound to be aware if she gazed around or took more interest in the other members of the audience she had sat rigidly facing forwards trying to enjoy it then she had glanced at him after one particularly dreadful sequence of lines and saw him wince a few moments later she had looked at him again and this time found him looking back his eyes bright with rueful amusement she had dissolved in giggles and knew that when he pulled out a large handkerchief and held it to his mouth it was for the same reason then he had leaned across to her and whispered shall we leave before they ask us not to disrupt the performance and she had been delighted to agree afterwards they had walked along the icy street still laughing mimicking some of the worst lines and parodying the scenes they had stopped by a brazier where a street peddler was selling roasted chestnuts and he had bought two packets and they had walked along together trying not to burn their fingers or their tongues it had been one of the happiest evenings she could remember and curiously comfortable she was still smiling at its recollection when the hansom reached her destination in ebury street and set her down with her luggage she paid the driver and presented herself at the side door where a footman helped her in with her case and directed her to where she should wait to meet the mistress hester had been told little about the circumstances of rhys duffs injuries only that they were sustained in an attack in which his father had been killed she had been far more concerned with the nature of his distress and what measures she could take to help him she had seen dr riley at the hospital and he had professed a continuing interest in rhys duffs ease but it was the family doctor corriden wade who had approached her he had told her only that rhys duff was suffering from profound bruising both external and internal he was in a state of the most serious shock and had so far not spoken since the incident she should not try to make him respond except in so far as to make his wishes known regarding his comfort her task was to relieve his pain as far as was possible to change the dressings of his minor external wounds dr wade himself would care for the more major ones she must keep him clean warm and prepare for him such food as he was willing to take this of course should be bland and nourishing she was also to keep his room warm and pleasant for him and to read to him if he should show any desire for it the choice of material was to be made with great care there must be nothing disturbing either to the emotions or the intellect and nothing which would excite him or keep him from as much rest as he was able to find in hesters view that excluded almost everything that was worthy of either the time or effort of reading if it did not stir the intellect the emotions or the imagination what point was there in it should she read him the railway timetable but she had merely nodded and answered obediently when sylvestra duff came into the room she was a complete surprise hester had not formed a picture of her in her mind but she realised she had expected someone as anodyne as dr wades regimen for rhys sylvestra was anything but bland she was very naturally dressed entirely in black but on her tall very slender figure and with her intense colouring it was dramatic and most flattering she was pale with shock still and moved as if she needed to be careful in case in her daze she bumped into things but there was a grace and a composure in her which hester could not help but admire her first impression was most favourable she stood up immediately good morning mrs duff i am hester latterly the nurse dr wade engaged in your behalf to care for your son during his convalescence how do you do miss latterly sylvestra spoke with a low voice and rather slowly as if she measured her words before she uttered them i am grateful you could come you must have nursed many young men who have been terribly injured yes i have she considered adding something to the effect that a large number of them had made startling recoveries even from the most appalling circumstances then she looked at sylvestras calm eyes and decided it would be shallow and sound as if she were minim ising the truth and she had not yet seen rhys duff she had no idea for herself of his condition dr rileys pinched face and anxious eyes his expressed desire to hear of his progress indicated that his fears were deep that he would recover slowly if at all dr wade had also seemed in some personal distress as he spoke of it to her when engaging her we have prepared a room for you next to my sons sylvestra continued and arranged a bell so that he can call you if he should need you of course he cannot ring it but he can knock it off on to the floor and you will hear she was thinking of all the practical details speaking too quickly to cover her emotion the kitchen will serve you meals of course at whatever time may prove most suitable you must advise cook what you think best for my son from day to day i hope you will be comfortable if you have any other requirements please tell me and i shall do all i can to meet them thank you hesteracknowledged i am sure that will be satisfactory the shadow of a smile touched sylvestras mouth i imagine the footman has taken your luggage upstairs do you wish to see your room first and perhaps change your attire thank you but i should prefer to meet mr duff before anything else hester replied and perhaps you could tell me a little more about him about him sylvestra looked puzzled his nature his interests hesteranswered gently dr wade said that the shock has temporarily robbed him of speech i shall know of him only what you tell me to begin with i should not like to cause him any unnecessary annoyance or distress by ignorance also she hesitated sylvestra waited with no idea what she meant hester took a breath also i must know if you have told him of his fathers death sylvestras face cleared as she understood of course im sorry for being so slow to understand yes i have told him i did not think it right to keep it from him he will have to face it i do not want him to believe i have lied to him i cannot imagine how difficult it must be for you hester acknowledged i am sorry i had to ask sylvestra was silent for a moment as if she too were stunned even by the thought of what had happened to her in the space of a few days her husband was dead and her son was desperately ill and locked in his own world of isolation hearing and seeing but unable to speak unable to communicate with anyone the terror and the pain he must feel ill try to tell you something about him sylvestra replied to the request it it is difficult to think of the kind of things which would help she turned to lead the way out of the room and across the hall to the stairs at the bottom she looked back at hester i am afraid that because of the nature of the incident we have the police returning to ask questions i cannot believe they will trouble you since naturally you can know nothing when rhys regains his speech he will tell them but of course they dont wish to wait a bleakness came over her face i dont suppose they will ever find who did it anyway it will be some pack of nameless ruffians and the slums will protect their own she started up the stairs back very straight head high but there was no life in her step following after her hester imagined that inside she was barely beginning to lose the numbness of shock and only in her mind did she turn over and over the details as their reality emerged she could remember feeling the same when she first heard of the suicide of her father and then within weeks of her mothers death from loneliness and despair she had kept on worrying at the details and yet at the same time never really believed the man responsible for her familys ruin would be caught but that was all in the past now and all that needed to be retained in her mind from it was her understanding of the changing moods of grief the duff house was large and very modern in furnishings everything she had seen in the morning room and now in the hall dated from no further back than the accession of the queen there was none of the spare elegance of the georgian period or of william iv there were pictures everywhere ornate wallpaper tapestries and woven rugs flower arrangements and stuffed animals under glass fortunately both the hall and the upstairs landing were large enough not to give an air of oppression but it was not a style hester found comfortable sylvestra opened the third door along hesitated a moment then invited hester to accompany her inside this room was completely different the long windows faced south and such daylight as there was fell on almost bare walls the space was dominated by a large bed with carved posts and in it lay a young man with pale skin his sensitive moody face mottled with blueblack bruises and in several places still scabbed with dried blood his hair as black as his mothers was parted to one side and fell forward over his brow because of the disfigurement of his injuries and the pain he must feel it was difficult to read his expression but he stared at hester with what looked like resentment it did not surprise her she was an intruder in a very deep and private grief she was a stranger and yet he would be dependent upon her for his most personal needs she would witness his pain and be detached from it able to come and go to see and yet not to feel he would not be the first patient to find that humiliating an emotional and physical nakedness in front of someone who always had the privacy of clothing sylvestra went over to the bed but she did not sit this is miss latterly who is going to care for you now you are home again she will be with you all the time or else in the room along the landing where the bell will ring to summon her if you need her she will do everything she can to make you comfortable and help you to get better he turned his head to regard hester with only mild curiosity and still what she could not help feeling was dislike how do you do mr duff she said rather more coolly than she had originally intended she had nursed very awkward patients before but for all her realisation it was still disturbing to be disliked by someone for whom she had an instinctive pity and with whom she would spend the next weeks or months constantly and in most intimate circumstances he blinked but stared back at her in silence it was going to be a difficult beginning whatever might follow sylvestra looked faintly embarrassed she turned from rhys to hester perhaps i had better show you your room thank you hesteraccepted she would change into a plainer and more practical dress and return alone to try to get to know rhys duff and learn what there was she could do to help him her first evening in the duff house was unfamiliar and oddly lonely she had frequently been among people who were profoundly distressed by violence bereavement even by crime she had lived with people under the pressure of investigation by strangers into the most private and vulnerable parts of their lives she had known people whom dreadful circumstances had caused to be suspicious and frightened of each other but she had never before nursed a patient who was conscious and yet unable to speak there was a silence in the whole house which gave her a sense of isolation sylvestra herself was a quiet woman not given to conversing except when she had some definite message to impart not talking simply for companionship as most women do the servants were muted as if in the presence of the dead not chattering or gossiping among themselves as was habitual when hester returned to rhyss room she found him lying on his back staring up at the ceiling his eyes wide and fixed as if in great concentration upon something she hesitated to interrupt him she stood watching the firelight flickering looked to make certain there were enough coals in the bucket for several hours then studied the small bookcase on the nearer wall to see what he had chosen to read before the attack she saw books on various other countries africa india the far east and at least a dozen on forms of travel letters and memoirs of explorers botanists and observers of the customs and habits of other cultures there was one large and beautifully bound book on the art of islam another on the history of byzantium another seemed to be on the arab and moorish conquests of north africa and spain before the rise of ferdinand and isabella had driven them south again beside it was a book on arabic art mathematics and inventions she must make some contact with him if she had to force the issue then she would she walked forward where he must see her even if only from the corner of his eye you have an interesting collection of books she said conversationally have you ever travelled he turned his head to stare at her i know you cannot speak but you can nod your head she went on have you he shook his head very slightly it was communication but the animosity was still in his eyes do you plan to when you are better something closed inside his mind she could see the change in him quite clearly although it was so slight as to defy description ive been to the crimea she said disregarding his withdrawal i was there during the war of course i saw mostly battlefields and hospitals but there were occasions when i saw something of the people and the countryside it is always extraordinary almost indecent to me how the flowers go on blooming and so many things seem exactly the same even when the world is turning upside down with men killing and dying in their hundreds you feel as if everything ought to stop but of course it doesnt she watched him and he did not move his eyes away even though they seemed filled with anger she was almost sure it was anger not fear she looked down to where his broken and splinted hands lay on the sheets the ends of the fingers below the bandages were slender and sensitive the nails were perfectly shaped except one which was badly torn he must have injured them when he had fought to try to save himself and perhaps his father too what did he remember of it what terrible knowledge was locked up in his silence i met several turkish people who were very charming and most interesting she went on as if he had responded wishing to know she described a young man who had helped in the hospital talking about him quite casually remembering more and more as she spoke what she could not recall she invented once during the whole hour she saw the beginning of a smile touch his mouth at least he was really listening for a moment they had shared a thought or a feeling later she brought a salve to put on the broken skin of his face where it was drying and would crack painfully she reached out with it on her finger and the moment her skin touched his he snatched his cheek away his body clenched up his eyes black and angry it wont hurt she promised it will help to stop the scab from cracking he did not move his muscles were tight his chest and shoulders so locked the pain of it must have pulled on the bruises which both dr riley and dr wade had said covered his body she let her hands fall all right it doesnt matter ill ask you later and see if youve changed your mind she left and went downstairs to the kitchen to fetch him something to eat perhaps the cook would prepare him a coddled egg or a light custard according to dr wade he was well enough to eat and must be encouraged to do so the cook mrs crozier had quite an array of suitable dishes either already prepared or easy to make even as hester waited she offered beef tea eggs steamed fish bread and butter pudding baked custard or cold chicken how is he miss she asked with concern in her face he seems very poorly still hesteranswered honestly but we should keep every hope perhaps you know which dishes he likes her face brightened a little oh yes miss i certainly do very fond o cold saddle o mutton he is or jugged hare as soon as hes ready for that ill let you know hester took the coddled egg and the custard she found him in a changed mood he seemed very ready to allow her to assist him to sit up and take more than half the food prepared for him in spite of the fact that to move at all obviously caused him considerable pain he gasped and the sweat broke out on his face he seemed at once clammy and cold and for a little while nauseous as well she did all she could for him but it was very little she was forced to stand by helplessly while he fought waves of pain his eyes on her face filled with desperation and a plea for any comfort at all any relief she reached out and held the ends of his fingers below the bandages regardless of the bruising and the broken scabbed skin and gripped him as she would were he slipping away from her literally his fingers clung so hard she felt as though she too would be bruised when at last he let go half an hour passed in silence then finally he began to relax a little the sweat was running off his brow and standing in beads on his lip but his shoulders lay easy on the pillow and his fingers unclenched she was able to slip her hand out and move away to wring the cloth again and bathe his face he smiled at her it was just a small curving of the lips a softening of his eyes but it was real she smiled back and felt a tightness in her throat it was a glimpse of the man he must have been before this terrible thing had happened to him rhys did not knock the bell for her during the night nevertheless she woke twice of her own accord and went in to see how he was the first occasion she found him sleeping fitfully she waited a few moments then crept out again without disturbing him the second time he was awake and he heard her the moment she pushed the door he was lying staring towards her she had not brought a candle using only the light from the embers of the fire the room was colder his eyes looked hollow in the shadows she smiled at him i think its time i stoked the fire again she said quietly its nearly out he nodded very slightly and then watched her as she crossed the room and took away the guard and bent to riddle the dead ash through the basket and very gently pile more small pieces of coal on what was left then wait until it caught in a fragile flame its coming she said for no reason other than a sense of communication she looked around and saw him still watching her are you cold she asked he nodded but it was halfhearted his expression rueful she gathered he was only a very little chilly she waited until the flames were stronger then put on more coals piling them high enough to last until morning she went back to the bed and looked at him more closely trying to read in his expression what he wanted or needed he did not seem in physical pain any more than before but there was an urgency in his eyes a tension around his mouth did he want her to stay or to go if she asked him would it be too clumsy too direct she must be delicate he had been hurt so badly what had happened to him what had he seen would you like a little milk and arrowroot she suggested he nodded immediately ill be back in a few minutes she promised she returned nearly a quarter of an hour later it was further to the kitchen than she had remembered and it had taken longer to bring the cooking range to a reasonable heat but the ingredients were fresh and she had a handsome blue and white porcelain mug filled with steaming milk just the right temperature to drink and the arrowroot in it would be soothing she propped the pillows behind him and held it to his lips he drank it with a smile his eyes steady on hers when he was finished she was not sure whether he wanted her to stay or not to speak or remain silent what should she say usually she would have asked a patient about themselves led them to talk to her but anything with rhys would be utterly onesided she could only guess from his expression whether her words interested or bored encouraged or caused further pain she had hardly seen sylvestra to learn any more about him in the end she said nothing she took the empty cup from him are you ready to sleep she asked he shook his head slowly but decisively he wanted her to stay you have some very interesting books she glanced towards the shelf do you like to be read to he thought for a moment then nodded she should choose something far removed from his present life and it must be something without violence nothing must remind him of his own experience and yet it must not be tedious either she went over to the shelf and tried to make out the titles in the firelight which was now considerable how about a history of byzantium she suggested he nodded again and she returned with it in her hand ill have to light the gas he agreed and for threequarters of an hour she read quietly to him about the colourful and devious history of that great centre of empire its customs and its people its intrigues and struggles for power he fell asleep reluctantly and she closed the book marking the page with a taper from the box by the fire put out the light again and tiptoed back to her room with a feeling of something close to elation there was not a great deal she could do for him beyond making sure he was as comfortable as possible that his bedroom was clean and that the bandages on his more minor wounds were changed as often as was consistent with healing eating was difficult for him and seemed to cause him immediate distress obviously his internal injuries affected his ability to accept and digest food it was distressing and yet she knew that if he did not take nourishment he would waste away his organs would cease to function and he would damage them irreparably fluid was vital she brought him milk and arrowroot again beef tea and a little dry very thin toast and then half an hour later more egg custard it was not without pain but he did retain it dr wade came in the late morning he looked anxious his face pinched his eyes shadowed he himself was limping and in some pain from a fall from his horse over the previous weekend he came upstairs almost immediately meeting hester on the landing how is he miss latterly i fear it is a wretched job ive given you im truly sorry please dont apologise dr wade she responded sincerely i dont wish to have only the easy cases his face softened im very grateful for that i had heard well of you it seems with good reason nevertheless it must be disturbing when there is so little you can do anyone can do to help he frowned and his voice dropped he stared at the floor ive known the family for years miss latterly ever since i came out of the navy the navy she was caught by surprise it was something she had not even imagined im sorry i have no right to he smiled suddenly illuminating his features and changing his appearance entirely i was a naval surgeon twenty years ago some of the men i tended had served with nelson his eyes met hers bright with memory seeing in his mind another age another world one old sailor whose leg i amputated after a canon had broken loose and pinned him to the bulkhead had served in the victory at trafalgar his voice was thick with concentration i dont suppose there is another woman i know to whom i could say that and she would have some idea of what it means but you have seen battle you have watched the courage amid horror the heart and the strength the endurance through pain and in the face of death i think we share something that the people around us can never know i am extremely grateful that you are nursing poor rhys and will be here to support sylvestra through what can only be a dreadful ordeal for her he did not say so in words but she saw in his eyes that he was preparing her for the fact that rhys might not recover she steeled herself i shall do everything i can she promised meeting his gaze steadily im sure you will he nodded i have no doubt of it whatever now i will see him alone i am sure you understand he is a proud man young sensitive i have wounds to tend dressings which must be changed of course if i can be of assistance just ring the bell thank you thank you miss latterly in the afternoon hester left rhys to rest and spent a little time with sylvestra in the withdrawing room it was crowded with furniture as was the rest of the house but warm and surprisingly comfortable to the body if not to the eye the house was very quiet she could hear only the flames in the fireplace and the driving of rain against the window there were no sounds of servants feet across the hallway or whispers or laughter as there were in most houses tragedy seemed to have settled over it with peculiar loneliness sylvestra asked after rhys but it was merely to make conversation she had been in to see him twice during the day the second time she had stayed for a painful halfhour trying to think of something to say to him recalling happiness in the distant past when he was still a child and half promising that such peace and joy would come again she had not mentioned leighton duff perhaps that was natural the shock and wound of his loss was far too new and she certainly would not wish to remind rhys of it in the silences between them hester looked around the room for something to prompt a conversation again she was unsure whether speech was wanted or not she was conscious of a painful isolation in the woman who sat a few feet away from her a polite smile on her face her eyes distant hester did not know if it was loneliness or simply a private dignity of grief she saw among the group photographs one of a young woman with dark eyes and level brows and a nose too strong to be pretty but her mouth was beautiful she bore a marked resemblance to rhys and the gown she was wearing the top half of which was very clear in the picture was of very modern style not more than a year or two old what an interesting face she remarked hoping it was not touching on another tragedy sylvestra smiled and there was pride in it that is my daughter amalia hester wondered where she was and how soon she could be here to help and support her mother surely no family duty could be more important the answer came immediately again with a lift of pride and shadow of puzzlement she is in india both my daughters are there constance is married to a captain in the army she had the most terrible time during the mutiny three years ago she writes often telling us about life there she looked not at hester but into the dancing flames of the fire she says things can never be the same again she used to love it even when it was most boring for many of the wives during the heat of the summer the women would all go up to the hill stations you know it was a rhetorical question she did not expect hester to have any knowledge of such things she had forgotten she had been an army nurse or perhaps she did not understand what it really meant it was another world from hers they can never trust now as they used to it has all changed she went on the violence was unimaginable the torture the massacres she shook her head but of course they cant come home it is their duty to remain she said it without bitterness or the slightest resentment duty was a strength and a reason for life as well as its most rigid boundary i understand hester said quickly she did her mind flew back to officers she had known in the crimea men clever ones and foolish ones to whom duty was as simple as a flame at no matter what cost personal or public even when it was painful or ridiculous they would never think of doing other than what was expected of them at times she could have shouted at them or even lashed out at them physically through sheer frustration at their rigidity at the sometimes unnecessary and terrible sacrifices but she never ceased to admire it in them whether at its noblest or its most futile or both together sylvestra must have caught something in her voice a depth of answering emotion she turned to look at her and for the first time smiled amalia is in india too but her husband is in the colonial service and she takes a great interest in the native peoples there was pride in her face and amazement for a way of life she could hardly imagine she has friends among the women sometimes i worry that she is very rash i fear she intrudes where westerners are not wanted thinking she will alter things for the good when in truth she may only do damage i have written advising her but she was never good at accepting counsel hugo is a nice young man but too busy with his own tasks to pay sufficient attention to amalia i think hesters imagination pictured a rather stuffy man shuffling papers on a desk while the spirited more adventurous amalia explored forbidden territories im sorry they are not closer to be with you at this time she said gently she knew it would be months before any letters from sylvestra with the news of her fathers death could circle round the cape of good hope and reach india and the answers return to england no wonder sylvestra was so terribly alone mourning was always a time for family closeness outsiders no matter how excellent their friendship felt intrusive and did not know what to say yes sylvestra agreed almost as if speaking to herself i would dearly like their company especially amalia she is always so positive she shivered a little in spite of the warmth of the room the heavy curtains drawn across the windows against the rain and the dark the empty tea tray with the remains of crumpets and butter i dont know what to expect the police again i suppose more questions for which i have no answers hester knew but it was kinder not to reply answers would be found ugly things uncovered even if only because they were private and perhaps foolish or shabby they would not necessarily include finding the man who had murdered leighton duff again rhys ate only beef tea and a little dry toast hester read to him for a while and he fell asleep early hester herself did not put out her light until after midnight and awoke again in the dark with a ripple of horror going over her like an icy draught the bell had not fallen yet she rose immediately and went through to rhyss room the fire was still burning well and the flames cast plenty of light rhys was half sitting against the pillows his eyes wide open and filled with blind unspeakable terror his face was drenched in sweat his lips were stretched back over his teeth his throat convulsed over and over again and he seemed unable to draw breath except in gasps between each soundless scream his splinted hands were held up near his face to ward off the terror his mind saw rhys she cried going towards him quickly he did not hear her he was still asleep isolated in some terrible world of his own rhys she repeated more loudly wake up wake up you are safe at home still his mouth was working in the fearful screams which racked his body he could not see or hear hester he was in a narrow alley somewhere in st giles seeing agony and murder rhys now she shouted peremptorily and put out her hand to touch his wrist she was prepared for him to strike at her seeing her as part of the attack stop it you are at home you are safe she closed her hand over his wrist and shook him his body was rigid muscles locked his nightshirt was wet through with sweat wake up she shouted at him you must wake up he started to shake violently moving the whole bed back and forth then slowly he crumpled up and silent sobs shuddered through him tears running down his face the breath dragging in his throat she did not even think about it she sat on the bed and reached out her arms and held him touching his thick hair gently smoothing it off his brow following the line of it on the nape of his neck she sat there for a length of time she did not measure it could have been as long as an hour then at last gently she let him go and eased herself away to stand up she must change the damp and crumpled linen and make sure that in his distress he had not torn or moved any of his bandages im going to fetch clean sheets she said quietly she did not want him to think she was simply walking away ill be back in a moment or two she returned to find him staring at the door waiting for her she put the linen down on the chair and moved over to help him on to one side of the bed so she could begin changing it around him it was never an easy task but he was too ill to get out altogether and sit in a chair she was uncertain what internal injuries might be strained or what wounds dr wade had seen and she had not which might be broken open it took her some time and he was obviously in considerable pain and she had to be patient working around him smoothing and straightening rolling up and unfolding again at last it was remade and he lay exhausted but his nightshirt had to be changed as well the one he was wearing was soiled not only with sweat but with spots of blood she longed to redress the larger wounds to make sure they were properly covered but dr wade had forbidden her to touch them in case removal of the gauze should tear the healing tissue she held out the clean nightshirt he stared at it in her hands suddenly his eyes were defensive again the trust was gone unconsciously he pressed backwards into the pillows behind him she picked up the light top quilt and spread it over him from waist to feet she smiled at him very slightly and guardedly cautiously he allowed her to pull the nightshirt up and off over his head it hurt his shoulders to raise his arms but he gritted his teeth and did not hesitate she replaced it with the clean one and fumbling guardedly under the sheets pushed it down to cover him very carefully she smoothed the sheet and blankets again and at last he relaxed she restoked the fire then sat down in the chair and waited until he should fall asleep in the morning she was tired and extremely stiff herself she never got used to sleeping in a chair for all the times she had done it she told sylvestra about the incident but briefly without the true horror of pain she had witnessed it was only in order to make sure that dr wade did indeed come and not perhaps feel that rhys was recovering and another patient might need him more i must go to him sylvestra said immediately her face pinched with anguish i feel so useless i dont know what to say or do to help him i dont know what happened she stared at hesteras if believing she could supply an answer there had never been an answer not to rhys or to all the other young men who had seen atrocities more than they could bear except that time and love can heal at least a part of the pain dont try to talk about what happened she advised all the help you can give is simply to be there but when sylvestra came into the bedroom rhys turned away he refused to look at her she sat on the edge of the bed putting out her hand to touch his arm where it lay on the coverlet and he snatched it away then when she reached after him again he lashed out at her catching her hand with his splints hurting both her and himself sylvestra gave a little cry of distress not for the physical pain but the rebuff she sat motionless not knowing what to do rhys turned his head and kept his face away from her she looked at hester hester had no idea why he had acted with such sudden cruelty beyond that she had already considered it was impossible even to guess the reason his recent injury a feeling of guilt that perhaps he should have been able to save his father or if not that he should also have died she knew of men whose shame at their own survival when their comrades had perished was beyond any reason or comfort to console it was unreachable and attempts in words by those who could never truly understand only highlighted the gulf between them the utter loneliness but none of that would touch the hurt in sylvestra come downstairs hester said quietly well let him rest at least until the doctor comes but hester shook her head rhys was still lying motionless and stiff persuasion would not help reluctantly sylvestra rose and followed hester out and across the corridor and landing and downstairs again she did not say anything she was closed in a world of her own confusion shortly after luncheon the maid announced that the man from the police was here again will you stay sylvestra asked quickly i should prefer it are you sure hester was surprised usually people chose to keep such invasions of their privacy from as many as possible yes sylvestra was quite decisive yes if he has anything to tell us it will be easier for rhys if you know it also i it was not necessary to say how frightened she was for him it was only too plain in her face evan was shown in he looked cold and unhappy the maid had taken his hat and outer coat but his trouser legs were wet at the bottom his boots were soaked and his cheeks glistened with splashes of rain it was some time since hester had last seen him but they had shared many experiences both of triumph and of fear and pain and she had always liked him there was a gentleness and honesty in him which she admired and he was sometimes more perceptive than monk gave him credit for now it was discreet to behave as if they were strangers sylvestra introduced them and evan made no reference to past acquaintance how is mr duff he asked he is very ill sylvestra said quickly he has not spoken if that is what you are hoping i am afraid i know nothing further im sorry his face crumpled a little it was highly expressive mirroring his thoughts and feelings more than he wished he was a trifle thin with bright hazel eyes and an aquiline nose rather too long his words came from sympathy not annoyance have you learned anything she asked she was breathing rather quickly and her hands were held tightly together on her lap fingers clenched around each other very little mrs duff he replied if anyone saw what happened they are not willing to say so it is not an area where the police are liked people live on the fringes of the law and have too much to hide to come forward voluntarily i see she heard what he said but it was a world beyond her knowledge or comprehension he looked at her highboned severe and oddly beautiful face and did not try to explain although he must have understood hester guessed the question he wanted to ask and why he found it difficult to frame it without offending also it was more than possible she had no idea whatever of the truthful answers why would a man of leighton duffs standing go to such an area to gamble illegally to borrow money to sell or pawn his belongings to buy something stolen or forged or to meet a prostitute he could tell his wife none of these things even if it were something as comparatively praiseworthy as to help a friend in trouble he still would not be likely to share it with her such difficulties were private between men not for the knowledge of women evan decided to be blunt which did not surprise hester it was the nature she knew in him mrs duff have you any idea why your husband should go to an area like st giles at night i i know nothing about st giles it was an evasion a gaining of more time to think he could not afford to be put off it is an area of extreme poverty and crime both petty and serious he explained the streets are narrow and dirty and dangerous the sewage runs down the middle the doorways are full of drunken and sleeping beggars sometimes they are even dead especially this time of the year when they die of cold and hunger very easily particularly those who are ill anyway tuberculosis is rife her face twisted with revulsion and perhaps pity also but her horror was too great to tell she did not wish to know such things for many reasons it jarred her past happiness it frightened and revolted her it threatened the present the mere knowledge of it contaminated the thoughts more children die under six than survive he went on most of them have rickets many of the women work in sweatshops and factories but a great number practise a little prostitution on the side to make ends meet to feed their children he had gone too far it was a picture she could not bear no she said huskily i can only imagine that he must have been lost he showed a streak of ruthlessness that would have been characteristic of monk on foot he raised his eyebrows did he often walk around parts of london at night where he did not know the way mrs duff of course not she responded too quickly where did he say he was going he persisted she was very pale her eyes bright and defensive he did not say specifically she answered him but i believe he went out after my son they had had words about rhyss behaviour i was not in the room but i heard raised voices rhys had left in anger we had both believed that he had gone to his own room upstairs she was sitting very upright her shoulders high and stiff her hands folded then when my husband went up to resume the discussion he discovered he was absent and he was very angry he went out also i believe to try to find him before you ask me i do not know where rhys went or where leighton did find him which obviously he did perhaps that was how they became hurt perhaps evan agreed it is not unusual for a young man to frequent some questionable places maam if he is not squandering money or paying attentions to another mans wife it is generally not taken very seriously was your husband strict in his moral views she looked confused to judge from her expression it was a question she had never considered he was not rigid or selfrighteous if that is what you mean her eyebrows rose her eyes wide i dont think he was ever unfair he did not expect rhys to be abstinent it was not really a a quarrel if i gave that impression i did not mean to i did not overhear their words simply their voices it may even have been something else altogether she bit her lip perhaps rhys was seeing a woman who was married leighton would not have told me he could have wished to spare me that may be the case evan conceded it would explain a great deal if her husband confronted them violence might have followed sylvestra shuddered and looked away towards the fire to commit murder what kind of a woman can she be would it not have taken several men to to do such terrible things yes it would he agreed quietly but perhaps there were several a father or a brother or both she put her hands up to cover her face if that is true then he was wrong very wrong but he did not deserve a punishment like this and my husband did not deserve any punishment at all it was not his fault unconsciously she ran her slender fingers through her hair dislodging a pin letting a long black strand of it fall no wonder rhys will not face me she looked up at him how do i answer it how do i learn to forgive him for it and teach him to forgive himself hester put her hand on sylvestras shoulder first by not supposing it is true until we know she said firmly it may not be the case although looking across at evan and remembering the scene in the bedroom during the night and today when sylvestra had been there she found it very easy to believe they had guessed correctly sylvestra sat up slowly her face white evan rose to his feet perhaps miss latterly will take me up to see mr duff i know he cannot speak but he may be able to answer with a nod or a shake of his head sylvestra hesitated she was not yet ready to face even the questions let alone the answers rhys might give nor was she ready to return to the scene where only a short while ago she had witnessed such a sudden and vicious side of her son hester saw it in her eyes she read it easily because she shared the fear mr duff evan prompted he is unwell she said staring back at him he is hester reinforced he had a most difficult night i cannot allow you to press him sergeant evan looked at her questioningly he must have seen some of her feelings the memories of rhys cowering against the pillow as his mind relived something unspeakable so terrible he could not say it in words any words at all i will not press him he promised his voice dropping but he may wish to tell me we must give him the opportunity we need to know the truth it may be mrs duff that he needs to know it also do you think so she looked at him sceptic ally no vengeance or justice is going to change my husbands death or rhyss injuries it will help some distant concept of what is fair and i am not sure how much i care about that hester thought for a moment evan was going to argue but he said nothing simply standing back and waiting for her to lead the way upstairs rhys was lying quietly splinted hands on the covers his expression peaceful as if he were nearly asleep he turned his head as he heard them he looked guarded but not frightened or unduly wary im sorry to trouble you again mr duff evan began before even hester or sylvestra could speak but investigation has taken me very little further forward i know you cannot speak yet but if i ask you a few questions you can indicate yes or no to me rhys stared back at him almost unblinkingly hester found herself gritting her teeth her hands sticky she knew evan had no choice but to press rhys was the only one who knew the truth but she also knew that it could cost him more than even his mother could guess let alone evan who stood there looking so gentle and capable of pain himself when you went out that evening evan began did you meet anyone you knew a friend a shadow of a smile touched rhyss mouth bitter and hurt he did not move ive asked the wrong question evan was undeterred did you go in order to meet a friend had you made an arrangement rhys shook his head no evan acknowledged did you meet someone by chance rhys moved his shoulder a little it was almost a shrug a friend this time it was definite denial someone you do not like an enemy again the shrug this time angry impatient did you go straight to st giles rhys nodded very slowly as if he had trouble remembering had you been there before evan asked lowering his voice rhys nodded his eyes unwavering did you know your father was going there also rhys stiffened his body tightening till the muscles seemed locked did you evan repeated rhys cringed back into the pillow wincing as the movement hurt him he tried to speak his mouth forming the words his throat striving but no sounds came he started to tremble he could not get his breath and gasped the air dragging and catching in his throat sylvestra bent forward stop it she commanded evan leave him alone she placed herself between them as if evan were offering some physical threat she swivelled round to rhys but he cowered away from her too as if he could not distinguish the difference sylvestras face was ashen she struggled for something to say to him but it was beyond her reason or even her emotion to reach she was baffled frightened and hurt you must both leave hester said firmly please now as if assuming their obedience she turned to rhys who was shuddering violently and sounded in danger of choking stop it she said to him loudly and clearly nobody is going to hurt you now dont try to say anything just breathe in and out steadily very steadily do as i tell you she heard the door close as evan and sylvestra left gradually rhyss hysteria subsided he began to breathe regularly the scraping sound in his throat eased and he trembled instead of shaking keep on breathing slowly she told him gently in out in out she smiled at him warily shakily he smiled back now i am going to get you a little hot milk and a herbal draught to make you feel better you need to rest fear darkened his eyes again no one will come in it was no comfort then she thought perhaps she understood he was afraid of dreams the horror lay within him you dont need to sleep just lie there quietly it wont make you sleep he relaxed his eyes searching hers trying to make her understand but he did sleep for several hours and she sat beside him watching ready to waken him if he showed signs of distress corriden wade came in the late afternoon he looked anxious when hester told him of rhyss distress and of the nightmare which had produced such prolonged pain and hysteria his face creased with sharp concern his own physical discomfort of the fall forgotten it is most worrying miss latterly i shall go up and examine him this is not a good turn of events she made to follow him no he said abruptly holding his hand up as if physically to prevent her i will see him alone he has obviously been profoundly disturbed by what has happened in his best interest to keep him from further hysteria i shall examine him without the possible embarrassment of a stranger and a woman present he smiled very briefly merely a flicker more of communication than any lift of mood he was obviously deeply distressed by what had happened i have known rhys since he was a child he explained to her i knew his father well god rest his soul and my sister is a longstanding and dear friend of sylvestra no doubt she will call in the near future and offer whatever help or comfort she may that would be good hester began yes of course he cut her off i must see my patient miss latterly it seems his condition might have taken a turn for the worse it may be necessary to keep him sedated for a while so he does not further injure himself in his turmoil of mind she reached out to touch his arm but he is afraid of sleep doctor that is when he dreams miss latterly i know very well that you have his interests at heart his voice was quite quiet almost gentle but there was no mistaking the iron in his will but his injuries are severe more severe than you are aware of i cannot risk his becoming agitated again and perhaps tearing them open the results could be fatal he stared at her earnestly this is not the kind of violence either you or i are accustomed to dealing with we know war and its heroes which god knows are horrible enough this is the trial of a different kind of strength we must protect him from himself at least for a while in a few weeks he may be better we can only hope there was nothing she could do but acquiesce thank you his face softened i am sure we shall work together excellently we have much in common tests of endurance and judgement we have both passed he smiled briefly a look of pain and uncertainty then turned and continued on up the stairs hesterand sylvestra waited in the withdrawing room they sat on either side of the fire stiffbacked upright speaking only occasionally in stifled jerky sentences i have known corriden wade for years sylvestra said suddenly he was an excellent friend of my husbands leighton trusted him absolutely he will do everything for rhys that is possible of course i have heard of him his reputation is excellent very high is it yes yes of course it is minutes ticked by the coals settled in the fire neither of them moved to ring the bell for the maid to add more his sister eglantyne is a dear friend of mine yes he told me he said she may call upon you soon i hope so did he say that yes should you be with him no he said it would be better if he went alone less disturbing will it i dont know more minutes ticked by hester decided to rebuild the fire herself corriden wade returned his face grim how is he sylvestra demanded her voice tight and high with fear she rose to her feet without being aware of it he is very ill my dear he replied quietly but i have every hope that he will recover he must have as much rest as possible do not permit him to be disturbed again he can tell the police nothing he must not be harassed as he was today any reminder of the terrible events which he undoubtedly both saw and suffered will make him considerably worse they may even cause a complete relapse that is hardly to be wondered at he looked at hester we must protect him miss latterly i trust you to do that i shall leave you some powders to give him in warm milk or beef tea should he prefer it which will help him to sleep deeply and without dreams he frowned and i must insist absolutely that you do not speak of his ordeal or bring it to his mind in any way he is not able to recall anything of it without the most terrible distress that is natural to a young man of any decency or sensitivity whatever i imagine you or i would feel exactly the same hester had no doubt that what he said was true she had seen it only too vividly herself of course she agreed thank you i shall be glad to see him find some ease and some rest that is without trouble he smiled at her his face was charming full of warmth i am sure you are miss latterly he is fortunate to have you with him i shall continue to call every day but do not hesitate to send for me more often if you should need me he turned to sylvestra i believe eglantyne will come tomorrow if she may may i tell her you will receive her at last sylvestra too relaxed a little a faint smile touching her lips please do thank you corriden i cannot imagine how we would have survived this without your kindness and your skill he looked vaguely uncomfortable i wish i wish it were not necessary this is all tragic quite tragic he straightened up i shall call again tomorrow my dear until then have courage we shall do all we can miss latterly and i chapter three monk sat alone in the large chair in his rooms in fitzroy street he was unaware of evans case or of hesters involvement with one of the victims he had not seen hester for more than two weeks and it was high to the front of his mind that he did not wish to see her in the immediate future his participation in rathbones slander case had taken him to the continent both to venice and to the small german principality of felzburg it had given him a taste of an entirely different life of glamour wealth and idleness laughter and superficiality which he had found highly seductive there were also elements not unfamiliar to him it had awoken memories of his distant past before he had joined the police he had struggled hard to catch them more firmly and failed like all the rest it was lost but for a few glimpses now and then sudden windows opening showing only a little and then closing again and leaving him more confused than before he had fallen in love with evelyn von seidlitz at least he thought it was love it was certainly delicious exciting filling his mind and very definitely quickening his pulse he had been hurt but not as profoundly surprised as he should have been to discover she was shallow and under the surface charm and wit thoroughly selfish by the end of the matter he had longed for hesters leaner harder virtues her honesty her love of courage and truth even her morality and frequently selfrighteous opinions had a kind of cleanness to them like a sweet cold wind after heat and a cloud of flies he leaned forward and picked up the poker to move the coals he prodded at them viciously he did not wish to think of hester she was arbitrary arrogant and at times pompous a fault he had hitherto thought entirely a masculine one he could not afford to be vulnerable to such thoughts he had no case of interest at present which added to his dark mood there were petty thefts to deal with usually either a servant who was tragically easy to apprehend or a housebreaker who was almost impossible appearing out of the massed tens of thousands of the slums and disappearing into them again within the space of an hour but such cases were better than no work at all he could always go and see if there was any information rathbone wanted but that was a last resort as a matter of pride he liked rathbone they had shared many causes and dangers together they had worked with every ounce of imagination courage and intelligence for too many common purposes not to know a certain strength in each other which demanded admiration and because they had shared both triumph and failure they had a bond of friendship but there was also an irritation a difference which rankled too often pride and judgements which clashed rather than complemented and there was always hester she both drew them together and kept them apart but he preferred not to think about hester especially in relation to rathbone he was pleased when the doorbell rang and a minute la tera woman came in she was in early middleage but handsome in a fullblown obvious way her mouth was too large but sensuously shaped her eyes were magnificent her bones rather too well padded with flesh her figure was definitely buxom her clothes were dark and plain of indifferent quality but there was an air about her which at once proclaimed a confidence even a brashness she was neither a lady nor one who associated with ladies are you william monk she asked before he had time to speak yes i can see you are she looked him up and down very candidly yerve changed cant say what exacly but yer different point is are yer still any good yes i am extremely good he replied warily it seemed she knew him but he had no idea who she was except what he could deduce from her appearance she gave a sharp laugh mebbe you avent changed that much still gives yerself airs the amusement died out of her face and it became hard and cautious i want ter ire yer i can pay it was not likely to be work he would enjoy but he was not in a position to refuse he could at least listen to her it was unlikely she would have domestic problems that sort of thing she would be more than capable of dealing with herself me names vida opgood she said in case yer don remember he did not remember but it was plain she knew him from the past before the accident he was reminded jarringly of his vulnerability what is your difficulty mrs hopgood he indicated the large chair on the far side of the fire and when she had made herself comfortable he sat down opposite her she glanced at the burning coals then around at the very agreeable room with its landscape pictures heavy curtains and old but goodquality furniture it was largely supplied by monks patroness lady i callandra daviot from the surplus in her country house but vida hopgood did not need to know that done well fer yerself she said ungrudgingly yer dint never marry good or yer wouldnt be grubbin around wi other folks troubles besides yer wasnt the marryin sort too cussed only ever wanted the kind o wives asd never ave yer so i guess yer int lorst none oyer cleverness thats why i come thisll take it all and then maybe more but we gotter know we gotter put a stop ter it to what mrs hopgood me us band tom e runs a factry makin shirts and the like monk knew what the sweatshops of the east end were like huge airless places suffocating in summer bitterly cold in winter where a hundred or more women might sit from before dawn until nearly midnight sewing shirts gloves handkerchiefs petticoats for barely enough to feed one of them let alone the family which might depend on them if someone had stolen from him monk for one was not going to look for them she saw his expression wear nice shirts still do yer he looked at her sharply course yer do she answered her own question with a surprising viciousness twisting her mouth and what do yer pay for em eh wanner pay more wot dyer think tailors and outfitters pay us for em eh if we put up our prices we lose the business an ooll that elp gents oo like smart shirtsll buy em the cheapest they can get cant pay moren i can can i he was stung i presume you arent looking for me to alter the tailoring economy her face registered her scorn but it was not personal nor was it her principal emotion far more urgent was the reason she had come she chose not to quarrel with him the reason she had come to him at all defying the natural barrier between them was a mark of how grave the matter was to her her eyes narrowed ere wos the matter wiv yer yer look diff rent yer don remember me do yer would she believe a lie and did it matter she was staring at him wy dyer leave the rozzers then dyer get caught doin sum mink as yer shouldnt a no i quarrelled with my supervisor she gave a sharp laugh so mebbe yer avent changed that much arter all but yer dont look like yer used ter arder but not so cocky come down a bit avent yer it was a statement not a question int got the power yer used ter ave not well yer was slingin yer weight around seven dials afore he said nothing she looked at him even more closely leaning a fraction forward she was a very handsome woman there was a vitality in her which it was impossible to ignore wy dont yer remember me yer should i had an accident i dont remember a lot of things jeez she let out her breath slowly int that the truth well i never she was too angry even to swear thats a turn up if yer like so yer startin over from the bottom she gave a little laugh no bettern the rest o us then well ill pay yer if yer earns it i am better than the rest mrs hopgood he said staring at her levelly ive forgotten a few things a few people but i havent lost my brains or my will why have you come to me we can get by most of us she replied levelly one way an another least we could until this started appinin what started happening rape mr monk she answered meeting his eyes unflinchingly and with an icehard anger he was startled of all the possibilities which had flickered through his mind that had not been one of them rape he repeated the word with incredulity some o our girls is getting raped in the streets now there was nothing in her but hurt a blind confusion because she did not see the enemy for once she could not fight her own battle it could have been a ridiculous subject she was not speaking of respectable women in some pleasant area but sweatshop workers who eked out a living labouring around the clock then going home to one room in a tenement perhaps shared with half a dozen other people of all ages and both sexes crime and violence were a way of life with them for her to have come to him an expoliceman seeking to pay him to help her she must be speaking of something quite outside the ordinary tell me about it he said simply she had already broken the first barrier this was the second he was listening there was no mockery and no laughter in his eyes first orff i dint think no think to it she began jus one woman lookin a bit battered appens appens lots o times usband gets a bit drunkern usual we often gets women inter the shop wifa black eyes or worse specially on a monday but then the whisper goes around shes been done more than that still i take no notice int nuffink ter do wif me if shes got a bad man theres enough of em round he did not interrupt her voice was tighter and there was pain in it then there were another woman one oos us band sick too sick ter beater then theres a third an by now i wanna know wot in ells goin on she winced some of em int moren children ter cut it short mr monk these women is getting raped an beat up i gets the ole story i makes em come in an sit down in me parlour one by one an i gets it out of em ill tell you wot they tol me you had better put it in order for me mrs hopgood it will save time course wot did you think i were gonna do tell it yer like they tol me wed be ere all ruddy night int got all night even if you as i spec yer charge by the hour mos folks do ill charge by the day but only after ive taken the case if i do her face hardened wot yer want from me more money he saw the fear behind her defiance for all her brashness and the show of bravado she put on to impress she was frightened and hurt and angry this was not one of the familiar troubles she had faced all her life this was something she did not know how to deal with no he interrupted as she was about to go on i wont say i can help you if i cant tell me what you learned im listening she was partly mollified she settled back into the chair again rearranging her skirts slightly around her extremely handsome figure some of our respectable womens fallen on and times and thinks theyd never sell their selves no matter wot she continued thinks theyd starve before theyd go onter the streets but its surprisin ow quick yer can change yer mind when yer kids is starvin n sick yer ears em cryin cold an ungry long enough an yerd sell yerself ter the devil if e paid yer in bread an coal for the fire or a blanket or a pair o boots martyrin yerself is one thing seein yer kids die is diffrent monk did not argue his knowledge of that was deeper than any individual memory it was something of the flesh and bone it began easy she went on her voice thick with disgust first just a bloke ere n there wot wouldnt pay it appens theres always cheats in life int much yer can do but cut yer losses he nodded i wouldnt a thought nuffink o that she shrugged still watching him narrowly judging his reactions then one o the women comes in all bruised an bashed around like she bin beat up proper like i said at first i took it as er man ad beater wouldnt a blamed er if shed stuck im wifa shiv fer that but she said as itd bin two men wotd bin customers shed picked em up in the street an gone fera quick one in a dark alley an then theyd beater took er by force even though she were willin like she bit her full lip theres always them as likes ter be a bit rough but this were real beatin it int the same not jus a few bruises like but real urt he waited he knew from her eyes that there was more one rape of a prostitute was merely a misfortune she must know as well as he did that ugly and unjust as it was there was nothing that could be done about it she werent the only one she went on again it appened again not her woman then another it got worse each time theres bin seven now mr monk that i know of an the last one she were beat till she were senseless er nose an er jaw were broke an she lorst five teeth no one else dont care the rozzers int goin ter elp they reckon as women wot sells their selves deserves wot they get her body was clenched tight under the dark fabric but nobody dont deserve ter get beat like that it int safe fer em ter earn the extra bit wot they needs we gotter find oos doin this an thats wot we need you fer mr monk well pay yer he sat without replying for several moments if what she said was true then he also suspected that a little natural justice was planned he had no objection to that they both knew it was unlikely the police would take much action against a man who was raping prostitutes society considered that a woman who sold her body had little or no rights to withdraw the goods on offer or to object if she were treated like a commodity not a person she had voluntarily removed herself from the category of decent women she was an affront to society by her mere existence no one was going to exert themselves to protect a virtue which in their opinion did not exist the coals subsided in the hearth with a shower of sparks it was beginning to rain outside and there were the uglier dark emotions the men who used such women despised them and despised that part of themselves which needed them it was a vulnerability at best at worst a shame or perhaps the worst was the fact that they had a weakness which these women were aware of for once they had lost the control they had in ordinary daily life and the very people they most despised were the ones who saw it and knew it in all its intimacy was a man ever so open to ridicule as when he paid a woman he regarded with contempt for the use of her body to relieve the needs of his own she saw him not only with his body naked but part of his soul as well he would hate her for that and he would certainly not care to be reminded of her existence except when he could condemn her immorality and say how much he desired to be rid of her and her kind to labour to protect her from the foreseeable ills of her chosen trade was unthinkable the police would never seriously try to eradicate prostitution apart from the fact that it would be impossible they knew their value and that half respectable society would be horrified ifthey were to succeed they were like sewers not to be discussed in the withdrawing room or at all for that matter but vital to the health and the order of society monk felt a deep swell of the same anger that vida hopgood felt and when he was angry he did not forgive yes he said staring at her levelly ill take the case pay me enough to live on and ill do what i can to find the man or men who are doing this ill need to see the women they must tell me the truth i cant do anything on lies there was a gleam of triumph in her eyes she had won her first battle ill find him for you if i can he added i cant say the police will prosecute you know as well as i do what the chances of that are she gave an explosive laugh full of derision what you do after that is your own affair he said knowing what it could mean but i cant tell you anything until im sure she drew breath to argue then saw his face and knew it would be pointless ill tell you nothing he repeated until i know thats the bargain she put out her hand he took it and she gripped him with extraordinary strength she waited in the room beside the fire while monk changed his clothes to old ones both because he would not soil those he valued and for the very practical purpose of passing largely unnoticed in the areas to which he was going then he accompanied vida hopgood to seven dials she took him to her home a surprisingly wellfurnished set of rooms above the sweatshop where eightythree women sat by gaslight heads bent over their needles backs aching eyes straining to see but at least it was dry and it was warmer than the street outside where it was beginning to snow vida also changed her clothes leaving monk in her parlour while she did so her husband was in the shop below seeing no one slacked talked to their neighbour or pocketed anything that was not theirs monk stared around the room it was overfurnished there was hardly a space on the heavily patterned wallpaper which was not covered by a picture or a framed sampler of embroidery table surfaces were decorated with dried flowers china ornaments stuffed birds under glass more pictures but in spite of the crowding and the predominance of red the whole effect was one of comfort and even a kind of harmony whoever lived here cared about it there had been happiness a certain pride in it not to show off or impress others but for its own sake there was something in vida hopgood which he could like he wished he could remember their previous association it was a burden to him that he could not but he knew from too many attempts to trace other memories more important ones that the harder he sought the more elusive they were the more distorted it was a disadvantage he had learned to live with most of the time only on occasion was he sharply brought to realise its dangers when someone hated him and he had no idea why it was an unusual burden that did not afflict most people not to know who your friends or enemies were vida returned in plainer shabbier clothes and set straight about the business in hand she may need to use the services of a policeman but she had no intention of social ising with him it was a temporary truce and for all her humour he was still the enemy she would not forget it even if he might ill take yer ter see nellie first she said patting her skirt and straightening her shoulders there int no use yer goin alone she wont speak toyer if i don teller ter cant blame er she stared at him standing still in the comfortable room well come on then i know its rainin but a bit o water wont urt yer biting back his retort he followed her out into the iceswept street and hurried to keep pace with her she moved surprisingly rapidly her boots tapping sharply on the cobbles her back straight her eyes ahead she had given her orders and assumed that if he wanted to be paid he would obey them she turned abruptly along an alley head down into the flurries of snow hand up instinctively to keep her hat on even here she was going to maintain her superior status by wearing a hat rather than a shawl to protect her from the elements she stopped at one of the many doors and banged on it sharply after several moments it was opened by a plump young woman with a pretty face when she smiled showing gapped and stained teeth i wanna see nellie vida said bluntly teller mrs opgoods ere i got monk shell know oo i mean monk felt a stab of fear that his name was so well known even to this woman of the streets he had never heard of he could not even recall having been to seven dials at all let alone the faces of individual people his disadvantage was acute the girl heard the tone of command in vidas voice and went off obediently to fetch nellie she did not invite them in but left them standing in the freezing alley vida took the invitation as given and pushed the door open monk followed inside was cold also but mercifully out of the wind and now thickening snow the walls were damp in the corridor and smelled of mould and from the pervading odour of excrement the midden was not far away and probably overflowing vida pushed on the second door and it swung open into a room with a goodsized bed in it rumpled and obviously lately used but relatively clean and with several blankets and quilts on it monk presumed it was a place of business as well as rest there was a young woman standing in the farther corner waiting for them her face was marred by yellowing bruises and a severely cut brow the scar of which was still healing and would never knit evenly monk needed no other evidence to tell him the woman had been badly beaten he could not imagine an accident likely to cause such harm you tell this geezer ere wot appened toyer nellie vida ordered es a rozzer nellie said incredulously looking at monk with intense dislike no e int vida contradicted e used ter be they threw im out now e works fer ooever pays him an terday we do es goin ter find oos beatin the ell out o the girls round ere so we can put an end ter it oh yeah nellie said derisively an owe gonna do that eh wy should e care e probably dont care vida said sharply impatient with nellies stupidity but e aster eat same as the rest of us ell do wot es paid ter do wot we do with the bastard after es foundim int is business nellie still hesitated look nellie vida was fast losing her temper you may be one o them daft bitches wot likes bein beaten ter ell and back gawd knows she put her hands on her ample hips but do yer like bein too scared to go out in the streets ter earn yerself a little extra eh yer wanna live on wot yer get stitchin shirts do yer thats enough for yer is it grudgingly nellie saw the point she turned to monk her face puckered with dislike tell me what happened and where monk instructed her start by telling me where you were and what time it was or as near as you know it were three weeks ago but a day she answered sucking her broken tooth a tuesday night i were in fetter lane id just said goodbye tera gentoo walked north again i turned back ter come ome an i saw another gent dressed in a good coat cavy an wifa tall at on e looked like money an e were angin around like e wanted someone so i went up ter im an spoke nice thinkin like e might fancy me she stopped waiting for monks reaction and did he he asked yeah e said e did only well e started although i were willin e gets real rough an starts knockin me around afore i can let out a yell theres another geezer there an all an e lights in terme she touched her eye gingerly it me e did it me real and bloody near knocked me out then e an the first geezer olds me an took me one after the other then one o them by now i dunno which one me eads fair singin an im alf senseless wi pain e its me again an knocks me teef aht laughin they is like madmen i tell yer i were scared sick looking at her face it was only too easy to believe she was white at the memory can you tell me anything about them monk asked anything at all a smell a voice a feel of cloth wot smell he repeated can you remember any smell they were close to you like wot she looked puzzled anything think he tried not to sound sharp with her was she being intentionally stupid men work in different places he prompted some with horses some with leather some with fish or wool or bales of hemp did you smell salt sweat whisky she was silent well vida snapped think back wots the matter with yer dont yer want these bastards found yeah im thinkin nellie protested they didnt neither o them smell o none o them things one o them smelled o some drink real strong but it int one i ever drunk orrible it were cloth monk went on did you feel the cloth of their clothes was it quality or reworked thick or thin warm she said without hesitation thinking of the only thing which would have mattered to her wouldnt mind a coat like that me self cost moren i make in a month an then some clean shaven or bearded i didnt look feel you must have felt their faces think no beard clean shaven i spose mebbe side whiskers she gave a grunt of scorn could o bin any o thousands her voice was harsh with disillusion as if for a moment she had hoped yer int never goin ter find em yer a liar takin er money an shes a fool fer givin it yer you watch yer tongue nellie west vida said sharply you int so smart yer can get along on yer own an dont yer ferget it keep civil if yer knows wots good for yer what time of night was it monk asked the last thing he thought would be any use from her why she sneered narrers it down does it know oo it is then do yer it may help but if youd prefer to protect them well ask elsewhere i understand you are not the only woman to be beaten he turned for the door leaving vida to come after him he heard her swear at nellie carefully and viciously without repeating herself the second woman to whom vida led him was very different they met her trudging home aft era long day in the sweatshop it was still snowing although the cobbles were too wet for it to lie the woman was perhaps thirtyfive although from the stoop of her shoulders she could have been fifty her face was puffy and her skin pale but she had pretty eyes and her hair had a thick natural curl with a little spirit a little laughter she would still be attractive she stopped when she recognised vida her expression was not fearful or unfriendly it said much of vidas character that as the wife of the sweatshop owner she could still command a certain friendship in such a woman ello betty she said briskly this eres monk es gonner elp us with them bastards wotve bin beatin up women round ere there was a flicker of hope in bettys eyes so brief it could have been no more than imagined yeah she said without interest then wot the rozzers is gonna arrest em an the judge is gonna bang em up in the coldbath fields or maybe theyre goin ter newgate an the rope eh she gave a dry almost soundless laugh vida fell into step beside her leaving monk to walk a couple of paces behind they turned the corner passing a gin mill with drunken women on the doorstep insensible of the cold ows bert vida asked drunk betty answered ow else an yer kids billy as the croup maisie coughs sum mink terrible others is aright they had reached her door and she went to push it open just as two small boys came running around the corner of the alley from the opposite direction shouting and laughing they both had sticks which they slashed around as if they were swords one of them lunged and the other one yelled out then crumpled up and pretended to be dying in agony rolling around on the wet cobbles his face alight with glee the other one hopped up and down crowing his victory seemingly it was his turn and he was going to savour every ounce of it betty smiled patiently the rags they wore a mixture of handmedowns and clothes unpicked and restitched from others could hardly get any filthier monk found his shoulders relaxing a little at the sound of childrens laughter it was a touch of humanity in the grey drudgery around him betty led the way into a tenement very like the one in which nellie west lived she apparently occupied two rooms at the back a middleaged man lay in a stupor half in a chair half on the floor she ignored him the room was cluttered with the furniture of living a lopsided table the stuffed chair in which the man lay two wooden chairs one with a patched seat a whisk broom and half a dozen assorted rags the sound of childrens voices came through the thin walls from the other room and someone coughing the two boys were still fighting in the corridor vida ignored them all and concentrated on betty tell im wot appened toyer she jerked her head at monk to indicate who she meant the other man was apparently too deep in his stupor to be aware of them int nuffink much ter tell betty said resignedly i got beat it still urts but nobody cant do nothing about it thought o carryin a shiv me self but int worth it if i stick the bastards ill only get topped fer murder anyway dont spose theyll come ere again yeah vida said her voice thick with derision count on that would yer don mind goin out in the streets again takin yer chances appy about that are yer yer dint ear wot appened ter nellie west nor carrie barker nor dot mac rae nor them others wot got raped or beat some o thems only kids they damn near killed etty drover poor little cow bettie looked shaken i thought that were er man wot done that e drinks rotten an e don know wot e does alf the time she glanced towards the recumbent figure in the corner and monk guessed she was only too familiar with the predicament no it weren tim vida said bleakly george int that bad es all wind an water e don really doer that bad shejus likes ter mouth orff it were a geezer she picked up an e punched er sum mink rotten an then kicked er after e took er shes all tore an still bleedin yer sure yer appy ter go out there lookin are yer betty stared at her then ill stay ome she said between clenched teeth or ill go up the aymarket dont be a bloody fool vida spat back contemptuously you int aymarket quality an yer knows it nord they let yer jus wander up there an butt in an yer knows that too then ill ave ter stay ome an make do wont i betty retaliated her cheeks a dull pink vida stared at the sleeping man in the corner unutterable scorn in her face an es gonna feed yer kids is e grow up betty yerll be out there again rape or no rape an yer knows it as well as i do answer monks questions were gonna get these sods work together an we can betty was too tired to argue just this moment vida was a worse threat than hunger or violence she turned to monk resignedly he asked her the same questions he had asked nellie west and received roughly the same answers she had been out in the street to earn a little extra money it had been a thin week for her husband she referred to him loosely by that term he had tried hard but because of the weather there was nothing winters were always hard especially at the fish market where he often picked up a little work they had had a fight over nothing in particular he had hit her blackening her eye and pulling out a handful of her hair she had hit him over the head with an empty gin bottle knocking him out it had broken and she had cut her hand picking up the pieces before the children could tread on them and cut their feet it was after that that she had gone to look for a spot of trade to make up the money she had earned seventeen and sixpence quite a tidy sum and was looking to improve on it when three men had approached her two from in front one from behind and after no more than a few moments verbal abuse one of them had held her while the other two had raped her one after the other she left badly bruised one shoulder wrenched and her knees and elbows grazed and bleeding she had been too frightened to go out again for three weeks after that or even to allow george anywhere near her in fact the thought of going out again made her nearly sick with fear although hunger drove her past the door eventually monk questioned her closely for anything she could remember of them they had abused her verbally what were their voices like they spoke proper like gents werent from around ere there was no doubt in her at all old or young dunno dint see cant tell from a voice clean shaven or bearded clean i think don remember no whiskers least i don think so what kind of clothes dunno do you remember anything else a smell words a name anything at all dunno her eyes clouded smell wot yer mean they dint smell o nuffink no drink not as i can think of no dint smell o nuffink at all not soap then instantly he wished he had not said it he was putting the suggestion into her mind soap yeah i spose so funny like diff rent did she know what cleanliness smelled like perhaps it would be odd to her an absence rather than a presence it did not tell him anything more than nellie west had but it reinforced the same picture two or three men coming into the area from somewhere else and becoming increasingly violent in their appetites they apparently knew enough to pick on the women alone not the professional prostitutes who might have pimps to protect them but the amateurs the women who only took to the streets occasionally in times of need it was dark when they left and the snow was beginning to lie the few unbroken streetlamps reflected glittering shards of light on the running gutters but vida had no intention of stopping this was when they would find the women at home and apart from the fact that they might not speak in the company of their colleagues she was not going to lose good work time by asking the questions when they should be un picking or cutting or stitching the practicalities must be observed also it crossed monks mind that perhaps mr hopgood was not aware of her campaign and that indirectly he was paying for it he might very well not feel as personally about the issue as she did monk caught up with her as she strode purposefully around the corner into another one of the multitudinous alleyways of seven dials crossed a courtyard with a well and pump in it a drunk lounged in one doorway a couple kissed in another the girl giggling happily the youth whispering something inaudible to her monk wondered at their absorption in each other that they seemed oblivious of the wind and the snow behind a lighted window someone raised a jug of ale and candlelight fell on a womans bright hair the sound of laughter was quick and clear past them and across a main thoroughfare an old woman was selling sandwiches and a running patterer finished up his tale of lust and mayhem and began to jog along the pavement to another warmer spot to entertain a new crowd with stories news and general invention the next victim of violence was carrie barker she was almost sixteen the eldest of a family whose parents were both missing or dead she looked after six younger brothers and sisters earning what she could one way or another monk did not enquire they sat in one large room all together while she told vida what had happened to her in a breathless voice which whistled through a broken front tooth one sister about a year and a half younger nursed her left arm in front of her as if her chest and stomach hurt her and she listened to all carrie said nodding her head now and then in the dim light of one candle vidas face was a mask of fury and compassion her wide mouth set her eyes brilliant it was very much the same story the two eldest girls had been out earning a little extra money it was obviously the way the next girl now almost ten would also feed and clothe herself and her younger siblings in a year or less now she was busy nursing a child of about two or three rocking him back and forwards absently as she listened these two children were not visibly hurt as badly as the older women monk had seen but their fear was deeper and perhaps their need of the money greater there were seven to feed and no one else to care monk found the anger so deep in his soul that whether vida hopgood paid him or not he had every intention of finding the men who had done this and seeing them dealt with as harshly as the law allowed and if the law did not care then there would be others who would he questioned them carefully and gently but on every detail what could they remember where did it happen what time was anything said what about voices what were they wearing feel of fabric feel of skin bearded or shaven what did they smell like drunken or sober salt tar fish rope soot she looked blank all her answers confirmed the previous stories but added nothing all either of them clearly recalled now was the pain and the overriding terror the smell of the wet street the open gutter down the middle the feel of cobbles hard in their backs the redhot pain first inside their bodies then outside bruising pummelling then afterwards they had lain in the dark as the cold ate into them and at last there had been voices they had been lifted and there had been the slow return of sensation and more pain now they were hungry there was hardly any food left no coal or even wood and they were too frightened to go out but the time was coming when they would have to or starve inside monk fished in his pocket and left two coins on the table saying nothing but seeing their eyes go to them well vida demanded when they were out on the street again facing into the wind heads down there was a thin rime of ice on the stones and the snow was lying over it it looked eerie in the gloom reflecting back the distant streetlamps with a pale blur against the black of the roofs and walls and the dense lightless sky it was slippery and dangerous underfoot monk shoved his hands deeper into his pockets and hunched his coat around him his body was rigid with anger and it was making him even colder two or three men are beating and raping working women he answered bitterly theyre not local men but they could be from anywhere else theyre not labourers but they could be clerks shopkeepers traders or gentlemen they could be soldiers on leave or sailors ashore they didnt even have to be the same men each time although they probably are fat lot o use that is she spat at him we bloody know that much i int paying yer ter tell me wot me own sense can see i thought you were supposed to be the best rozzer in the force leastways you always acted like you was her voice was high and sharp with not only disgust but fear the emotion had torn through her she had trusted him and he had let her down she had nowhere else to turn did you expect me to solve it tonight he asked sarcastically one evening and im supposed to come up with names or proof you dont want a detective you want a magician she stopped and faced him for a moment she was about to come back with something equally vicious it was instinct to fight back then reality asserted itself her body sagged he could only see the outline of it in the dim light and the falling snow they were twenty yards from the nearest lamp can yer elp or not monk i int got no timeter play games with yer an old man shuffled past them carrying a sack muttering to himself i think so monk answered her they didnt materialise out of the ground they came here somehow probably a hansom they hung around before they attacked these women they may have had a drink or two somebody saw them somebody drove them here and drove them away again there were either two or three of them men looking for women dont usually go around in twos and threes someone will remember an yerll make em talk she said with a downwards fall in her voice as if memory was bitter and there was pain and regret in it how did she know so much about him was it all repute and if so of what they were in the borders of his area when he had been on the force or had they known each other well before better than she had implied another case another time what was it she knew of him and he did not know of himself she knew he was clever and ruthless and she did not like him but she respected his ability in a perverse way she trusted him and she believed he could work in seven dials far more than if she had been some decent wealthy woman he wanted to succeed for her it was mainly because of the rage in him against the brutality of these men the injustice of it all their lives and the lives of these women but it was also pride he would show her he was still the man he had been in the past he had lost none of his skills only memory everything else was the same even better runcorn might not know that the thought of runcorn brought him up sharply runcorn had been his superior but never felt it he was always aware of monk treading on his heels monk being better dressed quick witted sharper tongued monk always waiting to catch him out was that memory speaking to him or only what he had deduced from runcorns attitude after the accident this was runcorns area when he had the evidence it would be runcorn he would have to take it to yes he said aloud it might be hard to find where they come from but easier to find where they went theyd be dirty after rolling on the cobbles with the women fighting one or two of them might have been marked those women fought enough at least to scratch or bite his mind was picturing shadowy figures only but some things he knew theyd be elated touched with both victory and fear theyd done a monstrous thing some echo of that would be there in their manner some cabby somewhere will have noticed he would know where he took them because it would be out of the area said you was a clever sod she let out her breath in a sigh of relief nah theres one more fer yer ter see dot mac rae shes married legal but er us band useless consumptive poor devil cant do nothin coughin is lungs up she gotta work an shirt stitchin dont do it monk did not argue nor did he need it explaining to him somewhere in his memory was burned such knowledge he walked beside her in the thickening snow other people were hurrying by heads down occasionally calling out a greeting or even a joke two men staggered out of a public house supporting each other as far as the gutter then collapsed cursing but without anger a beggar wrapped his coat tighter around himself and settled down in a doorway within moments another joined him together they would be warmer than separately dot mac rae told them essentially what they had already heard she was older than the others maybe forty but still handsome her face had character and there was courage in her eyes there was also a helpless anger she was trapped and she knew it she did not expect either help or pity she told monk quite simply what had happened some two and a half weeks ago when she had been attacked by two men approaching her from opposite sides of a courtyard yes she had been quite certain it had been only two men one of them had held her down while the other had raped her then when she had fought back they had both beaten and kicked her leaving her almost senseless on the ground she had been found and helped home by percy a beggar who frequently slept in a doorway in the area he had seen there was something badly wrong and done all he could to assist her he had wanted to report it to someone but who was there who cared about a woman who sold her body being beaten a little or taken by force vida did not comment but again her feeling was evident in her face monk asked questions about time and place anything dot could remember which would differentiate these men from any others she had not seen them clearly they had been no more than shapes weight pain in the darkness she had been aware of an overwhelming sense of rage in them and then afterwards excitement even elation monk walked away through the snow so blind with anger he was almost oblivious of being cold he had left vida hopgood at the corner of her street and then turned to leave seven dials and head back towards the open thoroughfares the lights and the traffic of the main areas of the city later he would find a hansom and ride the rest of the way to his rooms in grafton street now he needed to think and to feel the quick exercise of muscles pour his energy into movement and smart under the sting of ice on his face this helpless rage at injustice was familiar it was an old pain dating far back before the accident into the times he only caught glimpses of when some emotion or some halfcaught sight or smell carried him back he knew the real source of it the man who had been his guide and mentor when he had newly come south from northumberland bound to make his fortune in london the man who had taken him in taught him so much not only about merchant banking and the uses of money but about cultured life about society and how to be a gentleman he had been ruined by injustice monk had done everything he could to help him and it had not been enough he had suffered that same feeling of frustration then of pacing the streets racking his brain for ideas of believing the answer was beyond his reach but only just he had learned a lot since then his character had become harder his mind faster more agile more patient to wait his chance less tolerant of stupidity less afraid of either success or failure the snow was settling on his collar and seeping down his neck he was shuddering with cold other people were dim forms in the gloom in the streets the gutters were running over he could smell the stench of middens and sour drains there was a pattern in these rapes the violence was the same and always unnecessary they were not seeking unwilling women god help them they were only too willing these were not professional prostitutes they were desperate women who worked honestly when they could and went to do the streets only when hunger drove them why not the professional prostitutes because they had men who looked after them they were merchandise too valuable to risk if anyone was going to beat them disfigure them reduce their value it would be the pimps the owners and it would be for a specific reason probably punishment for thieving for individual enterprise instead of returning their takings to their masters he had already ruled out a rival trying to take over a territory these women did not share their takings with anyone they certainly did not threaten any regular prostitutes living anyway a pimp would beat but he would not rape this had none of the marks of an underworld crime there was no profit in it people who lived on the edge of survival did not waste energy and resources on pointless violence time after time he turned a corner and the wind was bitter and stung his skin making his eyes water he wanted to go home weigh what he had heard and plan a strategy but these crimes had happened at night night was the time when he should look for other witnesses cab drivers who had picked up fares and taken them from the edge of seven dials back westwards it was less than honest to go to his own warm rooms hot food and clean bed and tell himself he was trying to find the man who had done these senseless and bestial things he stopped off at a public house and had a hot pie and a glass of stout and felt at least fortified if not comforted he thought of scraping a conversation with some of the other patrons or with the landlord and decided against it he did not yet want to be known as an agent of enquiry word would spread rapidly enough let vida do the more obvious asking she belonged here and would be respected probably even told the truth he worked until long after midnight trudging the streets on the edges of seven dials generally to the west and north towards oxford street and regent street speaking to cabby after cabby always asking the same questions the very last was typical of them all where to guy home fitzroy street monk replied still standing on the pavement right often work this patch yeah why sorry to take you so far out of your way he put his foot on the step taking his time the cabby gave a sharp laugh thats wot im ere fer jus round the corner int no good terme take a few trips north and west do you some are yer getting in or not yes monk answered without doing so do you remember taking a couple of gentlemen from this area probably about this time of night or later who were a bit roughed up maybe wet maybe scratched or bruised back up west why wots it toyer if i did i take lots o gents ter lots o places ere oo are yer an wy dyer wanna know fer some of the local women around here have been beaten pretty badly monk replied and i think it was by men from somewhere else probably west welldressed men who came down here for a little sport and took it too far id like to find them would yer the cabby was hesitating weighing the advantages and disadvantages of cooperation wy them women belong toyer do they im bein paid for it monk said honestly its worth it to someone to have it stopped oo some pimp look i int standin ere all night answering damn silly questions for yer less you pays right monk fished in his pocket and brought out half a crown he held it where the cabby could see it but did not yet offer it for vida hopgood whose husband owns the shop where they work she doesnt approve of rape i take it you dont care the cabby swore his voice angry oo the ell are you ter tell me i don care yer bleedin toff from up west yerself them bastards come down ere an took a woman an used er like dirt then go ridin back ome like theyd bin on a days outin in the city he spat with terse contempt monk handed him the halfcrown and he bit it automatically so where did you pick them up and where did you take them monk asked pick em up brick lane the cabby replied an took em up ter portman square nother time took em ter eaton square dont mean ter say thats where they lives you int got a cat in ells chance o finding em and wot if yer do oo dyer thinks gonna believe some poor bitch from seven dials agin a toff from up west theyll say shes sellin erself so wots wrong if es a bit rough es bought and paid for it int e they dont give decent women much of a chance wots bin raped wot chance as an ore got not much monk said miserably but there are other ways if the law will do nothing yeah the cabbys voice lifted in a moments hope like wot top the bastard yerself yerd only get strung up for it in the end rozzersll never let murder of a gent go they wont upset their selves too much over it if some ore from down ere gets bashed over the ead an dies of it appens all the time but let some gent get a shiv in is gut an all ellll get loose therell be rozzers up an dahn every street i tell yer it int worth it well all pay mark my words i was thinking of something a little subtler monk replied with a tight wolfish smile yeah like wot but the cabby was listening now leaning sideways over his box peering at monk in the lamplight through the snow like making sure everyone knows about it monk replied making it a news item with details they dont care the cabbys disappointment was palpable is friendsll all think its clever wots one ore ter them his friends might not care monk replied savagely but his wife will his parentsinlaw will especially his motherinlaw the cabby blasphemed under his breath and maybe his investors or his society friends wives the mothers of the girls his sons hope to marry or of the men his daughters do monk continued orright orright the cabby snapped i un understand yer wot yer wanna know i don know oo they was i wouldnt know em now if yer marched em in front o me but then i don spose id know you temorrer an these geezers kep their faces away i jus thought it were cos they fancied they were too good ter talk ter the likes o me jus give orders what orders monk said quickly drive em north an drop em in portman square they said theyd walk ome from there careful sods eh i din think nothin of it then they dont even ave ter live near portman square couldve got another ansom from there ter were ver they lives could be any place its a start go on even the bleedin rozzers couldnt find em from that maybe but theyve been here a dozen times or more therell be a common factor somewhere and if there is ill find it monk said in a low bitter voice ill ask all the other cabbies people on the street and there are plenty of those someone saw them someone will know theyll make a mistake they will already have made one maybe several the cabby shivered and it was only partly the snow he looked at monks face like a bleedin wolf you are im ruddy glad you int after me now if you wanna go ome get in me cab and get on with it if yer plan on standin ere all night yerll do it wivout me or me orse poor critter monk climbed in and sat down too cold to relax and was jolted steadily towards fitzroy street and a warm bed the following morning he woke aching his head throbbing he was in a foul mood and he had no right to be he had a home food clothing and a kind of safety he hurt only because he had slept with his body still knotted with the anger he felt over what he had heard he shaved and dressed ate breakfast and went to the police station where he used to work before he had finally and irrevocably quarrelled with runcorn and been obliged to leave it had not been so long ago roughly two years he was still remembered with clarity and very mixed emotions there were those who were afraid of him still half expecting some criticism or jibe at the quality of their work their dedication or their intelligence sometimes it had been just too often it had not he wanted to catch john evan before he went out on whatever case concerned him now evan was the one friend monk could count on he had come to the station after the accident they had worked together on the grey case unravelling it step by step and at the same time exposing monks own fears and his terrible vulnerability and in the end the truth which could now be thought of only with a shudder and a dark shadow of guilt evan knew him as well as anyone except hester that thought surprised him by its sharpness he had not intended to allow hester into his mind that relationship was entirely different most of it had been brought about by circumstances rather than inclination she was supremely irritating at times as well as her skill her intelligence and undoubtedly her courage there was so much that he found intensely annoying anyway she was not involved in this case he had no need to think about her now he should find evan this was important and most urgent it could happen again another woman could be beaten and raped perhaps murdered this time there was a pattern in the crimes they had become steadily more violent perhaps they would not end until one of the women was dead or more than one evan saw him immediately sitting in his small office little more than a large cupboard big enough for a stack of drawers and two hardbacked chairs and a tiny table for writing on evan himself looked tired there were shadows under his hazel eyes and his hair was longer than usual flopping forward in a heavy fair brown wave monk came straight to the point he knew better than to waste a policemans time ive got a case in seven dials he began the edge of thats your area you might know something about it and i might be able to help seven dials evans eyebrows rose what is it who in seven dials calls in a private agent for that matter who has anything to steal there was no unkindness in his face just a weary knowledge of how things were not theft monk replied rape and then unnecessary violence beatings evan winced domestic dont suppose we can touch that how could anybody prove it its hard enough to prove rape in a decent suburban area you know as well as i do society tends to think that if a woman gets raped then she must somehow have deserved it people dont want to think it happens to the innocent that way it wont happen to them yes of course i know that monks temper was short and his head still throbbed but whether a woman deserves to be raped or not she doesnt deserve to be beaten to have her teeth knocked out or her ribs broken she doesnt deserve to be knocked to the ground by two men at once then punched and kicked evan flinched as if he had seen it as monk described no of course she doesnt he agreed looking at monk steadily but violence theft hunger and cold are part of life in a score of areas across london along with filth and disease you know that as well as i do st giles aldgate seven dials bermondsey friars mount bluegate fields the devils acre and a dozen others you didnt answer my question was it domestic no it was men from outside the area wellbred welloff men coming into seven dials for a little sport he heard the anger in his voice as he said it and saw it mirrored in evans face what evidence have you evan asked watching him carefully any chance at all of ever finding them let alone proving it was them and that it was a crime not simply the indulgence of a particularly disgusting appetite monk drew breath to say that of course he had and then let it out in a sigh all he had was word of mouth from women no court would believe even if they could be persuaded to testify and that in itself was dubious im sorry evan said quietly his face tight and bleak with regret it isnt worth pressing even if we found them thered be nothing we could do its sickening but you know it as well as i do monk wanted to shout to swear over and over until he ran out of words but it would achieve nothing and only make his own weakness the more apparent evan looked at him with understanding ive got a miserable case myself monk was not interested but friendship compelled him to pretend he was evan deserved at least that much of him probably more have you what is it murder and assault in st giles poor devil might have been better if hed been murdered too instead of left beaten to within an inch of his life and now so badly shocked or terrified he cant speak at all st giles monk was surprised it was another area no better than seven dials and only a few thousand yards away if that why are you bothering with it he asked wryly what chance have you of solving that either evan shrugged i dont know probably not much but i have to try because the dead man was from ebury street considerable money and social standing monk raised his eyebrows what the devil was he doing in st giles they evan corrected so far i have very little idea the widow doesnt know and probably doesnt want to poor woman i have nothing to follow except the obvious he went to satisfy some appetite either for women or other excitement which he couldnt at home and the one still alive monk asked his son it appeared they had something of a quarrel or at least a heated disagreement before the son left and then the father went after him ugly monk said succinctly he stood up if i get any ideas ill tell you but i doubt i will evan smiled resignedly and picked up the pen again to resume what he had been writing when monk came in monk left without looking to right or left he did not want to bump into runcorn he was feeling angry and frustrated enough the last thing he desired was a past superior with a grudge and now all the advantages he must return to seven dials and vida hopgood and her women there was going to be no help from outside whatever was done it rested with him alone chapter four the evening after corriden wade had left hester went upstairs to see rhys for the last time before settling him for the night she found him lying half curled over on the bed his face turned into the pillow his eyes wide with anyone else she would have talked to him tried to learn if not directly at least indirectly what troubled him but rhys still had no way of communicating except by agreement or disagreement with whatever she asked him she had to guess to fumble with all the myriad possibilities and try to frame them so he could answer yes or no it was such a crude instrument to try to find so subtle and terrible a pain it was like trying to operate on living flesh using an axe yet sometimes words were too precise she did not even know what it was that hurt him at this moment it could be fear of what the future held or simply fear of sleep tonight and the dreams and memories it would bring it could be grief for his father guilt because he was alive and his father was dead or more deeply because his father had followed him out of the house and perhaps if he had not he would still be alive or it could be the mixture of anger and grief which afflicts someone when they have parted for the last time in a quarrel and it is too late for all the things that remain unsaid it might be no more than the weariness of physical pain and the fear of endless days stretching ahead when it would not ever stop would he spend the rest of his life here locked in silence and this terrible isolation or was memory returning with its terror and pain and helplessness relived she wanted to touch him it was the most immediate form of communication it did not need to say anything there were no queries in it no clumsiness of wrong guesses simply a nearness but she remembered how he had snatched himself away from his mother she did not know him well enough and he might consider it an intrusion a familiarity to which she had no right an advantage she took only because he was ill and dependent upon her in the end she simply spoke her mind rhys he did not move rhys shall i stay for a while or would you rather be alone he turned very slowly and stared at her his eyes wide and dark she tried to read them to feel what emotion what need was filling his mind and tearing at him till he could neither bear it nor loose it in words forgetting her resolve from her own need she reached out and touched him laying her hand on his arm above the splints and bandaging he did not flinch she smiled slightly he opened his mouth his throat tightened but no sound came he breathed more rapidly swallowing he had to gasp to stop choking but still there was no voice no word she put her hand up to his lips its all right wait a little give it time to heal is is there something in particular you want to say nothing his eyes were full of dread and misery she waited struggling to understand slowly his eyes filled with tears and he shook his head she brushed his dark hair from his brow are you ready to go to sleep he shook his head shall i find something to read to you he nodded she went to the bookshelf should she even try to censor out anything which might give him pain remind him of his condition or reawaken memory might it not end in being more conspicuous by its very absence she picked up a translation of the iliad it would be full of battles and deaths but the language would be beautiful and it would be alive with imagery and light epic loves gods and goddesses ancient cities and winedark seas a world of the mind away from the alleys of st giles she sat in the chair beside his bed and he lay still and listened to her his eyes never leaving her face eleven oclock came and went midnight one oclock and at last he fell asleep she marked the place and closed the book tiptoeing out and to her own room where she lay down on the bed and fell asleep herself still fully clothed she awoke late and still tired but she had slept better than any night since she came to ebury street she went immediately to rhys and found him restless but not yet ready to wake sufficiently to take breakfast downstairs she met sylvestra who came across the hall as soon as she saw hester her face tense with anxiety how is he has he spoken yet she closed her eyes impatient with herself im sorry i swore i would not ask that dr wade says i must be patient but she stopped of course it is difficult hesterassured her every day seems like a week but we sat reading till very late last night and he seems to have slept well he was much more at ease some of the tension slipped out of sylvestras body her shoulders lowered a little and she attempted to smile come into the dining room im sure you have not breakfasted yet neither have i thank you hesteraccepted not only because it was a request from her employer but because she hoped that gradually she might learn a little more about rhys and thus be able to be of more comfort to him comfort of mind was about all she could offer him apart from helping him to eat to stay clean and attend to his immediate personal wants so far dr wade had not permitted her to change any dressings but the most superficial and rhyss greatest injuries were internal where no one could reach them the dining room was pleasantly furnished but like the rest of the house in too heavy a style for hesters taste the table and sideboard were elizabethan oak solid and powerful an immense weight of wood the carver chairs at each end of the table had high backs and ornate arm rests there were no mirrors which might have given more light and impression of space the curtains were wine and pink brocade tied back with tasselled cords and splayed wide to show their richness and the burgundycoloured lining the walls were hung with a dozen or more pictures but it was extremely comfortable the chairs were padded on their seats and the fire blazed up in the inglenook hearth filling the room with warmth sylvestra did not wish to eat she picked at a piece of toast undecided whether to have dundee marmalade or apricot preserves she poured a cup of tea and sipped it before it was cool enough hester wondered what kind of a man leighton duff had been how they had met and what had happened in the relationship during its twentyfive or so years what friends had sylvestra to help her in her grief they would all have been at the funeral but that had been almost immediate in the few days when rhys had been in hospital and before hester had arrived now the formal acknowledgements of death were over and sylvestra was left alone to face the empty days afterwards apparently dr wades sister was one who was eager to call as soon as she could and he himself seemed to be more than merely a professional acquaintance have you always lived here hesterasked yes sylvestra replied looking up quickly as if she too were grateful for something to say but had simply not known how to begin yes ever since i was married its extremely comfortable yes sylvestra answered automatically as if it were the expected thing to observe and she did it as she had always done it no longer had meaning the poverty and hour to hour dangers of st giles were further away than the quarrels and the gods of the iliad because they were beyond the horizons of the imagination sylvestra recalled herself yes it is i suppose i have become so accustomed to it i forget you must have had very different experiences miss latterly i admire your courage and sense of duty in going to the crimea my daughter amalia would particularly have liked to meet you i believe you would have liked her also she has a most enquiring mind and the courage to follow her dreams a superb quality hester said sincerely you have many reasons to be most proud of her sylvestra smiled yes thank you of course thank you miss latterly yes does rhys remember what happened to him i dont know usually people do but not always i have a friend who had an accident and was struck on the head he has only the vaguest flashes of his life before that day at times a sight or a sound a smell will recall something to him but only fragments he has to piece it together as well as he can and leave the rest he has recreated a good life for himself she abandoned the pretence of eating but rhys was not struck on the head he knows hes home he knows you it is simply that night he may not recall and perhaps that is best there are some memories we cannot bear to forget is natures way of helping us to keep our sanity it is a way for the mind to heal when natural forgetting would be impossible sylvestra stared at her plate the police are going to try to make him remember they need to know who attacked him and who murdered my husband she looked up what if he cant bear to remember miss latterly what if they force him show him evidence bring a witness or whatever and make him relive it will it break his mind cant you stop that isnt there a way we can protect him there has to be yes of course hester said before she really thought her mind was filled with memories of rhys trying desperately to speak of his eyes wide with horror of his sweatsoaked body as he struggled in nightmare rigid with terror his throat contracted in a silent scream as pain ripped through him and no one heard no one came he is far too ill to be harassed and i am sure dr wade will tell them so anyway since he cannot speak or write there is little he can do except to indicate yes or no they will have to solve this case by other means i dont know how sylvestras voice rose in desperation i cannot help them all they asked me were useless questions about what leighton was wearing and when he went out none of that is going to achieve anything what would help hester poured her cold tea into the slop basin and reached for the pot tactfully offering it to sylvestra as well at her nod she refilled both cups i wish i knew sylvestra said almost under her breath ive racked my brain to think what leighton would have been doing in a place like that and all i can imagine is that he went after rhys he was he was very angry when he left home far angrier than i told that young man from the police it seems so disloyal to discuss family quarrels with strangers hester knew she meant not so much strangers as people from a different social order as she must consider evan to be she would not know his father was a minister of the church and he had chosen police work from a sense of dedication to justice not because it was his natural place in society of course she agreed it is painful to admit even to oneself of a quarrel which cannot now be repaired one has to set it amid the rest of the relationship and see it as merely a part only by mischance the last part it was probably far less important than it seems had mr duff lived they would surely have made up their differences she did not leave it exactly a question sylvestra sipped her fresh tea they were quite unlike each other rhys is the youngest leighton said i indulged him perhaps i did i i felt i understood him so well her face puckered with hurt now it looks as if i didnt understand him at all and my failure may have cost my husband his life her fingers gripped the cup so tightly hester was afraid she would break it and spill the hot liquid over herself even cut her hands on the shards dont torture yourself with that when you dont know if it is true she urged perhaps you can think of something which may help the police learn why they went to st giles it may stem from something that happened some time before that evening it is a fearful place they must have had a very compelling reason could it have been on someone elses account a friend in trouble sylvestra looked up at her quickly her eyes bright that would make some sense of it wouldnt it yes who are rhyss friends who might he care about sufficiently to go to such a place to help them perhaps they had borrowed money it can happen a gambling debt they dared not tell their family about or a girl of dubious reputation sylvestra smiled it was full of fear but there was selfmastery in it also that sounds like rhys himself im afraid he tended to find respectable young ladies rather boring that was the principal reason he quarrelled with his father he felt it unfair that constance and amalia were able to travel to india to have all manner of exotic experiences and he was required to remain at home and study and marry well and then go into the family business what was mr duffs business hester felt considerable sympathy with rhys all his will and passion all his dreams seemed to lie in the middle east and he was required to remain in london while his elder sisters had the adventures not only of the mind but of the body as well he was in law sylvestra replied conveyancing property he was the senior partner he had offices in birmingham and manchesteras well as the city highly respectable hester thought but hardly the stuff of dreams at least the family would presumably still have some means finance would not be an additional cause for anxiety she imagined rhys had been expected to go up to university and then follow in his fathers footsteps in the company probably a junior partnership to begin with leading to rapid promotion his whole future was built ahead of him and rigidly defined naturally it required that he make at the very least a suitable marriage at best a fortunate one she could feel the net drawing tight as if it had been around herself it was a life tens of thousands would have been only too grateful for she tried to imagine leighton duff and his hopes for his son his anger and frustration that rhys was ungrateful blind to his good fortune he must have been a very talented man she said again to fill the silence he was sylvestra agreed with a distant smile he was immensely respected the number of people who regarded his opinion was extraordinary he could perceive both opportunities and dangers that others some very skilled and learned men did not to hester it only made his journey into st giles the harder to understand she had no sense of his personality apart from an ambition for his son and perhaps a lack of wisdom in his approach to pressing it but then she had not known rhys before the attack perhaps he had been very wilful wasted his time when he should have been studying maybe he had chosen poorly in his friends especially his female ones he could well have been a son overindulged by his mother refusing to grow up and accept adult responsibility leighton duff may have had every reason to be exasperated with him it would not be the first time a mother had overprotected a boy and thereby achieved the very last thing she intended left him unfit for any kind of lasting happiness but instead a permanent dependant and an inadequate husband in his turn sylvestra was lost in her own thoughts remembering a kinder past leighton could be very dashing she said thoughtfully he used to ride over hurdles when he was younger he was terribly good at it he didnt keep horses himself but many friends wanted him to ride for them he won very often because he had the courage and of course the skill i used to love to watch him even though i was terrified he would fall at that speed it can be extremely dangerous hester tried to picture it it was profoundly at odds with the rather staid man she had envisioned in her mind the dry lawyer drawing up deeds for property how foolish it was to judge a person by a few facts when there were so many other things to know perhaps the law offices were only a small part of him a practical side which provided for the family life and perhaps also the money for the adventure and imagination of his truer self it could be from their father that constance and amalia had inherited their courage and their dreams i suppose he had to give it up as he got older she said thoughtfully sylvestra smiled yes im afraid so he realised it when a friend of ours had a very bad fall leighton was so upset for him he was crippled oh he learned to walk again after about six months but it was only with pain and he was no longer able to practise his profession he was a surgeon and he could not hold his hands steadily enough it was very tragic he was only fortythree hester did not reply she thought of a man whose life had been dedicated to one art losing it in a moments fall from a horse not even doing anything necessary simply a race what regret would follow what selfblame for the hardship to his family leighton helped him a great deal sylvestra went on he managed to sell some property for him and invest the money so he was provided for at least with some income for his family hester smiled quickly in acknowledgement she had heard and appreciated it sylvestras face darkened again do you think rhys may have gone into that dreadful area searching for a friend in trouble she asked it seems possible i shall have to ask arthur kynaston perhaps he will come to see rhys when he is a little better he might like that we can ask him in a day or two is he fond of rhys oh yes arthur is the son of one of leightons closest friends the headmaster of rowntrees that is an excellent boys school near q here her face softened for a moment and her voice lifted with enthusiasm joel kynaston was a brilliant scholar and he chose to dedicate his life to teaching boys the love of learning especially the classics that is where rhys learned his latin and greek and his love of history and ancient cultures it is one of the greatest gifts a young person can receive or any age of person i suppose of course hesteragreed arthur is rhyss age she went on his elder brother marmaduke they call him duke is also a friend he is a little wilder perhaps clever people sometimes are and duke is very talented i know leighton thought him headstrong he is now at oxford studying classics like his father of course he is home for christmas they must both be terribly grieved by this hester finished her toast and drank the last of her tea at least she knew a little more about rhys it did not explain what had happened to him but it offered a few possibilities nothing she had learned prepared her for what happened that afternoon when sylvestra came into the bedroom for the third time that day rhys had had a very light luncheon and then fallen asleep he was in some physical pain lying in more or less one position was making him very stiff and his bruises were healing only slowly it was impossible to know what injuries were causing pain within him swelling or even bleeding he was very uncomfortable and after she had given him a sedative herbal drink with something to ease him at least a little he fell into a light sleep he woke when sylvestra came in she went over and sat in the chair next to him how are you my dear she said softly are you rested he stared at her hester was standing at the end of the bed and saw the pain and the darkness in his eyes sylvestra put out her hand and stroked him gently on the bare arm above his splints and plasters every day will be a little better rhys she said just above a whisper her voice dry with emotion it will pass and you will heal he looked at her steadily then slowly his lips curled back from his teeth in a cold glare of utter contempt sylvestra looked as if she had been struck her hand remained on his arm but as if frozen she was too stunned to move rhys a savage hatred filled his face as if had he the strength he would have lashed out at her physically wounding gouging delighting in pain rhys she opened her mouth to continue but she had no words she withdrew her hand as if it had been injured holding it protectively his face softened the violence crumpled out of it leaving him limp and bruised she reached out to him again instantly to forgive he looked at her measuring her feelings waiting then he lifted his other hand and hit her jarring the splints it must have been agony to his broken bones and he went grey with the shock of it but he did not move his eyes from hers her eyes filled with tears and she stood up now truly physically hurt although it was nothing compared with the pain of confusion and rejection and helplessness within she walked slowly to the door and out of the room rhyss lips curled in a slow vicious satisfied smile and he swung his face back to look at hester hester was cold inside as if she had swallowed ice that was horrible she said clearly you have belittled yourself he stared at her confusion filling his face and surprise whatever he had expected of her it was not that she was too repelled and too aware of sylvestras grief to guard her words she felt a kind of horror she had never known before a mixture of pity and fear and a sense of something so dark she could not even stumble towards it in imagination that was a cruel and pointless thing to do she went on im disgusted with you anger blazed in his eyes and the smile came back to his mouth still twisted as if in selfmockery she turned away she heard him bang his hand on the sheet it must have hurt it would jar the broken bones even further it was his only way of attracting attention unless he knocked the bell off and when he did that others might hear especially sylvestra if she had not yet gone downstairs she turned back he was trying desperately to speak his head jerked his lips moved and his throat convulsed as he fought to make a sound nothing came only a gasping for breath as he choked and gagged and then choked again she went to him and put her arm around him lifting him a little so he could breathe more easily stop it she ordered stop it that wont help you to speak just breathe slowly in out in out thats better again slowly she sat holding him up until his breathing was regular under control then she let him lie back on the pillows she regarded him dispassionately until she saw the tears on his cheeks and the despair in his eyes he seemed oblivious of his hands lying on the cover with the splints crooked carrying the bones awry it must have been agonising and yet the pain of emotion inside him was so much greater he did not even feel it what in gods name had happened to him in st giles what memory tore inside him with such unbearable horror ill rebandage your hands she said more gently you cant leave them like that the bones may even have been moved he blinked but made no more sign of disagreement its going to hurt she warned he smiled and made a little snort letting out his breath sharply it took her nearly threequarters of an hour to take the bandages off both hands examine the broken fingers and the bruised and swollen flesh lacerated across the knuckles realign the bones all the time aware of the hideous pain it must be causing him and then resplint them and rebandage them it was really a surgeons job and perhaps corriden wade would be angry with her for doing it herself instead of calling him but he was due to come tomorrow and she was perfectly capable she had certainly set enough bones before she could not leave rhys like this while she sent a messenger out to wades house to look for him at this time he might very well be out at dinner or even the theatre afterwards rhys was exhausted his face was grey with pain and his clothes were soaked with sweat ill change the bed she said matteroffactly you cant sleep in that then ill get you a draught to ease the pain of it and help you to rest maybe youll think twice before hitting anyone again he bit his lip and stared at her he looked rueful but it was far less than an apology it was too complicated to express without words perhaps even with them she helped him to the further side of the bed half supporting his weight he was dizzy and weak with pain she eased him down on to it she took off the rumpled sheets marked with spots of blood and put on clean ones then she helped him change into a fresh nightshirt and held him steady while he half rolled back to the centre of the bed and she straightened the covers over him ill be back in a few moments with the draught for pain she told him dont move until i return he nodded obediently it took her nearly quarter of an hour to mix up the strongest dose she dared give him from dr wades medicine it should be enough to help him sleep at least half of the night anything strong enough to deaden the pain of his hands might kill him it was the best she could do she offered it to him and held it while he drank he made a face i know its bitter she agreed i brought a little peppermint to take the taste away he looked at her gravely then very slowly he smiled it was thanks there was nothing else in it no cruelty no satisfaction he was powerless to explain she pushed the hair back off his brow goodnight she said quietly if you need me you have only to knock the bell he raised his eyebrows yes of course ill come she promised this time the smile was a little wider then he turned away suddenly and his eyes filled with tears she went out quietly bitterly aware that she was leaving him alone with his horror and his silence the draught would give him at least a little rest the doctor called the following morning it was a dark day the sky heavyladen with snow and an icy wind whistling in the eaves he came in with skin whipped ruddy by the cold and rubbing his hands to get the circulation back after sitting still in his carriage sylvestra was relieved to see him and came out of the morning room immediately she heard his voice in the hall hester was on the stairs and could not help observing his quick effort to smile at her and her relief she went to him eagerly and he took her hands in his nodding while he spoke to her the conversation was brief then he came straight up to hester he took her arm and led her away from the banister edge and towards the more private centre of the landing it is not good news he said very quietly as if aware of sylvestra still below them you gave him the powders i left yes in the strongest dose you prescribed it provided him some ease yes he nodded he looked cold anxious and very tired as if he too had slept little perhaps he had been up all night with other patients below them in the hall sylvestras footsteps faded towards the withdrawing room i wish i knew what to do to help him but i confess i am working blindly wade looked at hester with a regretful smile this is very different from the orlop deck on which i trained he gave a dry little laugh there everything was so quick men were carried in and laid on the canvas each waited his turn first brought in first seen it was a matter of searching for musket balls splinters of wood teak splinters are poisonous did you know that miss latterly no of course not i dont suppose you have them in the army but then in the navy we didnt have men trodden on or dragged by horses i expect you did yes but we are both used to cannon fire sabre slashes and musket shot and fever his eyes were bright with remembered agony god the fevers yellow jack scurvy malaria cholera typhoid and gangrene she responded the past hideously clear for an instant gangrene he agreed his gaze unwavering from hers dear god i saw some courage i imagine you could match me instance for instance i believe so she did not want to see the white faces again the broken bodies and the fever and deaths but it gave her a pride like a burning pain inside to have been part of it and to be able to share it with this man who understood as a mere reader and listener never could what can we do for rhys she asked he drew in his breath and let it go in a sigh keep him as quiet and as comfortable as we can the internal bruising will subside in time i believe unless there is more damage done than we know his external wounds are healing but it is very early yet he looked very grave and his voice dropped even lower belying his words he is young and was strong and in good health the flesh will knit but it will take time it must still cause him severe pain it is to be expected and there is nothing to do but endure you can relieve him to some extent with the powders i have left i will redress his wounds each time i call and make sure they are uninfected there is little suppuration and no sign of gangrene so far i shall be most careful i was obliged to rebandage his hands last night im sorry she was reluctant to tell him about the unpleasant incident with sylvestra oh he looked wary the concern in his eyes deepening but she saw no anger no censure of her i think you had better tell me what happened miss latterly i am sensitive to your wish to protect your patients confidentiality but i have known rhys a long time i am already aware of some of his characteristics briefly omitting detail she told him of the encounter with sylvestra i see he said quietly he turned away so she could not see his face it is not hopeful please do not encourage mrs duff to expect miss latterly i confess i do not know what to say one should never abandon any effort try all one can whatever the odds he hesitated before going on as if it cost him an effort to master his feelings i have seen miracles of recovery i have also seen a great many men die perhaps it is better to say nothing if you can do that living here in the house i can try do you think he will regain his speech he swung around to face her his eyes narrow and dark unreadable i have no idea but you must keep the police from harassing him if they do and they send him into another hysteria it could kill him his voice was brittle and urgent she heard the note of fear in it which she saw in his eyes and mouth i dont know what happened or what he did but i do know that the memory is unbearable to him if you want to save his sanity you will guard him with every spark of courage and intelligence you have from the police attempts to make him relive it with their questions for him to do so could very well tip him over the abyss into madness from which he might never return i have no doubt that if anyone is equal to that you are thank you she said simply it was a compliment she would treasure because it was from a man who used no idle words he nodded now i will go and see him if you will be good enough to ensure we are uninterrupted i must examine not only his hands but his other wounds to see he has not torn any of the newly healing skin thank you for your care miss latterly the following day rhys received his first visitor since the incident it was early in the afternoon the day was considerably brighter snow was lying on the roofs and it reflected back from a windy sky and the pale sunlight of short winter days hester was upstairs when the doorbell rang and wharmby showed in a woman of unusual appearance she was of average height and fair unremarkable colouring but her features were strong decidedly asymmetrical and yet possessed of an extraordinary air of inner resolution and calm she was certainly not beautiful yet one gained from her a sense of wellbeing which was almost more attractive good afternoon mrs kynaston wharmby said with evident pleasure he looked at the youth who had followed her his hair and skin were as fair as hers but his features quite different his face was thin his features finer and more aquiline his eyes clear light blue it was a face of humour and dreams and perhaps a certain loneliness good afternoon mr arthur good afternoon mrs kynaston replied she was wearing dark browns and blacks as became one visiting a house in mourning her clothes were well cut but somehow devoid of individual style it seemed evident it did not matter to her she allowed wharmby to take her cloak and then to conduct her into the withdrawing room where apparently sylvestra was expecting her arthur followed a pace behind wharmby came up the stairs miss latterly young mr kynaston is a great friend of mr rhyss he has asked if he may visit is that possible do you think i shall ask mr rhys is he wishes to see him hester replied if he does i would like to see mr kynaston first it is imperative he does not say or do anything which would cause distress dr wade is adamant on that of course i understand he stood waiting while she went to enquire rhys was lying staring at the ceiling his eyes half closed hester stood in the doorway arthur kynaston is here he would like to visit you if you are feeling well enough if you arent all you have to do is let me know i shall see he is not offended rhyss eyes opened wide she thought she saw eagerness in them then a sudden doubt perhaps embarrassment she waited he was uncertain he was lonely frightened vulnerable ashamed of his helplessness and perhaps of what he had not done to save his father maybe like many soldiers she had known the sheer fact of his survival was a reproach to him when someone else had not had he really been a coward or did he only fear he had been did he even remember with any clarity any approximation to fact if you see him shall i leave you alone she asked a shadow crossed his face shall i stay and see that we talk of pleasant things interesting things slowly he smiled she turned and went out to tell wharmby arthur kynaston came up the stairs slowly his fair face creased in concern are you the nurse he asked when he stood in front of her yes my name is hester latterly may i see him yes but i must warn you mr kynaston he is very ill i expect you have already been told than he cannot speak but he will be able to soon i mean it will come back wont it i dont know for now he cannot but he can nod or shake his head and he likes to be spoken to what can i say he looked confused and a little afraid he was very young perhaps seventeen anything except to mention what happened in st giles or the death of his father oh god i mean he does know doesnt he someone has told him yes but he was there we dont know what happened but the shock of it seems to be what has robbed him of speech talk about anything else you must have interests do you study what do you hope to do classics he replied without hesitation rhys loves the ancient stories even more than i do wed love to go to greece or turkey she smiled and stood aside there was no need to say that he had answered his own question he knew it as soon as he saw arthur rhyss face lit up then instantly was shadowed by selfconsciousness he was in bed helpless unable even to welcome him if arthur kynaston had any idea of such things he hid it superbly he walked in as if it were the way they naturally met he sat down in the chair beside the bed ignoring hester facing rhys i suppose youve got rather more time to read than you can use he said ruefully ill see if i can find a few new books for you ive just been reading something fascinating trust me to get there years after everyone else but ive got this book about egypt by an italian called belzoni it was written nearly forty years ago to be exact its all about the discovery of ancient tombs in egypt and nubia he could not help his face tightening with his enthusiasm its marvelous im convinced there must be much more there if only we knew where to look he leaned forward i havent told papa yet but although i keep saying ill study the classics actually i think i might like to be an egyptologist in fact im pretty sure i would in the doorway hesteralready felt herself relaxing rhys stared at arthur his eyes wide with fascination i must tell you about some of the stuff theyve found arthur went on i tried to tell duke but you know him he wasnt even remotely interested no imagination sees time like a series of little rooms all without windows if you are in today then thats all that exists i see it all as a vast whole any day is as important and as real as any other dont you think so rhys smiled and nodded can i tell you about this arthur asked do you mind ive been longing to tell someone papa would be furious with me for wasting time mama would just listen with half her mind and then forget it duke thinks im a fool but youre a captive audience he blushed hotly sorry that was a wretched thing to say i wish id bitten my tongue rhys smiled with sudden brilliance it changed his whole face lighting it with an extraordinary charm it was a warmth hester had never had a chance to see thanks arthur said with a little shake of his head what i mean is i know youll understand and he proceeded to describe the discoveries belzoni had made in egypt his voice rising with eagerness his hands moving quickly to outline them in the air hester slipped out silently she was perfectly confident that arthur kynaston would cause rhys no unnecessary harm if he reminded him of other times of life and vigour that was unavoidable he would think of those things anyway if he made the occasional clumsy reference that was bound to happen too they were still best left alone downstairs the maid janet told her that mrs duff would be pleased if she would join her in the withdrawing room for tea it was a courtesy and one that hester had not expected she was not a servant in the house but neither was she a guest perhaps sylvestra wished her to know as much as possible about family friends in order to be able to help rhys to explain the rage in him she must feel a consuming loneliness and hester was the only bridge between herself and her son except corriden wade and he was here only briefly she was introduced and fidelis kynaston betrayed no surprise at accepting her as part of the afternoons visit and of the conversation is he sylvestra began nervously hesteranswered with a smile which must have shown her pleasure they are having an excellent time she answered with confidence mr kynaston is describing the discoveries along the nile by a signor belzoni and they are both enjoying it greatly i admit i too was much interested i think when i have spare time i shall purchase the book myself sylvestra gave a sigh of relief and her whole body eased the muscles of her shoulders and back un knotting the silk of her dress ceasing to strain she turned to fidelis thank you so much for coming it is not always easy to visit people who are ill or bereaved one never knows what to say my dear what kind of a friend would one be if the moment one was needed one chose to be somewhere else i have never seen you adopt that course fidelis assured leaning forward sylvestra shrugged there has been so little nothing like this fidelis agreed but there has been unpleasantness even if largely unspoken and you have felt it and been there with companionship sylvestra smiled her acknowledgement the conversation became general of trivial current events family affairs sylvestra recounted the latest letters from amalia in india of course still unaware of events in london she wrote of the poverty she saw and particularly of the disease and lack of clean water a subject which seemed to trouble her greatly hester was drawn in sufficiently for good manners then fidelis asked her about her experiences in the crimea her interest seemed quite genuine it must feel very strange to you to come home to england after the danger and responsibility of your position out there she said with a puckered brow it was difficult to alter the attitude of ones mind hesteradmitted with massive understatement she had found it utterly impossible one month she was dealing with dying men terrible injuries decisions that affected lives then a month later she was required to behave like an obedient and grateful dependant to have no more opinions upon anything more important or controversial than a hemline or a pudding fidelis smiled and there was a flash of amusement in her eyes as if she had some awareness of what the truth may be have you met dr wade yes of course you have he served in the navy for many years you know i imagine you will have a certain amount in common with him he is a most remarkable man he has great strength both of purpose and of character hester recalled corriden wades face as he had stood on the landing talking to her about the sailors he had known the men who had fought with nelson who had seen the great sea battles which had turned the tide of history fiftyfive years ago when england stood alone against the massive armies of napoleon allied with spain and the fate of europe was in the balance she had seen the fire of imagination in his eyes the knowledge of what it meant and the cost in lives and pain she had heard in the timbre of his voice his admiration for the dedication and the sacrifice of those men yes she said with surprising vehemence yes he is he was telling me something of his experiences i know my husband admires him very much sylvestra remarked he has known him for close to twenty years of course not so well to begin with that would be before he came ashore there was a pensiveness in her face for a moment as though she had thought of something else something she did not understand then it passed and she turned to fidelis it is strange to think how much of a persons life you cannot share even though you see them every day and discuss all sorts of things with them have a home and family in common even a destiny shared and yet the part which formed so much of what they think and feel and believe all happened in places you have never been to and were unlike all you have experienced yourself i suppose it is fidelis said slowly her fair brows furrowed very slightly there is so much one observes but will never understand we see what appears to be the same events and yet when we speak about them afterwards they are quite different as if we were not discussing the same thing at all i used to wonder if it was memory now i know it is quite a different perception in the first place i suppose that is part of growing up she smiled very slightly at her own foolishness you realise that people do not necessarily feel or think as you do yourself some things cannot be communicated cant they sylvestra challenged surely that is what speech is for words are only labels fidelis replied taking the thoughts hester felt it would be too bold of her to express them herself a way of describing an idea if you do not know what the idea is then the label does not tell you sylvestra was plainly puzzled i remember joel trying to explain some greek or arabic ideas to me fidelis attempted to clarify i did not understand because we do not have such a concept in our culture she smiled ruefully in the end all he could do was use their word for it it did not help in the slightest i still had no idea what it was she looked at hester can you tell me what it is like to watch a young soldier die of cholera in scutari or see the wagon loads of mangled bodies come in from sebastopol or balaclava some of them dying of hunger and cold i mean can you tell me so that i will feel what you felt no the bare word was enough hester looked at this woman with the extraordinary face far more closely than before at first she had seemed simply another wellbred wife of a successful man come to offer her sympathy to a friend bereaved in what had begun as an afternoons trivial conversation she had touched on one of the mysteries of loneliness and misunderstanding that underlay so many incomplete relationships she saw in sylvestras eyes the sudden flare of her own incomprehension perhaps the chasm between rhys and herself was more than his loss of speech maybe words would not have conveyed what had really happened to him anyway and what of leighton duff how well had she known him she could see that thought reflected in her dark eyes even now fidelis was watching sylvestra too her lopsided face touched with concern how much had she been told or had she guessed of that night had she any idea of why leighton duff had gone to st giles no hester broke the silence i think there must always be experiences we can share only imperfectly for any of us fidelis smiled briefly again the shadow behind her eyes the wisest thing my dear is to accept a certain blindness and not either to blame yourself or to blame others too much you must succeed by your own terms not anyone elses it was a curious remark and hester had the fleeting impression that it was made with some deeper meaning which sylvestra would understand she was not sure if it referred to rhys or to leighton duff or simply to some generality of their lives which was relevant to this new and consuming misery whatever it was fidelis kynaston wished sylvestra to believe she understood it their tea was cold and the tiny sandwiches eaten when arthur kynaston returned looking slightly flushed but far less tense than when he had gone up how is he his mother asked before sylvestra could speak he seems in good spirits he replied hastily he was too young too clearfaced to lie well he had obviously been profoundly shaken but was trying to conceal it from sylvestra im sure when his cuts and bruises have healed hell feel a different man he was really quite interested in belzoni i promised to bring him some drawings if thats all right of course sylvestra said quickly yes yes please do she seemed relieved at last something was returning to normal it was a moment when things were back to the sanity the wholeness of the past fidelis rose to her feet and put her hand on her sons arm that would be most kind now i think we should allow mrs duff a little time to herself she turned and bade hester goodbye then looked at sylvestra if there is anything whatever i can do my dear you have only to let me know if you wish to talk i am always ready to listen and then forget selectively i have an excellent ability to forget there are so many things i would like to forget sylvestra replied almost under her breath i cant forget what i dont understand ridiculous isnt it you would think that would be the easiest why st giles that is what the police keep asking me and i cannot answer them you probably never will fidelis said wryly you might be best advised happiest if you do not guess she kissed sylvestra lightly on each cheek and then took her leave arthur a few steps behind her hester offered no comment and sylvestra did not raise the matter hester had been present as a courtesy and she was owed no confidences they both went up to see if rhys was still in the good spirits arthur had described and found him lying half asleep and apparently at as much ease as was possible in his pain that evening eglantyne wade called it was the first time she had come since the funeral no doubt knowing how ill rhys was and not wishing to intrude hester was curious to see what kind of woman dr wades sister might be she hoped she would prove to be not unlike him a woman of courage imagination and individuality perhaps not unlike fidelis kynaston in the event she proved to be far prettier or far more conventional in appearance and hester felt a stab of disappointment it was totally unreasonable why should his sister have any of his intelligence or inner courage of the spirit her own brother charles was nothing at all like her he was kind in his own way honest and infinitely predictable she replied politely to sylvestras introduction searching miss wades face for some sign of inner fire and not finding it all she met was a bland blue stare which seemed without thought or any but the mildest interest even sylvestras remark on her service in the crimea provoked no surprise but the usual murmur of respect which mention of scutari and sebastopol always earned it seemed as if eglantyne wade were not even truly listening sylvestra had promised hester that she might have the evening free to do as she pleased she had even suggested she might like to go out somewhere visit friends or relatives since oliver rathbone had asked that if she were permitted an evenings respite from her new case she would use it to dine with him she had sent a note to his office at midday by late afternoon she received the reply that he would be honoured if she would allow him to send a carriage for her that they might dine together therefore at seven she waited in the hall dressed in her one really good gown and felt a distinct ripple of excitement when the doorbell rang and wharmby informed her that it was for her it was a bitter night a rime of ice on the cobbles steam rising from the horses flanks and the wreaths of fog curling around the lamps and drifting in choking clammy patches smoke and soot hung heavy in the air above blotting out the stars and a daggerlike wind scythed down the tunnels made by the high house walls on either side of the street she had dined at rathbones home before but with monk also present and to discuss a case and their strategy to fight it she had also dined with him several times at his fathers house in primrose hill but she had gathered from the invitation that this was to be in some public place as was only proper if they were not to be accompanied by any other person the cab drew up at a very handsome inn and the footman immediately opened the door and offered his hand to assist her to alight she was shown into a small dining room where rathbone was waiting he turned from the mantel where he had been standing in front of the fire he was formally dressed in black with icywhite shirt front the light from the chandelier catching his fair hair he smiled and watched her come in until she was in the centre of the room and the door closed behind her before he came forward he took her hands in his her dress was greyblue severely cut but she knew it flattered her eyes and her strong intelligent face frills had always looked absurd on her out of style with her character thank you for coming in such extreme haste he said warmly it is a most ungentlemanly way of snatching an opportunity to see you purely for pleasure and not some wretched business either of yours or of mine i am happy to say that all my current cases are merely matters of litigation and require no detecting at all she was not sure if that was an allusion to monk or simply a statement that for once they had no cause for their meeting but each others company it was an extraordinary departure for him he had always been so guarded in the past so very private where anything personal was concerned and mine has no trial that would interest you she replied with an answering smile in fact i fear probably no trial at all she withdrew her hands and he let her go he walked back slowly towards the chairs near the fire and indicated one for her to sit before he sat on the other it was a delightful room comfortable and private without being too intimate for decorum anyone might come or go at any moment and they could hear the chatter and laughter and the clink of china in another room very close the fire burned hotly in the grate and there was a pleasant glow from the pink and plum shades of the furniture light gleamed on the polished wood of a side table a main table was set with linen crystal and silver for two do you want a trial he asked with amusement his eyes were extraordinarily dark and he watched her intently she had thought she would find it disconcerting but although perhaps it was it was also unquestionably pleasant even if it made her skin a little warm and very slightly disturbed her concentration in a subtle way it was like being touched i would very much like the offenders caught and punished she said vehemently it is one of the worst cases i have seen often i think i can see some sort of reason for things but this seems to be simply the most bestial violence what happened a young man and his father were attacked in st giles and appallingly beaten the father died the young man whom i am nursing is very badly injured and cannot speak her voice dropped unintentionally i have watched him have nightmares when it is quite obvious he is reliving the attack he is agonised with terror hysterical trying over and over to scream but his voice wont come he is in great physical pain but the anguish in his mind is even worse im sorry he said regarding her gravely it must be very difficult for you to watch can you help him at all a little i hope he smiled across at her the warmth in his eyes praise enough then his brow puckered what were they doing in st giles if they can afford a private nurse for him they dont sound like residents or even visitors of such a place oh they arent she said quickly with a lift of amusement which vanished at once they live in ebury street mr duff was a senior solicitor in property conveyancing i have no idea what they were doing in st giles that is one of the problems the police are trying to solve it is john evan by the way i feel odd behaving as if i do not know him but it is best im sure he agreed im sorry you have such a distressing case the servant had left a decanter of wine and he offered it to her and when she accepted poured a glassful and passed it to her he raised his own glass to his lips in an unspoken toast i suppose many of your cases are trying one way or another she had not thought of it in that light yes i suppose they are either the person is very ill and to watch suffering is hard or they are not and then i feel i am not challenged enough not really necessary she smiled suddenly with real laughter this time im impossible to please he stared at the light reflecting through the wine in the glass are you sure you want to continue nursing in an ideal situation if you did not have to provide for yourself would you not rather work for hospital reform as you originally intended she found herself sitting very still suddenly aware of the crackling of the fire and the sharp edges of the crystal on the glass in her hands he was not looking at her perhaps there was no deeper meaning behind what he had said no of course there wasnt she was being ridiculous the warmth of the room and the glow of the wine were addling her wits i havent thought about it she replied trying to sound light and casual i fear reform will be a very slow process and i have not the influence necessary to make anyone listen to me he looked up his eyes gentle and almost black in the candlelight instantly she could have bitten her tongue out it sounded exactly as if she were angling for the greater influence he had obliquely referred to perhaps or perhaps not it was the last thing she had meant it was not only crass it was clumsily done she could feel the colour burning up her cheeks she rose to her feet and turned away she must say something quickly but it must be the right thing haste might even make it worse it was so easy to talk too much he had risen when she did and now he was behind her closer than when they were sitting she was sharply aware of him i dont really have that kind of skill she said very measuredly miss nightingale has she is a brilliant administrator and arguer she can make a point so that people have to concede she is correct and she never gives up do you he said with laughter in his voice she could hear it but she did not look around no of course i dont there were too many shared memories for that to need an answer they had fought battles together against lies and violence mystery fear ignorance they had faced all kinds of darkness and found their way through to at least what justice there was left if not necessarily any resolution of tragedy the one thing they had never done was give up she swung round to face him now he was only a yard away but she was confident of what she was going to say she even smiled back at him i have learned a few tricks of a good soldier i like to choose my own battlefield and my own weapons bravo he said softly his eyes studying her face she stood still for a moment then moved to the table and sat in one of the chairs her skirts draped unusually dramatically she felt elegant even feminine although she had never seemed to herself stronger or more alive he hesitated looking down at her for several moments she was aware of him and yet now she was not uncomfortable the servant came in and announced the first course of the meal rathbone accepted and it was brought and dished hester smiled across at him she felt a little fluttering inside but curiously warm excited what cases are you engaged in that need no detection she asked for a second monk came to her mind and the fact that rathbone had chosen issues where he did not use him could it be intentional or was that a shabby thought as if he too had seen monks face in his inner vision rathbone looked down at the plate a society paternity suit he said with a halfsmile there is really very little to prove it is largely a matter of negotiation to limit the scandal it is an exercise in diplomacy he raised his eyes to hers and again they were brilliant with inner laughter i am endeavouring to judge discretion to the precise degree of knowing how much pressure i can exert before there will be war if i succeed you will never hear anything about it there will simply be a great exchange of money he shrugged if i fail there will be the biggest scandal since he took a deep breath and his expression became rueful selfmocking since princess gisela she finished for him they both laughed it was crowded with memories mostly of the appalling risk he had taken and her fear for him her efforts and ultimately her success in saving at least the truth if not unmixed honour from the issue he had been vindicated that was probably the best that could be said and the truth or at least a good deal of it had been laid bare but there had been a vast number of people who would have preferred not to know not to be obliged to know and will you win she asked him yes he replied firmly this i will win he hesitated suddenly she did not want him to say whatever it was that was on his tongue how is your father she asked very well his voice dropped a little he has just returned from a trip to leipzig where he met a number of interesting people and i gather sat up half of every night talking with them about mathematics and philosophy all very german he enjoyed it immensely she found herself smiling she liked henry rathbone more each time she saw him she had been happy the evenings she had spent in his house in primrose hill with its doors which opened on to the long lawn the apple trees at the far end the honeysuckle hedge and the orchard beyond she remembered walking once with oliver across the grass in the dark they had spoken of other things not connected with any case personal things hopes and beliefs the moment did not seem so very far away it was the same feeling of trust of companionable ease and yet there was something different now an added quality between them which sharpened as if on the brink of some decision she was not sure if she wanted it or if perhaps she was not ready i am glad he is well it is a long time since i travelled anywhere where would you like to go she thought instantly of venice and then remembered monk had been there so very recently with evelyn von seidlitz it was the last place she wanted now she looked up at him and saw the understanding of it in his eyes and what might have been a flash of sadness an awareness of some kind of loss or pain it cut her she wanted to eradicate it egypt she said with a lift of enthusiasm i have just been hearing about signer belzonis discoveries a trifle late i know but i should love to go up the nile wouldnt you oh god she had done it again been far too forthright and desperately clumsy there was no retracting it again she felt the tide of colour hot in her face this time rathbone laughed outright hester my dear dont ever change sometimes you are so unknown to me i cannot possibly guess what you will say or do next at others you are as transparent as the spring sunlight tell me who is signor belzoni and what did he discover haltingly at first she did so struggling to recall what arthur kynaston had said and then as rathbone asked her more questions the conversation flowered again and the unease vanished it was nearly midnight when they parted in his carriage where it stopped in ebury street to return her home the fog had cleared and it was a clear night dry and bitterly cold he alighted to help her down offering his hand steadying her on the icy cobbles with the other thank you she said meaning it as far more than a mere politeness it had been an island of warmth both physical and of a deeper inward quality a few hours when all manner of pain and struggle had been forgotten they had talked of wonderful things shared excitement laughter and imagination thank you oliver he leaned forward his hand tightening over hers and pulling her a little closer he kissed her lips softly gently but without the slightest hesitation she could not have pulled back even if for an instant she had wanted to it was an amazingly sweet and comfortable feeling and even as she was going up the steps knowing he was standing in the street watching her she could feel the happiness of it run through her filling her whole being chapter five evan found the duff case increasingly baffling he had had an artist draw a likeness of both leighton duff and rhys and he and shotts had taken them around the area of st giles to see if anyone recognised them surely two men a generation apart would of itself be something noticeable they had tried pawnbrokers brothels and bawdy houses inns and lodging rooms gambling dens gin mills even the attics high on the rooftops under the skylights where forgers worked and the massive cellars below where fencers of stolen goods stored their merchandise no one showed the slightest recognition not even promise of reward could elicit anything worth having mebbe it were the first time they came shotts said dismally pulling his collar up against the falling snow it was nearly dark they were walking heads down into the wind leaving st giles behind them and turning north towards regent street and the traffic and lights again i dunno oo else terask do you think they are lying evan said thoughtfully it would be natural enough since duff was murdered no one wants to get involved with murder no shotts nimbly avoided a puddle a vegetable cart rattled by them its driver hunched under half a blanket the snow beginning to settle on the brim of his high black hat i know when at least some o them weasels is lyin mebbe they did come ere by accident got lorst evan did not bother to reply the suggestion was not worthy of one they crossed george street the snow was falling faster settling white on some of the roofs but the pavements were still wet and black showing broken reflections of the gaslights and the carriage lamps as the horses passed by at a brisk trot eager to get home maybe they dont recognise them because we are asking the wrong questions evan mused half to himself yeah shotts kept pace with him easily what are the right ones then i dont know perhaps rhys went there with friends his own age afterall one doesnt usually go whoring with ones father maybe that is what put people off the older man mebbe shotts said doubtfully want meter try yes unless you can think of something better im going to the station its time i reported to mr runcorn shotts grinned sooner youn me sir e wont be appy ill get sum mink ter eat then ill go an try again runcorn was a tall wellbuilt man with a lean face and very steady blue eyes his nose was long and his cheeks a little hollow but in his youth he had been goodlooking and now he was an imposing figure he could have been even more so had he the confidence to bear himself with greater ease he sat in his office behind his large leather inlaid desk and surveyed evan with wariness well the leighton duff case sir evan replied still standing i am afraid we do not seem to be progressing we can find no one in st giles who ever saw either of the two men before or will admit to it runcorn agreed shotts believes them evan said defensively aware that runcorn thought he was too soft it was partly his vague unspecific anger at a young man of evans background choosing to come into the police force he could not understand it evan was a gentleman something runcorn both admired and resented he could have chosen all sorts of occupations if he had not the brains or the inclination to go up to university and follow one of the professions if he needed to make his living then he could quite easily have gone into a bank or a trading house of some description evan had not explained to him that a country parson with an ailing wife and several daughters to marry could not afford expensive tuition for their only son one did not discuss such things anyway the police force interested him he had begun idealistically he had not a suit of armour or a white horse he had a quick mind and good brown boots some of the romance had gone but the energy and the desire had not he had that much at least in common with monk does he runcorn said grimly then youd better get back to the family widow and the son who was there and cant speak that right yes sir whats she like the widow his eyes opened wider could it be a conspiracy of some sort son got in the way perhaps wasnt meant to be there and had to be silenced conspiracy evan was astonished between whom thats for you to find out runcorn said testily use your imagination is she handsome yes very in an unusual sort of way what do you mean unusual whats wrong with her how old is she how old was he evan found himself resenting the implications shes very dark sort of spanishlooking theres nothing wrong with her its just unusual how old runcorn repeated about forty i should think the thought had never occurred to him until runcorn had mentioned it but it should have it was obvious enough now that it was there the whole crime might have nothing to do with st giles that may have been no more than a suitable place it could as easily have been any other slum any alley or yard in a dozen such areas just somewhere to leave a body where it would be believed to be an attack by ruffians it was sickening of course rhys was never meant to have been there his presence was mischance leighton duff had followed him and been caught up with but that did not need to be true either he had only sylvestras word for that the two men could have gone out at any time separately or together for any reason he must consider it independently before he accepted it to be the truth now he was angry with himself monk would never have made such an elementary mistake runcorn let out his breath in a sigh you should have thought of that evan he said reprovingly you think everybody who speaks well belongs in your country vicarage evan opened his mouth and then closed it again runcorns remark was unfair but it sprang not from fact or not primarily but from his own complex feelings about gentlemen and about evan himself at least some of it stemmed from the long relationship with monk and the rivalry between them the years of unease of accumulated of fences which monk could not remember and runcorn never forgot evan did not know the origin of it but he had seen the clash of ideals and natures when he first came after monks accident and he had been here when the final and blazing quarrel had severed the tie and monk had found himself out of the police force like every other man in the station he was aware of the emotions he had been monks friend therefore he could never truly be trusted by runcorn and never liked without there always being a reservation so what have you got runcorn asked abruptly evans silence bothered him he did not understand him he did not know what he was thinking very little evan answered ruefully leighton duff died somewhere about three in the morning according to dr riley could have been earlier or later he was beaten and kicked to death no weapon used except fists and boots young rhys duff was almost as badly beaten but he survived i know that evidence man runcorn said impatiently curling his fist on the desk top what evidence have you facts objects statements witnesses that can be believed no witnesses to anything except finding the bodies evan replied stiffly there were moments when he wished he had monks speed of mind to retaliate but he did not want the ordinary man on the beat to fear him only respect no one admits to having seen either man separately or together in st giles cabbies runcorn said his eyebrows raised they didnt walk there were trying nothing so far you havent got very much runcorns face was plainly marked with contempt youd better have another look at the family look at the widow dont let elegance blind you maybe the son knows his mothers nature and thats why hes so horrified that he cannot speak evan thought of rhyss expression as he had looked at sylvestra of his flinching from her when she moved to touch him it was a repellent thought im going to do that he said reluctantly im going to look into his friends and associates more closely he may have been seeing a woman in that area perhaps a married woman and her male relatives may have taken offence at his treatment of her runcorn let out a sigh possible he concluded what about the father why attack him because he was a witness to the scene of course evan replied with a lift of satisfaction runcorn looked at him sharply and another thing sir evan went on monk has been hired to look into a series of very violent rapes across in seven dials runcorns blue eyes narrowed then hes more of a fool than i took him for if ever there were a profitless exercise that is it have we any reports that might help help monk runcorn said with disbelief help solve the crime sir evan answered with only a hint of sarcasm i can solve it for you now runcorn stood up he was at least three inches taller than evan and considerably more solid how many were there half a dozen he ticked off on his fingers one was a drunken husband one was a pimp taking his revenge for a little liberty turned licence at least two were dissatisfied clients probably too drunk one was an amateur who changed her mind and wanted more money when it was too late and probably one was drunk herself and fell over and cant remember what happened i disagree sir evan said coldly i think monk can tell the difference between a woman who was raped and beaten and one who fell over because she was drunk runcorn glared at him he was standing beside the bookshelf of moroccobound volumes in a variety of profound subjects including philosophy evan had used monks name and the memory of his skill quicker sharper than runcorns on purpose he was angry and it was the easiest weapon but even as he did it he wondered what had started the enmity between the two had it really been no more than a difference of character or beliefs if monk thinks he can prove rape of half a dozen parttime prostitutes in seven dials hes lost the wits he used to have runcorn said with a flush of satisfaction under his anger i knew hed come to nothing after he left here private agent of enquiry indeed hes no good for anything but a policeman and now hes no good even for that his eyes were bright with satisfaction and there was a halfsmile on his lips hes come right down in the world hasnt he our monk if hes reduced to running after prostitutes in seven dials whos going to pay him evan felt a tight hard knot of rage inside him presumably someone who cares just as much about poor women as rich ones he said with his teeth clenched and who doesnt believe it will do them any good appealing to the police someone whos got more money than brains sergeant evan runcorn retorted a flush of anger blotching his cheeks and if monk were an honest man and not a desperate one trying to scrape any living he can no matt erat whose expense then hed have told them theres nothing he can do he jerked one hand dismissively hell never find who did it if anything was done and if he did find them whos to prove it was rape and not a willing one that got a bit rough and even supposing all of that whats a court going to do when was a man ever hanged or gaoled for taking a woman who sells her body anyway and at the end of it all what difference would it make to seven dials what difference is one death more or less to london evan demanded leaning towards him his voice thick not much unless its yours then it makes all the difference in the world stay with what you can do something about sergeant runcorn said wearily let monk worry about rape and seven dials if he wants to perhaps he has nothing else poor devil you have youre a policeman with a duty go and find out who murdered leighton duff and why then bring me proof of it thered be some point in that yes sir evan replied so sharply it was almost one word then swivelled on his heel and went out of the room the anger burning inside him the following morning when he set out for ebury street he was still turning over in his mind his conversation with runcorn of course runcorn was right to consider the possibility that sylvestra was at the heart of it she was a woman of more than beauty there was a gravity a mystery about her an air of something different and undiscovered which was far more intriguing than mere perfection of form or colouring it was something which might fascinate for a lifetime and last even when the years had laid their mark on physical loveliness evan should have thought of it himself and it had never crossed his mind he walked part of the way it was not an unpleasant morning and his mind worked more clearly if he exerted some effort of body he strode along the pavement in the crisp frostsharpened air there were rims of white along the roofs where the snow had remained and curls of smoke rose from chimneys almost straight up at the edge of hyde park the bare trees were black against a white sky the flat winter light seeming almost shadowless he must learn a great deal more about leighton duff what manner of man had he been could this after all be a crime of passion or jealousy and not a random robbery at all was rhyss presence there simply the most appalling mischance and how much of what sylvestra said was the truth was her grief and confusion for her son and not for her husband at all evan must learn very much more of her life her friends especially those who were men and who might possibly now court a fascinating and quite comfortably situated widow dr wade was the first and most apparent place to begin it was a thought which repelled him and he shivered as he crossed buckingham palace road running the last few steps to get out of the way of a carriage turning from the mews off stafford place it went past him at a smart clip harness jingling horses hooves loud on the stones their breath steaming in the icy air the other questions which lay unresolved at the back of the mind concerned his relationship with runcorn there were many occasions when he saw a side of him he almost liked at least a side he could understand and feel for his aspirations to better himself were such as any man might have most particularly one from a very ordinary background a goodlooking man whose education was unremarkable but where intelligence and ability were greater than his opportunities would allow he had chosen the police as a career where avenues were open for him to exercise his natural gifts and he had done so with great success he was not a gentleman born nor had he the daring and the confidence to bluff his way as monk had he lacked the grace the quickwitted ness or the model from whom to learn evan thought that very possibly he had received little encouragement from whatever family he possessed they might see him as being ashamed of his roots and resent him accordingly and he had never married there must be a story to that evan wondered if it were financial many men felt they could not afford a home fit for a wife and the almost certain family which would follow or had it been emotional a woman who had refused him or perhaps who had died young and he had not loved again probably evan would never know but the possibilities lent a greater humanity to a man whose temper and whose weakness he saw as well as his competence and his strengths he stood on the kerb waiting for the traffic to ease so he could cross the corner at grosvenor street a newspaper seller was calling out headlines about the controversial book published last year by charles darwin a leading bishop had expressed horror and condemnation liberal and progressive thinkers disagreed with him and labelled him reactionary and diehard the murder in st giles was forgotten there was a brazier on the corner and a man selling roasted chestnuts and warming his hands at the fire there was congestion at the junction of eccleston street and belgrave road two dray men were in a heated discussion evan could hear their raised voices from where he stood the traffic all ground to a halt and he went across the street dodging fresh horse droppings pungent in the cold air he was a short block from ebury street the worst of runcorn the times he descended into spite were when monks name or by implication his achievements were mentioned there was a shadow between them far deeper than the few clashes evan had witnessed or the final quarrel when monk had left simultaneously with runcorn dismissing him monk no longer understood it it was gone with all the rest of his past returning only in glimpses and unconnected fragments leaving him to guess and fear the rest evan would almost certainly never know but it was there in his mind when he saw the weakness and the vulnerability in runcorn he reached ebury street and knocked on the door of number thirtyfour he was met by the maid janet who smiled at him a slight uncertainty as if she liked him but knew his errand only too painfully she showed him into the morning room and asked him to wait while she discovered if mrs duff would see him however when the door opened it was hester who came in quickly closing it behind her she was wearing blue her hair dressed a little less severely than usual and she looked flushed but with vitality rather than fever or any embarrassment he had always liked her but now he thought perhaps she was also prettier than he had realised before softer more openly feminine that was another thing he wondered about monk why he quarrelled with her so much he would be the last man on earth to admit it but perhaps that was exactly why he could not afford he did not dare to see her as she really was good morning hester he said informally echoing his thoughts rather than his usual manners good morning john she answered with a smile a touch of amusement in it as well as friendship how is mr duff the laughter vanished from her eyes and even the light in her face seemed to fade he is very poorly still he has the most dreadful nightmares he had another again last night i dont even know how to help him there is no question he saw what happened to his father he said regretfully if only he could tell us he cant she said instantly i know he cant speak but no you cant ask him she interrupted in fact it would be better if you did not even see him really i am not being obstructive i would like to know who murdered leighton duff and also did this to him as much as you would but his recovery has to be my chief concern she looked at him earnestly it has to be john regardless of anything else i could not conceal a crime or knowingly tell you anything that was not true but i cannot allow you to cause him the distress and the real damage it may do if you try in any way at all to bring back to his mind what he saw and felt and if you had witnessed his nightmares as i have you would not argue with me her eyes were dark with her own distress her face pinched with it and he knew her well enough to read in her expression far more than she said and dr wade has forbidden it she added he has seen his injuries and knows the damage further hysteria on his part might cause they could be torn open so easily were he to wrench his body around or move suddenly or violently i understand he conceded trying not to imagine too vividly the horror and the pain and finding it hideously real i came principally to report to mrs duff her eyes widened have you found something she remained curiously still and for a moment he thought she was afraid of the answer no that was not totally true she had not asked him openly but had he been honest to the question which was understood between them he would have said he had learned new suspicions about sylvestra he had returned not because of a discovery but a realisation i wish there were new facts he went on its only a matter of trying better to understand the old ones i cant help you she said quietly im not even sure whether i want you to find the truth i have no idea what it is except that rhys cannot bear it he smiled at her and all the memory of past tragedies and horrors they had known was there with its emotion for an instant shared then the door opened and sylvestra came in she looked at hester with dark eyebrows lifted in question miss latterly says that mr duff is not well enough to be spoken to evan explained i am sorry i had hoped he was better for his own sake as well as for the truth no hes not sylvestra said quickly relief filling her face and a softening of gratitude towards hester im afraid he still cannot help perhaps you can mrs duff evan was not going to allow her to close him out since i cannot speak with mr duff i shall have to speak with his friends some of them may know something which can tell us why he went to st giles and whom he knew there hester went out silently i doubt it sylvestra said almost before evan had finished speaking then seemed to regret her haste not as having said something untrue but as tactically mistaken i mean at least i dont think so if they did surely they would have come forward by now arthur kynaston was here yesterday if he or his brother had known anything at all they would surely have told us if they realise the relevance evan said persuasively as if he had not thought she was being evasive where may i find them oh the kynastons live in lowndes square number seventeen thank you i dare say they can tell me of any other friends whose company they kept from time to time he made his tone casual who would know your husband in his leisure hours mrs duff i mean who else might frequent the same clubs or have the same hobbies or interests she said nothing staring at him with wide black eyes he tried to read in them what she was thinking and failed completely she was different from any woman he had seen before there was a composure to her a mystery which filled his mind even when he had thought he was concentrating on something else some utterly different aspect of the case he would never understand her until he knew a great deal more about leighton duff what manner of man he had been brave or cowardly kind or cruel honest or deceitful loving or cold had he had wit charm gentleness imagination had she loved him or had it been a marriage of convenience workable but without passion had there even been friendships in it or trust mrs duff i suppose dr wade and mr kynaston principally she replied there are many others of course i think he had interests in common with mr milton in his law partnership and mr hodge he spoke of a james wellingham once or twice and he wrote to a mr phillips quite regularly ill speak with them perhaps i may see the letters he had no idea what possible use they could be but he must try everything of course she seemed perfectly at ease with the idea if runcorn were right her lover did not lie in that direction he could not help thinking again of corriden wade he spent a profitless morning reading agreeable but essentially tedious correspondence from mr phillips largely on the subject of toxophily he left and went to the law office of cullingford duff and partners where he learned that leighton duff was a brilliant man in his chosen career and the driving force behind the success of the concern his rise from junior to effective leader had been almost without hindrance everyone spoke well of his ability and was concerned for the continued preeminence of the company in its field now he was no longer with them if there were envy or personal malice evan did not see it perhaps he was too easily persuaded possibly he lacked monks sharper harder mind but he saw in the replies of his associates nothing more sinister than respect for a colleague a decent observance for the etiquette of speaking no ill of the dead and a lively fear for their own future prosperity apparently they had not been socially acquainted and none of them claimed to know the widow he could catch them in no evasion let alone untruth he left feeling he had wasted his time all he had learned had confirmed his earlier picture of leighton duff as a clever hardworking and eminently almost boringly decent man the side of his character which took him to st giles for whatever reason was perfectly hidden from his partners in the law if they suspected anything they did not allow evan to see it but then if a gentleman took occasional release for his natural carnal appetites it was certainly not a matter to be displayed before the vulgar and the inquisitive and evan knew that in their minds the police would fall into both those categories it was after four oclock and already dusk with the lamp lighters hurrying to the last few before it was too late when evan arrived at the home of joel kynaston friend of leighton duff and headmaster i in of the excellent school at which rhys had obtained his education he did not live on the school premises but in a fine georgian house about a quarter of a mile away the door was opened by a rather short butler straightening to stand up to every fraction of his height yes sir he must be used to parents of pupils turning up at unexpected hours he showed no surprise at all except perhaps at evans comparative youth as he stepped into the light good afternoon my name is john evan i would very much appreciate speaking confidentially with mr kynaston it is in regard to the recent tragic death of mr leighton duff he did not give his rank or occupation indeed sir the butler said without expression i shall inquire if mr kynaston is at home if you will be so good as to wait it was the customary polite fiction kynaston would have expected someone to call it was surely inevitable he would be prepared in his mind if he had anything relevant he was willing to say he would have sought out evan himself he looked around the hallway where he had been left it was elegant a trifle cold in its lack of personal touches the umbrella stand held only sticks and umbrellas of one character one length such ornaments as there were were all of finely wrought brass possibly arabic beautiful but lacking the variety of objects collected by a family over a period of years even the pictures on the walls spoke of one taste either kynaston and his wife were remarkably alike in their choices or one persons character prevailed over the other but the man who came out of the double oak doors of the withdrawing room was not more than twentytwo or three he was handsome if a little undershot of jaw had fair hair which curled attractively and bold direct blue eyes im duke kynaston mr evan he said coolly stopping in the middle of the polished floor my father is not at home yet i am not sure when he will be naturally we wish to be of any assistance to the police that we can but i fear there is nothing we know about the matter would you not be better pursuing your enquiries in st giles that is where it happened is it not yes it is evan replied trying to sum up the young man make a judgement as to his nature he wondered how close he had been to rhys duff there was an arrogance in his face a hint of selfindulgence about the mouth which made it easy to imagine that if rhys had indeed gone whoring in st giles duke kynaston might well have been his companion had he been there that night at the dark edges of evans mind something he did not even want to allow into his conscious thought was the knowledge of monks case the rapes of povertystricken women amateur prostitutes but that had been in seven dials beyond aldwych was it just conceivable rhys and his companions had been responsible for that and had this time met their match a woman who had a brother or a husband who was not as drunken as they had supposed possibly even a vigilante group of their own that would explain the violence of the reprisal and leighton duff had feared as much and had followed his son and he had been the one who had paid the ultimate price dying to save his sons life little wonder rhys had nightmares and could not speak it would be a memory no man could live with he looked at the young duke kynastons rather supercilious face with the consciousness of youth strength and money so plain in it but there were no bruises even healed ones fading no cuts or scratches except one faint scar on his cheek it would have been no more than a nick of the razor such as any young man might make so what is it you imagine we can tell you duke said a little impatiently st giles is a large area evan began not very duke contradicted square mile or so so you know it evan said with a smile duke flushed i know of it mr evan that is not the same thing but his annoyance betrayed that he perceived it was then you will know that it is densely populated evan continued with people who are most unlikely to offer us any assistance there is a great deal of poverty there and crime it is not a natural place for gentlemen to go it is crowded dirty and dangerous so i have heard you have never been there never as you said it is not a place any gentleman would wish to be duke smiled more widely if i were to go searching cheap entertainment i would choose the haymarket i had imagined rhys would do the same but possibly i was wrong he has never been to the haymarket with you evan asked mildly for the first time duke hesitated i hardly think my pleasures are any of your concern mr evan but no i have not been with rhys to the haymarket or anywhere else for at least a year i have no idea what he was doing in st giles he stared back at evan with steady defiant eyes evan would like to have disbelieved him but he thought it was literally true even if there were an implicit lie embedded in it somewhere it was pointless to press him on the subject he was obviously not willing to offer anything and evan had no weapon with which to draw him against his will his only tactic was to bide his time and look as if he were content with it unfortunate evan said blandly it would have made our task shorter but no doubt we shall find those who do it will take more work more disruption to others and i dare say more investigation of private lives but there is no help for it duke looked at him narrowly evan was not sure if he imagined it but there seemed a flicker of unease if you want to wait in the morning room there may be a newspaper there or something duke said abruptly its that way he indicated the door to his left evans right i expect when papa comes home hell see you not that i imagine he can tell you anything either but he did teach rhys at school do you imagine rhys might have confided in him duke gave him a look of such incredible contempt no answer was necessary evan accepted the invitation and went to the cold and very uncomfortable morning room the fire had long since gone out and he was too chilly to sit he walked back and forth half looking at the books on the shelf noticing a number of classical titles tacitus sallust juvenal caesar cicero and pliny in the original latin translations of terence and plautus the poems of catullus and on the shelf above the travels of herodotus and thucydides history of the peloponnesian war they were hardly the reading a waiting guest would choose he wondered what manner of person usually sat here what he really wanted was to ask kynaston about sylvestra duff he wanted to know if she had a lover if she was the sort of woman to seize her own desires even at the expense of someone elses life had she the strength of will the courage the blind passionate selfishness but how did you say that to anyone how did you elicit it from them without their wish not by pacing the floor alone in a cold room thinking about it he wished he had monks skill he might have known he went to the fireplace and pulled the bell rope when the maid answered he asked if he could see mrs kynaston the maid promised to enquire he had no picture in his mind but still fidelis kynaston surprised him he would have said at a glance that she was plain she was certainly over forty nearer to fortyfive and yet he found himself drawn to her immediately there was a composure in her an inner certainty which was integrity good evening mr evan she came in and closed the door she had fair hair which was fading a little at the temples and she wore a dark grey dress of simple cut without ornament except for a very beautiful cameo brooch heightened by its solitary presence the physical resemblance to her son was plain and yet her personality was so utterly different she seemed nothing like him at all there was no antagonism in her eyes no contempt only amusement and patience good evening mrs kynaston he said quickly i am sorry to disturb you but i need your help if you are able to give it in endeavouring to learn what happened to rhys duff and his father i cannot question him as you may know he cannot speak and is too ill to be distressed by having the subject even mentioned to him i dislike raising it with mrs duff more than i am obliged to and i think she is too deeply shocked at present to recall a great deal i am not sure what i know mr evan she answered with a frown the imagination answers why rhys may have gone to such an area young men do they frequently have more curiosity and appetite than either sense or good taste he was surprised at her candour and it must have shown in his expression she smiled a lopsided gesture because of the extra ordinariness of her face i have sons and i had brothers mr evan also my husband is the principal of a school for boys i should indeed have my eyes closed were i to be unaware of such things did you not find it difficult to believe that rhys would go there no he was an average young man with all the usual desires to flout convention as he thought his parents considered it and yet to do exactly what all young men have always done his father before him he asked her eyebrows rose probably if you are asking me if i know then the answer is that i do not there are many things a wise woman chooses not to know unless the knowledge is forced upon her and most men do not force it he hesitated was she referring to the use of prostitutes or something else as well there was a shadow in her eyes a darkness in her voice she had looked at the world clearly and seen much unpleasantness he was quite sure she had known pain and accepted it as inevitable her own no less than that of others could it be to do with her son duke might he have a great deal to do with the younger more impressionable rhyss behaviour he was the kind of youth others wanted to impress and to emulate but nevertheless you guess he said quietly that is not the same mr evan what you only guess you can always deny to yourself the element of uncertainty is enough but before you ask no i do not know what happened to rhys or to his father i can only assume rhys fell in with bad company and poor leighton was so concerned for him that in this instance he followed him perhaps in an attempt to persuade rhys to leave and in the ensuing fight leighton was killed and rhys injured it is tragic with a little more consideration less pride and stubbornness it need not have happened is this guess based on your knowledge of the character of mr duff she was still standing perhaps also too cold to sit yes you knew him quite well yes i did i have known mrs duff for years mr duff and my husband were close friends my husband is profoundly grieved at his death it has made him quite unwell he took a severe chill and i am sure the distress has hindered his recovery im sorry evan said automatically tell me something about mr duff it may help me to learn the truth she had an ability to stand in one place without looking awkward or moving her hands unnecessarily she was a woman of peculiar grace he was a very sober man of deep intelligence she answered thoughtfully he took his responsibilities to heart he knew a large number of people depended upon his skills and his hard work she made a small gesture of her hands not merely his family of course but also all those whose future lay in the prosperity of his company and you will understand he dealt with valuable properties and large amounts of money almost daily a flicker crossed her face and her eyes lightened as if a new thought had occurred to her i think that is one of the reasons joel my husband found him so easy to speak with they both understood the burden of responsibility for others of being trusted without question it is an extraordinary thing mr evan to have people place their confidence in you not only in your skills but in your honour and take it for granted that you will do for them all that they require yes he said slowly thinking that he too was on occasion treated with that kind of blind faith it was a remarkable compliment but it was also a burden when one realised the possibilities of failure she was still lost in her thoughts my husband is the final judge in so many issues she went on not looking at evan but at some inner memories of her own the decisions upon a boys academic education and perhaps even more his moral education can affect the rest of his life in fact i suppose when you speak of the boys who will one day lead our nation the politicians inventors writers and artists of the future then it may affect us all no wonder these decisions have to be made with care and with much searching of conscience and with absolute selflessness there can be no evasions into simplicity the cost of error may never be recovered did he have a sense of humour the words were out before evan realised how inappropriate they were i beg your pardon it was too late to withdraw did mr duff have a sense of humour he felt the blush creep up his face no she stared back at him in what seemed like a moments complete understanding too fragile for words then it was gone not that i saw but he loved music he played the pianoforte very well you know he liked good music especially beethoven and occasionally bach evan was forming no picture of him certainly nothing to explain what he was doing in st giles except following a wayward and disappointing son whose taste in pleasures he did not understand and perhaps whose appetites frightened him knowing the danger to which they could lead disease being not the least of them he would not ask this woman the questions whose answers he needed but he would ask joel kynaston he must it was another halfhour of largely meaningless but pleasant conversation before the butler came back to say that mr kynaston had returned and would see evan in his study evan thanked fidelis and followed where he was directed the study was obviously a room for use the fire blazed in a large hearth glinting on wrought brass shovel and tongs and gleaming on the fender evan was shivering with cold and the warmth enveloped him like a welcome blanket the walls were decorated with glassfronted bookcases and pictures of country domestic scenes the oak desk was massive and there were three piles of books and papers on it joel kynaston sat behind it looking at evan curiously it was impossible to tell his height but he gave the impression of being slight his face was keen nose a trifle pinched mouth highly individual it was not a countenance one would forget nor easily overlook his intelligence was inescapable as was his consciousness of authority come in mr evan he said with a slight nod he did not rise immediately establishing their relative status how may i be of service to you if i had known anything about poor leighton duffs death i should already have told you naturally although i have been ill with a fever and spent the last few days in my bed however today i am better and i cannot lie at home any longer im sorry for your illness sir evan responded thank you kynaston waved to the chair opposite do sit down now tell me what you think i can do to be of assistance evan accepted finding it less comfortable than it looked although he would have sat on boards to achieve the warmth he was obliged to sit upright rather than relax i believe you have known rhys duff since he was a boy sir he began making a statement rather than a question kynaston frowned very slightly drawing his brows together yes does it surprise you that he should be in an area like st giles kynaston drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly no i regret to say that it does not he was always wayward and lately his choice of company caused his father some concern why i mean for what specific reason kynaston stared at him several reactions flickered across his face he had highly expressive features they showed amazement disdain sadness and something else not so easily read a darker thing a sense of tragedy or perhaps evil what exactly do you mean mr evan was it the immorality of it evan expanded the fear of disease of scandal or disgrace of losing the favour of some respectable young lady or the knowledge that it might lead him to physical danger or greater depravity kynaston hesitated so long evan thought he was not going to answer when finally he did speak his voice was low very careful very precise and he held his strong bony hands in front of him clutched tightly together i should imagine all of those things mr evan a man is uniquely responsible for the character of his son there cannot be many experiences in human existence more harrowing than witnessing your own child the bearer of your name and your heritage your immortality treading a downward path into weakness corruption of the mind and of the body he looked at evans surprise his eyebrows rose not that i am suggesting rhys was depraved there was a predisposition to weakness in him which required greater discipline than perhaps he received that is all it is common among the young especially an only boy in a family leighton duff was concerned tragically it now appears that he had grave cause you believe mr duff followed rhys into st giles and they were both attacked as a result of something that happened because they were there dont you it seems a tragically apparent explanation you dont believe mr duff would have gone alone otherwise you knew him well i believe very well kynaston said decisively i am perfectly certain he would not why in heavens name should he he had everything to lose and nothing of any conceivable value to gain he smiled very slightly a fleeting bitter humour swallowed instantly in the reality of loss i hope you catch whoever is responsible sir but i have no sensible hope that you will if rhys had a liaison with some woman of the area or something worse his mouth twisted very slightly in distaste then i doubt you will discover it now those involved will hardly come forward and i imagine the denizens of that world will protect their own rather than ally with the forces of law what he said was true evan had to admit it he thanked him and rose to take his leave he would speak to dr corriden wade but he did not expect to learn much from him that would be of any value wade was tired at the end of a long and harrowing day when he allowed evan into his library there were dark shadows under his eyes and he walked across the room ahead of evan as if his back and legs hurt him of course i will tell you what i can sergeant he said turning and settling in one of the comfortable chairs by the embers of the fire and gesturing towards the other for evan but i fear it will not be anything you do not already know and i cannot permit you to question rhys duff he is in a very poor state of health and any distress which you cannot help but cause him could precipitate a crisis i cannot tell what injuries may have been caused to his inner organs by the treatment he received i understand evan replied quickly the memory returned to him with sharp pity of rhys lying in the alley of his own horror when he had realised he was still alive still capable of immeasurable pain nor could he ever rid his mind of the horror in rhyss eyes when he had regained his senses and first tried to speak and found he could not i had no intention of asking to see him i hoped you might tell me more about both rhys and his father it may help to learn what happened wade sighed presumably they were attacked robbed and beaten by thieves he said unhappily sadness and gravity equal in his face does it matter now why they went to st giles have you the least real hope of catching whoever it was or of proving anything i have little experience of st giles in particular but i spent several years in the navy i have seen some rough areas places where there is desperate poverty where disease and death are commonplace and a child is fortunate to reach its sixth birthday and more fortunate still to reach manhood few have an honest trade which earns them sufficient to live fewer still can read or write this is then a way of life violence is easy the first resort not the last he was looking at evan intently his dark eyes narrowed i would have thought you were familiar with such places also but perhaps you are too young were you born in the city sergeant no in the country wade smiled he had excellent teeth then perhaps you still have something to learn about the human battle for survival and how men turn upon each other when there is too little space too little food too little air and no hope or strength of belief to change it despair breeds rage mr evan and a desire to retaliate against a world in which there is no apparent justice it is to be expected i do expect it sir evan replied and i would have imagined a man of mr leighton duffs intelligence and experience of the world to have expected it also indeed to have foreseen it wade stared at him he looked extremely tired there was little colour in his face and his body slumped as though he had no strength left and his muscles hurt him i imagine he knew it as well as we do he said bleakly he must have gone in after rhys you have only seen rhys as he is now mr evan a victim of violence a man confused and in pain and extremely frightened he pushed out his lower lip he is not always so before this incident he was a young man of considerable bravado and appetite and with much of youths belief in its own superiority invincibility and insensitivity to the feelings of others he had the average capacity to be cruel and to enjoy a certain power his mouth tightened i make no judgements and god knows i would cure him of all of this if i could but it is not impossible he was involved with a woman of that area and exercised certain desires without regard to their consequences upon others she may have belonged to someone else he may even have been rougher than was acceptable perhaps she had family who he did not bother to finish it was unnecessary evan frowned searching his way through crowding possibilities dr wade are you saying that you have observed a streak of cruelty or violence in rhys duff before this incident wade hesitated no sergeant i am not he said finally i am saying that i knew leighton duff for close to twenty years and i cannot conceive of any reason why he should go to an area like st giles except to try to reason with his son and prevent him from committing some act of folly from which he could not extricate himself in the light of what has happened i can only believe that he was right did he speak to you of such fears dr wade you must know sergeant that i cannot answer you wades voice was grave and heavy but there was no anger in it i understand that it is your duty to ask you must understand that it is my duty to refuse to answer yes evan agreed with a sigh yes of course i do i do not think i need to trouble you further at least not tonight thank you for your time you are welcome sergeant evan stood up and went to the door sergeant he turned yes sir i think your case may be insoluble please try to consider mrs duffs feelings as much as you can do not pursue tragic and sordid details of her sons life which cannot help you and which she will have to live with as well as with her grief i cannot promise you that rhys will recover he may not do you mean his speech or his life both i see thank you for your kindness goodnight dr wade goodnight sergeant evan left with a deep grief inside him he went out into the dark street the fog had descended since he had gone inside and now he could barely see four or five yards in front of him the gas lamps were no more than blurs in the gloom before and behind him beyond that it was a dense wall the sound of traffic was muffled wheels almost silent hooves a dull sound on stone eaten by the fog as soon as they touched carriage lamps lurched towards him passed and disappeared he walked with his collar up and his hat pulled forward over his brow the air was wet and clung to his skin smelling of soot he thought of the people of st giles on a night like this the ones huddled together a dozen to a room cold and hungry and he thought of those outside in doorways without even shelter what had happened to rhys duff why had he thrown away everything he had warmth home love opportunity of achievement respect of his father to chase after some appetite which would end in destroying him he thought of his own youth of his mothers kitchen full of herbs and vegetables and the smell of baking there was always soup on the stove all winter long his sisters were noisy laughing quarrelling gossiping their pretty clothes were all over the place their dolls and later their books and letters paint brushes and embroidery he had sat for hours in his fathers study talking about all manner of things with him mostly ideas values old stories of love and adventure courage sacrifice and reward how would his father have explained this what meaning and hope could he find in it how could he equate it with the god he preached every sunday in the church amid its great trees and humble gravestones where the village had buried its dead for seven hundred years and laid flowers on quiet graves he felt no anger no bitterness only confusion the following morning he met shotts back in the alley in st giles and started over again in the search for witnesses evidence anything which would lead to the truth he could not disown the possibility that sylvestra duff had had some part in her husbands death it was an ugly thought but now it had entered his mind he saw more that upheld it at least sufficiently to warrant its investigation was it that knowledge which had horrified rhys so much he could not speak was it at the core of his apparent chill now towards his mother was that burden the one which tormented him and kept him silent who was the man was he implicated or merely the unknowing motive was it corriden wade and did rhys know that or was it as the doctor had implied rhyss own weakness which had taken him to st giles and his father in desperation for him had followed interrupted him and been killed for his trouble which led to the other dreadful question what hand had rhys in his fathers death a witness or more have you got those pictures he asked shotts what oh yeah shotts took out of his pocket two drawings one of rhys as close as the artist could estimate removing the present bruises the other of leighton duff necessarily poorer less accurate made from a portrait in the hall but they were sufficient to give a very lively impression of how each man must have appeared in life have you found nothing more evan pressed pedlars street traders or cabbies someone must have seen them shotts bit his lip nobody wants ter ave seen em he said candidly what about women evan went on if they were here for women someone must know them not for sure shotts argued quick fumble in an alley or a doorway oo cares about faces evan shivered it was bitterly cold and he felt it eating inside him as well as numbing his face his hands and his feet it was beginning to rain again and the broken eaves were dripping steadily the gutters overflowed would have thought women would be careful about familiarity in the street these days i hear there have been several bad rapes of dolly mops and amateur prostitutes lately he remarked yeah shotts said with a frown i card that too but its over seven dials way not ere who did you hear it from evan asked there was a moments silence what who did you hear it from evan repeated oh runnin patterer shotts said casually one of is stories i know some o them tales is alf nonsense but i reckoned as there was a grain o truth in it yes evan agreed unfortunately there is is that all you found yeah least about the father got a few likely visits o the son women oo think they adim but nones fer sure they dont take no notice o faces even if they see em ow many young men dyer suppose there are oo are tall a bit on the thin side an wi dark air not so many who come from ebury street to take their pleasures in st giles evan answered drily shotts did not say anything further together they trudged from one wretched bawdy house to another with the pictures asking questions pressing wheedling sometimes threatening evan learned a considerable respect for shotts skills he seemed to know instinctively how to treat each person in order to obtain the most cooperation from them he knew surprisingly many some with what looked like a quite genuine camaraderie a few jokes were exchanged he asked after children by name and was answered as if his concern were believed i hadnt realised you knew the area so well evan mentioned as they stopped and bought pies from a pedlar on the corner of a main thoroughfare they were hot and pungent with onions as long as he did not think too hard as to what the other contents might be they were most enjoyable they provided a little highly welcome warmth inside as the day became even colder and the fine rain turned to sleet me job shotts replied biting into the pasty and not looking at evan couldnt do it proper if i din know the streets an the people he seemed reluctant to talk about it possibly he was unused to praise and his modesty made him uncomfortable evan did not pursue it they continued on their fruitless quest everything was negative or uncertain no one recognised leighton duff they were adamant in that but half a dozen thought perhaps they had seen rhys then again perhaps not no one mentioned the violence in seven dials it could have been another world they also tried the regular street pedlars beggars the occasional pawnbroker or innkeeper two beggars had seen someone answering rhyss description on half a dozen occasions they thought possibly it was the running patterer a thin lightboned man with straggly black hair and wide blue eyes who gave the answer which most surprised and disturbed evan when he had been shown the pictures he was quite certain he had seen leighton duff once before on the very outskirts of st giles alone and apparently looking for someone but he had not spoken to him he had seen him talking to a woman he knew to be a prostitute he appeared to be asking her something and when she had denied it he had walked away and left her the patterer was certain of it he answered without a moments hesitation and looked for no reward he was also certain he had seen rhys on several occasions how do you know it was this man evan said doubtfully trying to keep a sense of victory at last from overtaking him not that it was much of a victory it was indication not proof of anything and even then only what he had assumed there must be lots of young men hanging around in the shadows in an area like this i saw im under the lights the patterer responded faces is me business least its part of it i member is eyes particlar not like most folks big black almost e looked lorst lost yeah like e werent sure wot e wanted nor which way ter go kind o miserable that cant be unusual around here e don belong around ere i knows most oo belongs ere don i mr shotts shotts looked startled yeah yeah i spose you would but you go seven dials way as well evan remembered what shotts had said about the patterer telling him of monks case have you seen him there too it was a remote chance but one he should not overlook me the patterer looked surprised his blue eyes staring at evan i don go ter seven dials this is me patch but you know what happens there he should not give up too easily and there was an uncertainty at the back of his mind sorry guy no idea yerd ave terask some o them wot works there try jimmy morrison e knows seven dials you dont know about violence in seven dials towards women the patterer gave a sharp derisive laugh wot yer mean diff rent from always yes dunno wot is it rape and beatings of factory women the patterers face wrinkled in disgust evan could not believe he had already known why had shotts lied it was a small thing very small but what was the point of it it was out of the character he knew of the man and disturbing you told me he knew he said as soon as they were a dozen yards away shotts did not look at him must a bin someone else he replied dismissively dont you write down who tells you what evan pressed it makes a lot of difference did you ever speak to him before on this case shotts turned into the wind and his answer was half lost course i did said so didnt i evan let the matter rest but he knew he had been lied to and it troubled him his instinct was to like shotts and to respect his abilities there was something he did not know the question was was it something important he saw monk that evening monk had left a note for him at the police station and he was happy to spend an hour or two over a good meal in a public house and indulge in a little conversation monk was in a dour mood his case was going badly but he had considerable sympathy for evan you think it could be the widow he asked his eyes level and curious the slight smile on his lips expressed his understanding of evans reluctance to accept such a thing he knew evan too well and his affection for him did not prevent his amusement and slight derision at his optimism in human nature i think it was probably just what it looked like evan replied gloomily rhys was a young man who had been indulged by his mother and whose father had great expectations of him which he possibly could not live up to and did not want to he indulged a selfish and possibly cruel streak in his character his father went after him to try to stop him perhaps to warn of the dangers and somehow they became involved in a fight with others the father died the son was severely injured physically and so horrified by what he saw that now he cannot even speak monk cut into the thick light suet crust of his steak and kidney pudding the question is he said with his mouth full were they both attacked by the denizens of st giles or did rhys kill his own father in a quarrel or did sylvestra duff have a lover and did he either do it himself or have someone else do it evan asked who is he samson monk raised his eyebrows what he took on two men at once killed one and left the other senseless and walked away from the scene himself monk pointed out then there was more than one evan argued he hired somebody two people and it was coincidence rhys was there he was following leighton duff and happened to come on him when he had found rhys or else rhys was in it with his mother monk swallowed and took a mouthful of his stout have you any way of looking into that he ignored evans expression of distaste hesters there shes nursing rhys evan replied he saw the emotion cross monks face the momentary flicker the light and then the shadow he knew something of what monk felt for her even though he did not understand the reasons for its complexity he had seen the trust between them hester had fought for monk when no one else would she had also quarrelled when at least to evan it made no sense at all but he knew the dark areas of monks heart prevented him from committing himself as evan would have halfmemories and fears of what he did not know made it impossible for him what he did not know was whether it was fear for hesterand the hurt he might cause her in that part of himself which lay secret or simply fear for himself and his own vulnerability if he allowed her to know him so well to become even more important to him and to understand it himself nothing in monks behaviour let him know he thought perhaps hester did not know either monk was halfway through his meal she wont tell you he said looking at his plate i know that evan replied im not placing her in the position of asking monk looked up at him quickly then down again made any advance in your case evan asked monks expression darkened the skin on his face tight with the anger inside him two or three men came into seven dials quite regularly usually a tuesday or thursday about ten in the evening up until two or three in the morning as far as i can tell they were not drunk nor did they go into any public houses or brothels no one seems to have seen their faces clearly one was of above average height the other two ordinary one a little heavier than the other ive found cabbies who have taken them back to portman square eaton square theyre miles apart evan exclaimed well a good distance i know monk snapped theyve also been taken to cardigan place belgrave square and wimpole street i am perfectly aware that they may live in three different areas or more likely very simply have changed cabs i dont need you to tell me the obvious what i need is for the police to care that over a dozen women have been beaten some of them badly injured and could have been dead for all these animals cared what i need is a little sense of outrage for the poor as well as the inhabitants of ebury street a little blind justice instead of justice that looks so damned carefully at the size and shape of your pockets and the cut of your coat before it decides whether to bother with you or not thats unfair evan replied staring back at him with equal anger we have only so much time so many men which you know as well as i do and even if we find them what good would it do whos going to prosecute them it will never get to court and you know that too he leaned forward elbows on the table what are you hoping for monk private vengeance youd better be dammed sure you are right i shall be monk said between his teeth i shall have the proof before i act and then what murder evan demanded you have no right to take the law into your own hands or to put it in the hands of men you know will take it for themselves the law belongs to all of us or we are none of us safe safe monk exploded tell that to the women in seven dials youre talking about theory im dealing with fact evan stood his ground if you find these men and tell whoever has hired you and they commit murder that will be fact enough so what is your alternative monk said i havent one evan admitted i dont know chapter six as he had told evan monk was having peripheral success in finding the men responsible for the rapes and violence in seven dials he was still not sure if there were generally three or only two no cabby could reliably describe three men at any one time everything that was said was imprecise vague little more than an impression hunched figures in the fog and cold of the winter night voices in the darkness orders given for a destination shadows moving in and out a sudden shift in weight in the cab one driver was almost certain that a third person had got out at an intersection where he had been obliged to stop because of the traffic another had said one of his fares had been limping badly one had been wet as though rolling in a gutter or fallen in a water butt one caught briefly in the coach light had had a bloody face there was nothing to prove any of them were the men monk was looking for on sunday when he knew he would find her at home he told vida hopgood as much seated in her red parlour before a very healthy fire and sipping dark brown tea with so strong a flavour he was glad of a sticky sweet bun to moderate it a little yer sayin yer beat she asked contemptuously but he heard the note of disappointment in her and saw the shadow cross her eyes she was angry but her shoulders sagged beneath the burden of hope lost no im not he responded sharply im telling you what i know so far i promised id do that if you remember yeah she agreed grudgingly but she was sitting up a little straighter she looked at him with narrowed eyes yer do believe they was raped dont yer yes i do he said without doubt not necessarily all by the same men but at least eight of them probably were and three of them i think may be provable mebbe she said guardedly wot uses mebbe wot about the others oo done them then i dont know and it doesnt matter if we prove two or three that will be enough wont it yeah yeah itll do fine she stared at him defying him to ask her what she planned to do about it he had not intended to ask he was angry enough not to care id like to speak to more women he took another sip of the bitter tea the flavour was appalling but it did have an invigorating effect wot fer she was suspicious there are gaps in times weeks when i know of no one attacked is that true she thought for several minutes before she answered well no it int yer could try bella green dint wanna bringer inter it but if i ave ter then i will why not geez why the ell der yer care because er mans an ol soljer an itll cut im up sum mink terrible ter know as she bin beat an e couldnt elp er let alone that she goes aht ter earn wot e cant that way poor sod lorst is leg at the battle o the alma int good fer much now urt bad e were never bin the same since e come back he did not let his emotion show any others she offered him more tea and he declined any others he repeated yer could try maggie arkwright yer probly wont believe a word wot she says but that don mean it int true sometimes anyway why would she lie to me about that cos er geezers a thief professional like an shell never tell a rozzer the truth on principle she looked at him with wry humour an if yer thinks as yer can kid er yer int yer dafter n i took yer fer take me to them i int got time nor money ter waste yer doin anythin cept keepin bread in yer belly an yer pride her voice rose yer any damn use at all or yer gonna tell me in a monfs time that yer dunno oo done it any moren yer do now eh im going to find who did it he said without even a shadow of humour or agreeability if you wont pay then ill do it myself the information will be mine he looked at her with cold charity so she could not possibly mistake him oright she said at length her voice very low very quiet ill take yer ter bella anter maggie get up then don sit all day usin up me fire he did not bother to reply but rose and followed her out putting his coat back on as they went through the door into the street where it was nearly dark and the fog was thicker it caught in his throat damp cold and sour with the taste of soot and old smoke they walked in silence their footsteps without echo sound swallowed instantly it was a little after five oclock there were many other people on the streets some idling in doorways having lost heart in begging or seeing no prospects others still waited hopefully peddling matches bootlaces and similar odds and ends some went briskly about business legal or illegal pickpockets and cut purses loitered in the shadows and disappeared again softfooted monk knew better than to carry anything of value as he followed vida hopgood along the narrow alleys staying close to the walls memory hovered at the edge of his mind fleeting impressions of having been somewhere worse than this of urgent danger and violence he passed a window half filled with straw and paper ridiculous as a barrier against the cold he turned as if thinking he knew what he would see but it was only a blur of yellow faces in the candlelight a bearded man a fat woman and others equally meaningless to him who had he expected his only feeling was of danger and that he must hurry others were depending upon him he thought of narrow passages crawling on hands and knees through tunnels and the knowledge all the time that he could fall head first into the abyss of the sewers below and drown it was a favourite trick of the thieves and forgers who hid in the great festering tenements of the holy land seven or eight acres between st giles and st georges they would lead a pursuer along a deliberate track through alleys and up and down stairs there were trap doors to cellars leading one to another for hundreds of yards a man might emerge half a mile away or he might wait and stick a knife into his pursuers throat or open up a trap to a cesspool the police went there only armed and in numbers and even then rarely if a man disappeared into the rookeries he might not be seen again for a year it hid its own and trespassers went there at their peril how long ago had that been stunning joes public house had gone he knew that much he had passed the corner where it used to be at least he thought he knew it the holy land itself had certainly opened up the worst of the creaking tenements were gone collapsed and rebuilt the criminal strongholds had crumbled their power dissipated where had the memory come from and how far back was it ten years fifteen when he and runcorn had both been new and inexperienced they had fought there side by side guarding each others backs it had been a comradeship there had been trust when had it gone gradually a dozen a score of small issues a parting of the paths of choice or one sudden ugly incident he could not remember he followed vida hopgood across a small yard with a well in it under an archway and then across a surprisingly busy street and into another alley it was boneachingly cold the fog an icy shroud he racked his brain and there was nothing there at all only the present his anger with runcorn now his contempt for him and the knowledge that runcorn hated him that it was deep and bitter and that it governed him even when it was against his own interest his dignity and all that he wanted to be it was so passionate in him he could not control it it consumed his judgement ere wots the matter wivyer vidas voice cut across his thoughts dragging him back to seven dials and the rape of the sweatshop women nothing he said sharply is this bella greens course it is wot the ell dyer think were ere fer she banged on the rickety door and shouted bellas name it was several minutes before it was answered by a girl somewhere between twelve and fifteen her long hair was curling and knotted but her face was clean and she had nice teeth vida asked for bella green me mas busy the girl replied shell be back in a wile you wanna wait yeah vida was not going to be put off even had monk allowed it but they were not permitted in the child had obviously been warned about strangers she slammed the fragile door and monk and vida were left on the step in the cold the gin mill vida said immediately taking no offence shell a gorn ter get jimmy a bottle dulls the pain poor sod monk did not bother to enquire whether the pain was physical or the bleak despair of the mind the difference was academic the burden of living with it was the same vidas guess was right inside the noise and filth of the gin shop the sound of laughter the shards of broken glass and the women huddled together for warmth and the comfort of living flesh rather than the cold stones they found bella green she was coming towards them cradling a bottle in her arms holding it as if it were a child it was a few moments oblivion for her husband a man she must have seen answer his countrys call whole and full of courage and hope and received back again broken in body and fast sinking in mind as he looked at the long hopeless years ahead and daily pain beside her a woman wept and sank slowly to the floor in the maudlin selfpity of gin drunkenness bella saw vida hopgood and her tired face showed surprise and something that might have been embarrassment need ter see yer bella vida said ignoring the gin as if she had not seen it din wanner know yer busy wi yer own troubles but need yer elp me elp bella could not grasp it per wot vida turned and went out into the street stepping over a woman fallen on the cobbles insensible to the cold monk followed knowing the uselessness of trying to pick anyone up at least on the ground they could fall no further theyd be colder wetter but less bruised they walked quickly back to the door where monk and vida had knocked bella went straight in it was cold and the damp had seeped through the walls it smelled sour but there were two rooms which was more than some people had the second had a small black stove in it and it gave off a faint warmth sitting beside it was a man with one leg his empty trouser hung flat over the edge of his chair fastened up with a pin he was clean shaven his hair combed but his skin was so pale it seemed grey and there were dark shadows around his blue eyes monk was reminded of hester with a jolt so sharp it caught his breath how many men like this must she have known have nursed have seen them when they were carried in from the battlefield still stunned with horror and disbelief not yet understanding what had happened to them what lay ahead only wondering if they would survive hanging on to life with the grim brave desperation that had brought them so far she had helped them during the worst days and nights she had dressed the appalling wounds encouraged them bullied them into fighting back into hanging on when there seemed no point no hope as she had done to him at the end of the grey case he had wanted to give up then why waste energy and hope and pain on a battle you could not win it was exhausting futile it had not even dignity but she had refused to give up on him on the struggle perhaps she was used to going on enduring keeping up the work the sense of purpose the outward calm even when it seemed utterly useless how could exhausted men fight against absurd odds survive the pain and the loss support their fellows except if the women who nursed them showed the same courage and blind pointless faith or perhaps faith was never pointless maybe faith itself was the point or courage but he had not meant to think of hester he had promised himself he would not it left an emptiness inside him a sense of loss which pervaded everything else spoiling his concentration darkening his mood he needed his energy to think of details he was storing in his mind about the violence in seven dials these women had no help but that which vida hopgood could wring from him they deserved his best he must forget the man slumped in the chair waiting with desperation for the few hours release the gin would give him and concentrate on the woman perhaps it could even be done without him realising his wife had been raped monk could word it so it sounded like a simple assault there was a great difference between what one thought one knew privately never acknowledging directly and what one was forced to admit to hear spoken known by others where it could never after be forgotten how many men where there he asked quietly she knew what he was referring to the understanding and the fear were plain in her eyes three are you sure yeah first there was two then a third one came i dint see where from where was it the yard orff foundry lane what time about two near as i can remember her voice was very low never once did she look sideways at her husband perhaps she wanted to pretend he was not there that he did not know do you remember anything about them height build clothes smell voices she thought for several minutes before she replied monk began to feel a lift of hope perhaps that was foolish one o them smelled like sum mink odd she said slowly like gin ony it werent gin kind o sharper cleaner like tar creosote he guessed as much to keep her mind on it as in hope of defining it quickly nah cleaner n that i know tar an i know creosote werent paint nor nuffink anyway e werent a labourer cos is ands was all smooth smoother n mine a gentleman yeah vida gave an ugly snort expressive of her opinion anything else monk pressed fabric of clothes height build hair thick or thin whiskers no wiskers bellas face was white as she recalled her eyes dark and hollow she was speaking in little more than a whisper one o them was taller than the others one were thin one eavier the thin one were terrible angry like there were a rage eatin im up inside i reckon as mebbe e were one o them lunatics from down limeouse way wot eats them chinese drugs an goes mad opium doesnt make you violent like that monk replied they usually go off into dreams of oblivion lying on beds in rooms full of smoke not wandering around alleys he stopped just before using the word rape attacking people opiumeating is a very solitary pursuit in mind if not in body these men seemed to work together didnt they yeah yeah they did her face tightened with bitterness id o thought wot they did terme were sum mink a mand do by is self but they didnt nah proud otheirselves they was hervoice sank even lower one o them laughed ill remember that till the day i die i will laughed e did just afore e it me monk shivered and it was more than the cold of the room were they old men or young men he asked her i dunno mebbe young they was smooth no whiskers no she touched her own cheek nuffink rough young men out to savour first blood monk thought to himself tasting violence and intoxicated with the rush of power young men inadequate to make their mark in their own world finding the helpless where they could control everything inflict their will with no one to deny them humiliate instead of being humiliated was that what had happened to evans young man had he and one or two of his friends come to seven dials in search of excitement some thrill of power unavailable to them in their own world and then violence had for once met with superior resistance had his father followed him this time only to meet with the same punishment or had the fight been primarily between father and son it was possible but he had no proof at all if it was so then at least one of the perpetrators had met with a terrible vengeance already and vida hopgood need seek no more he thanked bella green and glanced across to see if it was worth speaking to her husband it was impossible to tell from his eyes if he had been listening he spoke to him anyway thank you for giving us your time good day to you the man opened his eyes with a sudden flash of clarity but he did not answer bella showed them out the child was nowhere to be seen possibly in the other room bella did not speak again either she hesitated as if to ask for hope but perhaps as if to thank him it was in her eyes a moments softness but she remained silent and they went out into the street and were swallowed instantly by the everthickening fog now yellow and sour with smoke catching in the throat settling as ice on the cobbles well vida demanded ill tell you when im ready monk retorted he wanted to stride out he was too angry to walk slowly to keep pace with her and too cold but he did not know where he was or where he was going he was forced against his will to wait for her the next house they went to was a trifle warmer they came out of the now freezing fog into a room where a potbellied stove smelled of stale soot but gave off quite a comforting heat maggie arkwright was plump and comfortable blackhaired ruddyskinned it was easy to understand that she might do very well at her parttime profession there was a good humour about her even a look of health which was attractive glancing around at the room with two soft chairs a table with all four of its original legs a stool and a wooden chest with three folded blankets monk wondered if they were bought with the proceeds of her trade then he remembered that vida had said her husband was a petty thief and realised that may be the source of their relative prosperity the man came in a moment after them his face was genial eyes lost in wrinkles of general goodwill but his head was close shaved in what monk knew was a terrier crop a prison haircut he had probably been out no more than a week or ten days presumably she kept the household going when he was accepting her majestys hospitality in millwall or the coldbath fields there was a burst of laughter from the next room an old womans high cackle and the giggling of children it was a sound of hilarity unguarded and carefree wot yer want maggie asked civilly but with eyes wary on monks face vida she knew but he had an air of authority about him she did not trust vida explained and bit by bit monk drew from maggie the story of the attack upon her it was one of the earliest and seemed to be far less vicious than those more recently the account was colourful and he thought very possibly embellished a trifle for his benefit it was of no practical value except that it told him of yet another victim one vida had not known of she told him where to find her but tomorrow not today today she would be drunk and no use to him at all she laughed as she said it a sound rich with mocking pleasure but little unkindness when monk found the woman she was at her stall selling all kinds of household goods pots dishes pails the occasional picture or ornament candlesticks here and there a jug or ewer some of them were of moderate value she was not young maybe in her late thirties or early forties it was hard to tell her bones were good as if she had been handsome in her youth but her skin was clouded by too much gin too little clean air or water and a lifetimes ingrained grime she looked at monk as a prospective customer mildly interested never giving up hope to lose interest was to lose money and to lose money was death are you sarah blaine he asked although she fitted maggies description and she was in the right place it was rarely a person allowed their place to be taken even for a day oo wants ter know she said carefully then her eyes widened and filled with unmistakable loathing a deep and bitter remembrance she drew in her breath and let it out in a hiss between her teeth geez oped id never see yer again yer bastard thought yer was dead eard yer was in fiftysix went out an shouted the ole o the grinnin rat tera free drink on it danced an sang songs we did danced on yer grave monk only yer wasnt in it wot appened devil dint want yer too much even fer is belly was yer monk was stunned she knew him it was impossible to deny and why not he had not changed he still had the same lean body the same hard steady eyes the high smooth bones in his face the same beautiful precise voice he had no idea who she was or what their relationship had been except what was obvious which was that she hated him more than simply because he was police but from some individual or personal cause i was injured he replied with the literal truth not killed yeah wot a shame she said laconically never mind better luck next time the brilliance of her eyes and the curl of her lip made her meaning obvious well none o this lot sot so naff orff int nuffink ere for yer an i int tellin yer nuffink abaht nobody he debated whether or not to tell her he was no longer with the police or if it would be useful for her to believe he was it lent him power a certain authority the loss of which still hurt him the only people i want to know about are the men who raped and beat you in stevens alley a couple of weeks ago he watched her face and was gratified to see the total amazement in it making it blank of all other expression for a moment i dunno wot yer talkin abaht she said at length her jaw set hard her eyes flat and still filled with hatred nobody never raped me yer wrong again damn sure oyer self yare come down ere in yer fancy kit like yer was lord muck flingin yer weight arahnd an yer knows nuffink he knew she was lying it was nothing he could define not a matter of intelligence but an instinct he was met with disbelief and contempt i overestimated you he said witheringly thought you had more loyalty to your own it was the one quality he was certain she would value he was right she flinched as if he had struck her yer not one o me own any moren them rats in that pile o dirt over there mebbe you should go an try one o them eh yer want loyalty ter yer own they might speak toyer if yer ask em pretty like she laughed loudly at her own joke but there was a brittle edge to it she was afraid of something and as he looked at her sitting huddled in her greyblack shawl shoulders hunched hair blowing across her face in the icy air the more the conviction hardened in him that it was him she feared why he posed no possible threat to her the answer had to lie in the past whatever it was that had brought them together before and which had made her rejoice when she had believed him dead he raised his eyebrows sarcastically you think so would they be able to describe the men who beat you and all the other women the poor devils that work in the sweatshop all day and then go out in the streets a few hours in the night to try to get a little extra to feed their children would they tell me how many there were if they were old or young what their voices were like which way they came from and which way they went after they beat fourteenyearold carrie barker and broke her younger sisters arm he had achieved his effect she looked hurt and surprised the pain in her was real for a moment her anger against him was forgotten and it was against these men the world of injustice which allowed such a thing the whole monstrosity of the fear and the misery she saw closing in on her and her kind and the certainty that there was no redress and no vengeance he was the only living thing within her immediate reach the only one to share the hurt so wad da you care yer bloody jackal filth thats all you are her voice was hoarse with bitterness and the knowledge of her own helplessness even to hurt him beyond a mere scratch to the skin nothing like the jagged wound which was killing her she hated him for it with all the passion of futility filth livin orff other folks sins if we dont sin you int worth nothin at all shovel the gutters you do clean out other folks middens thats all you are cant tell yer from the muck there was a gleam of satisfaction in her face at the simile it was not worth retaliating there is no need to be frightened of me im not after stolen candlesticks or teapots i int afraid oyer she spat fear sharp in her eyes hating him the more because she knew he saw it as certainly as he had before im not with the police he went on ignoring her interruptions tm working privately for vida hopgood shes paying me and she doesnt give a damn where your goods come from or go to she wants the rapes stopped and the beatings she stared at him trying to read truth in his face who beat you sarah i dunno yer eejut she said furiously if n i knew dont yer think id a got somebody ter cut is throat fer im the bastard it was only one man he said with surprise no it were two least i think so it were black as a witchs eart an i couldnt see nuffink ha should say black as a rozzers eart shount i ceptin oo knows if a rozzers got an eart mebbe we should get one an cut im open jus ter see like what if he does and its just as red as yours he asked she spat tell me what happened he persisted maybe it will help me to find these men an wot if yer do oo cares ooll do anyfin abaht it she said derisively wouldnt you if you knew who they were he asked it was enough she told him all she could remember drawn from her a piece at a time and he thought largely honestly it was of little use except that she also remembered the strange smell sharp alcoholic and yet unlike anything she could name he left walking into the wind turning over in his mind what she had said but against his will more and more preoccupied wondering what he had done in the past to earn the intensity of her hatred in the evening on impulse he decided to go and see hester he did not give himself a reason there was not any he had already decided to keep her from his mind while he was on this case there was nothing to say to her nothing to pursue or to discuss he knew where she was because evan had told him he had mentioned the name duff and ebury street it was not very difficult from there to find himself on the front step of the correct house he explained to the maid who answered the door that he was acquainted with miss latterly and would be obliged if he might visit with her if she could be spared for a few minutes the answer from mrs sylvestra duff was most gracious she was to be at home herself and if miss latterly cared to she might spend the entire evening away from ebury street she had worked extremely hard lately and would be most welcome to a complete respite and change of scene if she so desired monk thanked her with the feeling of something close to alarm it seemed mrs duff had read more into the relationship than was founded in fact he did not want to spend all evening with her he had nothing to say in fact now that he was here he was not sure he wanted to see her at all but to say so now would make him look absurd a complete coward it could be interpreted all sorts of ways none of them to his advantage she seemed ages in coming perhaps she had no desire to see him either why had she taken offence at something she had been very brittle lately she had made some waspish remarks about his conduct in the slander case especially his trip to the continent it was as if she were jealous of evelyn von seidlitz which was idiotic his temporary fascination with evelyn did not affect their friendship unless she forced it to he was pacing back and forth across the morning room while he waited nine steps one way nine steps back evelyn von seidlitz could never be the friend hester was she was beautiful certainly but she was also as shallow as a puddle innately selfish that was the kind of ugliness which touched the soul whereas hester with her angular shoulders and keen face eyes far too direct tongue too honest had no charm at all but a kind of beauty like a sweet wind off the sea or light breaking on an upland when you can see from horizon to horizon as it had in his youth on the great hills of northumberland it was in the blood and the bone and one never grew tired of it it healed the petty wounds and laid a clean hand on the heart gently there was a noise in the hall he swung round to face it just as she came through the door she was dressed in dark grey with a white lace collar she looked very smart very feminine as if she had made a special effort for the occasion he felt panic rise up inside him this was not a social call certainly the furthest thing from a romantic one what on earth had mrs duff told her i only came for a moment he said hastily i did not wish to interrupt you how are you the colour burned up her cheeks quite well thank you she said sarcastically and you tired chasing an exhausting and un hopeful case he answered it will be difficult to solve even harder to prove and i am not optimistic the law will prosecute it even should i succeed am i interrupting you she closed the door and leaned against the handle if you were i should not have come the maid is perfectly capable of carrying a message she might look less businesslike than usual but she had absolutely no feminine charm no other woman would have spoken to him like that you have no idea how to be gracious have you he criticised her eyes widened is that what you came for someone to be gracious to you i would hardly have come here would i she ignored him what would you like me to say that i am sure you know what you are doing and your skill will triumph in the end that a just cause is well fought win or lose her eyebrows rose the honour is in the battle not the victory im not a soldier i have seen too much of the cost of illplanned battles and the price of loss yes we all know you would have fought a better war than lord raglan he snapped if the war office had had the good sense to put you in charge instead if they had picked someone at random off the street they would have she rejoined then her face softened a little what is your battle i would rather tell you somewhere more comfortable and more private he replied would you like to dine if it was a surprise she hid it very well too well perhaps it was what she had expected it was not what he had intended to say but to retreat now would make it even worse it would draw attention to it and to his feelings about it he could not even pretend he thought she was busy mrs duff had told him she was not thank you she said with an aplomb he had not expected she seemed very cool about it she turned and opened the door leading the way out into the hall she asked the footman for her cloak and then together she and monk went outside to the bitter evening again dimmed by fog the streetlamps vague moons haloed by drifting ice the footpaths slippery it took just under ten minutes to find a hansom and climb into it he gave directions to an inn he knew quite well he would not take her to an expensive place in case she misunderstood his intent but to take her to a cheap one would find her thinking he could not afford better and possibly even offering to pay what is your battle she repeated when they were sitting side by side in the cold as the cab lurched forward then settled into a steadier pace it was miserably cold even inside there was very little to see just gloom broken by hazes of light sudden breaks in the mist when outlines were sharp a carriage lamp a horses head and forequarters the high black silhouette of a hansom driver and then the shroud of fog closed in again at first just women being cheated in seven dials he answered to begin with it was no more than using a prostitute and refusing to pay dont they have pimps and madams to help prevent that she asked he winced but then he should have expected her to know such things she had hardly been sheltered from many truths these were amateurs he explained mostly women who work in factories and sweatshops during the day and just need a little more now and again i see then they were raped now it has escalated until they are being beaten increasingly violently she said nothing he glanced sideways at her as they passed close to another carriage the light from the lamps caught her face he saw the pity and anger in it and suddenly his loneliness vanished all the times of resentment and irritation and selfprotectiveness telescoped into the causes they had shared and disappeared leaving only the understanding he went on to describe to her his efforts to elicit some facts about the men and from his questioning of the cabbies and street vendors in order to learn where they had come from they arrived at the hostelry where he planned to eat they alighted paid the driver and went in he was barely aware of the street or the noise and warmth once they were inside he ordered without realising he had done it for both of them and she made a very slight face but she did not interrupt except to ask for clarification as he omitted a point or was vague on an issue im going to find them he finished with hard relentless commitment whether vida hopgood pays me for it or not ill stop them and ill make damned sure everyone like them knows theyve paid the price whether its the justice of the law or of the streets he waited half expecting her to argue with him to preach the sanctity of keeping the civilised law of the descent into barbarism if it were abandoned whatever the cause or the provocation but she sat in thoughtful silence for several minutes before she replied the room around them swirled with the clatter of crockery the sound of voices and laughter the smells of food and ale and damp wool filled the air light glinted on glass and was reflected on faces white shirt fronts and the white of plates the young man im nursing was beaten nearly to death in st giles she said at last his father did die she looked across at him are you sure enough you can get the right man if you make a mistake there can be no undoing it the law will try them there will have to be proof weighed and measured and someone to speak in their defence if it is the streets then it will simply be execution are you prepared to be accuser defender and jury and to let the victims judge what if the alternative is freedom he asked not only freedom to enjoy all the pleasures and rewards of life without hindrance or answer ability for wrong but the freedom to go on committing it creating new victims on and on until someone is murdered maybe one of the young ones twelve or fourteen too weak to fight back at all he stared at her meeting her clear eyes i am involved i am the jury whatever i decide omission is a judgement as well to walk away to pass on the other side is as much a decision i know she agreed justice may be blindfolded but the law is not it sees when and whom it chooses because it is administered by those who see when and whom they choose she was still frowning he broached the subject which was hanging unspoken between them he knew it and he thought perhaps she did also with anyone else he would have let the moment pass it was too delicate and had all the possibilities of being too painful as well with hester to have thought it was almost the same as to have spoken it to her are you sure it cannot be your young man and his father or his friends tell me about him again she waited several moments before she replied at the next table an old man broke into a fit of coughing beyond him a woman laughed they could hear her but not see her it was a high braying sound the room was getting warmer all the time no im not sure she said so quietly he had to lean forward to hear her ignoring the last of his food evan is investigating the case i assume you know that he has not been able to find out what they were doing in st giles it is hardly likely to be anything admirable she hesitated unhappiness profound in her face i dont think i believe he would do such a thing not willingly not intentionally but you are not sure he said quickly her eyes searched his face longing to find some comfort there and failing no im not sure there is a cruelty in him which is very ugly to see i dont know why it seems directed largely at his mother im sorry without thinking he reached forward and put his hand over hers where it lay on the table he felt the slenderness of her bones a strong hand but so slight his own covered it it doesnt have to be anything to do with this she said slowly and he thought it was more to convince herself than him its just it could be because he cannot speak hes alone she looked at him with an intensity oblivious of the room around her or anything else hes utterly alone we dont know what happened to him and he cant tell us we guess we talk to each other we work at the possibilities and he cant even tell us where we are wrong where it is ludicrous or unjust i cant imagine being more helpless he was torn whether to say what was in his mind or not she looked so hurt so involved with the pain she saw but this was hester not a woman he needed to protect gentle and vulnerable used only to the feminine things of life she had already known the worst worse than he had your pity for him now does not alter what he may have done before he answered her she drew her hand away he felt vaguely hurt as if she had withdrawn something of herself she was so independent she did not need anyone she could give but she could not take i know she said quietly no you dont he was answering his own thoughts she did not know how arrogant she was how so much of her giving was a form of taking whereas if she had taken it would have been a gift yes i do she was angry now defensive i just dont think it was rhys i know him you dont and your judgement is clear of course he challenged sitting back in his chair you could not be biased just a trifle a couple passed by them the womans skirt brushing hesters chair thats a stupid remark her voice was sharp her face flushed youre saying that if you know something about a thing then you are biased and your judgement is no good whereas if you know nothing your mind is clear and so your judgement is fine if you know nothing your mind isnt clear its empty by that standard we could do away with juries simply ask someone whos never heard of the case and they will give you a perfect unbiased decision you dont think perhaps it could be a good idea to know something about the victims as well he said sarcastically or even the crimes or is all that irrelevant youvejust told me what the crimes are and the victims she pointed out her voice rising and yes in a way it is irrelevant in judging rhys the horror of a crime has nothing to do with whether a particular person is guilty or not that is elementary it only has to do with the punishment why are you pretending you dont know that and liking somebody or pitying them has nothing to do with guilt or innocence he responded his voice louder also why are you pretending youve forgotten that it doesnt matter how much you care hester you cant change what has already happened a man at the next table turned to look at them dont be so patronising she said furiously i know that dont you care any more that you find the truth are you so keen to take someone back to vida hopgood and prove you can do it that youll take anyone right or wrong he was hurt it was as if she had suddenly and without warning kicked him he was determined she should not know it ill find the truth comfortable or uncomfortable he said coldly if it is someone we can all be happy to dislike and rejoice in his punishment so much the easier his voice dropped the emotion tighter but if it is someone we like and pity and his punishment will tear us apart along with him that wont make me turn the other way and pretend it is not so if you think the world is divided into those who are good and those who are bad you are worse than a fool you are a moral imbecile refusing to grow up she stood up would you be so kind as to find me a hansom so i may return to ebury street if not i imagine i can find one for myself he rose also and bowed his head sarcastically remembering their meeting earlier i am delighted you enjoyed your dinner he replied cut tingly it was my pleasure she blushed with annoyance but he saw the flash of acknowledgement in her eyes they went out in silence into the now dense fog in the street it was bitterly cold the freezing air catching in the nose and throat the traffic was forced to a walk and it took him several minutes to find a hansom he climbed in and they sat side by side in rigid silence all the way back to ebury street she refused to speak and he had nothing he wanted to say to her there were hundreds of things in his mind but none of them he was prepared to share not now they parted with a simple exchange of goodnight and he rode on to grafton street cold angry and alone in the morning he returned yet again to seven dials and the pursuit of witnesses who may have seen anything to do with the attacks most particularly anyone who was a frequent visitor to the area he had already exhausted the cabbies and was now trying street pedlars beggars and vagrants his pockets were full of all the small change he could afford people often spoke more readily for some slight reward it was his own money not vidas the first three people he approached knew nothing the fourth was a seller of meat pies hot and savourysmelling but probably made mostly of offal and other castoffs he bought one and overpaid but without intention of eating it he held it in his hand while talking to the man there was a wind this morning the fog had lifted but it was intensely cold the cobbles were slippery with ice as he stood there the pie became more and more tempting and he was less inclined to consider what was in it seen or heard anything about two or three strangers roaming around at night he said casually gentlemen from up west yeah the pedlar replied without surprise they bin beatin the ell out o some o our women poor cows wy dyer wanna know eh int rozzers bus ness he looked at monk with steady dislike want em for sum mink else do yer no i want them for that isnt that enough for you the mans scorn was open yeah an yer gonna ave em up for it are yer don give me that muck since well did your sort give a toss wot appened ter the likes o us i know you yer evil bastard yer dont even care fer yer own never mind us poor sods monk looked at his eyes and could not deny the recognition in them he was not speaking of police in general this was personal should he ask capture some tangible fact of the past would it be the truth would it help would it tell him something he would rather not have known ugly incomplete and without explanation probably but perhaps imagination alone was worse what do you mean not even my own the instant he had said it he wished he had not the man gave a grunt of disgust a woman in a black shawl came past and bought two pies i seen yer shaft yer own the pedlar answered when she had gone left im angin out ter dry like a proper fool yer did monks stomach turned cold and a little fluttery it was what he had feared how do you know he argued saw is face an seen yours the pedlar sold another pie and fished for change for a threepenny piece e werent spec ting it caught improper poor sod how what did i do wots the matter wiv yer the man looked at him incredulously want the pleasure of it twice do yer i dunno jus know yer came ere tergether an yer done im someow e trusted yer an finished up in the muck i guess its is own fault e should a knowed better it were writ in yer face i wouldnt a trusted yer far as i can spit it was ugly and direct and it was probably the truth he would like to think the man lied find some way out of it but he knew there was no hope he felt cold inside in his stomach in his chest what about these men youve seen he asked his voice sounding hollow dont you want them stopped the mans face darkened course i do an well do it without your elp havent done a very good job so far monk pointed out im not with the police any more im working for vida hopgood in this anything i find out i tell her the mans disbelief was plain why plice threw yer out did they good guess that fella got the best oyer in the end he smiled showing yellow teeth so theres some justice arterall you dont know what happened between us monk said defensively you dont know what he did to me first it sounded childish even as he said it but it could not be taken back very little ever could the man smiled agin you i reckon as yer a firstclass swine but id back yer ter win agin anyone monk felt a shiver of apprehension and perhaps pride as well perverse hurting pride a salvage from the wreck of other things then help me to find these men you know what theyve done let vida hopgood learn who they are and stop them yeah right the mans face eased the anger melting i spose if anyone can find them its you i dunno much or id a done em myself have you seen them or anyone who could be them ow do i know i seen lots o geezers wot dont belong ere but usual yer knows wot theyre ere for reglar brothels or gamblin or ter ock sum mink as they darentock closer ter ome describe them monk demanded i dont care about the others tell me all you saw of these men where and when how many how dressed anything else you know the man thought carefully for a few moments before giving his answer his description established what monk had already heard regarding build and that there were three men on several occasions on others only two the one new fact he added was that he had seen them meet on the outskirts of seven dials as if they had arrived from different directions but he had only ever seen them leave together he could no longer avoid putting his theory to the test he would much rather not have because he was afraid it was true and he did not wish it to be hester was being foolish about it of course but he did not wish her to be hurt and she would be when she was forced to accept that rhys duff had been one of the rapists it took him all day moving from one grey and bitter street to another asking cajoling threatening but by dusk he had found not only others who had seen the men immediately after one of the attacks and only a mere fifty yards from the place they had been dishevelled staggering a little and one of them had been marked with blood as his face was caught for a moment in the glare of a passing hansoms carriage lights it was not what he wanted it was bringing him inevitably closer to a tragedy he was now almost certain would involve rhys duff but he still felt a kind of elation a surge inside him of the knowledge of power the taste of victory he was turning a corner into a wider street stepping off the narrow pavement avoiding the gutter when he remembered doing exactly the same before with the same surge of knowledge that he had won then it had been runcorn he did not know what about but there had been men who had told him something he needed to know and they had been afraid of him as they were now it was an unpleasant knowledge to look back on the guarded eyes the hatred in them and the defeat because he was stronger cleverer and they knew it but he could not remember it hurting them it was only now in retrospect that he doubted he had been wholly right he shivered and increased his pace there was no going back he had enough now to go to runcorn it should be a police matter that would protect vida hopgood forestall the mob justice hester was afraid of this way there would be a trial and proof he found a cab and gave the address of the police station runcorn would have to listen there was too much to ignore beatings runcorn said sceptic ally sitting back in his chair and staring up at monk sounds domestic you know better than to bring that to us most women withdraw the complaints anyway a man is entitled to hit his wife to chastise her within reason his lip curled in a mixture of irritation and amusement its not like you to waste your time on lost causes never saw you as a man to tilt at windmills he left the sentence hanging in the air a wealth of unspoken meaning in it you have changed had to come down a bit have you he tipped his chair back a trifle take on the cases of the poor and desperate victims of beating and rape are often desperate monk said with as much control of his temper as he was able but he heard the anger coming through his voice runcorn responded immediately it woke memories of a score of old quarrels they were replaying so many past scenes runcorns anxiety stubbornness provocation monks anger and contempt and quicker tongue for an instant for monk it was as if he were removed from himself a spectator seeing two men imprisoned in reenacting the same pointless tragedy over and over again i told you before runcorn said sitting forward banging the chair legs down leaning his elbows on his desk youll never prove some men got violent with a prostitute shes already sold herself monk you may not approve of it he wrinkled his long nose as if imitating monk although there had been no scorn in monks voice or in his mind you may find it an immoral and contemptible way to make a living but well never get rid of it it may offend your sensibilities but i assure you a great many men you might call gentlemen or might aspire to join with your social airs and graces a great many of them come to the haymarket and even to places like seven dials and make use of women they pay for the privilege monk opened his mouth to argue but runcorn ploughed on talking over him deliberately maybe you would like to think differently but its time you looked at some of your gentry as they really are he jabbed his finger at the desk they like to marry their wives for social nicety to wear on their arms when they dine and dance with their equals they like to have a cool and proper wife he kept on jabbing his finger his face sneering a virtuous woman who doesnt know anything about the pleasures of the flesh to be the mother of their children the guardian of all thats safe and good and uplifting and morally clean but when it comes to their appetites they want a woman who doesnt know them personally doesnt expect anything of them except payment for services rendered and who wont be horrified if they exhibit a few tastes that would disgust and terrify their gentle wives they want the freedom to be any damned thing they like and that can include a great deal you may not approve of monk monk leaned over the desk towards him his jaw tight spitting the words through his teeth if a man wants a wife he wont satisfy and cant enjoy thats his misfortune he retorted and his hypocrisy and hers but it is not a crime but if he joins with two of his friends and comes to seven dials and then rapes and beats the sweatshop women who practise a little prostitution on the side that is a crime i intend to stop it before it becomes murder as well runcorns face was dark with anger and surprise but this time it was monk who overrode him still leaning forward looking down on him runcorns earlier advantage of being seated while monk stood was now the opposite but he refused to move back they were less than two feet away from each other i thought you had the courage and the sense of your own duty to the law to have felt the same monk went on i expected you to ask for my information and be glad to take it what you think of me doesnt matter he snapped his fingers in the air with a sharp sound arent you man enough to forget it for as long as it takes to catch these men who rape and beat women and even girls for their pleasure as you put it or do you hate me enough to sacrifice your honour just to be able to deny me this have you really lost that much of yourself lost runcorns face was a dull purple and he leaned even closer i havent lost anything monk i have a job i have a home i have men who respect me some of them even like me which is more than you could ever say i havent lost any of that his eyes were brilliant accusing and triumphant but his voice was rising higher and there was a sharpness that betrayed old wounds between them which none of this could heal there was no ease on his face no peace with himself monk felt his own body rigid runcorn had struck home with his words and they both knew it is that your answer he said very quietly stepping back i tell you that women are being raped and beaten in the area in which you are responsible for the law and you reply by rehearsing old quarrels with me as a justification for looking the other way you may have the job the money for it and the liking of some of your juniors do you think you have any claim to their respect or anyones if they heard you say this i had forgotten why i despised you but you remind me you are a coward and you put your personal petty dislikes before honour he straightened up squaring his shoulders i shall go back and tell mrs hopgood that i told you i had evidence and wanted to share it with you but you were so intent on having your personal revenge on me you would not look at it it will get out runcorn dont imagine this is between you and me because it isnt our dislike for each other is petty and dishonourable these women are being injured maybe the next one will be killed and it will be our fault because we couldnt work together to stop these men runcorn rose to his feet his skin sweating white around the lips dont you dare tell me how to do my job and dont try coercing me with threats bring me one piece of evidence i can use in a court and ill arrest any man it points to so far youve told me nothing that means a thing and im not wasting men until i know theres a probable crime and some chance of prosecution one decent woman whos been raped monk one woman who will give evidence i can use who are you trying monk retaliated the man or the woman the rapist or the victim both runcorn said suddenly lowering his voice i have to deal with reality have you forgotten that or are you just pretending you have because that is easier gives you a high moral note but its hypocrisy and you know it monk did know it it infuriated him he hated it with all the passion of which he was capable there were times when he hated people almost all people for their willing blindness it was injustice burning callous selfrighteous injustice have you got anything monk runcorn asked this time quietly and seriously still standing monk told him everything he knew and how he knew it he told him the victims he had spoken to collating it all chronologically showing how the attacks had increased in violence each time the injuries worse and more viciously given he told runcorn how he had traced the men to specific hansom drivers times and places he gave him the most consistent physical descriptions all right runcorn said at last i agree crimes have been committed i dont doubt that i wish i could do something about it but set your outrage aside for long enough to let your brain think clearly monk you know the law when did you ever see a gentleman convicted of rape jurors are made up of property owners you cant be a juror if youre not they are all men obviously can you imagine any jury in the land convicting one of their own of raping a series of prostitutes from seven dials you would put the women through a terrible ordeal for nothing monk did not speak find out who they are if you can by all means runcorn went on and tell your client but if she provokes the local men into attacking those responsible even killing them then we will step in murders another thing well have to go on with it until we find them is that what you want runcorn was right it was choking to have to concede it ill find out who they are monk said almost under his breath and ill prove it not to vida hopgood or to you ill prove it to their own bloody society ill see them ruined and with that he turned on his heel and went out of the door it was dark and snowing outside but he barely noticed his rage was blazing too hotly for mere ice in the wind to temper it chapter seven rhys progressed only very slowly dr wade pronounced himself satisfied with the way in which his external wounds were healing he came out of rhyss room looking grave but not more concerned than when hester had shown him in as always he had chosen to see him alone bearing in mind the site of some of the injuries and a young mans natural modesty it was easy to understand hester was not as impersonal a nurse to him as she had been to the men in the hospitals of the crimea there were so many of them she had had no time to become a friend to any one except in brief moments of extremity with rhys she was far more than merely someone who attended to his needs they spent hours together she talked to him read to him sometimes they laughed she knew his family and his friends like arthur kynaston and now also his brother duke a young man she found less attractive satisfactory miss latterly wade said with a very slight smile he seems to be responding well although i do not wish to give false encouragement he is certainly not recovered yet you must still care for him with the greatest skill you possess his brows drew together and he looked at her intensely and i cannot impress upon you too strongly how important it is that he should not be disturbed or caused anxiety fear or other turbulence of spirit that can be avoided you must not permit that young policeman or any other to force him to attempt a recollection of what happened the night of his injury i hope you understand that i imagine you do i feel that you are very fully aware of his pain and would do anything even place yourself at risk to protect him he looked very slightly selfconscious a faint colour to his cheeks i have a high opinion of you miss latterly she felt a warmth inside her simple praise from a colleague for whom she had a supreme regard was sweeter than the greatest extravagance from someone who did not know precisely what it meant thank you dr wade she said quietly i shall endeavour not to give you cause ever to think otherwise he smiled suddenly as if for an instant he forgot the care and unhappiness which had brought them together i have no doubt of you he replied then bowed very slightly and walked past her and down the stairs to where sylvestra would be waiting for him in the withdrawing room early in the afternoon hester tried to spin out small domestic tasks getting smears out of rhyss nightshirt where one of his bandages had been pulled crooked and blood from the stillopen wound had seeped through mending a pillow case before the tiny tear became worse sorting the books in the bedroom into some specific order there was a knock on the door and when she answered it the maid informed her that a gentleman had called to see her and had been shown to the housekeepers sitting room who is he hesterasked with surprise her immediate thought was that it was monk then she realised how unlikely that was it had come to her mind only because some thought of him was so close under the surface of her consciousness it would be evan come to see if he could enlist her help in solving the mystery of rhyss injuries at least in learning something more about the family and the relationship between father and son it was absurd to feel this sudden sinking of disappointment she would not know what to say to monk anyway nor did she know what to say to evan her duty lay to the truth but she did not know if she wanted to learn it her professional loyalty and her emotions were towards rhys and she was employed by sylvestra that required of her some kind of honesty she thanked the maid and finished what she was doing then went downstairs and through the green baize door along the passage to the housekeepers sitting room she went in without knocking she stopped abruptly it was monk who stood in the middle of the floor slim and graceful in his perfectly cut coat he looked shorttempered and impatient she closed the door behind her how is your patient he asked his expression was one of interest was it politeness or did he have a reason to care or was it simply something to say dr wade tells me he is recovering fairly well but still far from healed she replied a trifle stiffly she was angry with herself for the elation she felt because it was him and not evan there was nothing to be pleased about it would only be another pointless quarrel havent you got an opinion of your own he raised his eyebrows he sounded critical of course i have she retorted do you think it is likely to be of more use to you than the doctors hardly so i imagined that is why i gave you the doctors he took a breath and then let it out quickly and he still does not speak no or communicate in any other way if you mean in words no he cannot hold a pen to write the bones in his hands are far from healed yet i assume from your persistence your interest is professional i dont know why do you imagine he witnessed your attackers in seven dials or that he knows who the assailants were he put his hands in his pockets and looked down at the floor then up at her his expression softened the guardedness slipped away from it i would like to think he had nothing to do with them whatever his eyes met hers steady and clear jolting her suddenly with memory of how well they knew each other what losses and victories they had shared are you sure that is so yes she said immediately then knew from his look and from her own inner honesty that it was not so no not absolutely she tried again i dont know what happened except that it was very dreadful so dreadful it has rendered him speechless is that genuine i mean to ask that truly he looked apologetic unwilling to hurt if you say it is so i will accept it she came further into the room standing closer to him the fire in the small carefully blacked grate burned briskly and there were two chairs near it but she ignored them and so did he yes she said with complete certainty this time if you had seen him in nightmare trying desperately to cry out you would know it as i do his face reflected his acceptance but there was a sadness in it also which frightened her it was a tenderness something she did not often see in him an unguarded emotion have you found evidence she asked her voice catching do you know something about it no his expression did not change but the suggestions are increasing what what suggestions im sorry hester i wish it were not so what suggestions her voice was rising a little higher it was mostly fear for rhys but also it was the gentleness in monks eyes it was too fragile to grasp too precious to break like a perfect reflection in water touch it and it shatters what have you learned that the three men who attacked these women were gentlemen well dressed arriving in cabs sometimes together sometimes separately leaving in a hansom nearly always together thats nothing to do with rhys she knew she was interrupting and that he would not have mentioned it had he no more than that she just found it impossible to hear him out the thought hurt so much she could see he knew that and that he hated doing it the warmth in his eyes she would hoard up like a memory of joy a sweet light in darkness one of them was tall and slender he went on the description fitted rhys they both knew it the other two were of average height one stockier the other rather thin he went on quietly the coals settled in the fire and neither of them noticed there were footsteps down the corridor outside but they passed without stopping monk had not seen arthur and duke kynaston but hester had glimpsed hastily hurrying in a dark street it could very well be them a coldness filled her she tried to shut it out but memory was vivid of the cruelty in rhyss eyes the sense of power as he had hurt sylvestra his smile afterwards his relish in it it had not happened only once a mistake an aberration he exulted in his power to hurt she had tried not to believe it but in monks presence it was impossible she could be furious with him she could despise elements in him she could disagree violently but she could not intentionally harm him and she could not lie to build that barrier between them would be unbearable like denying part of herself the protection must be emotional selfchosen not to divide them but merely to cover from a pain too real he moved towards her he was so close she could smell the damp wool of his coat where the rain had caught his collar im sorry he said quietly i cant turn aside because hes injured now or because he is your patient if he had been alone perhaps i could but there are the other two i cant believe arthur kynaston was involved she met his eyes i would have to see proof that could not be argued i would have to hear him admit it duke i do not know about it could have been rhys duke and someone else he pointed out then why is leighton duff dead and duke kynaston unhurt he put out a hand as if to touch her then let it fall because leighton duff guessed there was something profoundly wrong and he followed them and challenged his son he answered gravely a pucker between his brows the one with whom he was most concerned the one for whom he cared and rhys lost his temper perhaps high on whisky fuelled by guilt and fear and a belief in his own power the others ran off the result is what evan found two men who began a fight and couldnt stop it short of the death of one of them and the near mortal injury of the other she shook her head but it was to close out the vision to defend herself from it not because she could deny its possibility this time he did put his hands on her shoulders very gently not to hold her simply to touch she stared at the floor refusing to look up at him or perhaps some men of the area husbands or lovers of the last victim brothers or even friends caught up with them they had stopped running for too long and it was they who beat them both rhys cannot tell us even if he wanted to there was nothing to say the impulse was to deny it and that was pointless i dont know any way to find out she said defensively i know he smiled very slightly and if you did you wouldnt until you had to know for yourself you would have to prove him innocent and when you proved him guilty you would say nothing and i would know anyway she raised her eyes quickly no you wouldnt not if i chose to conceal it he hesitated then stepped back half a pace i would know he repeated why would you defend him for it i should take you to see these women beaten by poverty dirt ignorance and now beaten by three young gentlemen who are bored by their comfortable lives and want a little more dangerous entertainment something to make the heart beat a trifle faster and bring the blood to the head his voice was hard in his throat with outrage a deep and abiding hurt he felt for the injured some of them are no more than children at their age you were in the schoolroom wearing a pinafore and doing your sums and your most urgent distress was being forced to eat your rice pudding he was exaggerating and he knew it but it hardly mattered the essence was real you wouldnt defend that hester you couldnt you have more honour more imagination than that she turned away of course i do but you havent seen rhyss pain now judgement is fine when you only know one side it is much harder when you know the offender and like him feel his pain too he stood close behind her i was not concerned with ease only what was right sometimes we cannot have both i know some people dont understand that or accept it but you do you have always been able to face the truth no matter what it was you will do it this time there was certainty in his voice no doubt at all she was hester reliable strong virtuous hester no need to protect her from pain or danger no need even to worry about her she wanted to lash out angrily at him for taking her for granted she was exactly like anybody else inside any other woman she ached to be protected sometimes to be cherished and have ugliness and danger warded off by someone else not because they thought she could not bear it but because they did not wish her hurt but she could not possibly say that to him not to monk of all people to be worth anything at all it had to be offered freely it must be his wish even his need if she had been one of the fragile warm feminine women he so admired he would have done it instinctively what could she say she was so angry and confused and hurt words tumbled over each other in her mind and all of them were useless only betraying what she felt which was the last thing she wished him to know she could protect herself at least as much as that of course she said stiffly her voice thick in her throat there is little point in doing anything else is there she moved another step away from him her shoulders rigid as if she would flinch were he to touch her i imagine i shall endure whatever it is i shall have no alternative youre angry he said with a lift of surprise nonsense she snapped he was missing the point entirely it had nothing to do with rhys duff or who had beaten the women it was his assumption that she could be treated like another man that she could and should always look after herself she could but that was not the point either hester she had her back to him but he sounded patient and reasonable it was like vinegar on the wound hester im not choosing it to be rhys ill look for any other possibility as well i know you will now he was puzzled then what the devil more do you want of me i cannot alter what happened nor will i settle for less than the truth i cant save rhys from himself and i cant save his mother if that is what you want she swung round it isnt what i want and i dont expect anything of you heavens above ive known you long enough now to be precisely aware of what i shall get from you the words poured out of her and even as she heard them she wished she had kept silent not made herself so obvious and so vulnerable he would read her plainly now he would hardly be able to help it he was dumbfounded and annoyed his face showed the only too familiar marks of temper a veil came over his eyes the gentleness hidden then our conversation seems to be pointless he said grimly we understand each other perfectly and there is no more to be said he gave a little gesture rather less than a bow thank you for sparing your time good day he walked out leaving her miserable and equally angry later in the afternoon arthur kynaston called again this time accompanied by his elder brother duke hester saw them as they crossed the hall from the library to go upstairs good afternoon miss latterly arthur said cheerfully he glanced down at the book she was carrying is that one for rhys how is he duke was behind him a larger and stronger version of his brother heavier shouldered he had walked in with more grace something of a swagger his face was broader boned more traditionally handsome but perhaps less individual he had the same soft wavy hair with a touch of auburn in it he was now regarding hester with impatience it was not she they had come to see arthur turned round oh duke this is miss latterly who is looking after rhys good duke said abruptly well carry the book up for you he held out his hand for it it was rather more a demand than an offer hester felt an instant dislike for him if these were indeed the young men monk was looking for then he was responsible not only for the brutal attacks on the women but for the ruin of his brother and of rhys thank you mr kynaston she replied coldly making an immediate change of mind it is not for rhys i intend reading it myself he looked at it it is a history of the ottoman empire he said with a slight smile a most interesting people she observed last time i was in istanbul i found much of great beauty i should like to know more about it they were a generous people in many respects with a culture of great subtlety and complexity it was also cruel beyond her understanding but that was irrelevant just now duke looked taken aback it was not the reply he had expected but he regained his composure rapidly is there much call for domestic servants in istanbul i would have thought most people would have employed natives especially for fetching and carrying i imagine they do she answered him without looking at arthur i was too busy to think of such things i left my own ladys maid in london i did not think it was any place for her and it was quite unfair to ask her to go she smiled back at him i have always believed consideration for ones servants is the mark of the gentleman or lady as the case may be dont you agree you had a ladys maid he said incredulously whatever for if you ask your mother mr kynaston i am sure she will acquaint you with the duties of a ladys maid she answered tucking the book under her arm they are many and varied and i am sure you do not wish to keep mr duff waiting and before he could find a reply to that she smiled charmingly at arthur and went up the stairs ahead of them her temper still seething an hour later there was a knock on her door and when she opened it arthur kynaston was standing on the threshold im sorry he apologised he can be awfully rude theres no excuse for him may i come in and speak with you of course she could not have refused him anyway and however much against her will monk was right she would search for the truth hoping with every step that it would prove rhys innocent but compelled to know it anyway please come in thank you he glanced around in curiosity then blushed i wanted to ask you if rhys really is getting better and if his brows furrowed and his eyes darkened if hes going to speak again is he miss latterly instantly she wondered if it was fear she saw in him what was it rhys would say if he could speak was that why duke kynaston was here to see if rhys was any danger to him and perhaps to ensure that he was not should she leave them alone with him he could not even cry out he was utterly at their mercy no that was a hideous thought and nonsense if anything happened to him while they were there they would certainly be blamed for it there was no way they could explain or escape they must know that as surely as she did was duke alone with him now instinctively she turned towards the connecting door what is it arthur asked quickly oh she turned back to him forcing herself to smile was she virtually alone with a young man who had raped and beaten a dozen or more women and were there two more only the thickness of the door away she should be frightened not for them but of them for herself she collected her wits i wish i could give you more hope mr kynaston she must protect rhys but there is no sign at all i am so sorry he looked stricken as if she had destroyed a hope in him what happened to him he said shaking his head a little how was he hurt that he cant speak why cant dr wade do anything for him is it something broken it should heal then shouldnt it he looked as if he cared intensely she found it almost impossible to believe his wide stare concealed guilt it is not physical she answered with the truth before weighing if it was the wisest thing to do now she could not stop whatever he saw that night was so fearful it has affected his mind arthurs eyes brightened so he could regain his speech any day what should she say what was best for rhys arthur was watching her the anxiety clouding over his face again couldnt he he repeated it is possible she said cautiously but dont expect it yet it can take a long time its awful he shoved his hands deep in his pockets rhys used to be such fun you know he looked at her earnestly willing her to understand we did all kinds of things together he and i and duke some of the time rhys had a great sense of adventure he could be terribly brave and make us all laugh his face was full of distress can you think of anything worse than having hundreds of things to say and lying alone not able to say a single one of them thinking of something funny and not being able to share it whats the point of a joke if you cant tell it to anyone and watch their faces as they grasp it you cant share anything beautiful or awful or even ask for help or say you are hungry or scared rigid he shook his head a little how do you even know what he wants you might be giving him rice pudding when hes asking for bread and butter it is not as bad as that she said gently although in essence it was true he could not share his real pain or terror i can ask him questions and he can answer with a nod or a shake im getting quite good at guessing what he would like its hardly the same though is it he said with a sudden touch of bitterness will he ever be able to ride a horse again or race it will he dance or be able to play cards he used to be so quick with cards he could shuffle them faster than anyone else it made duke furious because he couldnt match it cant you do anything to help miss latterly its awful standing by like this and simply watching him i feel so useless you are not useless she assured him your visits are greatly encouraging friendship always helps his smile came and vanished in a moment then i suppose ill go back and talk to him a while thank you but he did not remain as long as usual and when hester went in to see rhys after arthur and duke had left she found him staring at the ceiling his eyes thoughtful his lips pursed in an expression of withdrawn unhappiness she had come to know well she could only guess what had disturbed him she did not want to ask it might only make it worse perhaps seeing duke kynaston less tactful than his brother had reminded him of the past when they had all been virile a little reckless thinking themselves capable of anything the other two still were rhys entertained them lying silently on a bed he could not even offer wit or interest or was it memory of an appalling secret they all shared he turned slowly to look at her his eyes were curious but cold defensive do you want to see duke kynaston again if he comes she asked if you had rather not i can have him turned away i can think of a reason he stared at her without giving any indication that he had heard you dont seem to like him as much as you do arthur this time his face filled with expression humour irritation impatience and then resignation he sat up an inch or two and took a deep breath his lips moved she leaned towards him only a little not enough to embarrass him if he failed he let out his breath and tried again his mouth formed the words but she could not read them his throat tightened his eyes were fixed desperately on her she placed her hand on his arm above the bandages tightening her fingers to grip him is it something about duke kynaston she asked him he hesitated only a moment then shook his head his eyes full of loneliness and confusion there was something he ached to tell her and the harder he tried the more his helplessness thwarted him she could not walk away she must guess she must take the risk in spite of what dr wade had said this frustration was hurting him as much is it to do with the night you were hurt very slowly he nodded as if now he were uncertain whether to go on or not do you know what happened she said very quietly his eyes filled with tears and he turned his head away from her pulling his arm roughly out of her grip should she ask him directly what would it do to him would forcing him to remember and answer to someone else shock him as violently as dr wade had warned her could she undo any of the harm to him if it did he was still turned away from her motionless she could no longer see his face to guess what he was feeling dr wade cared for him deeply but he was not a soft or cowardly man he had seen too much suffering for that faced danger and hardships himself he admired courage and that inner strength which survives her judgement of him answered her question she must obey his instructions in fact they had been quite unequivocal commands do you want to tell me about something she asked he turned back slowly his eyes were bright and hurt he shook his head you would just like to be able to talk he nodded would you like to be alone he shook his head shall i stay he nodded in the evening rhys was exhausted and slept very early hester sat by the fire opposite sylvestra there was no sound in the room but the rain beating on the windows the fire flickering in the hearth and the occasional settling of the coals sylvestra was embroidering her needle weaving in and out of the linen occasionally flashing silver as it caught the light hester was idle there was no mending to do and she had no one to whom she owed a letter nor was she in the mood to write lady callandra daviot the only person to who me she might have considered confiding her feelings was on a trip to spain and moving from place to place there was no address where she could be certain of catching her sylvestra looked up at her i think the rain is turning to snow again she said with a sigh rhys was planning to go to amsterdam in february he used to be very good at skating he had all the grace and courage one needs he was even better than his father of course he was taller i dont know if that makes any difference no neither do i hesteranswered quickly he may recover you know sylvestras face was wideeyed tense in the soft light from the gas lamps and the fire please do not be kind to me miss latterly i think perhaps i am ready to hear the truth a very faint smile touched her face and was gone i received a letter from amalia this morning she writes about such conditions in india it makes me feel very feeble to be sitting here before the fire with everything a person could need for their physical comfort and safety and still to imagine i have something to complain about you must have known many soldiers miss latterly yes and their wives yes i knew several she wondered why sylvestra asked amalia has told me something of the mutiny in india sylvestra went on of course that was three years ago now i know but it seems as if things will be changed for ever by it more and more white women are being sent over there to keep their husbands company amalia says that it is to keep the soldiers apart from the native indians so they can never trust and be taken unaware like that again do you suppose she is right i should think it very likely hester replied candidly she did not know a great deal about the circumstances of the indian mutiny it had occurred too close to the end of the war in the crimea when she was deeply concerned with the tragic death of both her parents with finding a means of supporting herself and accommodating to the dramatically different way of life afforded to her when she returned to england attempting to adapt to the life of a single woman rather past the best age for marriage not possessed of the sort of family connections to make her sought after nor the money to provide for herself or a handsome dowry and unfortunately not of great natural beauty or winning ways had made the task extremely difficult she was also not of a docile disposition she had read the fearful stories and heard accounts of starvation and massacre but she had not known anyone who had been affected personally it is hard to imagine such atrocity sylvestra said thoughtfully i am beginning to realise how very little i know it is disturbing she hesitated her hands idle the linen held up but quite still and yet there is something not unlike exhilaration in it also amalia wrote to me of the most extraordinary incident she shook her head her face troubled eyes far away it seems that the siege of cawnpore was particularly brutal the women and children were starved for three weeks then the survivors were taken to the river and placed upon boats where the native soldiers sepoys i believe they are called fell upon them those hundred and twentyfive or so who still survived even that were taken to a building known as the bibighvr and aft era further eighteen days were slaughtered by butchers brought in from the bazaar for the purpose hester did not interrupt it seems when the highland regiment relieved cawnpore they found the hackedup bodies and exacted a fearful revenge killing every one of the sepoys there what i wanted to mention was the tale amalia wrote me of one soldiers wife named bridget widdowson who during the siege was set to guard eleven mutineers because at that time there were no men available this she accomplished perfectly marching up and down in front of them all day terrifying them immobile and it was only when she was finally relieved by a regular soldier that they all escaped is that not remarkable indeed it is hesteragreed wholeheartedly she saw the wonder and the amazed admiration in sylvestras eyes there was something stirring in her which was going to find the loneliness of this house without her husband the restrictions of society widowhood and her enforced idleness as a kind of imprisonment rhyss dependency would only add to it in time but the heat and the endemic disease are things i should find very trying she said to counter it would you it was a genuine question not an idle remark why did you go out to the crimea miss latterly hester was startled oh forgive me sylvestra apologised immediately that was an intrusive question you may have had all manner of private reasons which are none of my concern i do beg your pardon hester knew what she was thinking she laughed outright it is not a broken affair of the heart i promise you i wanted the adventure the freedom to use such brains and talents as i have where i would be sufficiently needed that necessity would remove prejudices against womens initiative i imagine you succeeded there was vivid interest in sylvestras face hester smiled most assuredly my husband would have admired that sylvestra said with certainty he loved courage and the fire to be different inventive she looked rueful i sometimes wonder if he would have liked to have gone somewhere like india or perhaps africa amalias letters would thrill him but i had a feeling they also awoke a restlessness in him even a kind of envy he would have loved new frontiers the challenge of discovery the chance of great leadership he was an outstanding man miss latterly he had a most remarkable mind amalia gets her courage from him and constance too and rhys hester said quietly the shadow returned to sylvestras face yes rhys too he wanted so much for rhyt is it terrible of me to say that there is a kind of way in which i am glad he did not live to see this rhys so ill unable to speak and so so changed she shook her head a little it would have hurt him beyond bearing she stared down at her hands then i wish with all my heart that leighton could have lived longer and they could have grown closer together now it is too late rhys will never know his father as man to man never appreciate his qualities as i did hester thought of monks vision of what happened in the dark alley in st giles she hoped with an overwhelming fierceness that it was not true it was hideous for sylvestra it would be more than she could live through and keep her sanity you will have to tell him she said aloud there will be a great deal you can say to make his fathers true character and skills real to him he will need your company as he recovers and your encouragement do you think so sylvestra asked quickly hope and doubt in her eyes at the moment he seems to find even my presence distressing there is much anger inside him miss latterly do you understand it hester did not and it frightened her with its underlying cruelty she had seen that exultancy in the power to hurt a number of times and it chilled her even more than monks words i dare say it is only the frustration of not being able to speak she lied and of course the physical pain yes yes i suppose so sylvestra picked up her embroidery again and resumed stitching the maid came in and banked up the fire taking the coal bucket away with her to refill it the following evening fidelis kynaston called again as she had promised she would and sylvestra had urged hester to take another time away from ebury street and do as she pleased perhaps visit with friends she had accepted with pleasure most particularly because oliver rathbone had again invited her to dine with him and to attend the theatre if she cared to normally clothes were of less interest to her than to most women but this evening she wished she had a wardrobe full of gowns to choose from all selected for their ability to flatter to soften the line of shoulder and bosom to give colour and light to a complexion and depth to the eyes since she had already worn her best gown on the previous occasion she was reduced to wearing a dark green which was over three years old and really a great deal more severe than she would have chosen had she any other available to her still she must make the best of what she had and then think about it no more she dressed her hair softly it was straight and unwilling to fall into the prescribed coils and loops but it was thick and there was a nice sheen on it her skin had not sufficient colour but pinching it now would serve no purpose by the time she arrived at the theatre and in a hansom it would hardly matter and indeed when rathbone came for her and she was unintentionally a few minutes late thought of appearance lingered only a moment before it vanished in pleasure of seeing him and a quickening of her pulse as she recalled their last parting and the touch of his lips upon hers good evening oliver she said breathlessly as she almost tripped on the last stair and hurried across the hall to where he stood a few feet from a surprised butler he looked startlingly elegant to be calling for the paid nurse and quite obviously a gentleman he smiled back at her exchanged some pleasantries then escorted her out to the waiting hansom the evening was cold but quite dry and for once there was no fog and a clear view of a threequarter moon over the rooftops they rode in companionable conversation about totally trivial matters the weather political gossip a smattering of foreign news until they reached the theatre and alighted he had chosen a play of wit and good humour something for a social occasion rather than to challenge the mind or harrow the emotions they stepped inside and were instantly engulfed in a tide of colours and light and the hubbub of chatter as women swirled past huge skirts brushing one another faces eager to greet some old acquaintance or to pursue some new one it was the social life hester had been accustomed to before she went to the crimea when she was at home in her fathers house and it was everyones very natural assumption that she would meet an eligible young man and marry one hoped within a year or two at most that had only been six years ago but it seemed like a lifetime now it was alien and she had lost the skills good evening sir oliver a large lady bore down on them enthusiastically how charming to see you again i had quite feared we had lost the pleasure of your company you do know my sister mrs maybury dont you it was a statement not a question may i introduce you to her daughter my niece miss mariella maybury how do you do miss maybury rathbone bowed to the young woman with practised ease i am delighted to make your acquaintance i hope you will enjoy the play it is said to be most entertaining mrs trowbridge may i introduce to you miss hester latterly he offered no further explanation but put his hand on hesters elbow as if making some affirmation that she was not a mere acquaintance but a friend towards whom he felt a sense of pride and even closeness how do you do miss latterly mrs trowbridge said with illconcealed surprise her rather thin eyebrows rose as if she were about to add something further but she remained silent how do you do mrs trowbridge hesteranswered politely a little trickle of warmth bubbling inside her miss maybury mrs trowbridge fixed hester with a baleful eye have you known sir oliver long miss latterly she asked sweetly hester was about to reply truthfully but rathbone spoke first we have been acquainted for several years he said with an air of satisfaction but i feel we are better friends now than ever before sometimes i think the best affections grow slowly through shared beliefs and battles fought side by side dont you miss maybury looked lost mrs trowbridge caught her breath indeed she nodded especially family friendships are you a family friend miss latterly i know sir olivers father and i like him enormously hester answered again with the truth mrs trowbridge murmured something inaudible rathbone bowed and offered his arm to hester leading her away towards another group of people most of them men in their middle years and obviously welltodo he introduced hester to them one by one each time without explanation by the time they had taken their seats and the curtain had risen on the first act hesters mind was whirling she had seen the speculation in their eyes rathbone knew precisely what he was doing now she sat beside him in the box and could not help glancing away from the stage to watch what expression she could read in his face in the reflected lights he seemed at ease if anything a trifle amused a very slight smile touched his lips and the skin across his cheeks was perfectly smooth then she glanced down at his hands and saw they were constantly moving only slightly but as if he found himself unable to keep them still he was nervous about something she turned back to the stage her heart beating so she felt she could almost hear it she watched the actors and heard all their words but a moment later could not have recalled anything of it she thought of the first time she had come to the theatre with rathbone then she had said far more probably too much expressing her opinions on the things she felt most passionate about he had been courteous he always would be his own dignity would forbid anything else but she had been aware of the coolness in him always a certain distance as if he wanted to be sure his friends did not assume too much about his regard for her or that their relationship to each other was more than slight his conventionality deplored her outspokenness as if it admired her courage and fought in different ways for the same end but since then he had defended zorah rostova and nearly ruined his career he had learned in an acutely real way the boundaries of judgement and intolerance of his own profession and how quickly society could reverse its loyalties when certain borders were crossed compassion and belief did not excuse he had spoken from conviction and without weighing the results first suddenly he and hester were on the same side of the gulf which had separated them before was that what he was aware of and which at once alarmed and exhilarated him she turned to look at him again and found he was also looking at her she had remembered how dark his eyes were in spite of his fair brown hair but still she was startled at their warmth she smiled then swallowed and turned back to the stage she must pretend she was interested that at least she knew what was going on she had not the faintest idea she could not even have identified the hero or the villain presuming there was one when the interval came she found she was ridiculously selfconscious are you enjoying it he asked as he followed behind her up to the foyer where refreshments were served yes thank you she answered hoping he would not press her as to the plot and if i told you i have not been paying close attention to it that my mind was elsewhere could you tell me what i have missed he said gently so i may understand the second act she thought quickly she must concentrate on what he was saying not on what he might mean or might not she must not leap to conclusions and perhaps embarrass them both then she would never be able to resume their friendship it would be over even if neither of them acknowledged it and that would hurt she realised with surprise how very much it would hurt she looked at him with a smile quite a casual one but not so slight as to appear cool or studied have you a case which troubles you a new one would he retreat into that excuse or was it the truth anyway she had left the way open for him no he said quite directly i suppose in a sense it has to do with law but it was most certainly not the legal aspect of it which was on my mind this time she did not look at him the legal aspect of what of what concerns me he put his arm on her back to guide her through the throng of people and she felt the warmth of it ripple through her it was a safe feeling disturbingly comfortable why should comfort disturb her that was ridiculous because it would be so easy to get used to the gentleness the sweetness of it was overwhelmingly tempting it was like coming into sunlight and suddenly realising how chilled you had been hester yes perhaps this is not really the best place but before he could finish what he was about to say he was accosted by a large man with sweeping silver hair and an avuncular manner my goodness rathbone you are miles away man i swear i have seen you pass half a dozen acquaintances as if you were unaware of their existence do i credit that to your charming companion or a particularly challenging case you do seem to select the very devil of the lot of them rathbone blinked slightly it was something very few situations had ever caused him to do to my companion of course he replied without hesitation hester may i introduce mr justice charles miss hester latterly ah charles said with satisfaction now i recognise you maam you are the remarkable young lady who uncovered such damning evidence in the rostova case in the crimea werent you extraordinary how the world is changing not actually sure i care for it but no choice i suppose make the best of it eh at another time she would have challenged him as to what he meant did he disapprove of women having the opportunity to make such a contribution as florence nightingale had to their freedom their use of knowledge and authority and the power it gave them even if only temporarily such an attitude infuriated her it was antiquated blind rooted in privilege and ignorance it was worse than unjust it was dangerous it was precisely that sort of blinkered idiocy which had kept inadequate men in charge of the battles in the crimea and cost countless men their lives she drew in her breath to begin the assault then remembered rathbone standing so close to her he was actually touching her elbow and she let out her breath in a sigh it would embarrass him dreadfully even if in truth he half agreed with her i am afraid we are all in that situation sir she said sweetly there is a good deal i am quite certain i do not care for but i have not yet found a way of altering it not for want of seeking rathbone said drily when they had bidden mr justice charles good evening and moved a few yards away you were remarkably tactful to him i expected you to take him thoroughly to task for his oldfashioned views do you think it would have changed his mind one iota she asked looking at him with wide eyes no my dear i dont he said with a smile on the verge of laughter but that is the first time i have seen such a consideration halt you then perhaps the world really is changing she suggested please do not allow it to change too much he said with a gentleness that amazed her i appreciate the tact it has its place but i should not like you to become like everyone else i really care for you very much exactly as you are he put his hand on hers lightly even if at times it alarms me perhaps it is good to be disturbed now and again one can become complacent i have never thought of you as complacent yes you have but i assure you you would be wrong if you thought so now i have never been less comfortable or less certain of myself in my life suddenly she was not certain either confusion made her think of monk she liked rathbone immensely there was something in him which was uniquely valuable monk was elusive unyielding at times arbitrary and cold but she could not turn away from him she did not wish rathbone to say anything which would require an answer her heart was quieteragain she smiled and put up her hand to touch his cheek then let us forget yesterday and tomorrow and simply be certain that this evening is an island of friendship and a trust of which there is no doubt at all i have no idea what the play is about either but since the audience is laughing every few moments i expect it is just as witty as they say he took a deep breath and smiled back at her there was a look in his face of sudden ease he bent forward and took her hand where it rested against his cheek and put it to his lips i should enjoy that enormously when dr wade called the next day he was accompanied by his sister eglantyne who expressed the same concern for sylvestra as before coming to her with a kind of silent understanding which hester now appreciated more than on the previous occasion then it had seemed as if she were at a loss for what to say looking at her more closely it now appeared instead to be a knowledge that no words would serve any purpose they might end in belittling what was too large for everyday speech when they had gone together into the withdrawing room hester looked at corriden wade he was quite obviously tired and the strain was showing in the lines of weariness around his mouth and eyes there was no longer the same energy in his bearing can i help you at all dr wade she asked gravely surely there must be something i can do to lessen the burden upon you i imagine you have many other patients both in hospital and in their homes she searched his eyes when did you last take any thought for yourself he stared at her as if for a moment he was not sure what she meant dr wade he smiled and his face altered completely the dejection and anxiety vanished although nothing could mask the tiredness in him how generous of you miss latterly he said quietly i apologise for allowing my own feelings to be so obvious it is not a quality i intend or admire i admit this case does trouble me deeply as you have no doubt observed both my sister and i are very fond of the whole family a shadow of pain crossed his eyes and the surprise of it was naked to see i still find it hard to accept that leighton mr duff is dead i had known him for years we had shared a great deal that it should all end he took a deep breath like this is appalling rhys is much more than a patient to me i know he made a slight gesture with his hands i know a good doctor or a good nurse should not allow themselves to become personally involved with anyone they treat it can affect their judgement to offer the best care possible relatives can lend sympathy and grief moral support and love they look to us to provide the best professional treatment not emotion i know all this as well as anyone still i cannot help being moved by rhyss plight and i too she confessed i dont think anyone expects us not to care how could we dedicate our time to helping the sick and injured if we did not care he looked at her closely for several moments you are a remarkable woman miss latterly and of course you are right i shall go up and see rhys perhaps you will keep the ladies company and yes she was now used to his pattern of seeing rhys alone and no longer questioned it please do not offer them too much encouragement i do not know if he is progressing as well as i had hoped his outer wounds are healing but he seems to have no energy no will to recover i detect very little returning strength and that disturbs me can you tell me if i have missed something miss latterly no no i wish i could but i also have wished he would develop more desire to sit up longer even get into a chair for a while he is still very weak and not able to take as much food as i had expected he sighed perhaps we hope too much but guard your words miss latterly or we may unintentionally cause even more pain and with an inclination of his head he went up the stair past her and disappeared across the landing hester went to the withdrawing room and knocked on the door she had a fear of interrupting a moment that could be confidential however she was invited in immediately and with apparently genuine pleasure do come in miss latterly eglantyne said warmly mrs duff was telling me about amalias letters from india it sounds extraordinarily beautiful in spite of the heat and the disease sometimes i regret there is so much of the world i shall never see of course my brother has travelled a great deal he was a naval surgeon wasnt he hester sat in the chair offered her he mentioned something of it to me eglantynes face showed little expression it was plain it did not excite in her the imagination of danger personal courage desperate conditions and the knowledge of suffering that it did in hester but then how could it eglantyne wade had probably never witnessed anything more violent or distressing than a minor carriage accident the odd broken bone or cut hand her grief would be what boredom a sense of life passing by without touching her of being very little real use to anyone almost certainly a loneliness perhaps a broken romance a love known and lost or merely dreamed of she was pretty in fact very pretty and it seemed she was also kind but that was not enough to understand a man like corriden wade eglantyne avoided hesters eyes yes he does speak of it occasionally he believes very strongly in the power of the navy and the life at sea to build character he says it is natures way of refining the race at least i think that is what he said she seemed uninterested there was no life in her voice no lift of understanding or care sylvestra looked at her quickly as if sensing some emotion perhaps loneliness beyond her words would you like to travel hesterasked to fill the silence sometimes i think so eglantyne answered slowly recalling herself to the polite necessities of conversation i am not sure where fidelis mrs kynaston speaks of it sometimes but of course it was only a dream still it is pleasant to read is it not i dare say you read a great deal to rhys the conversation continued for nearly an hour touching on a dozen things exploring none of them eventually corriden wade returned looking very grave his face deeply lined as if he were close to exhaustion he closed the door behind him and walked across to stand in front of them silently eglantyne reached out and took sylvestras hand and sylvestra clung to it until her knuckles shone white with the pressure i am sorry my dear he said quietly i have to warn you that rhys is not progressing as well as i would like as no doubt miss latterly will have told you his outer wounds are healing well there is no suppuration and certainly no threat of gangrene but internally we cannot tell sometimes there is damage to organs that we have no way of knowing there is nothing i can do for him except prescribe sedatives to give him as much rest as possible bland food that will not cause him pain and yet will be nourishing and easy to digest sylvestra stared up at him her face stricken we must wait and hope eglantyne said gently looking from sylvestra to her brother and back again at least he is no worse and that in itself is something to be thankful for sylvestra attempted to smile and failed why does he not speak she pleaded you said he had not sustained any injury to make him dumb what is wrong with him corriden why has he changed so terribly he hesitated he glanced at his sister then drew in his breath as if to answer but remained silent why sylvestra demanded her voice rising i dont know he said helplessly i dont know and my dear you must brace yourself for the fact that we may never know perhaps he will only recover if he can forget it entirely begin life again from now onward and possibly in time that may happen he turned to hester his eyes wide in question she could not answer they were all staring at her waiting for her to offer some kind of hope she longed to be able to and yet if she did and it proved false how much harder would it be then or was getting through tonight and tomorrow all that mattered at this moment a step at a time dont attempt the entire journey in one leap of thought it will be enough to cripple you that may well be the case she agreed aloud time and forgetting may heal his spirit and his body will follow sylvestra relaxed a little blinking back tears surprisingly even corriden wade seemed to be pleased with her answer yes yes he nodded slightly i think you are very wise miss latterly and of course you have experience with men fearfully injured and who must have seen most terrible sights we will do all we can to help him forget hester rose to her feet i must go up and see if there is anything i can do for him now please excuse me they murmured assent and she left the room wishing them goodbye and hurried across the hall and up the stairs she found rhys lying hunched up in the bed the sheets tangled a bowl of bloodstained bandages left by the door half covered with a cloth he was shivering although the blankets were up around his chest and the fire was burning briskly shall i change your bed she began he glared at her with blazing eyes of such rage she stopped in midsentence he looked so savage she thought he might even attempt to strike at her if she came close enough and he would damage his broken hands again what had happened had dr wade told him how seriously ill he was had he suddenly realised there was a possibility he would not get better was this rage his way of concealing a pain he could not bear she had seen such rage before only too often or had dr wade examined him and been obliged to hurt him physically in order to look more carefully at his wounds did the fury in his eyes and the tear stains on his cheeks spring from unbearable pain and the humiliation of not having been able to live up to his ideal of courage how could she begin to help him perhaps fussing was the last thing he wanted at the moment maybe even a rumpled bed stale and uncomfortable sheets smeared with blood were better than the interference of somebody who could not share his pain if you want me knock the bell she said quietly looking to make sure it was still where his fingers could reach it it was not there she glanced around it was across on the tallboy dr wade had probably moved it because he had wished to use the bedside table for his instruments or the bowl she replaced it where it usually sat it doesnt matter what time it is she assured him ill come he stared at her he was still furious still imprisoned in silence his eyes brimmed over with tears and he turned away from her chapter eight monk walked briskly along brick lane head down under the wind which was clearing the last of the fog he must see vida hopgood again before he pursued the case any further she had the right to know of runcorns refusal to involve the police in the case in spite of the mounting proof that there had been a series of crimes of increasing violence memory of their encounter still angered him the more so because part of his mind knew runcorn was right and in his place he might well have made the same decision he would not have done it out of indifference but a matter of priorities he had too few men as it was they only touched the surface of crime in areas like seven dials it was an easy excuse to ignore people like vida hopgood but it was also unfair to all the countless other victims to put men where they could make no effective difference thinking of it made him angrier still but it was better than thinking of hester which was so natural to him and at the same time so full of all kinds of discomfort it was the same kind of temptation as pulling a bandage off a wound to see if it had healed yet touching the place that hurt in the hope that this time it would not it always did and he did not learn by experience he turned the corner into butchers yard and was suddenly sheltered he almost slipped where there was ice on the cobbles he passed a man shouldering a heavy load covered in sacking probably a carcass it was quarter past four and the light was fading in late january the days were short he reached vida hopgoods door and knocked he expected her to be in he had found this a good time to call he looked forward to the warmth of her fire and if he were fortunate a hot cup of tea you again she said when she saw him still got a face like a pot lion so i spose yer int found nothin useful come on in then dont stand there lettin in the cold she retreated along the passageway leaving him to close the door and follow her he took his coat off and sat down uninvited before the fire in the parlour rubbing his hands together and leaning towards the grate to catch the warmth she sat opposite him her handsome face sharpeyed watchful did yer come ere ter warm yerself cos yer got no fire at ome or was there sum mink in particular he was used to her manner i put all we have before runcorn yesterday he agrees there is plenty of proof of crime but says he wont put police onto it because no court would prosecute let alone convict he watched her face for the contempt and the hurt he expected to see she looked at him equally carefully judging his temper there was a gleam in her eyes a mixture of anger humour and cunning i wondered well yer was gonna say that dyer wanna give it up then that wot yer mean cometer it straight no if that was what i meant id have said it i thought you knew me better she smiled with a moment of real amusement yer a bastard monk but there are times well if yer wasnt a rozzer or i could ferget it which i cant as i could almost fancy yer he laughed i wouldnt dare he said lightly you might suddenly remember and then where would i be in bed wi a shiv in yer back she said laconically but there was still a warmth in her eyes as if the whole idea had an element which pleased her then the ease died away so wot yer gonna do about these poor cows wot bin raped then if yer int givin up wots left eh you gonna find them bastards fer us im going to find them he said carefully giving due weight to every word what i tell you depends upon what you are going to do about it her face darkened listen monk no you listen he cut across her i have no intention of ending up giving evidence at your trial for murder or of being in the dock beside you as accessory before the fact no jury in london is going to believe i didnt know what you would do with the knowledge once i found it for you there was confusion in her face for a moment then contempt ill see yer int caught up in it she said witheringly yer dont need ter run scared o that jus tell us oo they are well take care o the rest wont even tell anyone ow we found em they already know he ignored the sarcasm the reasoning and the excuses ill tell em yer failed she said with a grin we found em ourselves wont do yer reputation no good but itll keep yer from the rope seein as thats wot yer after in it stop playing vida when i know who they are well come to some agreement as to what we do about it and well do it my way or ill not tell you got money ave yer she said with raised eyebrows can afford ter work fer no pay all of a sudden int wot i card its not your concern vida he saw from her face she did not believe him maybe i have a rich woman wholl see i dont go hungry or homeless it was true callandra daviot would help him as she had from the beginning although it was far from in the sense vida would take from his words her eyes opened wide in amazement then she began to laugh a rich fullthroated surge of merriment you she chortled yer got yerself a rich woman ter keep yer thats priceless that is i never card any think so funny in all me life but she was watching him all the same and there was belief in her eyes so those are my conditions vida he said with a smile i intend to find out who they are then we bargain as to what we do about it and what i tell you rests on our agreement she pursed her lips and looked at him steadily in silence weighing up his strength of resolve his will his intelligence he looked back at her without wavering he did not know what she knew of him from the past but he had felt his reputation in seven dials keenly enough to be sure she would not judge him lightly oright she said at last i reckon as yer int gonna let the bastards orff or yer wouldnt care enough ter catch them whether i paid yer or not yer wants em fer sum mink near as much as i do she stood up and went over to a drawer in a small table and took out two guineas ere yare thats all until yer come up wi sum mink as we can use monk get on wif it jus cos some woman wi more moneyn sense fancies yer don mean i want yer clutterin up me best room alf the evenin but she smiled as she said it monk thanked her and left he walked slowly hands pushed hard into his pockets the deeper he looked into the case the more did it seem as if rhys duff could be guilty one thing he had noticed which he had not told vida hopgood was that from everything he had been able to establish there had been no attacks since the incident in which rhys had been injured they had begun slowly building up from small unpleasantnesses gradually escalating until they were assaults so violent as to threaten life then suddenly they had stopped altogether ten days before that had been the last of them he crossed an open square and went into the alley on the far side passing a man selling bootlaces and an old woman with a carpet bag why the ten days that was a larger space than between the other attacks what had kept them away for such a length of time was there a victim he had missed to fit in with the pattern there should have been at least two further afield rhys had been found in st giles had he and his friends moved territories perhaps fearing seven dials had become too dangerous for them that was an answer that fitted with what he knew so far but he must put it to the test he turned and began to walk west again until he came to a thoroughfare and caught a cab it was not very far he could have gone all the way on foot in half an hour but suddenly he was impatient he alighted just past the church of st giles itself and strode towards the first lighted hostelry he saw he went inside and sat down at one of the tables and after several minutes was served with a mug of stout noise surged all around him the press of bodies shouts laughter people swaying and shoving to get past calling out to one another greetings friendly abuse snippets of gossip and news little bits of business there were fencers of stolen goods here pickpockets forgers picking up a few likely customers card sharps and gamblers pimps he watched them all with a growing feeling of familiarity as if he had been here before or a score of places like it he remembered the way the lamp hung a trifle crookedly shedding an uneven light on the brass railing above the bar the line of hooks where customers hung their mugs dipped a little at the far end a small man with a withered arm looked at him and shook his head towards his companion and they both pulled up their collars and went outside into the cold a woman laughed overloudly and a man hiccuped a fairhaired man with a scots accent slid into the seat opposite monk weve no got anything here for ye mr monk tell me what it is yere after an ill pass the word but ye know id a great deal sooner ye did not sit in my house drinkin yer ale aye weve the odd thief in here but small folk no worth the bother o a man like yourself murder is worth my trouble jamie monk replied very quietly and so is rape and beating women if yere talking about those two men that were found in water lane none of us around here know who did that young policemans been all over asking and wasting his time poor devil and constable shotts who was born and bred around here should know better but why are you here his broad fair face was wary his crooked nose broken years ago and wide blue eyes gave him a comfortable look which belied his intelligence and whats it to do wi rape i dont know monk replied taking another drink of his stout have any women been raped around here in the last month or two i mean ordinary women women who work in the factories and sweatshops and maybe go on the streets now and then when things get a little tight why what do you care if they have poliss dont give a toss though i heard as youre not with the poliss any more a flicker of amusement crossed his face his lips curled as if he would laugh but he made no sound you heard truly monk replied he was certain he knew this man he had spoken his name without thinking jamie the rest of it escaped him but they know each other well too well to pretend it was an uneasy truce a natural enmity held at bay by a certain common interest and a thread very fragile of respect not unmixed with fear jamie macpherson was a brawler hottempered he carried a grudge and he despised cowardice or selfpity but he was loyal to his own and far too intelligent to strike out without a reason or to act against his own interests he was smiling now his eyes bright throw you out eh runcorn yer should o seen that coming man waited a long time to get his own back that one monk felt a shiver of cold run through him the man not only knew him he knew runcorn also and he knew more than monk did of what lay between them the chatter and laughter washed around him like a breaking sea leaving him is landed in his own silence not a part of them but separate alone they knew and he did not yes monk agreed not knowing what else to say he had lost control of the conversation and it was not what he had intended or was used to for the time being he added he must not let this man think he was no longer a force to fear or respect macphersons smile widened aye this is his patch hell no be happy if you take his case from him he isnt interested in it monk said quickly im after the rapists not the murderer are they no the same no i dont think so at least one is i think youre talking daft man macpherson said tartly ye know better than to take me for a fool be straight wi me an ill maybe help ye monk made up his mind on the spur a woman in seven dials hired me to find who was raping and beating factory women over there ive followed it for three weeks now and the more i learn the more i think it may be connected with your murder here yejust said it was no the same people macphersons blue eyes narrowed but he was still listening intently he may dislike monk but he did not despise his intelligence i think the young man who was beaten but lived may have been one of the rapists monk explained the man who died is his father aye we all ken that much who followed him having learned or guessed what he was doing and got caught in the fight and he was the one who got the worst of it macpherson pursed his lips what does the young man say nothing whatever he cant speak oh aye whys that then macpherson said sceptic ally shock but its true i know the nurse who is caring for him in spite of all he could do to prevent it the picture of hester was so vivid in his mind it was as though she were sitting beside him he knew she would hate what he was doing she would fight desperately to protect her patient but she would also understand why he could not leave the truth concealed if there were any way he could uncover it if it were not rhys she would want it known just as passionately macpherson was regarding him closely so what is it yere wanting from me there have been no attacks or rapes in seven dials since the murder monk explained or for some short time before i need to know if they moved to st giles not that i heard macpherson said his brow puckered but then thats a thing folk dont talk about easy yell have to work a little harder for that than just come in here and ask for it i know that but a little cooperation would cut down the time theres not much point in going to the brothels they werent professional prostitutes just women in need of a little extra now and then macpherson pushed out his lip his eyes hot and angry no protection he said aloud easy pickings if we knew who it was and they come back to st giles itll be their last trip theyll not go home again an thats a promise youll not be the first in the line monk said drily but we have to find them before we can do anything about it macpherson looked at him with a bleak smile showing his teeth i know you monk ye may be a hard bastard but yere far too fly to provoke a murder that can be traced back to ye yell no tell the likes o me what ye find monk smiled back at him although it was the last thing he felt like every other time he spoke macpherson was adding new darkness to monks knowledge of himself had he really been a man who had led others to believe he could countenance a murder any murder so long as it could not be traced to him could it conceivably be true i have no intention of allowing you or vida hopgood to contrive your own revenge for the attacks he said aloud icily if the law wont do it then there are other ways these men are not clerks or petty tradesmen with little to lose they are men of wealth and social position to ruin them would be far more effective it would be slower more painful and it would be perfectly legal macpherson stared at him let their own punish them monk went on drily they are very good at it indeed believe me they have refined it to an art macpherson pulled a face ye have no changed monk i should no have underestimated ye yere an evil devil i could no cross ye i tried to warn runcorn agin ye but he was too blind to see it id tell him now to watch his back for getting rid o ye from the force but it would no do any good yell bide your time and get him one way or another monk felt cold hard as he was macpherson thought monk harder more ruthless he felt runcorn the victim he did not have the whole story he did not know runcorns social ambitions his moral vacillation when a decision jeopardised his own career or how he trimmed and evaded in order to please those in power of any sort he did not know his smallmindedness the poverty of his imagination his sheer cowardice his meanness of spirit but then monk himself did not know the whole story either and the coldest thought of all which penetrated even into his bones was monk responsible for what runcorn had become was it something he had done in the past which had warped runcorns soul and made him what he was now he did not want to know but perhaps he had to imagination would torment him until he did for now perhaps it would be useful to allow macpherson to retain his image of monk as ruthless never forgetting a grudge who do i go to he said aloud who knows whats going on in st giles macpherson thought for a moment or two willie snaith for one he said finally and old bertha for another but theyll no speak to ye unless someone takes ye and vouches for ye so i assumed monk replied come with me me macpherson looked indignant walk out on my business and whos to care for this place if i go attendin to your affairs for ye monk took one of vidas guineas out of his pocket and put it on the table macpherson grunted ye are desperate he said drily why whats it to you if a few miserable women are raped or beaten dont tell me any of them mean something to you he watched monks face closely there must be more these bastards cross you somehow is that it or is it still to do with runcorn and the poliss trying to show them up are ye ive already told you monk said waspishly its not a police case yere right macpherson conceded it couldnt be not one for putting himself out on a limb runcorn always safe always careful not like you he laughed abruptly then rose to his feet all right then come on and ill take you to see willie monk followed immediately outside dressed again in heavy overcoats macpherson led the way deeper into st giles and the old area that had earlier in the century been known as the holy land he did not go by streets and alleys as evan had done but through passages sometimes no more than a yard wide the darkness was sometimes impenetrable it was wet underfoot there was a constant sound of dripping water from eaves and gutterings the rattle and scratch of rodent feet the creak of rotting timbers several times macpherson stopped and monk who could not see him continued moving and bumped into him eventually they emerged into a yard with a single yellow gas lamp and the light seemed brilliant by comparison the outlines of timber frames stood sharp and black brick and plaster work reflecting the glow the wet cobbles shone macpherson glanced behind him once to make sure monk was still there then went across and down a flight of stone steps into a cellar where one tallow candle smoked on a holder made of half an old bottle but it showed the entrance to a tunnel and macpherson went in without hesitation monk followed he had a sharp memory of stomachknotting skinprickling danger of sudden pain and then oblivion he knew what it was it came from the past he dreaded when he and runcorn had followed wanted men into areas just like this then there had been comradeship between them there had never been the slightest resentment on his part he knew that clearly and he had gone in head first without a seconds doubt that runcorn would be there to guard his back it had been the kind of trust that was built on experience time and time again of never being found wanting now he was following jamie macpherson he could not see him but he could recreate in his mind exactly his broad shoulders and slight swagger as he walked a little roll as if in his youth he had been at sea he had a pugilists agility and his fists were always ready he looked in his middlefifties his reddishfair hair receding how long ago had it been that he and runcorn had worked together here twenty years that would make monk in his twenties then young and keen perhaps too angry still from the injustice to the man who had been his friend and mentor too ambitious to gain the power for himself which would allow him to right the wrongs hester would have told him he was arrogant claiming for himself a position in judgement to which he had no right and no qualification he would never admit it to her but he winced now for the truth of it macphersons voice came out of the darkness ahead of him warning him of the step and an instant later he nearly fell over it they were climbing again and emerged into another cellar this time with a lighted door at the far side which led into a room and another macpherson banged sharply once then four times and it was opened by a man whose hair stood up in spikes on his head his face was full of humour and the hand he held up was missing the third finger well bless me if it int monk agin he said cheerfully thought yer was dead wot yer doin ere then looking into the rapes over in seven dials macpherson replied for him before monk could speak willie snaiths hazel eyes opened wide still looking at macpherson yer never tellin me the rozzers give a toss about that i don believe ya ya gorn sorft in the ead mac ya forgot oo this is ave ya hes no with the poliss any more macpherson explained coming further into the room and closing the door to the cellar behind them runcorn got his revenge it seems and had him drummed out hes on his own and id like to know for myself whos been doing this because its no one of us who live here its some fancy fellar from up west way so it is well if that dont beat the devil e wot lives longest sees most as they say so monks workin fer us in a fashion that id live ter see the day he gave a rich chortle of delight so wot you want from me then i dunno oo dun it or id a fixe dim me self i want to know if there were any beatings or rapes of factory women in the last three weeks monk replied immediately or in the two weeks before that either no snaith said slowly not as i card ow does that elp yer it doesnt monk answered him it was not what i was hoping you would say then he realised that was not true it would have indicated a solution but not the one he wanted he did not care about rhys duff himself but he knew how it would hurt hester that should not matter the truth was what counted if rhys duff was guilty then he was one of the most callous and brutal men monk had ever known of he was twisted to a depravity from which it would be unimaginable to redeem him and more immediate than that although he might recover in time there were his companions he was not guilty alone whoever had been with him was still at large presumably still bent on violence and cruelty even if the attack on rhys had temporarily frightened them it would not last such ingrained sadism did not vanish from the nature in one act however harsh the need to hurt would rise again and be satisfied again snaith was regarding him with growing interest yerve changed he observed nodding his head dunno as i like it mebbe i do edges a gorn yer int so ungry no more bloody nuisance yer was moren runcorn poor sod never ad yer nose fera lie e dint ed believe yer well youd smell the truth looks like yer lorst that though eh difficult truths take longer monk said tensely and we all change you shouldnt discount runcorn hes persistent too just weighs his priorities thats all snaith grinned eye ter the main chance that one i know that whereas you yer like a dog wi a bone never let go cut orff yer ead an yer teethd still be fast shut bleedin bastard yare still nobody crossed yer twice not even yer own you said that before monk snapped stung by his helplessness did i do anything to runcorn he didnt have coming he framed the question aggressively as if he knew the answer but his stomach knotted as he looked at snaiths face in the gaslight and waited for the answer it seemed an age in coming he could feel the seconds slip by and hear his own heart beating macpherson cleared his throat snaith stared back his round hazel eyes shadowed his face a trifle puckered monk knew before he spoke that his reply was the one he feared yeah i reckon so enemy in front of yers one thing be and yers another i don know wot yer dun ter im but it fair broke im an e werent spec ting it from yer learned me sum mink abaht yer never took yer light arter that yer an and bastard an thats the truth he took a breath but if yer want the swine wot done them women in seven dials ill elp yer ter that i int fussy oo i use go an ask wee minnie of bertha dunno nuthink find wee minnie an teller i sent yer she wont believe me monk said reasonably yeah she will cos lessn i tell yer wer ter finder yerll be wand ring around the rookeries for the rest oyer life thats the truth so it is macpherson agreed so tell me monk accepted snaith shook his head int yer never scared monk int it never entered yer ead as wed cut yer throat an drop yer in the midden jus for ol times sake monk grinned back several times and if you do there is nothing i can do now to stop you im too far into st giles to yell for help even supposing anyone would come but youre a businessman at least macpherson is you want what i want youll wait until ive got it before you do anything to me there are times when i could almost like yer snaith said surprised at himself one thing ill say for yer yer int never an ypocrite got that much on runcorn poor sod thank you monk said sarcastically wee minnie it was a tortuous hour and monk got lost three times before he finally slipped through an alley gateway across a brick yard and up the back steps into a series of rooms which finally ended in the airlessly hot parlour where wee minnie sat on a pile of cushions her wrinkled face in a toothless smile her gnarled hands clicking knitting needles of bone as she worked without looking at it on what appeared to be a sock so yer got ere she observed with a dry chuckle thought as yerd got lorst yer wanter know about rape do yer he should have known word would reach here before he did yes there was two bad they was so bad no one never said nothing i dont understand it was bad surely that was all the more reason to do something warn people stay together anything she shook her head her fingers never losing their rhythm yer gets beat yer tell people it int personal yer gets raped bad its different how do you know i know everything there was satisfaction in her voice then suddenly it hardened and her eyes became cruel yer get them bastards give em ter us an well draw an quarter em like they did in the old days me granfer told me abaht it yer string em up or by ells door we will can i speak to the women who were raped can yer wot she said incredulously can i speak to the women he repeated she swore under her breath i need to ask them about the men i have to be sure it was the same ones they might remember something a face a voice even a name the feel of fabric anything it were the same men she said with absolute certainty three of em one tall one eavier an one on the skinny side he tried to keep the sense of victory out of his voice what age were they age i dunno dont yer know i believe so when were these attacks wot before or after the murder in water lane she looked at him with her head a trifle to one side like a withered old sparrow afore o course int bin nuffink since wouldnt would there now no i think not that were im then wot got killed she said with satisfaction one of them he did not bother to correct her error i want the other two she grinned toothlessly you an a few others where did they happen exactly i need to know i need to speak to people who might have seen them coming or going people in the street traders beggars especially cabbies who might have brought them or taken them away afterwards wot fer she was genuinely puzzled it was plain in her face yer know oo it were dont yer i think so but i need to prove it wot fer she said again if yer think as the lawll take any notice yer daft an yer int daft not yer worst enemyd say that oyer other things mebbe do you want them caught he asked you imagine after what happened to one of them theyll come back to st giles for you to knife them and dump them on some midden itll be limehouse or the devils acre or bluegate fields next time if we want justice it will have to be in their territory and that means with better weapons than yours it means evidence proof not for the law which as you say doesnt care but for society which does abaht prostitutes getting raped or beat she said her voice cracking high with disbelief yerve lorst your wits monk its finally got toyer society ladies know their men use prostitutes minnie he explained patiently they dont like to think other people know it they certainly dont like to marry their daughters to young men who frequent places like st giles to pick up stray women who could have diseases and who practise violence against women extreme violence what society knows and what it acknowledges can be very difficult there are things which privately can be overlooked but publicly are never forgiven or forgotten he looked at her wrinkled face you have loyalties to your own you understand that you dont betray the tribe with someone else neither do they these young men have let the side down they will not be forgiven for that yer get em monk she said slowly and for the first time her fingers stopped moving on the needles yere a clever sod you are yer get em for us well not ferget yer where did they happen the two in st giles fishers walk the first one an ellicitts yard the second time jus arter midnight both times dates three nights afore the murder in water lane night afore christmas eve thank you minnie you have been a great help are you sure you wont give me the names it would help to talk to the victims themselves yeah im sure the following day he went to evan and aft era little persuasion obtained from him copies of the pictures of rhys duff and his father he looked at the faces with curiosity it was the first time he had seen them and they were neither as he had pictured them leighton duff had powerful features a strong broad nose clear eyes that were blue or grey from the light in them and the appearance of keen intelligence rhys was utterly different and it was his face which troubled him it was the face of a dreamer he should have been a poet or an explorer of ideas his eyes were dark under winged brows his nose good if a trifle long his mouth sensitive even vulnerable but it was only a drawing probably made after the incident and perhaps the artist had allowed his sense of pity to influence his hand monk put them in his pocket thanked evan and set out through a light drizzle towards st giles again in fishers walk he began asking street traders pedlars beggars anyone who would answer him if they recognised either of the two men it did not take long to find someone who identified rhys yeah he said scratching his finger at the side of his head and knocking his cap askew yeah i seen im angin around once or twice mebbe more tall eh nicelookin gent spoke proper like them up west dressed rough though down on is luck i reckon dressed rough monk said quickly what do you mean exactly was it rhys or only someone who looked a little like him well not like a gent the man replied looking at monk earnestly as if he doubted his intelligence i know wot gents look like overcoat e ad but nuthink special no fur on the collar no igh at no stick in fact no at at all co meter think on it but it was this man you are sure course im sure yer fink i dunno wot i sees or yer fink im a liar eh i think its important you are sure monk said carefully someones life might hang on it the man laughed uproariously his breath coming in gasps between rich rolling gurgles of merriment yer a caution you are i never card yer was a wit afore ony card yer was clever an never ter cross yer mean bastard but fair most o the time but one ter give a bloke enough rope ter ang is self an then watch wile e does it pull the trap fer im if ed done yer wrong monk felt the cold close in on him penetrating his skin i wasnt being funny he said in a voice that caught in his throat i meant depend on it not hang with a rope well if you aint gonna ang them bastards wot raped those women over in seven dials wot yer want em for ye gonna get em orff cos theyre gents that int like yer i never card from nobody even yer worst enemy as yer feared nor favoured no one not for nuffink at all well thats something i suppose im not going to hang them because i cant id be perfectly happy to he was not sure of that being true happy might not be the right word but he could certainly accede to it he knew hester would not but that was irrelevant well almost it were im the man said shivering a little as he grew colder standing still on the street corner i seen im ere three mebbe four times always at night alone or with others wif others twice once by is self who were the others describe them did you ever see him with women and what were they like ang on ang on once e were wif an older man cavy set dressed very smart like a gent e were real angry shouting at im who was shouting at whom monk interrupted they was shouting at each other o course monk produced the picture of leighton duff was this him or could it have been the man studied it for several moments then shook his head i dunno i don fink so wy oo is e that doesnt matter have you ever seen him the older man not as i knows of looks like a few as i seen and the other time who was the young man with then woman young mebbe sixteen or so they went together inter an alley dunno after that but i can guess thank you i dont suppose you know the name of the woman or where i can find her looked like fanny waterman terme but that dont mean it were monk could scarcely believe his good fortune he tried not to let his sense of victory show too much in his voice where can i find her black orse yard monk knew better than to try for a number he would have to go there and simply start asking he paid the man half a crown a magnificent reward he feared he would regret later and then set out for black horse yard it took him two hours to find fanny waterman and her answers left him totally puzzled she recognised rhys without hesitation yeah so wot when i dunno mebbe free or four times wots it toyer she was a slight skinny girl hardly handsome but she had a face which reflected intelligence and some humour behind the belligerence and in different circumstances she could well have had a kind of charm she was certainly fluent enough with words and there was a cockiness in her walk and the attitude of her head there was nothing of selfpity in her she seemed as curious about monk as he was about her wy dyer wanna know eh wots e done toyer if e broke the law i int shoppin im he didnt hurt you urt me wos matter wiv yer course e dint urt me wyd e urt me did he pay you wy yer wanna know she put her head on one side looking at him out of wide dark brown eyes like lookin at fellas do yer there was the beginning of contempt in her voice cost yer no i dont he said tartly a lot of women have been raped and beaten mostly in seven dials but some here im after whoever did it geez she said in awe well nobody urt me e paid proper an willin when was that please try to recall she thought for a moment was it before or after christmas he prompted new year it were between she said with sudden enlightenment then e came again arter new year wy cant yer tell me wy ye don think as it were im do yer what do you think never she tilted her head to one side were it onest when was the last time you saw him dunno i din see im for a couple o weeks afore them blokes was done in water lane rozzers all over the place arter that int good for business he took out the picture of leighton duff did you ever see this man she studied it no are you sure yeah i never seen im oo is e is e the bloke wot got beat ter death yes well i seed rhys thats is name wi other gents but this geezer werent one of em they was young like im one were real and some called is self king or prince or sum mink like that the other were arfur duke perhaps monk felt his pulse beating like a hammer this was it this was the three of them seen together and named yeah thats right were he a duke for real no its just short for marmaduke oh shame like ter fink as id ad a duke still never mind eh all the same wif their pants orff she laughed with genuine humour at the absurdity of pretension and they all paid you he pressed one more time nah that duke were a nasty piece o work ed a it me if id a pushed so i dint jus took wot i could did he hit you nah i knows well ter push me luck an well not ter did you see him the night of the murder nah none of them nah i see thank you he produced a shilling all the change he had left and gave it to her he continued in his search as he was already aware the word had spread whom he was seeking and why for once cooperation was less grudgingly given once or twice it was even volunteered he wanted one more piece if possible had there been a victim that night had leighton duff caught them before they had attacked or after was there any room at all for denial if they had been exultant intoxicated with the excitement of their victory dishevelled perhaps marked with blood then there was nothing else left to seek once evan knew where to look whom to question and had the force of law behind him and the crime of murder no more rape of women society chose to forget but a man who was at the heart and core of their own and the rest could be concerned proof enough for any court it took him another complete day but at last he found her a woman in her forties still pretty in spite of her tiredness and persistent cough her cheekbone was broken and she limped badly she was severely bruised yes they had raped her but she had not had the strength to fight and that in itself had seemed to anger them she was lucky they had been interrupted don tell anyone she begged ill lose me job he wished he could promise her that he said what he could they went on to commit murder within a few minutes of leaving you he said grimly you wont need to say you were raped you can swear you were walking along the street and they fell on you that will be good enough yeah she looked doubtful yes he said firmly where was it her voice was husky her face pale just orff water lane thank you that will be enough i promise it was sufficient he would have to take it to evan he could not conceal it any longer it was material evidence on the murder of leighton duff if rhys and his friends had been using prostitutes in st giles which was now unarguable and it had escalated in violence over the months then it seemed more than likely that leighton duff had found out and had followed him going to st giles just the once that was borne out by monks lack of ability to find anyone who had recognised him that was ample motive for the quarrel which had followed the battle which had gone so far it could only end in the death of the one person who knew the truth of what he had done his father whether arthur and marmaduke kynaston had been present or not what part they had played would have to be proved but monk must go to evan first he would tell hester she should not learn it when evan came to arrest rhys he hated having to tell her but it would be worse if he evaded the issue as the man in the street who had named fanny had said not even his worst enemies had accused him of cowardice it was late when he arrived at ebury street a pale moon glittered in a frosty sky and over towards the east the clouds obscured the faint light and promised more snow the butler opened the door and said he would enquire whether miss latterly was able to receive him ten minutes later he was in the library beside a very small fire when hester came in she looked frightened she closed the door behind her her eyes fixed on his face searching what is it she said without preamble what has happened she looked so fierce and vulnerable he ached to be able to shield her from it but there was no way he could lie now but it would open a chasm between them and in a few hours a day or two at most and it would happen anyway she would be here and see it the shock the sense of betrayal would only be worse ive found someone who saw rhys and arthur and duke kynaston together in st giles he said quietly he heard the regret in his own voice it sounded harsh as if his throat hurt im sorry i have to take it to evan she swallowed her face white it doesnt prove anything she was struggling and they both knew it dont hester he begged rhys was there with two of his friends together they answer to descriptions exactly if leighton duff knew or suspected and followed rhys to argue with him to try to prevent him from doing it again then there was plenty of motive to kill him he may even have found them immediately after they attacked the women that night then they would have no defence it it could have been duke or arthur her words trailed away there was no belief in them or in her eyes are they injured he asked gently although he knew the answer from her face she shook her head minutely there was nothing to say she stared at him the facts closed in like an iron mesh unbendable inescapable her mind tried every direction and he watched her do it and fail each time there was no real hope in her and gradually even the determination died im sorry he said softly he thought of adding how much he wished it had not been so how hard he had looked for other answers but she knew it already there was no need for such explanations between them they understood pain and reality far too well the dull ache of knowledge that must be faced the familiarity of pity have you told evan yet she asked when she had mastered the tension in her voice or almost no i shall tell him tomorrow i see he did not move he did not know what to say there was nothing and yet he wanted to say something he wanted to remain with her at least to share the hurt even though he could not ease it sometimes sharing was all there was left thank you for telling me first she smiled a little crookedly i think perhaps ishouldnt have he said with sudden doubt maybe it would have been easier for you if you had not known then your response would have been honest you would not have had to wait tonight knowing when they didnt i she started to shake her head i thought honesty was best he went on perhaps it wasnt i thought i knew that now i dont it would have been hard either way she answered him meeting his eyes with the same candour as in the past in their best moments if i know tonight will be hard and tomorrow but when evan does come then i shall have prepared myself and i shall have the strength to help instead of being stunned with my own shock i shant be busy trying to deny it to find arguments or ways to escape this is best please dont doubt it he hesitated for an instant wondering if she were being brave taking the responsibility upon herself to spare his feelings then he looked at her again and knew it was not so there was a kind of understanding in her which bridged the singleness of this incident and was part of all the triumphs and disasters they had ever shared he walked over to her and very gently bent forward and kissed her temple above the brow then laid his cheek against hers his breath stirring the loose tendrils of her hair then he turned and walked away without looking back if he did he might make an error he could never redeem and he was not yet ready for that chapter nine evan knew that monk had crossed into st giles although of course they were on different cases wot does e want shotts said suspiciously as they were walking back towards the station to find out who raped the women in seven dials evan replied its a problem we cant help shotts swore under his breath and then apologised sorry guy you dont need to be evan said sincerely his father might have been offended but that case angered him so profoundly the release of shouting and using language otherwise forbidden seemed very natural if anyone can deal with it it will be monk he added shotts gave a snort of derision edged with something which could have been fear if e catches the bastards ill lay theyll wish they were never born i wouldnt want monk on my back even if i hadnt done anything wrong evan looked at him curiously if you hadnt done anything wrong would he be on your back shotts looked at him hesitated a moment on the edge of confiding then changed his mind course not he denied it was a lie at least in intent and evan knew it but it was pointless to pursue nor was it the only time shotts had told him something which he had later learned to be false there was time unaccounted for small errors of fact he glanced sideways at shotts stolid face as they crossed the street avoiding the gutter and the horse dropping awash in the rain ducked past a coal cart and on to the farther footpath what else was there that he had not yet learned why should shotts lie to him about anything he had a sudden acutely unpleasant feeling of loneliness as if the ground had given way beneath him and old certainties had vanished without anything to replace them all around him was grey poverty people whose lives were bounded by hunger cold and danger they were so used to it they could eat and sleep in its midst laugh and beget children bury their dead steal from each other and practise their trades and their crafts legal or otherwise illegality was probably the least of their problems except in so much as it trespassed certain safeguards the cardinal principle was to survive if he had spoken to them of his fathers notion of a just god one who loved them he would have been greeted with utter incomprehension even good fairy stories had some relevance to fact some meaning that a person could understand they entered an alley too narrow to walk abreast and shotts went first evan behind him it was a short cut back to the main thoroughfare they crossed a tanners yard stinking of hides and went through a gate that was loosely chained and into the footpath evan increased his stride and caught up with shotts why did you lie to me he said bluntly shotts tripped on the kerb stone then regained his balance and stood still sir evan stopped also why did you lie to me he repeated his voice mild no accusation in it simply puzzlement and curiosity shotts swallowed about what sir lots of things where you were last friday when you told me you were questioning hattie burrows you werent because i learned afterwards where she was and it was not with you about seven dials and the running patterer and hearing from him the case monk was on that shotts began that was a mistake he did not look at evan as he was speaking have you a bad memory evan enquired politely in the same tone as he would have asked if shotts liked sausages shotts was caught to say he had would make him an unsuitable policeman above all a policeman needed keen observation and an excellent memory he had already demonstrated these qualities very effectively well pretty good most of the time sir he compromised rather well you need to have a perfect memory to be a good liar evan resumed walking at a level pace and shotts kept up but not looking at him better than yours why shotts do you know something about this murder that you dont want to tell me or is it something else altogether that you are hiding shotts blushed scarlet he must have felt the heat flush up his face because he surrendered its nothing agin the law sir i swear it i would never do nothing agin the law im listening evan kept his eyes straight ahead its a girl sir a woman i were seein er well i shouldnt ave its me only chance yer see wi all the extra duty i been pullin withe murder i was i was tryin ter keeper famly out o it not that theyre in it evan attempted to hide his smile and only partially succeeded oh why the secrecy mr runcorn wouldnt approve sir i mean ter marry er but i avent saved enough money yet an i cant afford ter lose me job then be a little more efficient with your lying and mr runcorn wont need to find out at least be wholehearted in your inventions shotts stared at him evan kept on walking coming to the crossroads and aft era brief glance to left and right striding out leaving shotts on the kerb as a rag and bone cart lumbered between them now he was smiling widely when evan reached the police station there was a message that monk wanted to see him and had information to impart relevant to the leighton duff case of a nature which would bring to a conclusion the initial part of the enquiry that was very strong language for monk who never exaggerated and evan went out again immediately and took a hansom to grafton street and knocked on the door of monks rooms it was some time since he had been there and he was surprised to see how comfortable they were in fact even inviting he was too intent on his purpose for calling to notice more than peripherally but he was aware of personal touches it was not something he would have associated with monk it was too restful there were antimacassars on the chair backs and a palm tree of some sort in a large brass pot the fire was hot as if it had been lit for some time he found he was relaxing in spite of himself what is it he asked as soon as his coat was off and even before he sat in the chair opposite monks what have you found out have you proof i have witnesses monk replied crossing his legs and leaning back his eyes on evans face i have several people who saw rhys duff in st giles at the time leading up to the murder including a prostitute he used there on several occasions it was definitely him she identified him from the picture you gave me and she knew him by name also arthur and duke kynaston i even have the last victim of rape attacked just before the murder only a few yards from water lane she identifies rhys duff evan said incredulously it was almost too good to be true how had he and shotts missed that were they really so inferior to monk was his skill and his ruthlessness so much greater he looked across at where monk sat the firelight red on his lean cheeks and casting shadows across his eyes it was a strong clever face but not insensitive not without imagination or the possibility of compassion there was a certain darkness in it now as if this victory destroyed as well as created there was so much in him evan did not understand but it did not stop him caring he had never been afraid to commit his friendship no monk answered she described three men one tall and fairly slight one shorter and leaner built and one of average height and thin she did not see or remember their faces that could be rhys duff and duke and arthur kynaston but its not proof evan argued a decent defence lawyer would tear that apart monk linked his fingers together in a steeple and stared at evan when this defence lawyer you have in mind asks why on earth rhys duff should murder his father he said he was a decent wellbred young man who like any other of his age and class occasionally took his pleasures with a prostitute simply because his father was a trifle straightlaced about such things even a little pompous perhaps is not cause for anything beyond a quarrel and perhaps a reduction in his allowance this provides their answer because leighton duff interrupted his son and his friends raping and beating a young woman he was horrified and appalled he would not accept it as part of any young mans natural appetites therefore he had to be silenced evan followed the reasoning perfectly a possible motive had been the one thing lacking before a quarrel was easy to understand even a few blows struck but a fight to the death over the issue of using a prostitute was absurd the issue of a series of rapes of increasing violence by three of them together and caught redhanded was another matter entirely it was repellent and it was criminal it was also escalating to the degree when sooner or later it would become murder to imagine three young men fresh from the victory of violence against a terrified victim beating to death the one man who threatened their exposure was sickening but not difficult to believe yes i see he agreed with a sudden sadness they were hideous crimes so ugly he should have been overwhelmed with revulsion and a towering anger against the young men who had committed them yet what filled his mind was the picture of rhys as he had seen him on the cobbles soaked with blood insensible and yet still breathing still just barely alive and then leaping to his mind came the sight of him in the hospital bed his face swollen and blue with bruising as he opened his eyes and tried desperately to speak choking in horror gagging drowning in pain evan felt no sense of victory not even the usual loosening of tension inside himself that knowledge brought there was no peace in this you had better take me to these witnesses he said flatly i presume they will tell me the same thing will they swear in court do you suppose he did not know what he hoped even if they would not nothing could alter the truth of it you can make them monk answered with impatience in his voice the majesty of the law will persuade them once in the witness box they have no reason to lie that is not your decision anyway he was right there was nothing to argue about then ill take it to runcorn evan went on he smiled with a downward turn of his lips he wont be amused that you solved the case a curious look crossed monks face a mixture of irony and something which could have been regret or even a form of guilt evan was aware of uncertainty in him a hesitation as if there were something else he wanted to talk about but was unsure how to begin he was making no move to rise from his comfortable chair i know he refused to pursue the rapes evan started but with this its different no one will bother prosecuting that when there is the murder thats what well charge them with we will only prove the rapes to establish motive the ones in seven dials will be by implication i know evan was puzzled why did monks contempt for runcorn run so deep runcorn was pompous at times but it was his manner of defending himself from the triviality he felt in his life perhaps the loneliness he was a man who seemed to know little else but the concern of his work the value it gave him even his relationships with others evan realised he knew nothing whatever of the man runcorn was when he left the police station except that he never spoke of family or other friends other pastimes had monk ever considered such things do you still think he should have pressed the cases of rape alone he asked hearing the criticism in his voice monk shrugged no he sounded reluctant he was right it would have put the victims through more of an ordeal than the offenders presuming they would even have testified which they probably wouldnt i would not ask any woman i cared for to do that we would be pursuing it far more for our own sense of vengeance than anything to do with the wellbeing of the women or even justice they would suffer and the men would go free we wouldnt even be able to try them again even if we eventually found proof because they would have been vindicated by the law there was anger in his face but it was for the situation not for runcorn rape is not a crime for which we have any answer even remotely just or compassionate he went on it strikes at a part of the emotions which we dont exercise honestly let alone govern with rationality it is even more primitive than murder why is that evan we deny it excuse it torture logic and twist facts to pretend it did not happen that somehow it was the victims fault and therefore not the crime we named it i dont know evan said even as he was thinking it is something to do with violation for gods sake it is the woman who is violated monk exploded his face dark yes it is evan agreed wryly but the violation we get so upset about is our own our property has been spoiled someone has taken something to which only we have the right the rape of any woman is a reminder that our own women can also be spoiled that way it is a very intimate thing so is murder monk retorted murder is only your own life evan was still thinking aloud rape is the contamination of your posterity the fountainhead of your immortality if you look at it that way monks eyebrows rose do you look at it that way no but then i believe in a resurrection of the body evan had thought he would apologise to monk for his faith but he found himself speaking with a perfectly calm and untroubled voice as his own father would have done to a parishioner i believe in an individual soul which travels through eternity this life is far from all there is in fact it is a minute part simply an antechamber a deciding place where we choose the light from the dark where we come to know what we truly value its a place of bloody injustice inequity and waste monk said hoarsely how can you possibly walk around st giles as you have been doing and even imagine a god that is fit for anything but fear or hate better for your sanity to think it is random and simply do what you can to redress the worst monstrosities evan leaned forward all the energy of his spirit in his words fragments half remembered returning to his tongue do you want a just world where sin is punished immediately and virtue rewarded why not monk challenged is there something wrong with that food and clothing for everyone health intelligence a chance to succeed and forgiveness and pity and courage evan pressed compassion for others humility and faith monk frowned the beginning of a doubt in his mind you say that as if the answer were not a certainty why not i thought they were the qualities you valued most arent they do you value them yes i may not always behave as if i do but yes certainly but if the world were always just and immediately so then people would choose to be good not out of compassion or pity but because it would be idiotic to be anything else evan reasoned only a fool would counsel any act he knew he would be punished for immediately and certainly monk said nothing courage against what evan went on do the right thing and there can be nothing to fear virtue will always be rewarded straight away there will be no need for humility or forgiveness either justice will take care of everything for that matter neither will there be need for pity or generosity because no one will need it the remedy for every ill will lie with the sufferer we would be full of judgement for each other all right monk cut across him you have made your point perhaps i would rather accept the world as it is than change it for the one you paint although there are times when i find this one almost beyond bearing not for me but for some of those i see he rose to his feet your father would be proud of you perhaps you are wasted on a police beat instead of a pulpit he was frowning do you want me to take you to these witnesses evan rose also yes please monk fetched his overcoat and evan put his back on again and together they went out into the dark cold evening walking side by side towards tottenham court road and a hansom inside rattling towards st giles monk spoke again his voice uncertain as if he were struggling for words seizing the opportunity of the temporary blindness of the night to voice some troubling thought does runcorn ever speak to you about the past about me evan could hear the emotion in his voice and knew he was searching for something of which he was afraid now and then but very little he answered as they passed the whitefields tabernacle and continued down towards oxford street we used to work st giles together monk went on staring straight ahead of him evan could not see his face but could judge from the sound of his voice back before they rebuilt any of it when it was known as the holy land it must have been very dangerous evan spoke to fill the silence yes we always went in with at least two at a time usually more he hasnt spoken of it no he wouldnt monks voice dropped at the end of the sentence betraying a sense of loss not for runcorns friendship but for whatever it was which had destroyed it evan understood what it was that disturbed him but it was too delicate to speak of between them monk wanted to know what it had been but only step by step so he could withdraw again if it became too ugly it was his own soul he was exploring the one territory from which there was no escape the one enemy which must always be faced sooner or later more certain than anything else in life or death he never mentions family evan said aloud he didnt marry didnt he monks tone was remote as if the remark were meaningless but the tension in his body belied that i think he regrets it evan added remembering casual references made and the momentary grief in runcorns face instantly hidden there had been a sergeants wedding anniversary everyone had wished him well spoken of their own families for an instant evan had seen the pain in runcorns eyes the knowledge of loneliness of exclusion he was not a man gifted by his nature or temperament to fill his own emptiness he would have been happier with someone there someone to encourage him when he failed admire him be grateful for his support someone with whom he could share his successes had monk with his greater inner strength his natural courage intentionally or not robbed runcorn of that monk feared he had blocked runcorns professional success stood in his path taken credit for some victory that rightly belonged to him the inner loss was the one evan feared the confidence the hope the courage to put fate to the test and abide the consequences that was what nestled cold in evans mind could one man really rob another of that or merely fail to help monk could not bear the silence did he want to i mean was there someone do you know evan recalled a fragment of conversation a name yes i think so but it was several years ago fifteen or sixteen or more her name was ellen i think what happened i dont know the cab swung round into oxford circus jolting and lurching as the dense traffic caused it to change course in a few moments they would be there after that it would be on foot all alleys and yards steps up and down icy rooms while monk retraced his questions and evan made notes for evidence there was no more time for conversation monk drew in his breath and let out a sigh the next afternoon evan had all he needed as monk had told him it was inescapable he sent up a message that he wished to see runcorn and at five minutes to three he knocked on the office door come in runcorn called from inside evan opened the door went into the warmth that filled the room from the fire but the chill that he carried with him did not ease yes runcorn looked up from the papers he had been reading this news had better be definite i dont want any more feelings sometimes you are too soft for your own good evan if you want to be a preacher you should have stayed at home if i had wanted to be a minister sir i would have evan replied meeting runcorns eyes boldly he recognised in himself the same shortness of temper he saw in monk the same desire to win the temptation to fight for the sake of it runcorn brought out the least admirable traits in him as they did in monk come to the point runcorn pursed his lips what do you have i assume we are talking about the murder of leighton duff you are not off on some crusade for monk his eyes were hard as if part of him actually wanted to catch evan in the trespass he wanted to like evan instinctively he did and yet his closeness to monk so often soured it yes sir evan stood to attention or as nearly as possible for a man of his natural ease i have witnesses to rhys duff and his two friends using prostitutes in st giles his picture had been recognised by one of the women i have her statement she also names him rhys is not a common christian name sir runcorn leaned forward the other papers pushed aside go on i also have testimony from the last victim of rape sir on the night of the murder she describes three men who answer the physical characteristics of rhys duff and his two friends arthur and marmaduke kynaston runcorn let out his breath slowly and sat back linking his fingers across his stomach any proof that the kynaston brothers were involved in the murder i mean proof not reasonable supposition we have to be absolute i know that sir and no no proof if we can convict rhys duff then the others may follow it infuriated him to have to allow their freedom until then whoever had actually killed leighton duff the other two were guilty of the string of crimes which had precipitated it if they had run away at the final moment it was an act of cowardice not compassion or honour decency of any kind at all would have intervened and prevented the ultimate tragedy can you place them there runcorn questioned sharply i can place them whoring in st giles with rhys but not that night not by name he was with two other men who answer their descriptions that is all so far the worst thing is that they neither of them seem to be hurt which would indicate they were not involved in the last fight with leighton duff well were not charging them with rape runcorn said decisively that is not a possibility so dismiss it what we have is evidence that three young men of whom rhys duff was one have been beating and raping women in st giles specifically on the night on which leighton duff was murdered outside in the passage someones footsteps stopped and then went on runcorn did not seem to hear them did rhys and his father go separately or together do you know he asked separately sir we have cab drivers testimony to that good so apparently on this occasion leighton duff followed his son presumably he had cause to suspect what he was doing it would be excellent if you could know what that was the wife may know but i imagine it will take some skill to elicit it from her his face did not betray the imagination to conceive of her suffering evan hardly dared think of what such knowledge would do to her he hoped profoundly that she did have some relationship of tenderness with dr wade she would surely need all his support now but you had better try runcorn went on be very careful how you question her evan she will be a vital witness when it conics to trial you will search the house of course you may find clothes with bloodstains from his earlier attacks you must establish that he was out on every occasion you intend to specify dont get caught on details i imagine if he does not confess to it and there is a major case then his mother will employ the best queens counsel she can find in his defence he compressed his lips although why anyone would wish to take on such a battle i dont know if you do your job properly he cannot win evan said nothing as far as he was concerned nobody won what finally led you to it runcorn asked curiously was it just persistence the right question eventually no sir evan did not really know why he took such pleasure in being perverse it was something to do with the air of satisfaction in runcorn monk found it actually he was following his rape cases and they led him to rhys duff runcorns head jerked up and his face darkened he seemed on the edge of interrupting then changed his mind he called me yesterday late afternoon and simply gave me the information evan continued i checked it myself and spoke to the people and took their testimony he looked at runcorn innocently as if he had no idea it would annoy him as well for us he was so stubborn about it he added for good measure otherwise i might still have been pressing mrs duff and looking for a lover runcorn glared at him a dull pink rising up his cheeks monk follows his cases for money evan he said between his teeth dont you forget that you follow yours because you are the servant of justice without fear or favour with loyalties to no one but her majesty whose law you represent he leaned forward over the desk his elbows on its polished surface you think monk is a hell of a clever fellow and to a certain level so he is but you dont know everything you dont know everything about him by a long way watch him and learn by all means but i warn you dont make a friend of him youll regret it he said that last with a frown not viciously but as a warning as though he were afraid of something for evan not for himself a shadow of old sadness crossed his face evan was taken by surprise runcorn was speaking against monk and he should have been angry with him instead he was aware of something lost a loneliness and he felt only sorrow and perhaps a touch of guilt dont trust him runcorn added then stopped abruptly i dont suppose youll believe me there was anger in his voice with himself for having spoken so openly revealed more of his feelings than he intended to and a thread of selfpity because he did not expect to be believed against his will evan did believe him not because runcorn said so but because monk himself feared it but it was what he had been not necessarily what he was now and what he was in the future lay within his own grasp i dont disbelieve you sir he said aloud you havent told me anything only to be careful i imagine you are speaking from some experience of your own or you would not feel as you do but i have no idea what it is monk has never spoken of it runcorn let out a burst of laughter hard and almost choking in his throat it was filled with helplessness and rage and unhappiness which time had never healed he wouldnt he likes you he needs you he may not know how to be ashamed but hes sense enough to understand what you would think of him evan did not want to know he would much rather have kept his ignorance but he knew monk himself needed to know for what sir runcorn stood up suddenly pushing his chair back so sharply it teetered on two legs and all but overbalanced he turned away to the chest of drawers full of files his back to evan go and arrest rhys duff for the murder of his father he ordered you did well in the case i didnt expect you to be able to solve it you were wise to take advantage of monk use him when you can just dont ever let him use you dont turn your back on him above all dont trust him dont count on him to be behind you when you need him he swung around his eyes hard and clear i mean that evan i dont want to see you hurt youre soft but youre a good man think well of him if you want but never trust him evan hesitated it was ugly very ugly but it was indefinite all implications and insubstantial pain there was nothing he could get hold of to prove or disprove nothing to take to monk for him to retrace his own steps and understand himself did monk betray you sir he said aloud then instantly wished he had not he did not want to hear any of it now it was unavoidable runcorn stared at him yes he betrayed me i trusted him and he destroyed everything i ever wanted he replied bitterly he saw the trap in front of me and he watched me walk right into it evan drew in his breath to question how much it was fair to blame monk for such a thing maybe he had not seen the pitfall any more than runcorn himself had or maybe he had assumed runcorn had seen it also then he realised that not only was it pointless to argue over the letter when the spirit was what drove but that in his heart monk believed himself guilty i see he said quietly runcorn faced him do you i doubt it but ive done all i can go and arrest rhys duff and dont mention anything about the other two men do you hear me evan i forbid it you could jeopardise any chance we have of getting them in the future his eyes betrayed the anger and frustration of his helplessness now it scalded inside him to see them escape and know it could be for ever yes sir i understand he turned and walked out his mind already made up to take monk with him when he went to ebury street monk had solved this case and his own case too he deserved to be there it was cold and growing dark as monk evan and pc shotts arrived in a cab at ebury street evan had considered taking the police wagon and decided against it rhys was still too ill to be transported in such a vehicle if he could be moved at all the fear that he could not was the reason he had brought shotts he expected to leave him to guard and watch against the extreme event of sylvestra trying to smuggle rhys away the cab drew up and they alighted evan paid the cabby and pulling his coat collar up walked ahead of the other two across the pavement he had never made an arrest which gave him less sense of achievement in fact now that his foot was on the step and his hand stretched towards the bell he admitted he dreaded it he knew that monk a yard behind him felt the same but monk did so for hesters sake he had never met rhys he had not seen his face to him he was only the sum of the evidence he had found and above all the cause of pain in the women he had listened to whose bruised lives he had witnessed the door opened and the butlers face darkened as soon as he recognised evan yes sir he said guardedly im sorry evan began then straightened his shoulders and continued but i require to speak to mrs duff i am aware it may not be convenient but i have no alternative the butler looked beyond him to monk and shotts his face was white what is it sir has there been another incident no nothing further has happened but we now understand more of what occurred the night of mr duffs death i am afraid we need to come in the butler hesitated only a moment he had caught the authority in evans voice and he knew suddenly the weight of his office yes sir if you will please follow me i shall inform mrs duff you are here he stood back for them to enter evan and monk did so leaving shotts outside as previously agreed he was there only as a precaution he expected the possibility of remaining all night until he was relieved by someone else in the morning his only release lay in rhys being deemed sufficiently well to be moved to a place of imprisonment pending his trial inside the hall was warm and bright a different world from the icy gloom of the street the butler walked across towards the withdrawing room door wharmby evan said suddenly yes sir perhaps you had better ask miss latterly to come downstairs sir it might be easier for mrs duff to have someone else present someone who can offer her some assistance wharmby turned even paler he swallowed so his throat jerked im sorry evan repeated what what have you come for sir wharmby asked to tell mrs duff what we know of how mr duff met his death and then the duty which follows from that tell her we are here and then please ask miss latterly to come wharmby pulled his jacket down and straightened his back then opened the withdrawing room door mr evan is here to see you maam and another gentleman with him he said no more but backed out again gave evan one more look then went to the stairs leaving them to go in alone sylvestra was standing on the carpet in front of the fire naturally she was still dressed in black with dark hair piled in a great coil on the back of her head and falling to her neck in the firelight she looked beautiful with her high cheekbones and slender throat yes mr evan what is it she asked with a slight surprise arching her brows she looked beyond him to monk evan introduced them briefly without explanation good evening mr monk she did no more than acknowledge him maam he inclined his head to have wished her good evening in return would have been a mockery he closed the door and came further into the room evan wished there were any way whatever to escape this moment he was acutely conscious of monk standing at his shoulder his mind filled with the cruelty whose results he had seen the rage smouldering inside him yes mrs duff we have learned a great deal of what happened the night your husband was killed first i would like to ask you one or two last questions he ignored the looked of astonishment on her face and monk shifting from one foot to the other behind him did mr duff express to you or in any way show anxiety as to what mr rhys was doing during the evenings he was away from home or the company he was keeping yes you know he did i told you so myself did he indicate either in words or by his behaviour that he had learned anything recently which troubled him additionally no at least he said nothing to me why her tone was getting sharper will you please be plain with me mr evan have you discovered what my husband was doing in st giles or not i told you when you first came here that i believed he had followed rhys to try to reason with him about the type of young woman he was associating with are you telling me that is true she lifted her chin a little almost as if challenging him that hardly warrants your coming here with mr monk at this hour we also believe we know how he met his death mrs duff and we must act accordingly evan replied he had not intended to be cruel but he realised that by stretching out what he had to say he was doing so a swift blow was better in the end we have witnesses who saw rhys several times in st giles sometimes with others sometimes alone one young woman places him there that evening obviously he was there that evening mr evan sylvestra cut across him what you are telling me we already know it is obvious monk could bear it no longer he stepped forward into the circle of candlelight from the shadows his face grim i have been investigating a series of violent rapes mrs duff they were committed by three men together they raped women sometimes as young as twelve or thirteen years old then beat them breaking their bones kicking them sometimes into insensibility her face registered her horror she stared at him as if he had risen out of the ground carrying the stench of terror and pain with him the last of the rapes was committed in st giles the night your husband was murdered in the same manner he said very quietly it is impossible to escape the evidence he followed rhys to st giles and caught up with him immediately after the crime was committed it happened less than fifty yards from the spot where his body was found she was ashen pale what are you saying she whispered we have come to arrest rhys duff for the murder of his father leighton duff monk answered her there is no choice you cannot take him away it was hester neither of them had heard her come in behind them he is too ill to be moved if you doubt my word dr wade will attest to it i have sent a message for him to come immediately she glanced at sylvestra i thought his presence might be necessary oh thank god sylvestra swayed for a moment but regained her composure this this is absurd rhys would not she looked from evan to hester could he i dont know hester said gravely coming right into the room but whatever the truth of it is he cannot be taken away from here tonight or within the near future he may be charged but he is not yet proven guilty of anything to move him from proper medical care might jeopardise his life and that cannot be permitted i am aware of his state of health evan responded if dr wade says he cannot be moved then i shall leave a constable on duty outside he turned to sylvestra he will not intrude upon you unless you give him cause to believe you plan to move mr duff yourself if that should happen he will naturally arrest him immediately and place him in prison sylvestra was speechless that will not happen hester spoke for her he will remain here in dr wades care and mine sylvestra nodded her assent i will go up to inform him of his situation evan said turning towards the door hester stood in front of him for a moment he was afraid she was going to try to bar his way physically but after an instants hesitation she went to the door ahead of him i shall come with you he may need some help i she met his eyes with both challenge and pleading i intend to be there sergeant evan what you say will cause him great distress and he is still very weak of course he agreed i am not trying to cause him harm she turned and led the way across the hall it seemed monk intended to remain with sylvestra perhaps he thought he could elicit some information from her where evan had failed he might be right hester went up the stairs and across the landing opening the door to rhyss room then as soon as she was inside standing away so evan could face the bed rhys was lying on his back his broken hands on the covers he was simply staring at the ceiling he was propped up on sufficient pillows to be able to meet evans eyes without discomfort he looked surprised to see him but the blue bruising was gone and the swelling had entirely disappeared he was a handsome young man in an unconventional way nose a little too long mouth too sensitive dark eyes dominating his white face evan was reminded sickeningly of when he had found him he felt responsible he had been part of willing him to live bringing him back from the brink of darkness and into this white light of pain he should have been able to protect him somehow it was his duty to find a better answer than this mr duff he began with a dry mouth he swallowed and felt worse we have traced your movements on the night your father was killed and on at least three other nights before that you regularly went to st giles and there used the services of a prostitute in fact several prostitutes rhys stared at him a faint flush coloured his cheeks it embarrassed him that that sort of thing should be mentioned in front of hester it was plain in his eyes the way he glanced at her and away again on the night in question a woman was raped and beaten evan stopped rhys had gone ashen almost greyfaced and his eyes were filled with such horror evan was afraid he was suffering some kind of seizure hester moved towards him then stopped the room seemed to roar with the silence the lights flickered a coal fell in the fire rhys duff i am arresting you for the murder of leighton duff on the night of january seventh in water lane st giles it would be a cruel brutality to warn him that anything he said might be used in evidence at his trial he could say nothing no defence no explanation no denial hester swung in front of him and sat on the bed between them taking rhyss hands in her own and turning him to look at her did you do it rhys she demanded pulling his arms hurting him to break the spell he looked at her he made a choking sound in his throat almost like a laugh the tears spilled over his cheeks and he shook his head a little at first then more and more violently till he was thrashing from side to side still making the desperate tearing sounds in his throat hester stood up and faced evan all right sergeant you have fulfilled your duty mr duff has heard your charge and he has told you he is not guilty if you wish to wait for dr wade to confirm that he is too ill to be moved you may do so downstairs perhaps in the morning room mrs duff may also need to be alone it will not be necessary to wait evan swung round to find corriden wade behind him looking exhausted hollowcheeked but absolutely unflinching good evening dr wade hardly wade said drily i have been fearing this would happen but now that it has i must inform you officially in my capacity as rhyss physician that he is not well enough to be moved if you do so you may jeopardise not only his recovery but possibly even his life and i must remind you that you have made a charge but you have not yet proved it before the law he is still an innocent man i know that dr wade evan answered calmly i have no intention of forcing the issue i shall leave a constable on duty outside the house i came only to inform mr duff of the charge not to attempt to take him into custody wade relaxed a little good good im sorry if i was a little hasty you must understand it is extremely distressing for me on a personal level as well as professional i have been a friend of the family for many years i feel their tragedies very keenly i know that evan conceded i wish my errand were something other im sure wade nodded then walked past him into the room glancing at hester with a look of quick appreciation thank you miss latterly for your pan i am sure you have been of great strength i shall remain with rhys for a while to make sure the shock of this has not affected him too seriously perhaps you would be good enough to be of what comfort you may to mrs duff i shall be down very shortly yes of course hesteragreed and instantly shepherded evan out of the room and down the stairs im sorry hester evan said going down behind her there really is no alternative the proof is overwhelming i know she answered without turning william told me she was stiff holding herself upright with an effort as if once she let go she might never find the strength to regain her composure she crossed the hallway and went into the withdrawing room without knocking inside sylvestra was sitting on the sofa near the fire and monk was standing in the middle of the carpet neither of them had been speaking at that moment sylvestra looked at hester her eyes terrified questioning dr wade is with him hester said in answer he is distressed of course but he is not in any danger and naturally he will remain here her voice dropped i asked him if he was guilty and he shook his head vehemently but sylvestra stammered but she looked at monk then at evan behind hester that is not helpful hester monk said sharply sylvestra looked bemused her hands moved as if to grasp at something and closed on air her body was rigid and she moved jerkily increasingly close to hysteria at this very moment her need was greater than rhyss hester went over to her and touched her taking her arms there is nothing we can do tonight but in the morning we must plan ahead the charge has been made it must be answered whatever that answer is mr monk is a private agent of enquiry there may yet be more to discover and naturally you will employ the best legal counsel you can just now you must keep up your strength no doubt dr wade will tell his sister but i will tell mrs kynaston if you would find that easier i dont know sylvestra was shaking violently and her skin was cold where hester held her evan moved uncomfortably he should not be witnessing this agony his task was completed here this was an intrusion as it was for monk he looked at hester she was absorbed in her feelings for sylvestra he and monk barely touched the periphery of her mind hester it was monk who spoke but hesitantly evan looked at him his face was filled with pity so profound it stood naked startling and it was a moment or two before evan realised it was for hester not the woman who had received such a devastating blow it was not only pity there was also in it a burning admiration and a tenderness which betrayed his de fences utterly he longed for hester to turn and see it but she was consumed by her anguish for sylvestra evan walked towards the door he was in the hall when he saw dr wade coming down the stairs he looked haggard and he still had the trace of a limp remaining from his accident there will be no possibility of your moving him he said as he neared the bottom whether he will be fit to stand a trial i cannot say we will have to have a medical opinion of more than one man to that evan answered him he looked at wades strained expression the darkness in his eyes and what he thought might even be fear or the shadow of fear to come sergeant yes doctor have he bit his lip what he was about to say seemed to hurt him intensely he struggled with it hovered on the edge of decision and finally summoned the strength have you considered the possibility that he is not sane not responsible as you and i understand the term so wade accepted that he was guilty was it simply the evidence they had presented or did he know something from rhys himself some communication some long knowledge and perception of his nature over the years no man could do what was done to those women doctor and be what you and i understand as sane he replied quickly blame is not for us to decide thank god wade took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh then nodded his acknowledgement and walked past evan to the withdrawing room door chapter ten after monk and evan had left corriden wade remained in the withdrawing room pacing the floor unable to be still long enough to sit sylvestra was motionless staring into space as if all will and strength within her had died hester stood by the fire im sorry wade said passionately looking at sylvestra im so sorry i had no conception this would happen it is the most ghastly thing hester stared at him had he seen some darkness in rhys all the time and feared disaster but something less than this less intense less irretrievable than death looking at his face now cast in deep shadow his eyes hollow his cheeks sombre with draining emotion and lack of sleep it would be easy to believe he was seeing the realisation of a longheld dread but something he had been helpless to prevent then another thought occurred to her was corriden wade the missing link in evans chain of evidence was it he perhaps who had tried to warn leighton duff of his sons weakness his propensity for real vice had it been something wade had said which had made him ultimately piece together all the sharp words looks little facts here and there and realise the terrible truth with a shiver of horror she realised she had accepted within herself that rhys was guilty she had fought against it so long and then in a moment had surrendered without even being conscious of it wade stopped pacing and stared down at sylvestra you must rest my dear i shall give you a draught to help you sleep i am sure miss latterly will sit up with rhys should it be necessary but i doubt it will you will need your strength he turned to hester i am sorry to place so much upon you but i have no doubt both your courage and your compassion are equal to it it was a profound compliment and gravely given it was not a time for thanks only acceptance of course she agreed tomorrow we shall begin what is to be done he nodded and at last seemed to relax a fraction hester believed it prudent to allow him a few moments alone with sylvestra his care for her was apparent now of all times they should be permitted a privacy to reach towards each other through the tragedy which engulfed them i shall go and see how rhys is now she said goodnight she did not wait for a reply but turned and went out closing the door behind her rhys did not call her in the night whatever dr wade had given him was sufficient to induce in him not rest but unconsciousness she had no idea how long he had been awake when she heard the bell fall on the floor she rose immediately it was full daylight she grasped her shawl and opened the connecting door rhys was lying facing her his eyes wide and terrified she went in and sat on the bed tell me again rhys she said quietly did you kill your father he shook his head slowly keeping his eyes on her not even by accident she pressed did you fight with him not realising who he was in the dark he hesitated then shook his head his expression was filled with horror his lips drawn back his jaw clenched the muscles of his neck corded with tension inside him could you see in the alley she pressed the evidence heavy in her mind if someone accosted you attacked you are you sure you would know who it was he gave a curious little jerk if he had had a voice it might have been laughter but bitter selfhurting there was some dreadful irony in what he knew and he could not tell her even if he would have could you see she asked again he stared at her without moving there were so many questions she thought desperately which would be the right one do you know what happened that night he nodded still not taking his eyes from hers although the horror in him was so palpable she could feel coldness creeping through her and despair so great it consumed and destroyed everything else rhys she put her hand on his arm holding him hard feeling the muscle and bone beneath her fingers ill help you in any way i can but i have to know how to can you tell me somehow what happened you were there you saw it if you want to plead against the charge they are bringing then you must give them something else to believe for seconds he simply gazed back at her then slowly he closed his eyes and turned away rhys he shook his head she did not know what to think whatever had happened he still could not bear to have anyone know even facing arrest and in time trial for his life he would not impart it but did he understand that did he imagine because evan had not taken him away that somehow it would not happen rhys she said urgently it hasnt gone away you know you are under house arrest it is just the same as being in a public cell or in newgate the only reason you are here not there is because you are too ill to move there will be a trial and if you are found guilty they will take you to newgate no matter how ill you are they wont care because they will hang you anyway she could not go on she could not bear it even though he had not turned back or even opened his eyes his body was rigid tears running under his lids and down his cheeks rhys she said softly i have to make you realise this is real you must tell someone the truth to save yourself again he shook his head did you kill him she whispered he shook his head again very little but quite unmistakably but you know who did she persisted he turned back very slowly meeting her eyes he lay still for seconds she could hear the sound of distant feet as a maid crossed the landing do you she said again he closed his eyes without answering she stood up and went out of the room and down the stairs to the withdrawing room where sylvestra was moving aimlessly from one idle task to another a pile of embroidery yarns sat tangled on a small table linen bunched up near them a bowl of winter flowers from the hothouse were half arranged half simply poked into the water several letters lay on a salver on the large semicircular table by the wall two were opened the others were not she swung around as soon as she heard the door how is he she asked quickly then bit her lip as though unsure what she wanted the answer to be i simply dont know what to do leighton was my husband i owe him everything not only loyalty but love respect decency her brow puckered how could it have happened what what changed him and dont tell me rhys hasnt changed ive seen the difference in him and it terrifies me she swung away her hands clenched in front of her a less controlled woman would have wept or screamed thrown something just to release the tension inside herself he never used to be like this miss latterly her voice was tight in her throat as if she had difficulty in making herself speak he was wilful at times thoughtless like most young people but there was no cruelty in him i dont understand it i thought i was so tired last night i would have slept with exhaustion i wanted to she emphasised it fiercely i wanted simply to cease to be able to think or feel anything but i lay awake for hours i racked my brain trying to understand what had changed him why he had become so different when it had begun to happen i found no answer it still makes no sense to me she turned back to hester her face bleak and desperate why would anyone want to beat those women why rape a woman who is willing anyway why would anyone do that it isnt sane i dont understand either hester said candidly but obviously it is not appetite but rather more a desire for power over someone else a need to hurt and humiliate she stopped sylvestra was looking at her with amazement as though she had said something new and almost inconceivable havent you ever wanted to punish not for justice but for anger hesterasked her i i suppose so sylvestra said slowly but that is hardly yes i suppose i have she stared at hester curiously are you saying it is the same thing hideously magnified i dont know i am only trying to imagine the fire settled with a shower of sparks you mean it is not appetite but hate sylvestra asked struggling to understand perhaps but why would rhys hate such women he doesnt even know them maybe it doesnt matter who it is anyone will do the weaker the more vulnerable the better stop it sylvestra took a shuddering breath im sorry it is not your fault i asked you and now i do not want to hear the answer her hands were twisting around one another she had scratched herself with her nails but she seemed unaware of it poor leighton he must have suspected there was something terribly wrong for ages and at last he had to put it to the test and when he followed him and he knew she could not finish they stood there in the quiet dignified room two women imagining the same terrible scene in the alley father and son face to face over a horror which had to divide them for ever and then the son had attacked perhaps out of rage or guilt perhaps out of some kind of fear that he would be caught by the law and he imagined he could escape the consequences if he fought his way out and they had beaten and punched and kicked at each other until leighton was dead and rhys was so badly hurt he lost consciousness and lay there on the stones soaked with his own blood and now it was so terrible to him he could not accept that it was he who had done it it had been another person another self one he did not own we must find a barrister for him hester said aloud he must have some defence when he comes to trial do you have someone you wish a barrister sylvestra blinked will they really try him he is too ill he must be mad wont they realise that corriden will tell them he is not too mad to stand trial hester said with absolute certainty whether insanity will be the best defence or not i cannot say but you must find a barrister do you have someone sylvestra seemed to find it difficult to concentrate her eyes looked without focus a barrister mr caulfield has always dealt with our affairs of course i have never spoken to him leighton handled business naturally is he a solicitor hesterasked almost sure of the answer you need a barrister for this someone who will appear in court to represent rhys he must be engaged through mr caulfield but if you do not have any preferences i am acquainted with sir oliver rathbone he is the best barrister there is i suppose so sylvestra was uncertain hester was not sure if it was her shock at the turn of events or if now she doubted whether she wished to engage an unknown barrister at unknown expense to defend rhys when she feared him guilty maybe it was simply too big a decision for her to make alone she was not used to decision she had always had her husband to see to such things he would find and assess the information his word would be final she would probably not even be expected to contribute an opinion it was up to hester to see rhys was defended possibly no one else would ill speak to sir oliver and ask him to come to see you she chose not to make it a question so sylvestra could not so easily refuse she smiled encouragingly will it be reasonable if i go first thing in the morning sylvestra drew in her breath but could not make up her mind thank you hesteraccepted her voice gentle full of an assurance she was far from feeling she was in rathbones office at nine oclock she waited until his first client had been and gone then she was ushered into his office the clerk advised that the next client should be handsomely entertained and informed that sir oliver was regrettably kept by an emergency which was at least half true she did not waste his time with preamble she was sufficiently conscious of the fact that he had seen her without an appointment and she was presuming on his regard for her to ask a favour she hated doing it the more so since their last encounter and her belief as to his feelings towards her had rhyss life not depended upon it she would not have come sylvestras solicitor could have briefed whomever he wished they have arrested rhys for the murder of his father she said bluntly they have not removed him of course because he is too ill but they will bring him to trial his mother is at her wits end and not in a position or a state of mind to find for him the best barrister for his defence she stopped acutely aware of his dark eyes on her and his expression of concern leaping ahead of what she had already told him i think you had better sit down and tell me the facts of the case so far as you know them he indicated the chair opposite his desk and moved around to sit at the one behind it he did not yet reach for the quill to make notes she tried to compose her mind so that she could tell him sensibly so that she could make it comprehensible without overweighing it with emotion rhys duff and his father leighton duff were found in water lane an alley in the area of st giles she started to explain leighton duff was beaten to death rhys was severely injured in a similar manner but he survived although he is unable to speak and both his hands are badly broken so neither can he hold a pen that is important because it means he cannot communicate except by a nod or a shake of his head that is an added complication he agreed gravely i have read something of the case it is impossible to pick up a newspaper and not at least be aware of it what evidence is there that leads the police to presume that rhys killed his father rather than the more natural assumption that both of them were attacked and possibly robbed by thieves or general ruffians of the area do you know yes monk has found evidence which ties them to the rape cases in seven dials just a minute he interrupted holding up his hand you said them who are we talking about and what rape cases in seven dials is he charged with rape as well she was not being as clear as she had intended after all she had seen the fractional change in his face when she had mentioned monks name and she felt guilty what had he seen in her eyes she must speak intelligently in an orderly fashion she started again monk was engaged by a woman from seven dials to discover who had been first cheating then with increasing violence raping and beating factory women amateur prostitutes in seven dials she stopped he was frowning did he disapprove of monk or of the women or did he fear it made rhyss case even worse what is it the words were out before she intended it is a very ugly crime he said quietly but it is one the courts will not pursue for a dozen different reasons both social he wrinkled his nose very slightly in a wealth of distaste subtle and deep and legal impossibilities also he added rape is a difficult crime to prove why did monk pursue it whatever else he has forgotten he must be aware of these things i argued it with him she said with a very slight smile it is not what you fear she hoped as she was saying it that it was the truth not merely her wish he intended only to expose them to their own society not to provoke the people of st giles to take their revenge rathbones lips curled in a faint ironic smile that sounds like monk a nice irony using societys hypocrisy to make it punish its own for the very crime it pretends does not exist and will not strengthen the law to judge he kept his eyes on her face but what has this to do with rhys duff and the death of his father for some time rhys had been keeping company with women of whom his father did not approve and to the exclusion of suitable young ladies she explained at least that is what his mother believed she was twisting her hands in her lap without realising it perhaps in fact he had some idea of what rhys was really doing anyway on that particular evening they quarrelled rhys left the room and apparently the house leighton duff left about half an hour afterwards when he realised that rhys had gone and perhaps suspected to where she looked at him to make sure he was following her explanation proceed he directed it is all perfectly clear so far one woman was raped and beaten in st giles that night she went on within a few yards of water lane a short time after that the bodies of rhys and his father were found in water lane itself rhys was insensible and has not spoken since leighton duff was dead and the assumption he concluded is that leighton duff caught up with rhys and his friends while it was still apparent they were the rapists of the woman either they were in the act or they had just completed it he was furious endeavoured to reason with them or apprehend them and one or all of them attacked him he drove off the other two quite quickly but rhys knowing he would not escape the matter fought until he had killed him yes more or less it was a terrible admission and she could not make it easily her voice sounded tight and brittle i see he sat silently for several moments deep in thought and she did not interrupt him he looked up have they anything to link rhys or his companions who are they do you know yes arthur and marmaduke kynaston they answer the descriptions given and one girl who actually named rhys named them also arthur and duke he is known as duke i see he nodded very slightly were they injured at the time rhys was do you know yes i do know and no they do not appear to have been she realised what he was thinking but that only makes them cowards as well i am afraid so but can anyone place any of the three in seven dials or connect them to the earlier rapes not so far as i know and is there evidence to prove these rapes are not random committed by several people there must be many rapes in london in a week i dont think many are carried out by three men together answering the descriptions of one tall and slight one average and one slender and all three gentlemen arriving and leaving by hansom she said bleakly he sighed you sound as if you believe him guilty hester do you she did not want to answer now that the question was put so bluntly and she faced rathbones clever subtle gaze which would not permit evasion and to whom she could not lie she must make a decision he waited he says he didnt she answered very slowly choosing her words i am not sure what he remembers it frightens him horrifies him i think maybe when he says that he is saying what he wishes were true perhaps he does not entirely know but you think physically for whatever reason he committed the act he said yes yes i think so i cant avoid it then what is it you wish me to do help him i now she realised how much she was being emotional rather than rational not only regarding rhys but in her plea to rathbone still she could not turn aside from doing it even now she was aware please oliver i dont know how it happened or why he should have let himself fall into such a desperate situation i i cant argue anything in mitigation for him i dont know what there is i just have to believe there is something she looked at his face with its humour and intelligence sometimes so cool and just now gazing back at her so gentle she forced herself to think of rhys his terror his helplessness maybe it is not justice im asking for but mercy he needs someone to speak for him she gave a painful little laugh even literally i dont believe hes purely evil ive spent too many hours with him close to him ive watched his pain if he did these things there must be some reason at least some cause which explained it to him i mean you mean insanity he finished for her no i dont yes you do my dear his voice was very patient trying not to hurt her more than he had to a young man doesnt rape and beat women he doesnt know then murder his father because he found out if he is anything that ordinary men and women would recognise as sane whether the law will make the same nature of distinction i dont know i very much doubt it his eyes were filled with sadness it is precise as to what insanity is and the fact that rhys attacked his father suggests he knew very well that his violence against the women was wrong which is what the law will view he knew what he was doing and that is the crucial factor but there must be something else she said desperately i cant let it go at that ive watched him too often too long he rose to his feet and came around the desk towards her then let me make arrangements to come and see him for myself that is if mrs duff wishes me to represent him hes not underage she said hotly rising also it is if he wants you to he smiled with dry rueful amusement my dear hester if he cannot speak or write and has no occupation of his own he will not only have very little power to defend himself he will have no financial means his father was wealthy he will have been left provided for she protested not if he killed his father hester you know that as well as i do if he is convicted for the crime he cannot inherit she was furious you mean he cannot have a defence because if he is found guilty he will not be able to pay that is monstrous she was so angry she almost choked on the words its he put both hands on her shoulders holding her so firmly she was obliged to face him i did not say that hester i think you know me better than to imagine i work only for money she swallowed she had cause to be ashamed she had come to plead with him to take on an impossible case because she believed he would i am sorry but i do work within the law he finished in the circumstances i shall have to speak first to his mother his lips twisted with genuine humour although i imagine that with you in the house and doubtless in charge i shall find her cooperative she blushed thank you oliver he said nothing but made a little sound of acquiescence it was midevening before rathbone arrived at ebury street hester had informed sylvestra of his willingness at least to consider the case and sylvestra had been too confused and unhappy to argue she had consulted her own solicitor a mild man skilled in the matters of property inheritance and finance and totally out of his depth where the criminal law was concerned he was to brief anyone recommended to him and willing to undertake such an unpromising cause sir oliver rathbone the butler announced and rathbone came into the withdrawing room almost on his heels he was as elegant as always with the ease of someone who knows his own power and feels no need to impress how do you do mrs duff he said with a very slight smile miss latterly how do you do sir oliver sylvestra replied with a commendable calm she could not have felt it is good of you to have come i am not sure what you can do for my son miss latterly speaks most highly of you but i fear our situation may be beyond any help please do sit down she indicated the chair opposite and he accepted hester sat on the sofa a little removed from them but where she could watch both their faces one does not always know what a defence will be until one begins mrs duff he replied calmly may i assume that you wish your son to have any assistance that is possible in his present tragic circumstances he looked at her patiently gently as if his words had been a simple question and without pressure yes she said slowly yes of course i her face was composed but it was plain from the shadows under her eyes and the fine lines of stress around her lips that it cost her very dearly it would be inconceivable that it should not rathbone smiled immediately of course you cannot yet see what can be done i admit neither can i but that is not unusual whatever the truth of the matter may prove to be we must see that as much as possible both justice and mercy are served that cannot be unless mr duff is represented by someone who will fight as hard for him as if they believed him valuable capable of hope and of pain and deserving every opportunity to explain himself sylvestra frowned you are already a brilliant advocate for him sir oliver i could not possibly disagree with anything you have said no one could she sat without moving a touch of immobility in spite of the emotion which must be tearing inside her it was an extraordinary selfdiscipline learned over the years to have the strength to apply now what confuses me is why you should wish to represent my son she continued and it is obvious from your presence here let alone your words that you do i know better than to imagine you are some young man seeking to make a career and a name for himself not that you would choose this case if you were nor are you so hungry for business that you would pursue any case at all why my son sir oliver rathbone smiled and there was a very faint touch of colour in his cheeks for miss latterlys sake mrs duff she feels very strongly for rhyss plight regardless of whether he should prove guilty of this or not she persuaded me that he needs the best defence he can obtain with your agreement i shall do all in my power to see that he has it hester felt the blood burn up her own face and she looked away avoiding rathbones eyes in case he should glance in her direction she had used his feeling for her perhaps even misled him because she was uncertain of her own emotions she was guilty but she did not regret it she would do the same again if she did not fight for rhys there was no one else who could sylvestra relaxed at last the rigidity easing out of her shoulders thank you sir oliver both for your honesty and for your compassion for my son i fear there will be few others if any at all who will feel the same for him he he will be regarded i think as a monster she stopped abruptly unable to go on the words were too hard too painfully true and it was a future which loomed within days not weeks it would be the pattern of life from now on the world would be changed for ever hester wanted to argue just to offer any comfort at all but it would be a lie and they all knew it anything she said would only belittle the truth and imply that she did not understand rathbone rose to his feet it will be my task to see that everything that can be said for him is put as eloquently as possible mrs duff now i would like to speak to rhys myself perhaps you would allow miss latterly to take me upstairs sylvestra rose also taking a step forward rathbone held up his hand in a very slight gesture if you please mrs duff i require to see him in effect alone what passes between a barrister and his client is privileged and must be confidential miss latterly will be party to it only in her capacity as his nurse in case he should become distressed and need her she will be bound by the same absolute rules sylvestra looked taken aback it is necessary he assured her otherwise i cannot proceed reluctantly she fell back her face still filled with uncertainty her eyes moving from rathbone to hester i shall see he is not distressed more than is absolutely necessary in order to learn what we must hester promised do you really think sylvestra began then faltered she was afraid it was stark in her eyes afraid of the truth she hesitated on the brink of telling rathbone not to seek it she turned to hester hester smiled at her pretending she did not understand and walked to the door she led rathbone upstairs and aft era knock on rhyss door merely as a courtesy she led him in rhys this is sir oliver rathbone he is going to speak for you in court rhys stared at her then at rathbone he was lying on his back propped up on pillows as she had left him his splinted hands on the covers in front of him he looked frightened and stiff how do you do rathbone said with a smile and an inclination of his head as if rhys had replied quite normally may i sit down rhys nodded then looked at hester would you pre ferme to leave she asked i can go next door and you can knock the bell off if you need me he shook his head immediately and she could sense his anxiety his loneliness his feeling almost of drowning under the weight of confusion inside him she retreated to the corner of the room and sat down you must be honest with me rathbone began quietly everything you tell me will remain in confidence if you wish it i am bound by law not to act other than in your interests as long as i remain honest myself i cannot lie but i can and will keep anything secret if that is what you wish rhys nodded the same applies to miss latterly that is her bond as well as mine rhys stared at him do you know what happened the night your father was killed rhys winced and seemed to shrink within himself but he did not move his eyes from rathbones face and he nodded slowly good i know you can indicate only yes or no i shall ask you questions and if you can answer them so then do if you cannot then wait and i shall reword it he hesitated only a moment did you go with your friends arthur and duke kynaston to the area of st giles and when there use the services of prostitutes rhys bit his lip and then nodded a dull flush of pink in his cheeks his eyes remained steady on rathbones face did you at any time injure any of these women fight with them even accidentally rhys shook his head violently did either arthur or duke kynaston do so rhys remained still do you know if they did or not rhys shook his head did you also go with them to seven dials rhys nodded very slowly uncertainly you want to add something rathbone asked did you go often rhys shook his head only a few times he nodded did you injure any women there again he shook his head sharply his eyes angry did your father go with you rhyss eyes widened in amazement no rathbone answered his own question but he knew you went and he did not approve rhys nodded a bitter smile twisting his mouth there was rage in it and hurt and a blazing frustration he tried to speak his throat muscles knotting his head jerking forward hester started up from her chair then realised she must not interrupt she might protect him for the moment and damage him for all the future rathbone must learn all he could however painful did you quarrel about it rathbone continued rhys nodded slowly here at home he nodded and when you went to st giles the night of his death again the sharp violent movement of denial and the jolt forward as if he would laugh had he the power did you quarrel about something else rhyss eyes filled with tears and he banged his broken hands up and down on the bedclothes his body locked in an inner pain far worse than the sickening jolting of the bones rathbone turned to hester his face white she moved forward rhys she said sharply she sat down on the bed and took hold of his wrists trying to force him to be still but his muscles were clenched so hard she could not he was stronger than she had expected and his whole body was caught in the emotion rhys she said again more urgently stop it youll move the bones again i know you think you dont care but you do please he unclenched his hands slowly and the tears spilled over his cheeks he stared at her then turned away and she saw only the back of his head rhys she said firmly did you kill your father there was a long silence neither hester nor rathbone moved then slowly he turned back to her and shook his head his eyes intent on her face but you know who did she pressed this time he refused to answer even by a look she turned to rathbone all right for now he conceded standing up i will consider what to do try to rest and recover as much as you can you will need your strength when the time comes i will do everything i can to help you that i promise rhys looked at him without blinking and rathbone looked back for a long moment then with a slight smile not of hope but only of a kind of warmth he turned and left the room outside on the landing he waited until hester had joined him and closed the door thank you she said simply i may have been a little rash he acknowledged with a tiny shrug his voice so low she could only just hear him her heart sank for a moment she had allowed herself to hope she realised just how much she trusted him how deep her confidence ran that he could accomplish even the impossible she had not been fair to lay such a burden on him she had seen people do it to doctors and then they had struggled under the weight of impossible hope and then the despair which followed and the guilt now she had done the same thing to rathbone because she wanted it so much for rhys i am sorry she said humbly i know there may not be anything to be done therell be something he replied with a tiny frown between his brows as if he were puzzled i am confused by him i went in persuaded by circumstance and evidence of his guilt now that i have spoken to him i dont know what to think i am not even sure what other possibilities there are why will he not answer as to who killed his father if it was not him why will he not say what they quarrelled over you saw his face when i asked she had no suggestions to give she had lain awake and racked her brains night after night searching for the same answers herself the only thing i can imagine is that he is defending someone she said quietly and the only people he would defend are his family or close friends i cannot see arthur kynaston doing this and his only family here is his mother what do you know of his mother he asked glancing towards the hall below them as he heard footsteps crossing it and fading away in the direction of the baize door through to the servants quarters is it conceivable she has done something for which rhys is willing to suffer even this to protect her she hesitated at first she had thought to deny even the possibility she could recall far too vividly rhyss anger with sylvestra the joy he had taken in hurting her of course he could not be protecting her then she realised that neither love nor guilt were always so clear it was possible he loved and hated her at the same time that he knew something which he would never betray but that he still despised her for it i dont know she said aloud the more i think of it the less sure i am but i have no idea what he was looking at her closely havent you no of course not if i knew i would tell you he nodded then if we are to help rhys we are going to have to know more than we do now since he cannot tell us and i imagine mrs duff either cannot or will not we shall have to employ some other means a flicker of amusement touched his lips i know of none better than monk if he will consent to it and mrs duff is prepared to agree surely she cannot refuse hester said fearing as she spoke that sylvestra might very well i mean unless without suggesting she fears there is something even worse to conceal i shall frame it so she will find it extremely difficult to refuse he promised i should also like to speak with arthur and duke kynaston what can you tell me about them i find it hard to believe arthur is the chief protagonist in this she said sincerely he has honesty in him an openness i could not but like his elder brother marmaduke is a different matter she bit her lip i should find it far easier to imagine he reacted with violence if challenged or criticised and certainly if he felt himself in any danger his words are quick enough to attempt to hurt honesty compelled her to go on but he has been here to visit rhys and he certainly was not involved in a fight of anything like the proportions that killed leighton duff and left rhys like this i wish i could say that he was rathbone smiled i can see that my dear and hear it in your voice nevertheless i shall visit them i must begin somewhere apart from engaging monk perhaps we had better go and set mrs duffs mind at ease that at least we shall begin and give the battle all we have rathbone did as he had said and asked sylvestras permission to employ someone to learn more of the events with the view to helping rhys not simply finding material proof as the police had done he phrased his request in such a way she could scarcely refuse him without appearing to wish to abandon rhys and to have something of her own to conceal he also asked her for the address of the kynaston family and she explained that joel kynaston had known rhys since childhood and she was certain he would offer any assistance within his power after rathbone had left she turned to hester her face pale and tense is there really anything he can do miss latterly or are we simply fighting a battle we must lose because to do less would be cowardly and a betrayal of courage and the sense of honour we admire please answer me honestly i would rather have truth now the time for reassuring lies however well meant is past i need to know the truth in order to make the decisions i must i dont know hester said honestly we can none of us know until the case is heard and concluded i have seen many trials several of which have ended far from the way we had expected and believed never give up until there is nothing else left to try and it is all over we are very far from that point now believe me if anyone can mitigate even the worst circumstances it is sir oliver sylvestras face softened in a smile sadness touching her eyes you are very fond of him arent you it was barely a question hester felt the heat in her face yes yes i have a high regard for him the words sounded stilted and absurd so very halfhearted and rathbone deserved better than that but the shadow of monk was too sharp in her mind to allow sylvestra to misunderstand as she seemed willing to do it was not difficult to comprehend it was one sweet and gentle thing one thing which led on into the future in a world which for sylvestra was full of darkness and violence and the ending of all the peace and hope she knew i hester started again i do have a great regard for him sylvestra was too sensitive to probe any further and hester excused herself saying she must go up and see how rhys was she found him lying exactly as she had left him staring up at the ceiling eyes wide open she sat down on the bed we wont give up she said quietly he looked at her searching her face then suddenly anger twisted his features and he swung his head away she thought of getting up and leaving perhaps he would rather be alone then she looked at him more closely and saw the despair beneath the anger and could not leave she simply sat and waited silent and helpless at least he knew she cared enough to remain it was the middle of the evening when rathbone returned he was shown into the dining room where hesterand sylvestra were picking at dinner pushing it around the plate in an attempt to eat sufficient not to offend the cook rathbone came in looking grave and immediately both of them stopped good evening sir oliver sylvestra said huskily have you learned something may i offer you something to eat if you would like to dine i her voice trailed off and she stared up at him too frightened of what he was going to say to continue he sat down but declined to eat no i have not learned anything new mrs duff i have been to speak to mr kynaston in the hope that he might shed some light on what has happened he has known your family for twentyfive years i believe i also intend to meet his sons who were with rhys in st giles i wanted to form some opinion as to whether we should call them to testify i imagine the prosecution may do that anyway sylvestra swallowed and seemed almost to choke you speak in the past sir oliver as if it were no longer true do you mean that joel kynaston is so so repelled by what rhys has done that he will not that what he says will will hurt rhys it is not favourable mrs duff rathbone said unhappily i tell you because i wonder if there is some reason you are aware of why mr kynaston may have such a view he expressed the opinion that rhys has been a poor influence upon his sons especially the elder marmaduke whom he feels has led a more he hesitated searching for the right word libertine life than he would have done without rhyss example and encouragement hester was amazed the arrogance in duke kynaston had been so apparent the natural assumption of leadership that it was inconceivable to her that rhys had influenced him and not the other way around but then she had not known rhys before the incident she hardly knew duke now all she had seen of him was a young mans swagger and bravado and a considerable rudeness to one he felt his social and intellectual inferior she looked at sylvestra to try to judge the surprise in her face joel kynaston is a very strict man sylvestra said thoughtfully staring not at rathbone but down at her plate he believes in great selfdiscipline especially among the young it is the foundation of strong character it is what courage and honour are built upon and without it all else may fail eventually her voice was careful full of longheld familiar conviction i have heard him say so many times he is much admired for it it may appear like hardness to others but in his position if he were to make exceptions be seen to be lenient towards one it would invalidate the principles for which he stands her face was intent but there was a slight frown between her brows as if she were concentrating on what she was saying and it flowed from memory rather than understanding and he felt rhys set a poor example rathbone said gently was he not a good student sylvestra looked surprised yes he was excellent but it was not only in academic studies joel felt passionately above all it was moral worth his school has a very high reputation and it is largely due to his own example she looked down at her hands sometimes i think he expected too much of boys forgetting they cannot have the strength of character one would hope of a man he did not understand the need of youth to discover boundaries for itself rhys was an explorer of thought i mean at least she gave up suddenly her lip trembling i am not sure what i do mean she swallowed and regained control with an intense effort i am sorry i know my husband had a deep respect for joel kynaston he believed him a most remarkable man she hurried on as if she feared interruption i should not be surprised that joel feels his death profoundly and cannot forgive anyone who was involved in causing it i am sorry sir oliver but you will have to look elsewhere for anyone to help us before rathbone could answer her the door opened and corriden wade came in he looked deeply concerned his face was gaunt as if he had slept little and there was a tension in him which was apparent even before he spoke he looked at rathbone with surprise and some anxiety sylvestra stood up immediately and went over to him relief and expectation in her eyes corriden this is sir oliver rathbone whom i have engaged to defend rhys we are searching for anything whatever which may help he has spoken to joel but it seems he feels rhys was an unfortunate influence upon arthur and duke and being the man he is he cannot speak anything but the truth i suppose i should admire him for that and if it were of anyone else i should be the first to applaud him she bit her lip which proves what a hypocrite i am because i cannot i wish desperately that he could bend a little i suppose be less honourable isnt that a dreadful thing to say i never thought i would hear myself say such a thing you will be ashamed of me wade put his arm around her never my dear it is only human to wish to protect those one loves especially when there is no one else to do so you are his mother i should expect no less of you he glanced at rathbone looking past sylvestra how do you do sir i am corriden wade physician to the family and at present rhys is in my care for his physical needs he nodded towards hester and miss latterlys of course she has done excellently well for him rathbone had risen when sylvestra did now he came forward and bowed in acknowledgement of wades introduction how do you do dr wade i am very pleased you have come we shall medically need your assistance when the time comes i believe you have known rhys a long time since he was a small child wade answered he looked worried as if he feared what rathbone might ask him i wish more intensely than you can know that i could offer some testimony which would mitigate this appalling tragedy but i have been unable to think of any he still had his arm resting lightly on sylvestras what will be your defence sir oliver i do not yet know sufficient to say rathbone replied smoothly if he was as frightened as hester felt he hid it superbly she thought he probably was there was a stiffness to the way he stood a hesitation in his voice which she had seen before at the worst times in past cases when it seemed there was no escape from disaster no solution but tragedy and failure what more is there to learn wade asked mrs duff has told me what the police believe that rhys had been keeping company with women of the street the lowest element in our society spreaders of disease and depravity that he had exercised a certain amount of violence in these relationships and that leighton had come to suspect as much when he followed him and taxed him with his behaviour they fought rhys was injured as you know and leighton perhaps being an older man taken by surprise was killed is it any defence to suggest the fight was not intended to go so far and that death was accidental he looked doubtful even as he said it if two men fight and one of them dies unless it can be demonstrated that it was accidental rathbone replied it will be proved to be murder for it to be manslaughter we should have to show that leighton duff tripped over by mischance or fell on some weapon he was carrying himself or something of that nature i am afraid that was very clearly not so the injuries were all inflicted by fist or boot such things are not accidental wade nodded that is what i had feared sir oliver do you think we might continue this discussion in private it can only be most distressing for mrs duff to listen to no sylvestra said sharply i will not be excluded from something which may affect my sons life anyway if it is evidence i shall hear it in court i should prefer to hear it now and at least be prepared but sylvestra my dear i am not a child corriden to be protected from the truth this will happen whatever i choose to ignore or pretend please give me the dignity of bearing it with some courage not running away wade hesitated his face dark of course rathbone said with admiration whatever the outcome you will have peace of mind only if you know that you failed in nothing that could conceivably have been of help sylvestra looked at him a moments gratitude in her eyes so the charge will be murder sir oliver yes i am afraid there is no possible defence of accident and it is not imaginable that leighton attacked rhys or that rhys in any way was defending himself wade continued gravely leighton may have been appalled by rhyss behaviour but the most he would have done would be to raise his hand he may have struck rhys but many a father chastises his son it does not end in murder i know of no son who would strike back then what defence can there be sylvestra said desperately for a moment her eyes flashed to hester then back to the men what else is left who else is there not arthur or duke surely i am afraid not my dear wade said dropping his voice had they been involved they would be injured also very profoundly so and you and i both know that they were not unless the police can find two or three ruffians in st giles there was no one and if they could have done that they would not have come here to accuse rhys he took a deep breath i am truly grieved to say this but i think the only defence that is believable is that the balance of rhyss mind has been affected and simply he is not sane that surely will be the path you will follow sir oliver i know of excellent people who may be prevailed upon to examine rhys and give their opinions in court of course insanity is not easy to prove rathbone answered rhys appears very rational when one speaks to him he is obviously of intelligence and conscience good god man wade said with an explosion of emotion he beat his father to death and very nearly at the cost of his own life how can any sane person do that they must have fought like animal he must have been frenzied to to do such a thing i saw leightons body he stopped as abruptly as he had begun his face white eyes hollow he took a deep shuddering breath and let it out in a sigh im sorry sylvestra i should never have said that you did not need to know to hear it like that im so sorry leighton was my best friend a man i admired enormously with whom i shared experiences i have with no one else that it should end like this is devastating i know she said quietly you have no need to apologise corriden i understand your anger and your grief she looked at rathbone sir oliver i think dr wade could be right i should be obliged if you would make every effort you can to find evidence testimony which will substantiate rhyss imbalance of mind perhaps there were signs beforehand but we did not understand them please call upon the best medical men i am informed that i have funds to meet any such expenses it she laughed jerkily painfully it seems preposterous that i am using the money leighton left for us to defend the son who killed him if that is not insane i wonder what is and yet i have to please sir oliver i will do all i can rathbone promised but i cannot go beyond what is provably true now i am sure you wish to see your patient dr wade and i would like to take my leave and consider my next step forward of course wade agreed quickly he turned to hester and you miss latterly you have been of extraordinary strength and courage in the whole affair you have worked unceasingly for rhyss welfare no one could have done more in fact i doubt anyone else would have done as much i will stay with rhys tonight please allow yourself a little time to rest and perhaps spend it doing something to enjoy yourself mrs duff and i can manage here i promise you thank you hesteraccepted hesitantly she felt a trifle uncertain about leaving rhys sylvestra was obviously more comforted by wade than anything hester could do for her and she would dearly like to go with rathbone to persuade monk to accept the case she had every confidence in rathbones powers of argument but still she wished to be there there might be something a thought an emotional persuasion she could try thank you very much that is most thoughtful of you she looked at sylvestra just to make sure she agreed please sylvestra added there needed no more to be said hester bade them goodnight and turned to leave with rathbone what monk said incredulously as he stood in the middle of his room facing hesterand rathbone it was very late the fire was almost dead and it was pouring with rain outside rathbone and hesters coats were both dripping on to the carpet even though they had come directly from ebury street in a hansom investigate the case to see if there is any evidence whatsoever to mitigate what rhys duff has done rathbone repeated why for gods sake monk demanded looking at rathbone and avoiding hesters eyes isnt it plain enough what happened no it isnt rathbone said patiently i have undertaken to defend him and i cannot begin to do that until i know every whit of truth that i can you cant anyway monk cut across him it is as indefensible as a human act can be the only possible thing you can say to procure anything except the rope for him is that he is insane which may be true it is not true rathbone replied keeping calm with some difficulty hester could see it in the muscles of his jaw and the way he stood his voice was very soft in any legal sense he is perfectly rational and not apparently suffering any delusions if you refuse to take the case on the grounds that it horrifies and appals you then say so i shall be obliged to accept that he also did not look at hester there was anger in him almost as if he would provoke the very answer he did not want monk heard the sharpness he swivelled to look at hester i suppose you put him up to this i asked him to defend rhys she replied rathbones acceptance and monks refusal hung in the air like a sword between them hester thought of a dozen things to say she wanted to excuse rathbone he had undertaken an impossible case because she had prevailed upon him she had persuaded him to see rhys to feel some of her own pity and the protectiveness for him she felt guilty for it and she admired him for not placing his own reputation and the failure he faced before it she wanted monk to feel the same compassion and accept it not for her but for rhys no that was not wholly true she wanted him to accept it for her also as rathbone had and she would be ashamed of herself if he did and all that ought to matter was rhys it was his life you were finding out about the rapes she said to monk now you could find out about rhys himself and his father discover if leighton duff did know what he was doing and follow him to try to stop him that will hardly help your case monk pointed out bitterly not that i can think of anything that will well try suddenly she was shouting at him helplessness anger and pain welling up inside her i dont believe rhys is wicked or mad there has to be something else some pain some i dont know just something look for it youre beaten hester monk said surprisingly gently dont go on fighting any more it is not a kindness to anyone no im not she wanted to cry she could feel tears prickling in her eyes and throat it was ridiculous just try there has to be something more we can do he looked at her steadily he did not believe it and she could see it in his face he pushed his hands deeper into his pockets all right ill try he acceded with a little shake of his head but it wont help thank you rathbone said quickly it is better than doing nothing monk let out his breath in a sigh stop dripping on the floor and tell me what you know chapter eleven monk was convinced that any attempt to find mitigating circumstances to explain rhys duffs behaviour was doomed to failure he was a young man whose lack of selfcontrol first of his appetites then of his temper had led him from rape to the situation of murder which he now faced curiously it was the beatings for which monk could not forgive him they of all the crimes seemed a gratuitous exercise of cruelty nevertheless he would try for hesters sake he had said he would perhaps in the emotion of the moment and now he was bound still as he set out from st giles it was more at the edge of his mind than the centre he could not rid himself of the memory of the expression of contempt he had seen in the eyes of the people who had known him before and liked runcorn better felt sorry for him in the exchange runcorn as he was now irritated monk like a constant abrasion to the skin he was pompous smallminded selfserving but perhaps he had not always been like that it was imaginable that whatever had happened between them had contributed to a warping of his original nature if anyone had offered it to monk as an excuse for his own behaviour he would have rejected it as precisely that an excuse if he did not have the strength the honesty or the courage to rise above it then he should have but he would soften the judgement towards others where he could not for himself he was in oxford street and going south in a moment or two the hansom would stop and let him down he would walk the rest of the way he was not yet sure precisely to what goal the traffic around him was dense people shouting in all directions the air filled with the squeal of horses rattle of harness and hiss of wheels in the rain he should turn his attention to rhys duff what could he look for what might a mitigating circumstance be accident was impossible it had to have been a deliberate and sustained battle fought until both men were incapable even of moving provocation that was conceivable for leighton duff in the rage and horror of discovering what his son had done it was not believable the other way around unless there was something else some other quarrel which happened to have reached a climax in water lane would that excuse anything were there any circumstances in which such violence ending in murder could be understood he could imagine none leighton duff had not died of a blow to the head which could have been one dreadful loss of control he had been beaten to death blow after blow after blow the hansom stopped and he alighted and paid the driver then turned and walked in the rain towards the first alley opening the smell of dirt was becoming familiar the narrow greyness of the buildings the sloping leaning walls the sense of imminent collapse as wood creaked wind flapped in loose canvas or whistled thinly in broken glass the holy land had been like this twenty years ago only more dangerous he turned his collar up then pushed his hands deeper in his pockets it was useless trying to avoid stepping in puddles everywhere the gutters overflowed the only answer was to keep old boots specifically for this purpose what had made leighton duff follow rhys on this particular evening did he discern something which with a horrifying shock made him realise what his son was doing what could that be and why had evan not found it had leighton duff destroyed it or taken it with him in order to confront rhys if so then why had it not been found on his body rhys had not left then had arthur or duke kynaston taken it with them and presumably destroyed it or did it not exist and leighton duff had known before or at least suspected what had decided him that night to follow rhys was it possible he had followed him before he crossed a narrow yard with a smithy in the building on the far side he could feel the warmth from the furnace yards away and smell the fire the burning metal and the damp hide and flesh of horses a new idea occurred to him as he hurried past before the warmth could ensnare him might leighton duff also have used prostitutes and that was how he had learned of rhyss behaviour and to reason on the subject how had he learned had rhys returned injured and been obliged to explain to his father the blood on him or scratches bruises surely not he would have sufficient privacy for that not to be necessary or another simple explanation to be given he could pass it off as a bout of boxing taken a little too far a riding mishap a scuffle in the street a fall a dozen things he should check with sylvestra duff and see if any such thing had happened but what if leighton had been there himself perhaps with one particular prostitute that could at one stroke explain his knowledge of rhyss presence in st giles and of the series of rapes and beatings and also perhaps explain something of rhyss rage at being chastised by his father the sheer hypocrisy of it in his eyes might infuriate him and on a darker note if he knew of his fathers association with such women might it explain his own violence towards prostitutes a sense of the violation of his family especially his mother that would be the beginning of some kind of mitigation if it were true and provable the answer was to see if anyone in st giles recognised leighton duff from any night except that of his death was he known in any of the brothels it would be by sight a man as sophisticated in the ways of the world was hardly likely to use his own name while society knew perfectly well that a great many gentlemen took their pleasures in such places it was still another matter to be caught at it ones reputation would suffer perhaps a great deal he stopped abruptly almost tripping over the edge of the kerb he all but overbalanced memory came to him so sharply of course a man could be ruined become the butt of social jokes not so much from his carnal weakness as the absurdity of being caught in a ridiculous position the dignity was shattered for ever ones inferiors laughed respect vanished one could no longer exert authority why had he thought of authority a man with a brazier of roasting chestnuts was staring at him curiously a coster girl giggled and disappeared round the end of the alley into the thoroughfare carrying a bag in front of her a magistrate it was a magistrate caught in a police raid in a brothel he had been in bed with a fat saucy girl of about fourteen when the police had gone in he had come running out of the room in his shirt tails his hair flying his spectacles left behind and he had tripped and fallen downstairs landing at the police officers feet with his shirt over his head very little left to the imagination monk had not been there he had heard about it afterwards and laughed till he was blind with tears and his ribs aching why did he remember that now it was still funny but there was a certain injustice to it a pain why why should monk feel any guilt the man was a hypocrite sentencing women for a crime in which he himself was the abettor for selling goods which he only too obviously bought and yet the sense of regret remained with him as he turned left and crossed the road again he was unconsciously heading towards one of the bigger brothels he knew of was it to ask about leighton duff or was this where the old raid had happened why would the police raid a brothel in st giles or the holy land it was riddled with them and no one cared there must have been some other reason theft forgery perhaps something more serious kidnapping or even murder that would justify storming into the place without warning he passed a man with a bundle of walking sticks threading his way through the alleys to a main street where he would begin to sell them a beggar moved into a doorway to shelter himself from the rain for no particular reason monk gave him threepence it would be more intelligent to go to the police station and get a picture of leighton duff from evan thousands of men matched his description it would be an extremely tedious job to comb st giles for someone who had seen leighton duff and could recognise him but he had nowhere else to start and there was only a day or two before the trial began but while he was still here in st giles he must see if he could trace his own history here with runcorn it was what he needed to know vida hopgood was satisfied he thought with a smile of her face when he had told her about rhys duff and his friends it was less than perfect that arthur and duke kynaston should escape but it was not necessarily a permanent state of affairs they would be unlikely to return to seven dials and if they did they would find a most unpleasant reception awaiting them perhaps monk should go and warn them of that it might save their lives which did not concern him overmuch but it would also free his own conscience from the stain of accessory to murder if they should be foolish enough to ignore him he reached the station and found evan now engaged in a new case may i borrow your pictures of rhys and leighton duff he asked when they were in evans tiny room evan was surprised what for isnt vida hopgood satisfied yes this isnt for her he would prefer not to have told evan that he was trying to save rhys duff to work in a sense against the case evan had built then who evan watched him closely his hazel eyes bright evan would find out sooner or later that rathbone had taken up the defence evan would testify at the trial he would know then if not before rathbone monk answered tersely he would like to know more about what happened before that night evan stared at him there was no anger in his face no sense of betrayal in fact if anything he looked relieved you mean hester persuaded rathbone to defend rhys and you are working to that end evan said with something that sounded like satisfaction monk was stung that evan imagined he was working for hester and in a hopeless cause like this one worse than that it was true he was tilting at windmills like a complete fool it was totally out of character of everything he knew of himself and it was to try to ease the pain for hester when she had to watch rhys duff convicted of a crime for which they would hang him and this time she would be helpless to offer him even the remotest comfort the knowledge of her pain then twisted inside him like a cramp and for that alone he could hate rhys duff and his selfish obsessive appetites his cruelty his stupidity and his mindless violence im working for rathbone he snapped at evan it is a total waste of time but if i dont do it hell find someone else and waste poor mrs duffs money not to mention her grief if ever a woman did not need a further burden to carry it is her evan did not argue monk would have preferred it if he had it was an evasion and monk knew that evan knew it instead he simply turned away to his desk drawer with a slight smile and a lift of his shoulders and pulled out the two pictures he gave them to monk i had better have them back when you are finished with them in case they are required for evidence thank you monk said rather less courteously than evan deserved he folded them up carefully in a piece of paper and put them in his pocket he bade evan goodbye and went out of the police station quickly he would prefer it if runcorn did not know he had been there the last thing he wanted was to run into him by chance or mischance it would be a long and cold day and evening was when he would have the best chance to find the people who would have been around at the time to see either rhys or leighton duff or for that matter either of the kynastons feeling angry at the helplessness of it his feet wet and almost numb with cold he went back towards st giles stopping at a public house for a hot meat pie potatoes and onions and a steamed pudding with a plain sauce he spent several hours in the area searching and questioning walking slowly along the alleys and through the passages up and down stairways deeper into the older part unchanged in generations water dripped off rotting eaves the stones were slimy wood creaked doors hung crooked but fast closed people moved ahead of him and behind like shadows one moment it would be strange frightening and bitterly infectious the next he thought he recognised something he would turn a corner and see exactly what he expected a skyline or a crooked wall exactly as he had known it would be a door with huge iron studs whose pattern he could have traced with his eyes closed he learned nothing except that he had been here before and that he already knew the police station he had worked from made that much obvious to anyone he began with the larger and more prosperous brothels if leighton duff had used prostitutes in st giles they were the most likely he worked until after midnight asking threatening cajoling coercing and learning nothing whatever if leighton duff had been to any of these places either the madams did not remember him or they were lying to protect their reputation for discretion monk believed it was the former duff was dead and they had little to fear from answering monk he had not lost so much of his old character that he could not wring information from people who made their living on the edge of crime he knew the balance too well not to use it he was walking along a short alley up towards regent street when he saw a cabby standing on the pavement talking to a sandwich seller shivering as the wind whipped around the corner and caught him in its icy blast monk offered a penny and bought a huge sandwich he bit into it with pleasure actually it was very good fresh bread with a sharp crust to it and a thick slice of ham liberally laced with a rhubarb chutney good he said with his mouth full find yer rapists yet the cabby asked raising his eyebrows he had very sad rather protuberant eyes of pale blue yes thank you monk replied smiling you been on this patch long baht eight years why just wondered he turned to the sandwich seller and you twentyfive he answered more or less do you know me the man blinked course i knows yer wot kinda question is that monk steeled himself do you remember a raid in a brothel a long time ago where a magistrate was caught he fell downstairs and hurt himself quite badly he had not finished before he saw from the mans face that he did it creased with laughter and a rich chortle of pure joy escaped his lips yeah he said happily yeah course i members it rotten bastard e were ol gutteridge put polly thorp away for three years jus cos some feller wot she were doin a service fer said as shed took is money well is trousers was orff he laughed again his cheeks puffing out and shining in the lamplight from across the street got caught proper e did trousers down an all leff the bench arter that no more and in down four years ere an five years there an the boat all over the place yer could ear em laughin all over the oly land yer could i heard runcorn got the credit for that one but i always wondered if that was really down ter you mr monk there was a lot o us as reckoned it were yer just wasnt there at the time so ter speak did you monk said slowly well its a long time ago now he wanted to change the subject he was floundering he could not afford to show his vulnerability to these people his skill depended on their fear and respect for him he pulled the picture of leighton duff out of his pocket and showed it to the sandwich seller have you ever seen this man the sandwich seller tipped it over a little towards the light of the distant streetlamp he thought for a few moments yeah e were the geezer wot were done in water lane a rozzer showed me this afore wy dyer wanna know fer just wondering if he came here any time before that monk replied the cabby looked at it curiously ere jus a minute he said his voice quickening i seen im not the night e were done i dint but i see dim afore that bout a couple o weeks or mebbe less it were the night afore christmas eve i know that id swear ter it monk felt his body tighten and his heart beat a little faster it was the scent of victory familiar and sharp the night before christmas eve and he was here in st giles yeah dint i jus say so e looked rough real rough then like ed bin in a fight blood on is face there were an on is sleeves monk swallowed look carefully are you sure yeah im sure ears yer see he looked at monk with a smile i likes ears ears is all different ave yer ever noticed that yes yes i have and what was it about the mans ears that you remember so well as he said it he moved his hand over the pictures to obscure the ears long the cabby said without hesitation long an narrer wi eavy lobes ter em yer take yer finger orff an look im right monk obeyed the man was right and he had blood on him did you see any injury he did not want to ask he almost did not it was too easily disproved he could feel the new thread slipping out of his grasp again no ony blood dont ave ter be is blood could a bin someone elses looked kind o drunk e did staggerin abaht a bit but appy enough like ed just won sum mink so maybe the other geezer got orff a bit worse eh yes maybe was he alone did you see anyone else had rhys been with him close behind or left wherever the fight had taken place this evidence was almost too good to be true perhaps he would be able to take hester something after all or rather take rathbone something saw someone else the cabby said thoughtfully but couldnt say oo jus a shadow tall like an thinnish though it int easy ter say in a good coat covers a lot a good coat does tall and thin monk said slowly and his face was he dark or fair young or old surely it must have been rhys and was he injured too don rush me the cabby protested cant answer moren one thing at a time did you see his face monk said controlling himself with difficulty sort o alf dark or fair dark very dark monk swallowed and was he hurt that you could see yeah co meter think on it e ad blood on im too not so much as i could see but yeah e were messed around i reckon is coat were torn an looked sort o wet wy guy wot does it matter now yerve got im int yer yes its just a matter of tidying it up for evidence in court you are positive about the date yeah i told yer thank you you have been a great help now will you please take me to ebury street have another sandwich he gave the sandwich seller threepence and took two more and have one yourself he added cheerfully theyre very good he gave one to the cabby and set out at a stride to climb up into the hansom his only regret was he had nothing for the horse at ebury street he alighted paid the cabby and thanked him again then went up the step and rang the bell when it was answered by wharmby looking grim he asked to see mrs duff i am sorry sir but mrs duff is not receiving wharmby said firmly please inform her that i am working for sir oliver rathbone and i have a question i must ask her regarding the case monk replied equally unflinchingly it is important that i receive an answer before i can proceed it is in mr rhys duffs interest yes sir i will tell her he hesitated there was nothing more to say and yet he did not move monk waited he wanted to prompt him but he was afraid if he were too direct he could break the moment and lose it do you remember christmas eve wharmby he said quite casually yes sir wharmby was surprised and the night before wharmby nodded yes sir how can i help you who was here that night no one sir in the evening mrs duff went with mrs wade to a concert mr rhys went to the kynastons to dinner and mr duff went out on business i see the taste of victory was there again and how were they all when they returned home or the next time you saw them how were they sir quite normal considering it was christmas eve was no one hurt in any way perhaps a slight traffic accident or something of the sort i believe mr duff had a scratch on his face he said it had been a flying stone from a carriage going much too fast why sir does this mean something can you can you help mr rhys sir his face was crumpled with curiosity his eyes frightened as if he dreaded the answer he had been almost too afraid to ask monk was taken aback such concern did not fit with the picture of rhys duff that monk had formed was the man not more moved by the violent death of his master or was it now sylvestra for whom he grieved imagining her second loss so much worse even than the first i dont know he said honestly im doing everything i can it is possible this may mitigate things a little perhaps you do not need to disturb mrs duff if you say that mr rhys said he was going to the kynastons that evening i can ask them to substantiate that can you give me their address certainly sir i shall write it down for you and without waiting for agreement he disappeared and came back a few moments later with a slip of paper and an address written out in copperplate monk thanked him and left seeking another cab at the kynaston house he asked to speak to mr kynaston he was received reluctantly in the library there was no fire burning but the ashes were still warm joel kynaston came in and closed the door behind him looking monk up and down with distaste he was a highly individual man with thick very beautiful hair of an auburn colour a thin nose and unusual mouth he was of average height and slight build and at the moment he was short of patience what can i do for you sir he said briskly my butler informed me you wish to make an enquiry about rhys duff to do with the forthcoming trial i find the whole matter most disturbing mr leighton duff was a close personal friend and his death is a great tragedy to my whole family if i can assist the cause of justice then it is my public duty to do so and i do not shirk from it but i must warn you sir i have no desire and no intention of involving myself in further hurt to the duff family nor will i injure or cause unhappiness to my own family in your interest what is it you wish of me did mr rhys duff visit your home on the evening of the day before christmas eve mr kynaston i have no idea i was not at home myself why is it important leighton duff was perfectly well and unharmed at that time what affair is it of yours if rhys was here monk could understand his desire to protect his sons whom he might well fear had been involved deeply and tragically with the duff family he might feel he was to blame for not having been aware of their behaviour as apparently leighton duff had been but for chance had he been the one to know instead he could have been beaten to death in water lane and monk could have been asking these questions of leighton duff it was not difficult to see mr kynaston was tense unhappy and unwilling to have monk or anyone else prying further into the wound perhaps he was owed some explanation it seems to me possible that the night of mr duffs death may not have been his first quarrel with his son over his conduct monk replied there is evidence to suggest they met and had some heated disagreement on the night before christmas eve i would like to know if that is true i cannot see why kynaston said with a frown it seems tragically apparent what happened leighton realised what rhys was doing that his behaviour was unacceptable by any standards at all let alone those of a gentleman his temper and selfindulgence had gone beyond all control his latest weaknesses had slipped into open vice his father followed him and remonstrated with him at which rhys became vicious with rage and attacked him with the consequences which we know only too well did rhys always have a temper mr kynaston i am afraid so when he was a boy it was held in check he was never permitted to lose it while in my charge what he was allowed at home of course i do not know but his father was concerned about him he confided that much to me i do not wish to speak ill of the poor woman who god knows has more grief than any person should be asked to bear but mrs duff has indulged the boy over the years she hated to discipline him and his character has suffered for it i see is there someone i could ask if rhys was here on that evening you might ask my wife i suppose she was at home as i believe were my sons monk was disconcerted but not set out of countenance it was just possible rhys had gone alone on this occasion or more likely kynaston was wrong about all of them thank you monk accepted uncertain whether mrs kynastons word would satisfy him as soon as kynaston turned to the door monk made to follow him kynaston stopped you are on my heels mr monk i should prefer if you were to wait here and i shall ask my wife and inform you of the answer possibly monk agreed then i shall have to inform sir oliver that i was not permitted to speak to mrs kynaston personally and he may feel the necessity to call her to testify in court he looked at him squarely and coldly however if i speak to her myself and to your sons then that may prove sufficient kynaston stiffened i do not appreciate being threatened mr monk few of us do monk said with a thin smile but most of us take heed kynaston looked at him a moment longer weighing his nerve and his intent then swung on his heel and led the way monk was startled by fidelis kynaston he had not had any particular expectations of kynastons wife but this woman of extraordinary composure with her asymmetrical face and her calm very lovely voice took him utterly by surprise the inner repose of her fascinated him this is mr monk kynaston said tersely without looking at him he requires to ask you a question about rhys duff it is probably advisable that you answer him how do you do mr monk she said graciously unlike her husband her face was filled with sadness rather than tension or anger perhaps she was completely unaware of her sons part in the crime or the pattern of behaviour which had led up to it kynaston may have shielded her from it in which case there was more in him to be admired than monk had supposed and yet looking at fidelis face there was knowledge of pain beneath her composure and a kind of stillness in her eyes which springs from selfmastery in the experience of deep unhappiness was it conceivable that they both knew and yet each shielded the other and the whole tragedy was never shared i am sorry to disturb your evening mrs kynaston he said sincerely but i need to ask you to cast your mind back to the night before christmas eve can you tell me if you were at home and if so who was with you and until what hour certainly she said with a shadow of puzzlement in her eyes i was at home and my sons were here and rhys duff and lady sandon and her son mr rufus sandon we played cards and talked a great deal about all manner of things egyptian exploration in particular rufus sandon was most enthusiastic about monsieur champollion and his deciphering of the rosetta stone rhys was fascinated i think he would willingly have listened all night what time did he leave mrs kynaston about two oclock i believe she replied it was very late indeed but the following day was christmas eve and they intended to lie in and be late the evening aft eras well i remember them saying so marmaduke retired to bed earlier he was less interested but the rest of us remained long into the night may i ask why you wish to know mr monk can it in some way help rhys now there was no need to ask if that was something she wished it was plain in her entire bearing i dont know maam he answered frankly it is not what i had expected you to say i admit this throws me into some confusion you have no doubt whatsoever about the date none at all we were discussing the fact that it was christmas eve the following day she affirmed thank you i appreciate your courtesy then we will not detain you any further mr monk kynaston said abruptly just as fidelis was about to speak again monk bowed and took his leave thoroughly puzzled if rhys had been at the kynastons until two in the morning then it could not have been he with whom leighton duff had fought in st giles shortly after midnight he did not doubt fidelis but it would be simple to check with lady sandon he had not asked for her address but a woman of title would not be difficult to locate as soon as he reached his rooms he went to his desk and took out all his notes on the times dates and places of the rapes he had investigated they were in chronological order and it took him only moments to ascertain that his memory was correct there had been a particularly brutal rape and beating on the night before christmas eve as near as the victim could tell shortly before midnight probably two men rather than three the conclusion was startling and inescapable rhys could not have been guilty of this one leighton duff had been there and had been involved in a struggle of some sort marmaduke kynaston could have been there arthur kynaston like rhys could not he must be absolutely certain there were more facts to check with lady sandon and with sylvestra duff and for extra certainty with the servants in the duff house had leighton duff followed and confronted marmaduke kynaston and his companion in rape whoever that was or was he himself the companion and had rhys usually the third on this occasion been more spellbound by something else and remained in the kynaston home listening to tales of egypt and the rosetta stone was it even possible that the three men who committed the rapes were not always the same ones he went to bed with his mind racing and slept fitfully haunted by dreams in the morning he arose dressed and aft era hasty breakfast went out barely feeling the cold by two in the afternoon he had ascertained his facts rhys duff had been at the kynaston house until two in the morning and had returned straight to his own home where he had remained until midday of christmas eve he could not have been in st giles leighton duff had gone out at half past nine in the evening and had returned at an unknown hour the footman had not waited up for him mr duff was always most considerate and never required the servants to remain out of their beds on his account it was confirmed that duke kynaston had retired before the end of the party but whether he had then gone out or not no one could say while he was at the kynaston house monk took the opportunity to deliver a warning he had doubted whether to do so or to leave justice to fortune now as the picture grew even less certain in his mind the doubt vanished he asked to see both brothers and learned that arthur was out but marmaduke could give him a few moments if he cared to come to the morning room duke looked at him with a mixture of interest and scorn a private agent of enquiry eh he said with a lift of the eyebrow what a curious way to make ones living still i suppose it is better than catching rats or repossessing the furniture of debtors there are times when it bears a closer resemblance to catching rats than one might wish monk answered with a corresponding sneer i hear you were the one who caught up with rhys duff duke said quickly cutting across him a little do you think the court will find him guilty is that why you consented to see me monk asked with amusement because you think i might know what the outcome will be there was a faint flush on dukes cheeks do you he demanded monk was surprised under the bravado was it possible duke actually felt some concern and some responsibility or guilt no i dont monk said more gently i thought i knew the answer without doubt but i have since discerned some information which makes me less sure why did you come here duke frowned what do you want from us when you left the party on the night before christmas eve where did you go to bed why what does that matter you did not go to st giles with leighton duff his utter amazement was too profound to disbelieve what monk repeated what he had said with leighton duff have you lost your wits ive been whoring in st giles certainly with rhys for mat matter and my brother arthur but leighton duff that pompous dryasdust old stick he started to laugh and it was harsh critical but as far as monk could tell perfectly genuine i take it you think it unlikely mr duff would have gone to st giles in search of a prostitute about as likely as her majesty appearing on the stage of the music halls i should think duke replied bitterly whatever gave you that notion you must be very out of touch with the case you really have not the least idea have you monk took the picture of leighton duff out of his pocket is that a good likeness of him duke considered it for a moment yes it is actually it is extremely good he had just that rather patronising air of selfrighteousness you did not like him monk observed a crashing remark of the obvious duke raised his eyebrows do you really make a living at this mr monk you would be surprised how people betray themselves when they imagine themselves safe mr kynaston monk said with a smile but thank you for your concern on my behalf it is not necessary what i came for was to warn you and your brother that the people of st giles and of seven dials as well are aware of who committed the recent rapes in their areas and if either of you should return there it is very probable you will meet with most unpleasant ends you have been there you know or can imagine how easily that could be accomplished and your bodies never found at least not recognisable ones duke stared at him with a mixture of shock and incomprehension but there was markedly fear in it as well why do you care if i get murdered in st giles he said truculently then passed his tongue over dry lips i dont monk replied with a smile but even as he said it it was not entirely true he disliked marmaduke kynaston less than when he had come in for no reason that he would have been prepared to explain i dont want the people of st giles to be pursued by a murder enquiry duke took a deep breath i should have known are you from st giles monk laughed outright it was the first time he had felt like it for days no i come from northumberland i suppose i should thank you for the warning duke said casually but his eyes still held the shock and there was a reluctant sincerity in his voice monk shrugged and smiled he left the house even further confused time was desperately short he took leighton duffs picture to seven dials and showed it to cabbies street pedlars a running patterer sellers of flowers bootlaces matches glassware and to a rat catcher and several prostitutes it was recognised by at least a dozen people and some without any hesitation at all not one of them was prepared to identify rhys by the second night monk had only one more question in his mind he returned to st giles to pursue the answer and walked the alleys and courtyards the dripping passages and up and down the rotting stairs until dawn came grey and bleak at about seven oclock and he was exhausted and so cold his feet were numb and he could not control the shaking of his body but he knew two things rhys duff and his father had come to st giles on the night of the murder from different directions and there was no proof they had met until the fatal encounter in water lane the other thing he learned by chance he was talking to a woman who had been a prostitute in her youth and had saved sufficient money to purchase a boarding house but still knew a remarkable amount of gossip he went to her partly to confirm certain dates and places but mainly from his compulsion to probe the darkness in his own mind the fear that gathered every time runcorns face came to his thoughts which it did so often in these dark slippery paths it was not runcorn as he was now greying at the temples a little broader at the waist but a younger keener runcorn shoulders straight eyes clearer and braver do you remember the raid in the brothel when the magistrate gutteridge was caught with his trousers down he was not sure why he asked or what he expected the answer to be only that it lay at the back of his mind and would not leave she gurgled with delight course i do why runcorn led it you know that cant tell me youve forgot she looked at him narrowly her head on one side did he set it up he asked wots this a game or sum mink you set it up an runcorn took it from yer yer let im cos yer knowd poor of guttridge was gonna be there runcorn walked right inter it daft sod why it was gutteridges own fault did he expect the police to hold off just because he was indulging himself her eyes widened yeah course e did or at least warn im upset a lot o people that did important people like none o us mind laughed till we creased ourselves we did what people monk paused knowing something eluded him something that mattered ere wots this abaht she said with a frown its all dead an buried nah oo cares any more it dont ave nuffink ter do wi them rapes ere i know it doesnt i just want to know tell me he pressed well there was a few gents wot felt their selves a bit exposed like arter that she laughed hugely at her own joke theyd always trusted you rozzers to keep yer distance from certain ouses o pleasure she wiped her eyes with the back of her hand arter that they dint trust no one couldnt it kind o soured relations at ween the rozzers and certain people o influence ony time i ever thought as i could like mr runcorn bleedin pain e is most o the time worsen you yer a mean bastard but yer was straight and yer werent full o cant i never knowed yer preach one thing an do another not like em she looked at him more closely wot is it monk wy dyer give a toss abaht a twentyyearold raid in a bawdy ouse im not sure he said honestly after yer is e she asked with a note of something which could even have been sympathy he was not sure whether it was for him or for runcorn afterme he repeated why it sounded foolish but she knew something about it or she would not have leaped to such a conclusion he had to know he was too close now not to grasp it whatever it was well yer droppedim right in it dint yer she said incredulously yer knew all them folk was there an yer never top im let im charge in an make a right fool of is self dont suppose nuffink was said but they don never fergive that kind o thing lorst is promotion then an lorst is girl too cos er father were one of em werent e she shrugged id watch me back if i was you even arterall this time e don fergive yer know carries a grudge and does runcorn monk was barely listening he could not remember doing it even after her description but he could remember the feeling of victory the deep hot satisfaction of knowing he had beaten runcorn now it was only shame it was a shabby trick and too deep a revenge for anything runcorn could have done to him not that he knew of anything he thanked her quietly and walked out leaving her puzzled muttering to herself about how times had changed why he walked with his head down into the rain hands deep in his pockets ignoring the gutters and his wet feet it was fully light now why had he done such a thing had it been as deliberate and as calculatedly cruel as everyone else thought if it had then no wonder runcorn still hated him to lose the promotion was fair enough that was the fortune of war but to lose the woman he loved was a bitter blow and one monk would not now have dealt to any man the trial of rhys duff had already begun the information he had was highly pertinent even if it offered little real help he should go and tell rathbone hester would be hurt how sylvestra duff would take the news that her husband was also a rapist he could not even imagine he crossed regent street barely noticing he was out of st giles and stopped to buy a hot cup of tea perhaps he should not tell rathbone it did not clear rhys of the murder of his father only of one rape with which he was not charged anyway but it was part of the truth and the truth mattered they had too little of it to make sense as it was rathbone had paid him to learn all he could he had promised hester he needed to cling on to his sense of honour the integrity and the trust of the friends he had now what he had been was acutely painful he had no memory of it no understanding did rhys duff understand himself that was irrelevant monk was a grown man and whether he remembered it or not he was responsible he was certainly in possession of all his faculties and answerable now his only reason for not facing himself was fear of what he would find and the gall to his pride effacing runcorn and admitting his remorse had he what it took courage he had been cruel arbitrary too hasty to judge but he had never been a liar and he had never ever been a coward he finished the last of his tea took a bun and paid for it then eating it as he went he started towards the police station he was obliged to wait until quarter past nine before runcorn arrived he looked warm and dry in his smart overcoat his face pink and freshly barbered his shoes shining he regarded monk soberly his gaze going from his dripping hair and his exhausted face hollow eyes down his wet coat to his sodden and filthy boots his expression was smug glowing with rich satisfaction you look on hard times monk he said cheerfully you want to come in and warm your feet perhaps youd like a cup of tea ive had one thank you monk said only sharp reminder inside himself of his contempt for cowardice kept him there and the thought of what hester would think of him if he were to fail the final confrontation now but ill come in i want to talk to you im busy runcorn replied but i suppose i can spare you fifteen minutes you look terrible he opened his office door and monk followed him in someone had already lit the fire and it was extremely pleasant there was a faint smell of beeswax and lavender polish sit down runcorn offered but take your coat off first or youll mark my chair ive spent the night in st giles monk said still standing you look like it runcorn retorted he wrinkled his nose and frankly you smell like it too i spoke to bessie mallard who is she and why are you telling me runcorn sat down and made himself comfortable she used to be a whore now she has a small boarding house she told me about the night they raided the brothel in cutters row and caught the magistrate gutteridge and he fell downstairs he stopped there was a tide of dull purple spreading up runcorns face his hands on the smooth desk top were curling into fists monk took a deep breath there was no evading it why did i hate you enough to let you do that i dont remember runcorn stared at him his eyes widening as he realised what monk was saying why do you care his voice was high a little hurting you ruined me with dora wasnt that what you wanted i dont know ive told you i cant remember but it was a vicious thing to do and i want to know why i did it runcorn blinked he was thrown off balance this was not the monk he thought he knew monk leaned forward over the desk staring down at him behind the freshly shaved face the mask of selfsatisfaction there was a man with a wound to his esteem which had never healed monk had done that or at least part of it he needed to know why im sorry he said aloud i wish i had not done it but i need to know why i did once we worked together trusted each other we went to st giles side by side never doubting each other what changed was it you or me runcorn sat silent for so long monk thought he was not going to answer he could hear the clatter of heavy feet outside and rain dripping from the eaves on to the window sill outside was the distant rumble of traffic in the street and a horse whinnying it was both of us runcorn spoke at last it began over the coat you could say coat what coat monk had no idea what he was talking about i got a new coat with a velvet collar you went and got one with fur just that bit better than mine we were going out to the same place to dine how stupid monk said immediately so i got back at you runcorn replied something to do with a girl i dont even know what now it just went from one thing to another until it got too big to go back on that was all just childish jealousies monk was horrified you lost the woman you loved over a coat collar the blood was dark in runcorns face it was more than that he said defensively it was he looked up at monk again his eyes hot and angry more honest than monk had ever seen them before for the first time he knew there was no veil between them it was a hundred things you undermining my authority with the men laughing at me behind my back taking credit for my ideas my arrests monk felt the void of ignorance swallowing him he did not know whether that was the truth or simply the way runcorn excused himself he hated it with the blind choking panic of helplessness he did not know he was fighting without weapons he might have been a man like that he did not feel it was himself but then how much had his accident changed him or was it simply that he had been forced to look at himself from the outside as a stranger might have and seeing himself had changed did i he said slowly why you why did i do that only to you why no one else what did you do to me runcorn looked miserable puzzled struggling with his thoughts monk waited he must not prompt a wrong word even one and the truth would slip away from him runcorn lifted his eyes to meet monks but he did not speak immediately i suppose i resented you he said at last you always seemed to have the right word to guess the right answers you always had luck on your side and you never gave anyone else any room you didnt forgive mistakes that was the damning indictment he did not forgive i should have he said gravely i was wrong in that i am sorry about dora i cant take it back now but i am sorry runcorn stared at him you are arent you he said in amazement he took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh you did well with the duff case thank you it was as close as he could come to an acceptance it was good enough monk nodded he could not allow the lie to remain it would break the fragile bridge he had just built at such a cost i havent finished with it yet im not sure about the motive the father was responsible for at least one of the rapes in st giles himself and he was in seven dials regularly what runcorn could scarcely believe what he seemed to have heard thats impossible it doesnt make any sense monk i know but it is true i have a dozen witnesses one who saw him smeared with blood the night before christmas eve when there was a rape in st giles and mrs kynaston and lady sandon will swear rhys duff was with them at the time miles away were not charging rhys duff with rape runcorn frowned now thoroughly disturbed he was a good enough policeman to see the implications monk did not argue further it was unnecessary im obliged runcorn said shaking his head monk nodded hesitated a moment then excused himself and went out to go home and bathe and sleep then he must go and tell rathbone chapter twelve the trial of rhys duff had commenced on the previous day the court was filled and an hour before it began the ushers closed the doors the preliminaries had already been conducted the jury were chosen the judge a handsome man of military appearance and the marks of pain in his face called the court to order he had come in with a pronounced limp and sat a trifle awkwardly in his high carved chair in order to accommodate a stiff leg the prosecution was conducted by ebenezer goode a man of curious and exuberant appearance well known and respected by rathbone he was unhappy with proceeding against someone as obviously ill as rhys duff but he abhorred not only the crime with which he was charged but the earlier ones which had provided the motive he willingly made concession to rhyss medical needs by allowing him to sit in the dock high above the body of the court and railed off in a padded chair to offer what comfort there was for his physical pain he also had made no demur when rathbone had asked that rhys not be handcuffed at any time so he might move if he wished or was able to and sit in whatever position gave him the least discomfort corriden wade was in court and could be called should he be needed and so was hester they were both to be allowed immediate access to the prisoner if he showed any need for their attention or assistance nevertheless as the testimony began rhys was alone as he faced a bitterly hostile crowd his accusers and his judges there was no one to speak for him except rathbone standing a solitary figure blackgowned whitewigged a fragile barrier against a tide of hatred goode called his witnesses one after the other the women who had found the two bodies constable shotts and john evan he took evan carefully step by step through his investigation not dwelling on the horror but permitting it to be passionately conveyed through evans white face and broken husky voice he called dr riley who spoke quietly and in surprisingly simple language of leighton duffs terrible wounds and the death he must have suffered and the accused goode asked standing in the middle of the floor like a great crow his arms dangling in his gown his aquiline face with its pale eyes reflected vividly the horror and the sense of tragedy he felt unmistakably deeply hester had liked him ever since first meeting him in the stonefield case staring around the courtroom more to judge the emotion of the crowd than to note who was present she was lent a moments real happiness to see enid ravensbrook her face smoothed of its earlier suffering her eyes gentle and bright as she watched goode a smile on her lips hester looked more closely and saw there was a gold wedding band on her hand not the one she had worn earlier but a new one for an instant she forgot the present ache of fear and tragedy but it was brief reality returned with rileys answer he was also very severely injured he said quietly there was barely a sound in the room there were faint rustles tiny movements a sigh of breath the jurors never took their eyes from the proceedings a great deal of blood goode pressed riley hesitated no one moved no he said at last when a person is kicked and punched there are terrible bruises but the skin is not necessarily broken there was some especially where his ribs were cracked one had pierced the skin and on his back there the flesh had been ripped there was a gasp of indrawn breath in the room several of the jurors looked very white but sergeant evan said that the accuseds clothes were soaked in blood dr riley goode pointed out where did that come from if not from his injuries i assume from the dead man riley replied his wounds were more severe and there were several places where the skin was broken but i am surprised he bled so badly and there were no wounds on the accused to account for such blood riley pressed no there were not thank you dr riley rathbone rose it was a forlorn hope but he had nothing else he must try anything no matter how remote he had no idea what monk would produce and there were always the possibilities that involved arthur and duke kynaston dr riley have you any way of knowing whose blood it was on rhys duffs clothes no sir riley answered without the least resentment the smooth expression of his face suggested he had no conviction in the matter himself only a sadness that the whole event should have happened at all so it could belong to a third or even a fourth person whom we have not yet mentioned it could were there such a person the jury looked bemused the judge watched rathbone anxiously but he did not intervene thank you rathbone nodded that is all i have to ask you sir goode called corriden wade who reluctantly palefaced his voice barely heard admitted that rhyss injuries could not have produced the blood described on his clothes not once did he look up to the dock where rhys sat motionless his face twisted in an unreadable expression a mixture of helpless bitterness and blazing anger nor did wade appear to look towards the gallery where sylvestra sat next to eglantyne both of them watching him intently he kept his eyes undeviatingly on goode confirming that the events of that night of his fathers death had rendered rhys incapable of communication either by speech or by writing he was able only to nod or shake his head he expressed the deepest concern for his wellbeing and would not commit himself to any certainty that he would recover goode hesitated as if to ask him further as to his knowledge of rhyss personality but after the vaguest of beginnings he changed his mind there was nothing for him to prove but the facts and to explore the growth of motive only opened the way for rathbone to suggest insanity he thanked wade and returned to his seat rathbone took his place he knew wade was as sympathetic a witness as he would get apart from hester whom he could find no excuse to call and yet he had nothing to ask wade which would not do more harm than good he needed something from monk as desperately as he ever had and he did not even know what to hope for let alone to seek or to suggest he stood in the middle of the floor feeling alone and ridiculous the jury were waiting for him to say something to begin to fight back he had done nothing so far except make a gesture about the blood one which he knew no one believed should he ask wade about the deterioration of rhyss character and lay grounds for a plea of insanity at least in mitigation he thought it was what sylvestra wanted it was the only thing which was comprehensible for such an act but it was not a defence in law not for rhys he may be evil acting from a different set of moral beliefs from anyone else in this crowded room but he was not insane in any sense that he did not understand either the law or the nature of his acts there was nothing whatever to suggest he suffered delusions thank you dr wade he said with confidence he was far from feeling i believe you have known rhys most of his life is that correct i have wade agreed and been his physician when he required one yes were you aware of there being a serious and violent disagreement with his father and if so over what subject it was a question to which wade would find it extremely difficult to answer in the affirmative if he admitted it it would seem incompetent that he had not done anything to forestall this tragedy it would seem like wisdom after the event and sylvestra would see it as a betrayal as indeed so might some of the jury dr wade he prompted wade raised his head and stared at him resolutely i was aware of a certain tension between them he answered his voice stronger full of regret i thought it the normal resentment a son might have for the discipline a father naturally exerts he bit his lip and drew in a deep breath i had no idea whatever it would end like this i blame myself i should have been more aware i have had a great deal of experience with men of all ages and under extreme pressure during my service in the navy a ghost of a smile touched his mouth and then vanished i suppose closer to home in people for whom one has affection one is loath to recognise such things it was a clever answer honest and yet without committing himself and it earned the jurys respect rathbone could see it in their faces he would have been wiser not to have asked but it was too late now you did not foresee it he repeated no wade said quietly looking down i did not god forgive me rathbone hesitated on the brink of asking him if he thought rhys insane and decided against it no answer either way could help enough to be worth the risk thank you dr wade that is all goode had already established the violence of the fight and the fact that leighton duff and rhys had been involved and there was no reason to suspect anyone else being there he called the duff household servants deeply against their will and obliged them to testify to the quarrel the evening of leighton duffs death and the time both men had left the house at least he spared sylvestra the distress of testifying all the time rhys sat propped up in the dock his skin ashen pale his eyes seeming enormous in his haggard face a prison warder on either side of him perhaps more to support him than to restrain he did not look capable of offering any resistance let alone an attempt to escape rathbone forced himself to put the thought of him out of his mind he must use intelligence rather than emotion let anyone else feel all the compassion they could his brain must be clear there seemed no way of casting the slightest doubt reasonable or unreasonable on rhyss physical guilt and he was struggling without a glimmer of hope to think of any mitigation where was monk he dared not look at hester he could imagine too clearly the panic she must be feeling through the afternoon and the next day goode brought on a troop of witnesses who placed rhys in st giles over a period of months not one of them could be cast doubt upon rathbone had to stand by and watch there was no argument to make the judge adjourned the court early it seemed as if there was little left to do but sum up the case goode had proved every assertion he had made there was no alternative to offer except that rhys had been whoring in st giles and his father had confronted him they had quarrelled and rhys had killed him goode had avoided mentioning the rapes but if rathbone challenged him that the motive for murder was too slender to believe then he would undoubtedly bring in the beaten women still bearing their scars he had said as much it was only rhyss desperate condition which stayed his hand fortune had already punished him appallingly and the conviction for murder would be sufficient to have him hanged there was no need for more rathbone left the courtroom feeling he had been defeated without offering even the semblance of a fight he had done nothing for rhys he had not begun to fulfill the trust hesterand sylvestra had placed in him he was ashamed and yet he could think of nothing to say which would do rhys the slightest service certainly he could harass witnesses object to goodes questions his tactics his logic or anything else but it would serve no purpose except to give the effect of a defence it would be a sham he knew it hester would know it would it even be of comfort to rhys or offer him false hope at least he should have the courage to go to rhys now and not escape as he would so much rather when he reached rhys hester was already there she turned as she heard rathbones step her eyes desperate pleading for some hope any hope at all they sat together in the grey cell below the old bailey rhys was in physical pain muscles clenched broken hands shaking he looked hopeless hester sat next to him her arm around his shoulders rathbone was at his wits end rhys he said tensely you have got to tell us what happened i want to defend you but i have nothing with which to do it his own muscles were knotted tight his hands balled into fists of frustration i have no weapons did you kill him rhys shook his head perhaps an inch in either direction but the denial was clear someone else did again the tiny movement but definitely a nod do you know who a nod a bitter smile tremblinglipped has it anything to do with your mother a very slight shrug of the shoulders then a shake no an enemy of your fathers rhys turned away jerking his head his hands starting to bang on his thighs jolting the splints hester grabbed his wrists stop it she said loudly you must tell us rhys dont you understand they will find you guilty if we cannot prove it was someone else or at least that it could have been he nodded slowly but would not face her there was nothing left but the violence of the truth they will hang you rathbone said deliberately rhyss throat moved as if he would say something then he swung away from them again and refused to look at them any more hester stared at rathbone her eyes filled with tears he stood still for a minute then another there was nothing to say or do he sighed and left as he was walking along the passage he passed corriden wade going in at least he might be able to offer some physical relief or even a draught of some sort strong enough to give a few hours sleep further along he encountered sylvestra looking so distraught she seemed on the verge of collapse at least she had fidelis kynaston with her rathbone spent the evening alone in his rooms unable to eat or even to sit at his fire he paced the floor his mind turning over one useless fact after another when his butler came to announce that monk was in the hall monk rathbone grasped at the very name as if it had been a raft for a drowning man monk bring him in immediately monk looked tired and pale his hair dripped and his face was shining wet well rathbone demanded finding himself gulping air his hands stiff a tingling in his arms what have you i dont know monk answered bleakly i have no idea whether it makes things better or even worse leighton duff was one of the rapists in seven dials and then later in st giles rathbone was stunned what he said his voice high with disbelief it was preposterous totally absurd he must have misunderstood what did you say leighton duff was one of the rapists in both areas monk repeated i have several people who will identify him in particular a cabby who saw him in st giles on the night before christmas eve with blood on his hands and face just after one of the worst rapes and rhys was in lowndes square at a quiet evening with mrs kynaston arthur kynaston and lady sandon and her son rathbone felt a sense of shock so great the room seemed to sway around him you are sure he said and the instant the words were off his tongue he knew how foolish they were it was plain in monks face anyway he would not have come with such news were he not certain beyond any doubt at all monk did not bother to answer he sat down uninvited close to the fire he was still shivering and he looked exhausted i dont know what it means he continued staring past rathbone at the empty chair opposite him but mostly at something he could see within his own mind perhaps rhys was not involved in that rape but he was in some or all of the others he said perhaps not certainly leighton duff did not follow his son in any sense of outrage or horror at what he had done and then in righteous indignation confront him with it he turned to rathbone who was still standing on the same spot im sorry all it means is that we have misunderstood the motive it doesnt prove anything else i dont know what you want to make of it how is the trial going appallingly rathbone replied at last moving to the other chair and sitting down stiffly i have nothing to fight with i suppose this will at least provide ammunition with which to open up the whole issue as to what happened it will raise doubts it will certainly prolong the trial he smiled bitterly it will shake ebenezer goode a well of horror opened up inside him it will shatter mrs duff yes i know that monk replied very quietly but it is the truth and if you allow rhys to be hanged for something of which he is not guilty none of us can then undo that or call him back from the gallows and the grave there is a certain kind of freedom in the truth whatever it is at least your decisions are founded on reality you can learn to live with them rathbone looked at him closely there was at once a pain and the beginning of a kind of peace in his face which he had not seen before his weariness held within it the possibility of rest yes he agreed thank you monk you had better give me the names of these people and all the details and of course your account you have done very well deliberately he blocked from his mind the thought of having to tell hester what he now knew it was sufficient for the night that he should work out his strategy for rhys rathbone worked until six in the morning and after two hours sleep a hot bath and breakfast he faced the courtroom again there was no air of expectation there were even some empty seats in the spectators gallery it had degenerated from high drama into simple tragedy it was not interesting any more rathbone had had messengers out all night monk was in court in the dock rhys looked white and ill he was obviously in physical pain as well as mental turmoil although there was now an air of despair about him which made rathbone believe he no longer hoped for anything except an end to his ordeal sylvestra sat like a woman in a nightmare unable to move or speak beside her on one side was fidelis kynaston on the other eglantyne wade rathbone was pleased she would not be alone and yet possibly to have to hear the things she was going to in the company of friends would be harder one might wish to absorb such shock in the privacy of solitude where one could weep unobserved yet everyone would know it was not as if she could cover it as one can some family secrets perhaps better they heard it in court than whispered distorted by telling and retelling either way rathbone had no choice in the matter he had not told sylvestra what he expected to uncover today she was not his client rhys was anyway he had had no time no opportunity to explain to her what it was he knew and he could not foresee what his witnesses would testify he simply had nothing to lose on rhyss behalf sir oliver the judge prompted my lord rathbone acknowledged the defence calls mrs vida hopgood the judge looked surprised but he made no remark there was a slight stir of movement in the crowd vida took the stand looking nervous her chin high her shoulders squared her magnificent hair half hidden under her hat rathbone began immediately he was hideously unsure of her but he had had no time to prepare he was fighting for survival and there was nothing else mrs hopgood what is your husbands occupation e as a factry she replied carefully wot makes shirts an the like and he employs women to sew these shirts and the like rathbone asked in the gallery someone tittered it was nervousness they could not be any more highly strung than he was yeah vida agreed ebenezer goode rose to his feet yes mr goode the judge forestalled him sir oliver has mr hopgoods occupation got anything to do with mr duffs guilt or innocence in this case yes my lord rathbone replied without hesitation the women he employs are profoundly pertinent to the issue indeed they are the true victims in this tragedy there was a ripple of amazement around the room several of the jurors looked confused and annoyed in the dock rhys moved position and a spasm of pain twisted his face the judge also seemed unhappy if you are going to demonstrate to the court that they were abused in some way sir oliver that will not help your clients cause the fact that they can or cannot identify their assailants will distress them and give you nothing in fact it will only damage your clients sympathies still further if it is your intention to plead insanity then practical evidence is required and of a very specific nature as i am sure you know very well you have pleaded not guilty are you now wishing to change that plea no my lord rathbone heard his words drop into a well of silence and wondered if he had just made an appalling mistake what was rhys himself thinking of him no my lord i have no cause to believe that my client is not of sane mind then proceed with questioning mrs hopgood the judge directed but come to your point as rapidly as you are able i shall not allow you to waste the courts time and patience with delaying tactics rathbone knew how very close to the truth that charge was thank you my lord he said graciously and turned back to vida mrs hopgood have you suffered a shortage of workers lately yeah lot o sickness she replied she knew what he wished she was an intelligent woman and articulate in her own fashion or more like injury took me a fair bit o argybargy but i got it aht of em wot ad appened she looked questioningly at rathbone and then seeing his expression continued with feeling they do a bit o dolly mop stuff on the side beggin yer pardon sir i mean takes the odd gent ere an there teradd a bit extra well their children is ungry or the like we understand rathbone assured her then explained for the jury you mean they practise a little amateur prostitution when times are particularly hard int that wot i said yeah cant blame em poor cows oos gonna watch their children starvin and not do sum mink abaht it int uman she drew breath like i said some of em was doin a bit on the side like well first orff they got cheated outa pay got no pimps ter look arter em yer see her handsome face darkened with anger then it got worse these geezers dont ony cheat they started roughin em up knockin em around like first it were just a bit then it got worse her expression twisted till the anger and pain in it were stark to see some of em got beat pretty bad bones broke teef an noses broke kicked some of em were some of em was ony bits o children their selves so i got a bit o money tergether an ired me self someone ter find out oo wos doin it she stopped abruptly staring at rathbone dyer want meter say oo i got an wot e found no thank you mrs hopgood rathbone replied you have laid an excellent foundation for us to discern from these poor women themselves what occurred just one more thing yeah how many women do you know of who were beaten in this way in seven dials abaht twenyodd as i knows of they went on ter st giles thank you mrs hopgood rathbone interrupted please tell us only your own experience goode rose again all we have heard so far is hearsay my lord mrs hopgood has not been a victim herself and she has not mentioned mr rhys duff i have been extraordinarily patient as was your lordship all this is tragic and abhorrent but completely irrelevant it is not irrelevant my lord rathbone argued the prosecutions case is that rhys duff went to the area of st giles to use prostitutes there and that his father followed him chastised him for his behaviour and in the resulting quarrel rhys killed his father and was severely injured himself therefore what happened to these women is fundamental to the case i have not claimed that these unfortunate women were raped my lord goode contradicted but if they were then that only adds to the brutality of the accuseds conduct and the validity of the motive no wonder his father charged him with grievous sin and would have chastened him severely possibly even threatened to turn him over to the law rathbone swung around to face him you have proved only that rhys used a prostitute in the area of st giles you have not proved violence of any sort against any women in st giles or in seven dials gentlemen the judge said sharply sir oliver if you are determined to prove this issue then you had better be absolutely certain you are aiding your clients cause and not further condemning him but if you are satisfied then prove your point proceed with dispatch thank you my lord he dismissed vida hopgood and one by one called half a dozen of the women of st giles whom monk had found he began with the earliest and least severely injured the court sat in uncomfortable nearsilence and listened to their pathetic tales of poverty illness desperation journeys out on to the streets to pick up a few pence by selling their bodies and the cheating then the violence which had followed rathbone loathed doing it the women were greyfaced almost inarticulate with fear and in some cases also shame they despised themselves for what they did but need drove them they hated standing in this handsome courtroom facing exquisitely gowned and wigged lawyers the judge in his scarlet robes and having to tell of their need their humiliation and their pain rathbone glanced at the jurors faces and read a sense of different emotions in them he watched how much their imaginations conceived of the lives that were being described how many of them if any had used such women themselves what did they feel now shame anger pity or revulsion more than half of them looked up to the dock at rhys whose face was twisted with emotion but what aroused his anger it was impossible to say or the revulsion which was so plain in his features rathbone looked also at sylvestra duff and saw her lips puckered with horror as a world opened up in front of her beyond anything she had imagined women whose lives were so utterly unlike her own they could have belonged to a different species and yet they lived only a few miles away in the same city and her son had used them could even for all she knew have begotten a child upon them beside her fidelis kynaston looked pale but less shocked there was in her already a knowledge of pain of the darker side of the world and those who lived in it this was only a restatement of things she already knew on her other side eglantyne wade was motionless as wave after wave of misery passed over her things she had never imagined were rehearsed before her in sickening detail the following day the stories became more violent the witnesses still carried the marks of beatings on their blackened and swollen faces showed their broken teeth ebenezer goode hesitated before questioning each one none of them recognised their assailants every brutal act only added to his case why should he challenge any of it to demonstrate that the women were prostitutes anyway was unnecessary there was not a man or woman in the room who did not know it and feel their own emotions regarding their trade and its place in society or in their own personal lives it was a subject of emotion rather than reason anyway words were only a froth on the surface of the deep tide of feeling a particular wave of revulsion and anger swelled when the thirteenyearold lily barker testified still nursing her dislocated shoulder haltingly she told rathbone how both she and her sister had been beaten and kicked she repeated the grunted words of abuse she had heard and how she had tried to crawl away and hide in the dark fidelis kynaston looked so ashen rathbone thought she suffered more in hearing it than sylvestra beside her the judge leaned forward his own face tight with distress have you not established all you need sir oliver surely no more can be necessary this is a horrifying matter of escalating violence and brutality what more do you require to show us make your point i have one more victim of rape my lord this one was in st giles very well i realise you need to establish that your assailants have moved into the relevant area but make it brief my lord rathbone called the woman who had been raped and beaten on the night before christmas eve her face was bruised purple and swollen she had difficulty speaking through her broken teeth slowly her eyes closed as she refused to look at the people who were watching her as she rehearsed her terror and pain and humiliation she began to describe being accosted by three men how one of them had taken hold of her how all three had laughed then one had thrown her to the ground in the dock rhys was greyskinned his eyes so hollow one could almost visualise the skull beneath the flesh he leaned forward over the rail his splinted hands stiff shivering the woman described how she had been taunted by the men called names one of them had kicked her told her she was filth should be got rid of the human race cleansed of her sort in the dock rhys started to bang his hands up and down on the railing one of the warders made a move to stop him but the muscles of his body were knotted so hard he did not succeed his face was a mask of pain no one else moved the woman in the witness stand went on speaking slowly each word forced between her lips she told how they had knocked her over till she was crouching on the cobbles they were and an wet she said huskily then one ofem leaned on top o me e were cavy and e smelled o sum mink funny sort o sharp one o the others forced me knees up and tore me dress then i felt im come in terme it was like i were tore inside it urt sum mink terrible i she stopped her eyes wide with horror as rhys wrenched himself from the warders his mouth gaping his throat tortured with the sound it could not make as if inside himself he screamed again and again a warder made a lunge after him and caught one arm rhys lashed at him his face a paroxysm of terror and loathing the other warder made a grab and missed rhys overbalanced hysterical with fear teetered for a moment on the high railing then swivelled and fell over the edge a woman shrieked the jurors rose to their feet sylvestra cried out his name and fidelis clasped her arms around her rhys landed with a sickening crash and lay still hester was the first to move she rose from her seat in the back of the gallery on the edge of the row where she could be reached were she needed and ran forward falling on her knees beside him then suddenly there was commotion everywhere people were crying out jostling one another others had been hurt two of them badly press reporters were scrambling to force their way out to pass on the news ushers were trying helplessly to restore some form of order the judge was banging his gavel someone was shouting for a doctor for a woman whose leg had been broken by an overturned bench rathbone swung around to make his way towards where rhys was lying where was corriden wade had he been seized to tend to the woman rathbone did not even know if rhys was still alive or not with the height of the fall he could easily be dead it is not difficult to break a neck the thought crossed his mind that perhaps it would be a merciful escape from a more prolonged and dreadful end was it even suicide in hearing the full horror of his crime told from the victims view her feelings of shame humiliation helplessness and pain was this the nearest he could come to some kind of redemption was this rathbones final failure or perhaps the only thing he had truly done for him except that rhys had not raped the woman he had been playing cards with lady sandon it was leighton duff who had first raped and then beaten her leighton duff and who else the uproar in the courtroom was overwhelming people were shouting trying to clear the way for a stretcher someone was screaming again and again uselessly hysterically all around him people were pushing and shoving trying to move one way or another bent over rhyss body hester for one desperate moment had the same thought that passed through rathbones mind was this rhyss escape at last from the pain of body which afflicted him and from the greater agony of mind which haunted even his sleep was this the only peace he could find in a world which had become one long nightmare then she touched him and knew he was still alive she slid her hand under his head feeling the thick hair she felt the bone gently exploring there was no depression in the skull she pulled her hand clear there was no blood his legs were twisted but his spine was straight as far as she could tell he was concussed but not fatally injured where was corriden wade she looked up peering around and saw no one she recognised but there was a huddle of people where the bench was overturned and someone was lying on the floor even rathbone was beyond the crowd jostling beside and in front of her then she saw monk and felt a surge of relief he was elbowing his way forward angry whitefaced he was shouting at someone a large man clenched his fist and seemed intent on making a fight of it someone else began pulling at him two more women were crying for no apparent reason monk finally forced his way through and knelt beside her is he alive he asked yes but weve got to get him out of here she responded hearing her voice sharp with fear he looked down at rhys who was still completely insensible thank god he cant feel this he said quietly ive sent the warder for one of those long benches we could carry him on that weve got to get him to a hospital she said desperately he cant stay in the cell i dont know how badly hes hurt monk opened his mouth as if to reply then changed his mind one of the warders had come downstairs from the dock and was pushing people aside to reach rhys poor devil he said laconically best for im if ed killed is self but since e int dead well do for im what we can ere miss let me get im up onter the bench wot toms bringin well take him to the nearest hospital she said rising shakily and only just avoiding falling over her own skirts sorry miss but we gotta take im back to is cell es a prisoner hes hardly going to escape she said furiously all her helplessness and pain welling up in useless anger for a moment hes totally insensible you fool look at him yes miss the warder said stolidly but the law is the law well put im back in is cell an yer can stay wif im if yer don mind bein locked in wif im no doubt theyll send a doctor well they get one of course ill stay with him she choked and fetch dr wade immediately well try miss is there any fink as yer want for im water like or a little brandy im sure as i could get a little brandy for yer she controlled herself with an effort the man was doing his best thank you yes get me both water and brandy please the other warder appeared along with two more men carrying a wooden bench with surprising gentleness they picked rhys up and laid him on it then carried it out of the courtroom pushing past onlookers and out through the doors and down the hallway toward the cells hester followed hardly aware of the people around her of the curious stares and the mutters and calls all she could think of was how badly was rhys hurt and why had he thrown himself over was it an accident as he tried to escape the warders and they attempted to restrain him or had he intended to kill himself had he lost every last vestige of hope or had he been lying all the time and he had both mlled his father and raped and beaten those women she refused to believe that not unless and until she had to as long as there was a nicker of any other possibility she would cling to it but what possibility what other conceivable explanation was there she racked her imagination and her memory then one occurred to her one so extreme and so horrible she stumbled as she followed the warders and all but fell she was shaking she felt cold and sick and her mind raced for any way at all in which she could learn if it were true and prove it and she knew why rhys could not speak why even if he could he would not she ran a step or two to catch up with them and as soon as they were at the cells she swung round to face the warders thank you bring me the brandy and water then leave us alone i will do what i can for him it was a race against time dr wade or some other physician would be bound to come soon if she was right it must not be corriden wade but she must know anyone interrupting what she now meant to do would be horrified she might even be prosecuted certainly she would jeopardise her career if it was corriden wade she might even lose her life the warder disappeared leaving the door open and his companion waited just outside how should she begin to save time yer all right miss yes of course i am thank you i am a nurse i have treated many injured men before i shall just examine him to see where he is most seriously hurt it will help the doctor when he comes where is the brandy and the water a little will do just hurry her hands were shaking her mouth was dry she could feel her heart lurching and knocking in her chest rhys was still completely unconscious once he stirred there would be nothing she could do she must not ask the warder to hurry again or he would become suspicious she unfastened rhyss collar and took off his tie she undid the buttons of his shirt and eased it open very gently she began to examine the upper part of his body there were no bandages there was little one could do for bruising except ointment such as arnica the worst of it was beginning to heal now the broken ribs were knitted well even though she knew they still caused him pain especially if he coughed sneezed or turned badly in the bed where was the warder with the brandy and the water it seemed like ages since he had gone carefully she unfastened the waist of his trousers this was where his worst injuries were the ones which dr wade had treated and not permitted her to see for the sake of rhyss modesty she slipped the waist down a few inches and saw the blue and purple bruising now fading the abrasions were still marked where he had been kicked but the edges were yellowish and far paler she could feel no bandaging miss she froze yes water miss the warder said quietly and a drop o brandy is e urt bad im not sure yet thank you for these she straightened up and took the dish of water from him then the brandy she set them on the small table thank you very much you can lock me in i shall be perfectly all right come back and let me know when the doctor comes knock on the door if you will i shall get him ready yes miss yer sure yer all right yer look terrible pale mebbe yer should take a sip o that brandy yerself she tried to smile and felt it sickly on her face maybe thank you right miss you knock if yer need ter come out i will yes now i had better see what i can do for him thank you at last he went and she was left alone she swung around to rhys and started immediately there was no time to be lost they could return with a doctor any moment there was no way on earth she could explain what she was doing if she were mistaken it would probably ruin her even if she were right but could not prove it she pulled open his trousers and his underclothes revealing his body as far as his thighs there were no bandages at all no plasters no lint no adhesives there was only the most fearful bruising as if he had been repeatedly kicked and punched sick in her stomach she rolled him over to lie on his face and began the examination which would tell her what she needed to know although the slow trickle of blood even now and the purplish and torn flesh was enough it took her only moments then with shaking hands fumbling fingers stiff she pulled the clothes back up and rolled him over almost knocking him off the narrow bench she tried to fasten his trousers but she had them crooked and they would not reach she snatched his jacket and threw it over him just as his eyes fluttered open rhys she choked on the word the anguish inside her spilling out her throat aching her hands trembling and clumsy he gasped drawing in his breath he was fighting her trying to lash out force her away rhys she clung on to his arms above the splints her fingers digging into his flesh rhys i know what happened to you its not your fault you are not the only one ive known soldiers it happened to brave men fighting men he started to shake trembling so violently she could not keep him still even holding him in her arms the fierceness of his anger shook her too he sobbed great racking desperate cries and she rocked back and forth her arms around him her hand stroking his head it was not until she had been doing so for several minutes time she could not count that she realised she could hear him he was weeping with a voice something in his despair in the fall or the knowledge that she knew had returned his speech who was it she said urgently you must tell me although she was certain with an aching coldness that she knew there was only one explanation as to why no one had known before why corriden wade had not told anyone not told her or rathbone it explained so much rhyss fear his cruelty and rejection of his mother his silence she remembered with a sick pain the bell removed to the dresser out of his reach ill protect you she promised fiercely ill see that the warders are with you all the time or i will be every moment i swear now tell me slowly in agonised and broken words in a whisper as if he could not bear to hear it himself he told her of the night his father died the door burst open and corriden wade came in bag in his hand his face haggard his eyes dark and furious the two warders were just behind him looming awkwardly what are you doing miss latterly wade demanded staring at rhyss white strained face and wild eyes leave me to my patient please he is obviously deeply distressed he turned to the warders i shall need clean water several bowls of it and bandages perhaps miss latterly can go and obtain those she will be aware of my needs i think not hester said abruptly moving to stand between rhys and wade she looked at the warder please will you fetch sir oliver rathbone immediately mr duff wants to make a statement it is imperative you do this with all possible speed i am sure you understand the urgency and the importance mr duff cannot speak wade said with contempt this tragedy has obviously unnerved miss latterly not surprisingly perhaps you had better take her out see if you can fetch sir oliver hester repeated loudly facing the warder go the man hesitated the doctors authority he understood he would always obey a man before a woman any woman fetch my lawyer rhys said hoarsely i want to make a statement before i die the blood drained from wades face the warder gasped go get im joe he said quickly ill wait ere the other warder turned on his heel and obeyed hester stood without moving this is preposterous wade began as if he would push his way past but the warder took him by the shoulder medicine was beyond him but dying statements he understood let go of me wade commanded furiously im sorry sir the warder said stiffly but well wait for the lawyer afore we start any treatment on the prisoner es well enough for now the nurse ere saw ter im you jus stand ere patient like an as soon as the lawyers done is bit you can treat all yer need wade opened his mouth as if to argue and saw the futility of it he stood as if trapped with no hope of escape rhys looked at hester she smiled back at him then turned and remained facing wade and the warder she felt sick with disillusion the minutes ticked by rathbone came in eyes wide face flushed i want rhys began then took a shuddering breath i want to tell you what happened silently corriden wade turned and left although there was nowhere now for him to go court resumed in the afternoon rhys was not present having been taken back to the hospital and put in the care of dr riley but under a police guard he was still accused of a fearful crime the gallery was surprisingly empty there were spare seats in every row people had assumed that rhyss pitch over the railing had been an attempt at suicide and therefore a tacit admission of guilt there was no longer any real interest it was all over bar the verdict the three women sylvestra duff eglantyne wade and fidelis kynaston sat together very clearly visible now they did not look at each other but there was a closeness in them a silent companionship which was apparent to anyone who regarded them carefully the judge called the court to order and commanded rathbone to proceed the jurors looked grim but resigned as if their duty had been taken from them and they were there only as a matter of form but purposeless thank you my lord rathbone acknowledged i call mrs fidelis kynaston there was a murmur of surprise as fidelis whitefaced walked across the floor and climbed the steps she took the oath and looked at rathbone with her head high but her hands on the railing were clenched as if she needed its presence to support her mrs kynaston he began gently did you have a party in your home on the night before christmas eve she had known what he was going to say her voice was hoarse when she answered yes who was present my two sons rhys duff lady sandon rufus sandon and myself at what time did rhys duff leave your house about two oclock in the morning there was a sudden rustle of sound in the gallery one of the jurors started forward are you certain as to the time mrs kynaston rathbone pressed i am positive she replied looking straight ahead at him as if he were an executioner if you were to ask lady sandon or any of my household staff they would tell you the same thing so the men who raped the unfortunate woman in st giles at around midnight could not possibly have included rhys duff no she swallowed her throat tight they could not thank you mrs kynaston that is all i have to ask you goode considered for a moment or two then declined his opportunity rathbone called the cabby joseph roscoe roscoe described the man he had seen leaving st giles his hands and face smeared with blood rathbone produced a picture of leighton duff and showed it to him is this the man you saw roscoe did not hesitate yes sir thats im my lord this is a likeness of leighton duff whom mr roscoe has identified he got no further the noise in the court was like the backwash of the sea sylvestra sat frozen her face a mask of blank unbelieving horror beside her eglantyne wade supported her weight fidelis was rigid still staring at the cab driver the jurors stared from the witness to rathbone and back again the judge was grave and deeply disturbed are you certain of your ground sir oliver are you claiming that leighton duff not rhys duff was the rapist in all these fearful cases yes my lord rathbone said with conviction leighton duff was one of three rhys duff had nothing to do with them he did indeed go to st giles and there use the services of a prostitute but he paid the price asked and he exercised no violence whatever it is a practice about which we may all have our moral judgements but it is not a crime and it is certainly not rape nor is it murder then who murdered leighton duff sir oliver he did not commit suicide it seems apparent he and rhys fought and rhys survived while he did not i shall explain my lord with your permission you must do more than explain sir oliver you must prove it to this court and this jury beyond a reasonable doubt that is what i intend my lord to that end i call miss hester latterly to the stand there was a slight stir of interest heads craned as hester walked across the floor and up the steps faced rathbone and took the oath what is your occupation miss latterly rathbone began almost conversationally i am a nurse do you presently have a patient yes i have been employed to nurse rhys duff since he returned from the hospital after the incident in water lane was there also a doctor in attendance dr corriden wade he has been the family physician for many years i understand the judge leaned forward please restrict yourself to what you know miss latterly im sorry my lord have you any experience in the army of men injured in the same manner and degree as rhys duff was miss latterly yes i nursed many injured soldiers in scutari there was a murmur of approval around the gallery two of the jurors nodded did you treat his injuries yourself or merely nurse him keep him clean feed him attend to his wants rathbone must be careful how he phrased his questions so far no one else seemed to have the slightest idea what he was seeking to prove he must not lead her neither must he leave any doubt in their minds once he had shown them the truth goode was listening intently i treated those wounds above the waist hester replied they were bruises very severe and the broken bones in his hands and two broken ribs there was very little to be done for them the injuries below the waist dr wade told me he bandaged this was for the sake of mr duffs sensibilities i see so you never observed them yourself that is correct but you accepted dr wades word for their nature and degree and that they were healing as well as could be expected yes the judge leaned forward again sir oliver do the nature or site of mr duffs wounds have any relevance to whether he was responsible for his fathers death i admit i fail to see it yes my lord they do rathbone turned to hester miss latterly was mr duff subject to any unusual degree of emotional turmoil during the time you cared for him goode rose to his feet my lord miss latterly did not know mr duff before the tragedy she cannot know if his distress was usual or not the judge looked at rathbone sir oliver mr goodes point is a fair one my lord i meant was he subject to emotions extraordinary in a man in his condition miss latterly has nursed many men severely injured i think she is in a better position than almost anyone else to know what to expect i agree the judge nodded you may answer miss latterly yes my lord rhys had the most appalling nightmares when he would try to cry out beat his arms even though his hands were broken and it must have caused him fearful pain and he would try to scream and yet when he was awake he refused absolutely to respond to questions about the incident and became extremely distressed to the point of violent reaction against people especially his mother when any pressure was placed upon him and what did you conclude from that rathbone asked i did not conclude anything i was puzzled i i feared perhaps he had indeed killed his father and the memory of it was unbearable to him are you still of that opinion no why not she drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly in the courtroom no one moved goode was frowning listening to her intently because when i saw him fall this morning she replied i remembered for an instant something i had learned of in the army it seemed too appalling to be true but in his cell where they carried him i was alone with him for several minutes before the doctor came i made a very brief examination of his injuries below the waist she stopped her face was filled with pain rathbone wished he did not have to make her say this but there was no possible alternative she saw it in his eyes and did not flinch he had been raped she said very quietly but very clearly rhys was the rapists last victim there was a gasp and then utter silence except for a moan from sylvestra as such pain of mind tore through her as was beyond bearing rhys and his father quarrelled because rhys knew a little of what was happening his father had criticised him for using prostitutes and the hypocrisy of it infuriated him but for his mothers sake he could not be open about it he flung out of the house and went to st giles by chance so did his father she took a breath and her voice became huskier the three of them set on him in water lane she went on and although it was hearsay goode did not interrupt her his extraordinary face was creased with horror they knocked him down and raped him she continued as they had done the women and perhaps other young men we may never know then as he struggled and cried out one of them stopped realising who he was it was leighton duff who had just raped and beaten his own son her voice was hoarse he attempted to defend him from further beating but his companions had gone too far to retreat if they let him live he would stand to accuse them it was they who killed leighton duff and who believed they had killed rhys eglantyne wade sat helplessly fidelis held sylvestra and rocked her back and forth oblivious of the crowd whose pity welled around them how can you possibly know this miss latterly rathbone asked because rhys has regained his speech she answered he told me and did he know the names of his other assailants yes it was joel kynaston his old headmaster and corriden wade his physician that was partial reason why he could not even attempt to tell anyone what had happened to him the other part was his total shame and humiliation eglantynes head jerked up her eyes wide her skin ashen she seemed to choke for breath there was no outward change in fidelis as if in her heart she was not surprised thank you miss latterly rathbone turned towards the judge about to make a plea and then stopped the judges face was engraved with a horror and pity so deep the sight of it shocked rathbone looked at the jurors and saw the same emotions mirrored in them except for the four whose disbelief could not grasp such a thing rape happened to women loose women who invited it it did not happen to a man any man men were inviolable at least in the intimacy of their bodies the horror and incomprehension left them stunned they sat staring blindly almost unaware of the room around them or of the strange shifting silence in the gallery rathbone looked at sylvestra duff she was so white she looked barely alive eglantyne wade sat with her head bowed forward her face covered by her hands only fidelis kynaston moved she still held sylvestra moving very slightly back and forth she seemed to be saying something to her bending close to her her expression was tender as if in this last agony she would bear some of it for her share both their burdens have you anything further to add sir oliver the judge broke the silence no my lord rathbone answered if anyone has doubts i will have further medical evidence obtained but i would very much rather not subject mr duff to any more pain or distress than he has already suffered he has sworn a statement as to what happened in water lane the night of his fathers death no doubt there will be further trials at which he will be required to testify which will be ordeal enough should he recover sufficiently both his health and his balance of mind in the meantime i am willing to rest on miss latterlys word the judge turned to ebenezer goode goode rose to his feet his face grave i am familiar with miss latterlys nursing experience my lord if she will verify for the court upon what she bases her judgement apart from mr duffs word i will abide by that the judge turned to hester with a bare minimum of words very quietly to a silent court she described the bruising and the tearing she had seen and likened it to other such injuries she had treated in the crimea and what the soldiers themselves had told her she was thanked and excused she returned to the body of the court feeling too numb with pity to be more than dimly aware of the press of people near her she did not even move immediately when she felt a man close to her and an arm around her you did the right thing monk said gently holding her with surprising strength as if he would support her weight you could not change the truth by concealing it some truths are better not known she whispered back i dont think so not truths like this they are only better learned at certain times and in certain ways what about sylvestra how will she bear it little by little a day at a time and by knowing that whatever is built upon now will last because it stands on reality not on lies you cannot make her brave that is something no one can do for someone else he stopped still holding her close but why she said almost to herself why did they risk everything to do something so pointless and even as she said it remarks of wades came back to her with utterly different meaning now remarks about nature refining the race by winnowing out the unfit the morally inferior and she remembered sylvestras stories of leighton duffs love of danger in his steeple chasing days the excitement of risks the elation of having taken a chance and beaten the odds what about kynaston she whispered to monk power he replied the power to terrify and humiliate perhaps the righteous image he created for his pupils parents was more than he could endure well probably never know frankly i dont care im a damned sight more concerned for the families they leave to struggle on for sylvestra and rhys i think fidelis kynaston will help she replied they will help each other and perhaps miss wade too they all have something appalling to face perhaps they will go to india she thought aloud all of them when rhys is better they couldnt stay here maybe he agreed although it is amazing what you can face if you have to he would tell her about runcorn some other time later on when they were alone and it was more appropriate theyd like india she insisted there is a great need for people out there who know something about nursing especially women i read it in amalias letters do they know anything about nursing he asked with a smile they could learn he smiled more widely but she did not see it the jury declined to retire they returned a verdict of not guilty hester slid her hand into monks and leaned even closer to him anne perry anne perry lives in portmahomack scotland
