clive cussler the kingdom fargo adventures prologue a land forgotten of the original one hundred forty could i be the last sentinel the grim thought swirled through dhakals mind the invaders main force had overrun his country from the east eight weeks earlier with brutal speed and cruelty cavalry and foot soldiers poured from the hills and swarmed into the valleys razed the villages to the ground and slaughtered all who stood before them along with the armies came elite bands of soldiers tasked with a single mission locate the sacred theurang and bring it to their king having foreseen this the sentinels whose duty was to protect the holy relic removed it from its place of reverence and spirited it away dhakal slowed his horse to a trot slipped off the trail through a break in the trees and stopped in a small shaded clearing he climbed from the saddle allowing his horse to wander to a nearby stream and bend its head to drink he moved behind the horse to check the series of leather bands that secured the cubeshaped chest to the animals rump as always his cargo was held fast the chest was a marvel so solidly built that it could withstand a high fall onto a rock or repeated bludgeoning without showing the slightest crack the locks were many hidden and ingeniously designed to make them all but impossible to open of the ten sentinels in dhakals cadre none had the resources or ability to open this unique chest nor did any of them know whether its contents were genuine or a substitute that honor or perhaps curse belonged solely to dhakal how he had been chosen was not revealed to him but he alone knew that this sacred chest carried the revered theurang soon with luck he would find a safe place to hide it for nearly the past nine weeks hed been on the run escaping the capital with his cadre just hours ahead of the invaders for two days as the smoke from their burning homes and fields filled the sky behind them they raced south on horseback on the third day they split up each sentinel heading in his predetermined direction most heading away from the invaders line of advance but some back toward it these brave men were either already dead or suffering at the hands of their enemy who having captured each sentinels decoy cargo were demanding to know how to gain access to his chest as designed this was an answer none of them could give as for dhakal his orders had taken him due east into the rising sun a direction hed maintained for the past sixtyone days the land in which he now found himself was very different from the arid mountainous terrain in which he was raised here there were mountains too but they were covered in thick forest and separated by lakepocked valleys it made staying hidden much easier but it had also slowed his progress the terrain was a doubleedged sword skilled ambushers could be upon him before he had a chance to run thus far hed had many close calls but his training had seen him through each one five times hed watched hidden as his pursuers rode within feet of him and twice hed fought a pitched battle with enemy cavalry squads though outnumbered and exhausted hed left these men dead their bodies and equipment buried and their horses scattered for the past three days hed not seen or heard any sign of his pursuers nor had he come across many local people those he did encounter paid him little attention his face and stature was similar to theirs his instincts told him to ride on that he hadnt put enough distance between himself and from across the stream perhaps fifty yards away came the crack of a branch in the trees anyone else would have dismissed it but dhakal knew the sound of a horse pushing through heavy brush his own horse had stopped drinking its head raised and ears twitching from the trail another sound the scuff of a horses hoof on the gravel trail dhakal pulled the bow from the sheath on his back and an arrow from the quiver then crouched down in the kneehigh water grass partially blocked by the horses legs dhakal peeked under the animals belly looking for signs of movement there was nothing he turned his head right through the trees he could just make out the narrow trail he watched waited then another hoof scuff dhakal nocked an arrow and drew the bow slightly taking up the tension a few moments later a horse appeared on the trail cantering slowly the horse stopped dhakal could see only the riders legs and his blackgloved hands resting on the saddles pommel reins gripped loosely in his fingers the hand moved jerked the reins slightly beneath him the horse whinnied and stamped its hoof an intentional move dhakal realized immediately a distraction the attackers would be coming from the forest side dhakal drew the bow fully took aim and let fly the arrow the point pierced the mans leg in the crease between his upper thigh and hip he screamed clutched his leg and toppled off his horse instinctively dhakal knew his aim was true the arrow had punctured the leg artery the man was out of the fight and would be dead within minutes still crouching dhakal spun on his back heel while retrieving three more arrows from his quiver two he planted in the ground before him the third he nocked there thirty feet away were three attackers swords drawn creeping through the underbrush toward him dhakal took aim on the trailing figure and fired the man went down in rapid succession he fired twice more catching one man squarely in the chest the next in the throat a fourth warrior let out a war cry and charged from behind a copse of trees he almost reached the edge of the stream before dhakals arrow dropped him the forest fell silent four dhakal thought they had never sent fewer than a dozen before as if in answer to his puzzlement the pounding of horses hooves sounded on the trail behind him dhakal spun saw a line of horses galloping down the trail past their fallen comrade three horses four seven ten horses and still they came the odds were overwhelming dhakal mounted his horse nocked an arrow and turned in his saddle in time to see the first horse galloping through the gap between the trees and into the clearing dhakal fired the arrow plunged into the mans right eye the force drove him backward over his saddle where he bumped off the rump of his horse and into the next rider whose horse reared backpedaling creating a choke point horses began slamming into one another the charge stalled dhakal kicked his heels into his horses flank the animal leapt off the bank into the water dhakal brought its head around heeled the horse and charged downriver he realized this was no chance ambush his pursuers had been covertly following him for some time and had managed to surround him over the splashing of his horses hooves in the shallow water he could hear them now riders crashing through the forest to his right and hooves on the gravel trail to his left ahead the stream curved to the right the trees and undergrowth were thicker here crowding the bank all but blotting out the sun and leaving him in twilight he heard a shout and glanced over his shoulder four riders were in pursuit he looked right saw dark horse shapes slipping in and out of the trees paralleling his course they were flushing him he realized but to where his answer came seconds later as the trees suddenly parted and he found himself in a meadow the streams width quadrupled the color of the water told him the depth had increased as well on impulse he veered his horse left toward the sandy bank directly ahead a line of five riders burst from the tree line two of them bent low pikes held horizontally before them the other three riding upright bows drawn he laid his body across his horses neck and jerked the reins to the right back into the water on the opposite bank another line of riders had emerged from the trees these too armed with pikes and bows and to complete the ambush directly behind galloping down the stream toward him was yet another line of cavalry as if on cue all three groups slowed to a trot then stopped pikes still at the ready and arrows nocked they watched him why arent they following he wondered and then he heard it the deafening rush of water waterfall i am caught trapped he reined back and let the horse walk until they reached a bend in the river he stopped here the water was deeper and moving fast fifty yards ahead dhakal could see the mist plume billowing over the surface could see the water boiling over the rocks at the rim of the cataract he turned in his saddle his pursuers had not moved save a single rider the mans armor told dhakal this was the leader of the group the man stopped twenty feet away and raised his hands to his shoulders signaling he was unarmed he shouted something dhakal did not understand the language but the tone was clear placation it is over the man was surely saying you have fought well done your duty surrender and you will be treated fairly it was a lie he would be tortured and eventually killed he would die fighting before he would let the theurang fall into the hands of his accursed enemy dhakal turned his horse until he was facing the pursuers with exaggerated slowness he drew the bow from his back and tossed it into the river he did the same with his quiver followed by his long sword and short sword finally the dagger in his belt the enemy leader gave dhakal a nod of respect then turned in his saddle and shouted something to his men slowly one by one the riders raised their pikes and sheathed their bows the leader turned back to dhakal and raised his hand gesturing for him to come forward dhakal gave him a smile and a shake of his head he jerked his reins hard to the right whipping his horse around then heeled it hard in the flanks the horse reared coiled its legs beneath it and began thrashing toward the spray rising above the deep waterfall frontier wastelands of xizang province qing empire china giuseppe saw the dust cloud on the eastern horizon before his brother did a mile wide and confined by the walls of a narrow valley the swirling brown wall of dirt and sand was headed directly for them eyes fixed on the spectacle giuseppe tapped his older brother on the shoulder francesco lana de terzi of brescia lombardy italy turned from his kneeling position where hed been studying a sheaf of blueprints and looked in the direction giuseppe was pointing the younger lana de terzi whispered nervously is it a storm of sorts francesco replied but not the kind you mean behind that dust cloud was not another windwhipped sandstorm the kind theyd grown so accustomed to over the last six months but rather hundreds of pounding horses hooves and atop the horses hundreds of elite and deadly soldiers francesco gave giuseppe a reassuring clap on the shoulder do not worry brother i have been expecting themthough i admit not this early it is him giuseppe croaked he is coming you did not tell me that i didnt want to frighten you worry not we still have time francesco raised a flattened hand to shield his eyes from the sun and studied the approaching cloud distances were deceptive here he had learned the vastness of the qing empire lay far behind the horizon in the two years theyd spent in this country francesco and his brother had seen a wild variety of terrainfrom jungles to forests to desertsbut of all of them this place this territory that seemed to have a dozen different pronunciations and spellings was the most godforsaken comprised mostly of hills some rolling and some jagged the land was a vast canvas painted in only two colors brown and gray even the water of rivers that gushed through the valleys was a dull gray it was as though god had cursed this place with a swipe of his mighty hand on days when the clouds parted the startlingly blue sky seemed only to accent the ashen landscape and then there was the wind francesco thought with a shudder the seemingly endless wind that whistled through the rocks and drove eddies of dust along the ground that seemed so animated the locals often treated the phenomena like ghosts come to snatch away their souls six months ago francesco a scientist by nature and training had scoffed at such superstitions now he wasnt so sure he had heard too many strange sounds in the night another few days he consoled himself and we will have the resources we need but it wasnt simply a matter of time was it he was making a bargain with the devil the fact that he was doing it for the larger good was something he hoped god would remember when judgment day came he studied the approaching wall of dust a few seconds more before lowering his hand and turning to giuseppe they are still twenty miles away he estimated we have another hour at least come let us finish francesco turned back around and shouted to one of the men a squat powerful figure in a roughly woven black tunic and trousers hao francescos primary liaison and translator jogged over yes sire he said in heavily accented but passable italian francesco sighed though hed long ago given up trying to get hao to call him by his first name he had hoped that at least by now the man would have ceased with the formality tell the men to finish quickly our guest will be arriving soon hao cast an eye to the horizon and saw what giuseppe had pointed out a few minutes earlier his eyes widened he nodded curtly said it will be done sire then turned around and began barking orders to the dozens of local men milling around the hilltop clearing he scurried off to join in the clearing which measured a hundred paces square was in fact the roof of a gompas interior courtyard on all sides of the clearing its turreted walls and watchtowers followed the hills ridges down to the valley floor like spines on a lizards back while francesco had been told a gompa was primarily a fortified center for education the residents of this particular stronghold seemed to practice only one profession soldiering and for that he was grateful as evidenced by the frequent raids and skirmishes that took place on the plains below it was clear he and his men were living on this realms frontier it was no accident that they had been transported here to complete work on the machinewhat their benefactor had dubbed the great dragon the clearing now echoed with the overlapping pounding of mallets on wood as haos workers hurried to drive the final stakes into the rocky soil all across the clearing plumes of brown dust rose into the air only to be caught by the wind and whipped into nothingness after another ten minutes the mallets fell silent hao scrambled back to where francesco and giuseppe stood we are done sire francesco backed up a few steps and admired the structure he was pleased designing it on paper was one thing to see it come to life was something else altogether standing forty feet tall occupying threequarters of the clearing and constructed of snowwhite silk with curved exterior bamboo braces painted blood red the tent seemed like a castle built of clouds well done francesco told hao giuseppe magnificent the younger lana de terzi murmured francesco nodded and said softly now let us hope what is inside is even more impressive though the gompas hawkeyed lookouts had certainly spotted the visitors approaching even before giuseppe had the alert horns did not sound until the retinue was but minutes away this as well as the riders direction of approach and early arrival was a tactical decision francesco guessed most of the enemys outposts lay to the west by coming in from the east the partys dust cloud would be obscured by the hill on which the gompa sat this way roving ambush parties would have no time to intercept the new arrivals knowing their benefactor as he did francesco suspected they had been covertly watching the gompa from a distance waiting for the wind direction to change and enemy patrols to move on a cunning man their patron francesco reminded himself cunning and dangerous less than ten minutes later francesco heard the crunching of leather and armored boots on the spiral gravel path below the clearing swirling dust rose above the rocklined border of the clearing then suddenly silence though francesco was expecting it what came next startled him all the same with a single barked command from an unseen mouth a cadre of two dozen home guard soldiers doubletimed into the clearing each syncopated footstep punctuated by a rhythmic grunt grimfaced eyes fixed on the horizon their pikes held horizontally before them the guards spread out through the clearing and began herding the awestruck workers to its far side and out of sight behind the tent once done they took up stations along the clearings perimeter spaced at regular intervals facing outward pikes held diagonally across their bodies again from the path below another guttural command followed by armored sandals crunching on gravel a diamondshaped formation of royal bodyguards in redandblack bamboo armor marched into the clearing and headed directly toward where francesco and giuseppe stood the phalanx stopped suddenly and the soldiers foreside stepped to the left and right opening a human gate through which a single man strode standing three hand widths taller than his tallest soldiers the kangxi emperor the ruler of the qing dynasty the regent of the mandate of heaven wore an expression that made the grimness of his soldiers faces seem positively exuberant the kangxi emperor took three long strides toward francesco and came to a stop through squinted eyes he studied the italians face for several seconds before speaking francesco was about to call for hao to translate but the man was already there standing at his elbow and whispering in his ear the emperor says are you surprised to see me surprised yes but pleased nonetheless your majesty the question was not a casual inquiry francesco knew the kangxi emperor was paranoid in the extreme had francesco not seemed sufficiently surprised at the emperors early arrival he would have fallen under immediate suspicion of being a spy what is this structure i see before me the kangxi emperor asked it is a tent your majesty of my own design it serves not only to protect the great dragon but also to shield it from prying eyes the kangxi emperor nodded curtly you will provide the plans to my personal secretary with a raised fingertip he commanded the secretary to step forward francesco said of course your majesty the slaves i provided you have performed adequately francesco winced inwardly at the emperors question but said nothing over the past six months he and giuseppe had worked and lived with these men under hardship conditions they were friends now he did not confess this aloud however such an emotional attachment would be a lever the emperor would not hesitate to use they have performed admirably your majesty sadly though four of them died last week when that is the way of the world death if they died in service to their king their ancestors will greet them with pride my foreman and translator hao has been especially invaluable the kangxi emperor flicked his eyes at hao then back to francesco the mans family will be released from prison the emperor raised his finger above his shoulder the personal secretary made a notation on the parchment he cradled in his arms francesco took a deep calming breath and smiled thank you your majesty for your kindness tell me when will the great dragon be ready another two days will you have until dawn tomorrow with that the kangxi emperor turned on his heel and strode back into the phalanx which closed in behind him did a synchronized aboutface and marched from the clearing followed moments later by the home guard soldiers from around the perimeter once the clomp of footsteps and the rhythmic grunting faded away giuseppe said is he crazy tomorrow at dawn how can we we will make it francesco replied with time to spare how we have only a few more hours of work left i told the emperor two days knowing he would demand the seemingly impossible this way we can give it to him giuseppe smiled you are a crafty one brother well done come let us put the finishing touches on this great dragon under the glow of polemounted torches and the watchful gaze of the emperors personal secretary who stood just inside the tents entrance arms folded inside his tunic they worked through the night with hao their everreliable foreman playing his part perfectly haranguing the men to hurry hurry hurry francesco and giuseppe did their part as well walking through the tent asking questions bending down here and there to inspect this or that oxsinew guylines were unlashed reknotted then checked for tension bamboo stays and cross braces were sounded with mallets to search for cracks silk was closely examined for the slightest imperfections the rattanwoven undercarriage underwent a mock attack with sharpened sticks to gauge its battlereadiness finding it lacking francesco ordered another coat of black lacquer be applied to the walls and bulwarks and finally the artist giuseppe had hired finished the bow mural a dragons snout complete with beaded eyes bared fangs and a protruding forked tongue as the suns upper rim rose above the hills to the east francesco ordered that all work be quickly finished once this was done he slowly circled the machine from bow to stern hands on his hips head tilting this way and that francesco studied the ships every surface its every feature looking for the slightest flaw he found none he returned to the bow and gave the emperors personal secretary a firm nod the man ducked under the tent flap and disappeared an hour later came the now familiar clomping and grunting of the emperors retinue the sound seemed to fill the clearing before suddenly falling silent now dressed in a simple gray silk tunic the kangxi emperor stepped though the tents entrance followed by his personal secretary and his chief bodyguard the emperor stopped in his tracks eyes wide in the two years he had known the emperor this was the first time francesco had seen the potentate taken aback with the suns pinkish orange light streaming through the tents white silken walls and roof the interior was bathed in an otherworldly glow the normally earthen floor had been covered in jetblack rugs that left the attendees feeling as though they were standing at the edge of an abyss scientist though he was francesco lana de terzi had a bit of showman in him the kangxi emperor stepped forwardunconsciously hesitating as his foot touched the edge of the black rugthen strode to the bow where he gazed at the dragons face now he smiled this was another first for francesco hed never seen the emperor without his characteristic dour expression the emperor spun to face francesco it is magnificent came haos translation unleash her at your command majesty once outside francescos men took their stations around the tent at his command the tents guylines were cut weighted along their upper hems as francesco had designed them the silken walls collapsed straight down simultaneously on the rear side of the tent a dozen men heaved the tents roof backward which rose up and billowed open like a great sail before being hauled down and out of sight all was silent save the wind whipping through the gompas turreted walls and windows standing alone in the center of the clearing was the kangxi emperors flying machine the great dragon francesco cared nothing for this moniker while he of course humored his benefactor to francesco the scientist the machine was merely a prototype for his dream a true lighterthanair vacuum ship measuring fifty feet long twelve feet wide and thirty feet tall the ships upper structure was comprised of four spheres of thick silk contained inside cages of fingerthin bamboo braces and animal sinew running from bow to stern each sphere measured twelve feet in diameter and was equipped with a valve port in its belly each of these ports was connected to a vertical copper stovepipe engirdled in its own lattice of bamboo and sinew from the valve port the stovepipe descended four feet to a thin bamboo plank to whose bottom was affixed a windshielded charcoal brazier and finally affixed by sinew to the spheres above was the blacklacquered rattan gondola long enough to accommodate ten soldiers in a line along with supplies equipment and weapons as well as a pilot and navigator the kangxi emperor strode forward alone until he was standing beneath the fore sphere facing the dragons mouth he raised his hands above his head as though he were beholding francesco thought his own creation it was at this moment that the gravity of what hed done hit him a wave of sadness and shame washed over him truly he had made a pact with the devil this man this cruel monarch was going to use his great dragon to murder other human beings soldiers and civilians alike armed with huo yao or gunpowder a substance that europe was only now using with moderate success and which china had long ago mastered the kangxi emperor would be able to rain fire down upon his enemies using matchlock muskets bombs and firespitting devices he could do all of this while out of reach in the sky and moving faster than the swiftest horse the truth had come too late francesco realized the death machine was in the kangxi emperors hands now there was no changing that perhaps if he were able to make a success of his true vacuum ship francesco could balance out the evil to come of course he would know that only on judgment day francesco was shaken from his reverie as he realized the kangxi emperor was standing before him i am pleased the emperor informed him once you have shown my generals how to build more of these you will have all you require to pursue your own venture majesty is it ready to fly give the command and it will be done it is given but first a change as planned master lana de terzi you will pilot the great dragon on her test flight your brother will remain here with us pardon me majesty why why to ensure you return of course and to save you when you are tempted to hand over the great dragon to my enemies majesty i would not and now we will be certain you will not majesty giuseppe is my copilot and navigator i need him i have eyes and ears everywhere master lana de terzi your vaunted foreman hao is as well trained as your brother hao will accompany youalong with six of my home guard should you need assistance i must protest majesty you must not master lana de terzi the kangxi emperor replied coldly the warning was clear francesco took a calming breath where will you have me go on this test flight do you see the mountains to the south the great ones touching the heavens i do you will travel there your majesty that is enemy territory what better test for a weapon of war francesco opened his mouth to protest but the kangxi emperor continued in the foothills along the streams you will find a golden flowerhao knows the one i mean bring that flower back to me before it wilts and you will be rewarded your majesty those mountains areforty miles away francesco thought perhaps fiftytoo far for a maiden voyage perhaps you will bring the flower back to me before it wilts or i will mount your brothers head on a spike do you understand i understand francesco turned to his younger brother having heard the entire exchange giuseppes face had gone ashen his chin trembled brother i im scared no need ill be back before you know it giuseppe took a breath set his jaw and squared his shoulders yes i know you are right the craft is a wonder and there is no one better at piloting it with luck well be sharing dinner together tonight good spirit francesco said they embraced for several seconds before francesco pulled away he turned to face hao and said order the braziers stoked we lift off in ten minutes sunda strait sumatra the present day sam fargo eased back on the throttle taking the engine to idle the speedboat slowed gliding to a stop in the water he shut off the engines and the craft began rocking gently from side to side a quarter mile off the bow their destination rose from the water a thickly forested island whose interior was dominated by sharp peaks plummeting valleys and thick rain forest below these a shoreline pockmarked with hundreds of pocket coves and narrow inlets in the speedboats aft seat remi fargo looked up from her booka little escapist reading entitled the aztec codices an oral history of conquest and genocidepushed her sunglasses onto her forehead and gazed at her husband trouble he turned to her and gave her an admiring stare just enjoying the scenic view then sam gave an exaggerated wiggle of his eyebrows remi smiled a smooth talker she closed the book and placed it on the seat beside her but magnum pi youre not sam nodded at the book how is it slow reading but the aztecs were fascinating people more than anyone ever imagined how long until youre finished with that one its next on my reading list tomorrow or the next day as of late each of them had been saddled with a daunting amount of homework and the island to which they were headed was largely the cause in any other circumstances the speck of land between sumatra and java might be a tropical getaway but it had in the last few months been turned into a dig site crawling with archaeologists historians anthropologists and of course a plethora of indonesian government officials like all of them each time sam and remi visited the island they had to negotiate the tree houselike rope city the engineers had strung above the site lest the ground collapse below the feet of the people trying to preserve the find what sam and remi had discovered on pulau legundi was helping to rewrite aztec and us civil war history and as the directors of not only this project but also two others they had to stay current on the mountain of data coming in it was for them a labor of love while their passion was treasure huntinga decidedly handson fieldintensive avocation based as much on instinct as it was on researcheach of them had come to it from a scientific background sam a caltecheducated engineer remi an anthropology and history major from boston college sam had fallen fairly close to the familial tree his father now passed away had been one of the lead engineers on nasas space programs while his mother eunice now seventyone lived in key west the sole proprietor captain and chief bottle washer of a snorkeling and deepseafishing boat remis mother and father a custom homebuilder and a pediatricianauthor respectively were both retired and living the good life in maine raising llamas sam and remi had met in hermosa beach at a jazz bar called the lighthouse on a whim sam had stopped in for a cold beer and he found remi and some colleagues letting off steam after spending the past few weeks hunting for a sunken galleon off abalone cove neither of them were starryeyed enough to remember their first meeting as instant love but the spark was undeniable talking and laughing over drinks they closed down the lighthouse without noticing the hours slipping by six months later they were married there in a small ceremony with remis encouragement sam had been pursuing an idea hed been tinkering with an argon laser scanner designed to detect and identify alloys at a distance through soil and water alike treasure hunters universities corporations mining outfits and the department of defense came begging for licenses checkbooks open and within a couple years fargo group ltd was turning a sevenfigure profit four years later they accepted a buyout offer that left them undeniably wealthy set for the rest of their lives instead of sitting back however they took a monthlong vacation then established the fargo foundation and set out on their first joint treasure hunt the wealth recovered went to a long list of charities now the fargos stared in silence at the island before them remi murmured still a little hard to fathom isnt it indeed it is sam agreed no amount of education or experience could have prepared them for what theyd found on pulau legundi the chance discovery of a ships bell off zanzibar had mushroomed into discoveries that would occupy the attention of generations of archaeologists historians and anthropologists sam was shaken from his reverie by the double whoop of a marine horn he turned to port half a mile away a thirtysixfoot sumatran harbor patrol boat was headed directly for them sam did you forget to pay for gas back at the rental place remi asked wryly no used the counterfeit rupiah i had lying around that might be it they watched as the boat closed the gap to a quarter mile where it turned first to starboard then to port in a crescent turn that brought it alongside them a hundred feet away over a loudspeaker an indonesianaccented voice said in english ahoy are you sam and remi fargo sam raised his arm in the affirmative stand by please we have a passenger for you sam and remi exchanged puzzled glances they were expecting no one the harbor patrol boat circled them once closing the distance until they were three feet off the port beam the engine slowed to idle then went silent at least they look friendly sam muttered to his wife the last time theyd been approached by a foreign naval vessel had been in zanzibar there it had been a patrol boat equipped with mm cannons and crewed by angrylooking sailors bearing aks so far remi replied on the boats afterdeck standing between two blueuniformed police officers was a petite asian woman in her midforties with a lean angular face and a hairdo that bordered on being a crew cut permission to come aboard the woman asked her english was almost flawless with only the barest trace of an accent sam shrugged permission granted the two policemen stepped forward as though preparing to help her cross the gap but she ignored them taking a single fluid stride that vaulted her off the gunwale and onto the fargos afterdeck she landed softly catlike she turned to face sam and remi who was now standing at her husbands side the woman stared at them a moment with a pair of impassive black eyes then handed them a business card it said simply zhilan hsu what can we do for you ms hsu asked remi my employer charles king requests the pleasure of your company our apologies but were not familiar with mr king he is waiting for you aboard his private aircraft at the private charter terminal outside palembang he wishes to speak with you while zhilan hsus english was technically flawless there was a disconcerting stiffness to it as though she were an automaton that part we understand sam said he handed the card back to her who is charles king and why does he want to see us mr king has authorized me to tell you it concerns an acquaintance of yours mr frank alton this got sams and remis attention alton was not just an acquaintance but rather a close longtime friend a former san diego police officer turned private detective who sam met in judo class sam remi frank and his wife judy had a standing monthly dinner date what about him sam asked mr king wishes to speak to you directly regarding mr alton youre being very secretive ms hsu remi said care to tell us why mr king wishes to speak with us directly remi finished yes that is right sam checked his watch please tell mr king we will meet him at seven oclock that is four hours from now said zhilan mr king is going to have to wait sam finished we have business we need to attend to zhilan hsus stoic expression flashed to anger but the look was gone almost as soon as it appeared she simply nodded and said seven oclock please be on time without another word she turned and leaped gazellelike off the deck to the harbor patrol boats gunwale she pushed past the policemen and disappeared into the cabin one of the policemen tipped his cap to them ten seconds later the engines growled to life and the boat pulled away well that was interesting sam said a few seconds later shes a real charmer remi said did you catch her choice of words sam nodded mr king has authorized if she understands the connotation then we can assume mr king is going to be just as genial do you believe her about frank judy would have called us if anything had happened while their adventures often led them into dicey situations their daily lives were fairly calm still zhilan hsus unexpected visit and mysterious invitation had both their internal warning alarms going off as unlikely as it seemed the possibility of a trap was something they couldnt ignore lets find out sam said he knelt down by the drivers seat retrieved his backpack from under the dashboard and pulled out his satellite phone from one of the side pockets he dialed and a few seconds later a female voice said yes mr fargo thought this was going to be the lucky call sam said he had a running bet with remi that someday hed catch selma wondrash off guard and shed call either of them by the first name not today mr fargo their chief researcher logistical guru and keeper of the inner sanctum selma was a former hungarian citizen who despite having lived in the united states for decades still retained a trace of an accentenough that it gave her voice a slight zsa zsa gabor lilt selma had managed the library of congresss special collections division until sam and remi lured her away with the promise of carte blanche and stateoftheart resources aside from her hobby aquarium and a collection of tea that occupied an entire cabinet in the workroom selmas only passion was research she was at her happiest when the fargos gave her an ancient riddle to unravel someday youll call me sam not today what time is it there about eleven selma rarely went to bed before midnight and rarely slept past four or five in the morning despite this she never sounded anything less than wide awake what have you got for me a dead end were hoping sam replied then recounted their visit from zhilan hsu charles king comes off like the anointed one ive heard of him hes rich with a capital r see if you can dig up any dirt about his personal life anything else have you heard any news from the altons no nothing replied selma call judy and see if franks out of the country sam requested look into it discreetly if there is a problem we dont want to alarm judy when do you meet king selma asked in four hours got it selma said with a laugh in her voice by then ill know his shirt size and his favorite flavor of ice cream palembang sumatra twenty minutes early for their meeting sam and remi pulled their scooters to a stop beside the hurricane fence bordering palembang airports private terminal area as selma had predicted they found the tarmac before the hangars crowded with a handful of private planes all of them either single or twinengine prop models save one a gulfstream g jet at sixtyfive million dollars the g was not only the worlds most expensive executive jet but also the fastest capable of nearly a mach top speed with a range of over eight thousand miles and a ceiling of fiftyone thousand feetten thousand feet higher than commercial jets given what selma had discovered about the mysterious mr king the presence of the g was of little surprise to sam and remi king charlie as he was known to his close friends and enemies alike was currently ranked eleventh on forbess richest people list with a net worth of billion dollars having started out in as a sixteenyearold wildcatter in the oil fields of texas king had by the age of twentyone started his own drilling company king oil by twentyfour he was a millionaire by thirty a billionaire through the eighties and nineties king expanded his empire into mining and banking according to forbes if king spent the rest of his life playing checkers in his penthouse office in houston he would still be earning a hundred thousand dollars an hour in interest for all that however king was in his daily life unostentatious to a fault often tooling around houston in his chevy pickup and eating at his favorite greasy spoon and while not quite at the same level as howard hughes he was rumored to be something of a recluse and a stickler for privacy king was rarely photographed in public and when he did attend events whether business or social he usually did so virtually via webcam remi looked at sam the tail number matches selmas research unless someone stole kings jet it appears the man himself is here the question is why in addition to giving them a brief biography of king selma had done her best to trace frank alton who according to his secretary was out of the country on a job while she hadnt heard from him for three days she was unconcerned alton often dropped from communication for a week or two if the job was particularly complex they heard a branch snap behind them and turned to find zhilan hsu on the other side of the fence only five feet away her legs and lower torso were hidden by foliage she regarded the fargos with her black eyes for a few seconds then said you are early her tone was slightly less severe than that of a prosecuting attorney and youre light on your feet remi said ive been watching for you sam said with a half smile didnt your mother ever tell you its not nice to sneak up on people zhilans face remained stoic i never knew my mother im sorry mr king is ready to see you now he must depart promptly at sevenfifty i will meet you at the gate on the eastern side please have your passports ready with that zhilan turned stepped into the bushes and disappeared eyes narrowed remi stared after her okay its official shes creepy seconded sam said lets go king charlie awaits they pulled their scooters into a spot beside the crossbarred gate and walked up to a small outer building where zhilan was standing beside a uniformed guard she stepped forward collected their passports and handed them to the guard who glanced at each before handing them back this way please zhilan said and led them around the building through a pedestrian gate then to the gulfstreams lowered stairs zhilan stepped aside and gestured for them to continue on once aboard they found themselves in a small but neatly appointed galley to the right through an archway was the main cabin the bulkheads were covered in lustrous walnut inlaid with silver teacupsized texas lone star emblems the floor in thick burgundy carpet there were two seating areas one a grouping of four leather reclinertype seats around a coffee table the second aft a trio of overstuffed settees the air was crisp and airconditioned faintly through unseen speakers came willie nelsons mammas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys oh boy remi muttered somewhere aft a voice with a texas twang said i think the fancy word for all this is cliche mizz fargo but heck i like what i like from one of the backwardfacing leather recliners a man rose and turned to face them he was six foot four two hundred poundsnearly half was musclewith a tan face and thick carefully styled silverblond hair though sam and remi knew charles king was sixtytwo he looked fifty he smiled broadly at them his teeth were square and startlingly white once texas gets into your blood king said its near impossible to get it out believe me ive had four wives do their damnedest with no luck hand outstretched king strode toward them he wore blue jeans a faded powder blue denim shirt and to sam and remis surprise nike running shoes rather than cowboy boots king didnt miss their expressions never liked those boots uncomfortable as hell and impractical besides all the horses i got are for racin and i aint exactly jockeysized he shook remis hand first then sams thanks so much for comin hope zee didnt put you off she aint much for small talk shed make a good poker player sam agreed hell she is a good poker player took me for six thousand bucks in ten minutes the firstand lasttime we played come on in take a seat lets get you somethin to drink whatll you have bottled water please remi said and sam nodded for the same zee if you dont mind ill have the usual from close behind sam and remi zhilan said yes mr king they followed him aft to the settee area and sat down zhilan was only seconds behind them with a tray she placed sams and remis waters before them and held out a whiskeyrocks to king he did not accept the tumbler but simply stared at it he scowled glanced at zhilan and shook his head how many ice cubes in there honey three mr king zhilan said hastily im sorry i dont give it a second thought zee just plop another one in there and ill be fine zhilan hurried off and king said no matter how many times i tell her she still forgets sometimes jack daniels is a fickle spirit gotta get the ice just right or it aint worth a damn sam said ill take your word for it youre a wise man mr fargo sam suit yourself call me charlie king stared at them a pleasant smile fixed on his face until zhilan returned with his now correctly cubed drink she stood at his side waiting as he tasted it thats my girl he said run along now to the fargos how goes your dig on that little island whats it called pulau legundi sam replied yeah thats right some kind of mr king charlie zhilan hsu mentioned a friend of ours frank alton lets save the small talk for now tell us about frank youre also a direct man you share that quality too im guessin remi neither of them replied but remi gave him a sweet smile king shrugged okay fair enough i hired alton a few weeks ago to look into a matter for me seems hes up and disappeared poof since you two seem to be good at findin what aint easily found and youre friends of his i thought id touch base with you when did you last hear from him remi asked ten days ago frank tends to be a bit independent when hes working sam said why do you because he was to check in with me every day that was part of our deal and he stuck to it until ten days ago do you have any reason to think somethings amiss you mean aside from him breakin his promise to me king replied with a hint of annoyance aside from him takin my money and disappearin for arguments sake well the part of the world hes in can be a tad hairy sometimes and that is remi asked nepal pardon you said yep last i heard he was in kathmandu sort of a backwater burg but it can be tough if you aint got your wits about you sam asked who else knows about this a handful of folk franks wife king shook his head took a sip of whiskey he screwed up his face zee zhilan was at his side five seconds later yes mr king he handed her the tumbler ice is meltin too fast get rid of it yes mr king and then she was gone again scowling king watched her walk away then turned back to the fargos sorry you were sayin have you told franks wife didnt know he had one he didnt give me emergency contact info besides why worry her for all i know altons taken up with some oriental woman and is gallivantin around down there on my dime frank alton wouldnt do that remi said maybe maybe not have you contacted the nepalese government asked sam or the american embassy in kathmandu king gave a dismissive wave of his hand backward all of em and corruptthe locals that is as for the embassy idea i considered it but i aint got the months it would take for them to get their butts in gear ive got my own people on the ground there workin on another project but they aint got the time to spend on this and like i said you two have got a reputation for findin what other folks cant sam said first of all charlie people arent things second hunting for missing persons isnt our specialty king opened his mouth to speak but sam raised his hand and went on that said franks a good friend so of course well go fantastic king slapped his knee lets talk nuts and bolts how much is this gonna cost me sam grinned were going to assume youre kidding about money never because hes a good friend well foot the bill remi said with a little edge to her voice well need all the information you can give us zees already put together a file shell give it to you on the way out give us the condensed version sam said its a bit of a wheelswithinwheels situation king said i hired alton to hunt down someone whod disappeared in the same region who my dad when he first disappeared i sent a string of folks out to look for him but nothin came of it its like he fell off the face of the earth when this latest sighting came up i beat the bushes for the best private eye i could find alton came highly recommended you said latest sighting remi observed what does that mean since my dad disappeared thereve been rumors of him popping up from time to time a dozen or so times in the seventies four times in the eighties sam interrupted charlie exactly how long has your father been missing thirtyeight years he disappeared in lewis bully king charles explained was something of an indiana jones type but long before the movies came out an archaeologist who spent eleven months out of the year in the field a globetrotting academic whod visited more countries than most people knew existed what exactly his father was doing when he disappeared charles king didnt know who was he affiliated with remi asked not sure what you mean did he work for a university or museum perhaps a foundation nope he was a square peg my pop didnt go for all that stuff how did he fund his expeditions king offered them an awshucks smile he had a generous and gullible donor to be fair though he never asked for much five thousand here and there workin alone he didnt have much overhead and he knew how to live cheap most of the places he traveled you could live for a few bucks a day did he have a home a little place in monterey i never sold it never did anything with it in fact its still mostly the way it was when he went missin and yeah i know what youre gonna ask back in seventythree i had some people go through his house lookin for clues but they didnt find nothin youre welcome to look for yourselves though zeell get you the info did frank go there no he didnt think itd be worth it tell us about the latest sighting sam said about six weeks ago a national geographic crew was doing some spread on an old city out therelo manta somethin or another lo monthang remi offered yeah thats the place used to be the capital of mustang like most people king pronounced the name as he would the horse its pronounced moostong remi replied it was also known as the kingdom of lo before it was absorbed by nepal in the eighteenth century whatever you say never did like that sort of stuff fell kind of far from the tree i guess anyway in one of the photos they took theres this guy in the background a dead ringer for my dador at least how i think hed look after nearly forty years thats not much to go on sam said its all ive got still wanna take a crack at it of course we do sam and remi stood up to leave they shook hands all around zees got my contact info in there youll be giving her updates let me know what you find id appreciate regular reports good huntin fargos charles king stood in the doorway of his gulfstream and watched the fargos return through the gate mount their scooters then disappear down the road zhilan hsu came walking back through the gate trotted up the planes stairs and stopped in front of king i do not like them she said and why is that they do not show you enough respect i can do without that darlin just as long as they live up to their reputation from what ive read those two have a real knack for this kind of thing and if they go beyond what we ask of them well hell thats why ive got you aint it yes mr king shall i go there now no lets let things unfold naturallike get russ on the horn will ya king walked aft and dropped into one of the recliners with a grunt a minute later zhilans voice came over the intercom i have him ready for you mr king please stand by king waited for the warbled squelch that told him the satellite line was open russ you there im here hows the dig goin on track had some problems with a local making a fuss but we took care of him marjories in the pit right now cracking the whip ill bet she is shes a

hear me if they get away from you ill have your hide goldfish point la jolla near san diego california after parting company with king sam and remi had returned to pulau legundi where as expected they found professor stan dydell surveying the site remis former teacher at boston college had taken a sabbatical to participate in the multiple excavations after hearing their news about alton dydell agreed to oversee the dig until they returned or found a permanent replacement thirtysix hours and three connections later they landed in san diego at noon local time sam and remi had driven straight to the alton home to break the news to franks wife now with their luggage deposited in their own homes foyer theyd made their way downstairs to selmas domain the workroom measuring two thousand square feet the highceilinged space was dominated by a twentyfootlong mapletopped worktable lit from above by halogen pendant lamps and surrounded by highbacked stools along one wall was a trio of half cubicleseach equipped with a brandnew core mac pro workstation and a thirtyinch cinema hd displaya pair of glassedin offices one each for sam and remi an environmentally controlled archive vault a small screening room and a research library the opposite wall was dedicated to selmas only hobby a fourteenfoot fivehundredgallon saltwater aquarium filled with a rainbowhued assortment of fish its soft gurgling lent the workroom a mellow ambience above the firstfloor work space the fargos home was a threestory twelvethousandsquarefoot spanishstyle house with an open floor plan vaulted ceilings and enough windows and skylights that they rarely had their lights on for more than a couple hours a day what electricity they did draw was primarily supplied by a robust array of newly installed solar panels on the roof the top floor contained sam and remis master suite directly below this were four guest suites a living room a dining room and a kitchengreat room that jutted over the cliff and overlooked the ocean on the second floor was a gymnasium containing both aerobic and circuit training exercise equipment a steam room a hydroworx endless lap pool a climbing wall and a thousand square feet of hardwood floor space for remi to practice her fencing and sam his judo sam and remi took a pair of stools at one corner of the worktable selma joined them she wore her traditional work attire khaki pants sneakers a tiedyed tshirt and hornrimmed glasses complete with a neck chain pete jeffcoat and wendy corden wandered over to listen tan fit blond and easygoing selmas assistants were quintessential californians but far from beach bums jeff had a degree in archaeology wendy in social sciences shes worried remi now said but did a good job of hiding it for the kids we told her wed keep her updated selma if you could touch base with her every day while were gone of course how was your audience with his highness sam recounted their meeting with charlie king remi and i discussed this on the plane he says all the right things and has the ol country boy routine down pat but something doesnt sit right about him his girl friday for one thing remi said then described zhilan hsu while outside kings presence the woman had a thoroughly unnerving demeanor her behavior aboard the gulfstream had told a different story kings displeasure over the number of ice cubes in his jack daniels and her mortified reaction told them not only that she was frightened of her employer but that he was a domineering control freak remis also got an interesting hunch about ms hsu sam said remi said shes his mistress sams not so sure but im positive and kings grip on her is ironfisted im still preparing a biography of the king family selma said but so far still no luck on zhilan ill keep working with your permission i may call rube rube haywood another friend of sams worked at the cia headquarters in langley virginia theyd met of all places at the cias infamous camp peary covert operations training facility when sam was with darpa the defense advanced research projects agency and rube was an upandcoming case officer while the farm was a prerequisite course for someone like rube sam was there as part of a cooperative experiment the better engineers understood how case officers worked in the field darpa and the cia proposed the better they would be able to equip americas spies if you need to go ahead another thing sam added king claims he has no idea what his fathers area of interest was king claims hes been searching for him for almost forty years and yet he knows nothing about what drove the man i dont buy it remi added he also asserts that he hasnt bothered contacting either the nepalese government or the us embassy somebody as powerful as king would get action with just a few phone calls king also claimed frank wasnt interested in his fathers monterey house but franks too thorough to have ignored that if king had told frank about it he would have gone why would king lie about that pete said no idea replied remi what does all that add up to wendy asked somebody whos got something to hide replied selma our thoughts exactly sam said the question is what king also has a tinge of paranoia and to be fair as wealthy as he is hes probably got scammers coming at him in droves in the end none of that matters remi said frank alton is missing thats where we need to focus our attention starting where asked selma monterey monterey california sam took the corners slowly as the cars headlights probed the fog that swirled over the ground and through the foliage that lined the winding gravel road below them the lights of the cliffside houses twinkled in the gloom while farther out the navigation beacons of fishing boats floated in the blackness remis window was open and through it they could hear the occasional mournful gong of a buoy in the distance tired though they were sam and remi were anxious to get started on franks disappearance so theyd caught the evening shuttle flight from san diego to montereys dualrunway peninsula airport where theyd rented a car even without seeing the structure itself it was clear lewis bully kings home was worth millions more accurately the property on which it sat was worth millions a view of monterey bay did not come cheap according to charlie king his father had purchased the home in the early fifties since then appreciation would have worked its magic turning even a tarpaper shack into a real estate gold mine the cars dashboard navigation screen chimed at sam signaling another turn as they rounded the corner the headlights swept over a lone mailbox sitting atop a listing post thats it remi said reading the numbers sam pulled into a driveway lined with scrub pine and a rickety nolongerwhite picket fence that seemed to be held erect only by the vines entangling it sam let the car coast to a stop ahead the headlights illuminated a thousandsquarefoot saltboxstyle house two small boardedup windows flanked a front door below which was a set of crumbling concrete steps the facade was painted in what had likely once been a deep green now what hadnt peeled away had faded to a sickly olive color at the end of the driveway partially tucked behind the house stood a singlecar garage with drooping eaves troughs thats a nineteenfifties house all right said remi talk about no frills the lot must be at least two acres its a wonder its stayed out of the hands of developers not considering who owns it good point sam said i have to admit this is a little spooky i was going to say a lot spooky shall we sam doused the headlights then shut off the engine leaving the house illuminated only by what little pale moonlight filtered through the mist sam grabbed a leather valise from the backseat then they climbed out and shut the cars doors in the silence the double thunk seemed abnormally loud sam dug his micro led flashlight from his pants pocket and clicked it on they followed the walkway to the front door probing with his foot sam checked the stability of the stairs he nodded to remi then mounted the steps slipped the key zhilan had provided them into the lock and turned with a snick the mechanism opened he gave the door a gentle shove the hinges let out a predictable squelch sam stepped across the threshold followed by remi give me a little light remi said sam turned and shone the beam on the wall beside the doorjamb where remi was hunting for a switch she found one and flipped it zhilan had assured them that the homes power would be on and shed been true to her word in three corners of the room floor lamps glowed to life casting dull yellow cones on the walls not as abandoned as king made it sound sam observed not only did the bulbs in the lamps work but there wasnt a trace of dust to be seen he must have the place cleaned regularly doesnt that strike you as strange remi asked not only does he keep the house for almost forty years after his father disappeared he doesnt change a thing and he has it cleaned while the yard goes to seed charlie king himself strikes me as strange so no this doesnt surprise me give the guy germ phobia and hide his fingernail clippers and hes halfway to howard hughes territory remi laughed well the good news is theres not much ground to cover she was right they could see most of bullys house from where they stood a twentyfootsquare main room that appeared to be a denstudy the east and west walls dominated by floortoceiling bookcases filled with books knickknacks framed photos and display cases containing what looked to be fossils and artifacts in the center of the room was a butcherblock kitchen table that lewis had been using as a desk on it an old portable typewriter pens pencils steno pads and stacks of books on the south wall were three doorways one leading to a kitchenette the second a bathroom and the third a bedroom beneath the tang of pinesol and mothballs the house smelled of mildew and old wallpaper paste i think the balls in your court remi you and bully wereor arekindred spirits ill check the other rooms holler if you see a bat not funny fargo remi was a trooper through and through never afraid to get her hands dirty or to jump into danger but she loathed bats their leathery wings tiny claw hands and pinched pig faces struck a primal chord in her halloween was a tense time in the fargo household and vintage vampire movies were banned sam stepped back to her lifted her chin with his index finger and kissed her sorry accepted as sam stepped into the kitchenette remi scanned the bookcases predictably all of the books appeared to have been written prior to the s lewis king was an eclectic reader she saw while most of the books were directly related to archaeology and its associate disciplinesanthropology paleontology geology etceterathere were also volumes on philosophy cosmology sociology classic literature and history sam returned to the den nothing of interest in the other rooms how about here i suspect he was a she paused turned around i guess we should decide on a tense for him do we think hes dead or alive lets assume the latter frank did remi nodded i suspect lewis is a fascinating man if i had to wager id say hed read most of these books if not all of them if he was in the field as much as king said when would he have had the time speedreader remi suggested possible whats in the display cases sam shone his flashlight on the one nearest remis shoulder she peered into it clovis points she said referring to the now universal name for spear and arrow tips constructed from stone ivory or bone nice collection too in turn they began checking the rest of the display cases lewiss collection was as eclectic as his library while there were plenty of archaeological artifactspot shards carved antlers stone tools petrified wood splintersthere were pieces that belonged in the historical sciences fossils rocks illustrations of extinct plants and insects scraps of ancient manuscripts remi tapped the glass of a case containing a parchment written in what looked like devanagari the parent alphabet of nepali this is interesting its a reproduction i think theres what looks like a translators notation a kaalrami princeton university but theres no translation checking sam said pulling his iphone from his pocket he called up the safari web browser and waited for the g network icon to appear in the phones menu bar instead a message box appeared on the screen select a wifi network fpr frowning sam studied the message for a moment then closed the web browser and brought up a notetaking application he said to remi i cant get a connection take a look remi turned to look at him what he winked take a look she walked over and looked at his iphones screen on it he had typed a message follow my lead remi didnt miss a beat im not surprised you couldnt get a signal she said were in the boondocks what do you think have we seen everything i think so lets go find a hotel they shut off the lights then walked out the front door and locked it behind them remi said whats going on sam i picked up a wireless network its named after this address false pass road sam recalled the message screen and showed it to remi could it be a neighbor she asked no the average household signal wont carry beyond fifty yards or so curiouser and curiouser remi said i didnt see any modems or routers why would a supposedly abandoned house need a wireless network i can think of only one reason and given who were dealing with its not as crazy as it sounds monitoring as in cameras andor listening devices kings spying on us why who knows but now my curiosity is piqued we have to get back in there come on lets have a look around what if hes got exterior cameras those are hard to hide well keep an eye out shining his flashlight along the homes facade and soffit he walked up the driveway toward the garage when he reached the corner of the house he paused and took a peek he pulled back nothing he said he walked to the garages side door and tried the knob it was locked sam took off his windbreaker balled it around his right hand and pressed his fist against the glass pane above the knob leaning hard until the glass shattered with a muffled pop he knocked the remaining glass shards clear then reached in and unlocked the door once inside he took only a minute to find the electrical panel sam opened the cover and studied the configuration it was an old fuse type some of the fuses appeared relatively new what now asked remi im not messing with fuses he tracked his flashlight beam from the panel down to the wooden sole plate then left to the next stud where he found the electricity meter using his pocketknife he ripped away the lead wire then opened the cover and flipped off the main power switch providing king doesnt have a generator or backup batteries hidden somewhere that should do the trick sam said they returned to the front step remi pulled out her iphone and checked for the wireless network it had disappeared clear she said lets go see what charlie kings hiding back inside remi went straight back to the case containing the devanagari parchment sam can you get my camera sam opened the valise which hed placed on a nearby armchair retrieved remis cannon g and handed it to her she began taking pictures of the case once done she moved on to the next might as well document everything sam nodded hands on hips he surveyed the bookcases he did a quick mental calculation there were five hundred to six hundred volumes he estimated ill start flipping pages it quickly became evident that whoever king had hired to clean the house had paid scant attention to the cases while the books spines were clean their tops were covered in a thick layer of dust before removing each volume sam examined it with the flashlight for fingerprints none appeared to have been touched for a decade or more two hours and a hundred sneezes later they returned the last book to its slot remi who had finished photographing the display cases an hour earlier had helped with the last hundred volumes nothing sam said backing away from a bookcase and wiping his hands on his pants you no i did find something interesting in one of the cases though she powered up her camera scrolled to the relevant picture and showed sam the display he studied it for a moment what are those dont hold me to it yet but i think theyre ostrich egg shards and the engraving is it a language art i dont know i took them out of the case and photographed each individually as well whats the significance for us in particular probably nothing in a larger context remi shrugged perhaps a lot in remi explained a team of french archaeologists discovered a cache of two hundred seventy engraved ostrich shell fragments at the diepkloof rock shelter in south africa the shards were engraved with geometric patterns that dated back between fiftyfive thousand and sixtyfive thousand years ago and belonged to what is known as the howiesons poort lithic cultural period the experts are still debating the significance of the engravings remi continued some argue its artwork others a map still others a form of written language do these look similar i cant recall offhand but if theyre of the same type as the south african shards remi finished then they predate the diepkloof find by at least thirtyfive years maybe lewis didnt know what he had i doubt it any archaeologist worth his or her salt would recognize these as significant once we find frank and things get back to normalsam opened his mouth to speak and remi quickly corrected herselfnormal for us ill look into it sam sighed so for now all weve got that is even remotely related to nepal is that devanagari parchment kathmandu nepal sam and remi awoke to the sound of the pilot announcing their final approach to kathmandus tribhuvan international airport after having spent the majority of the past three days in the air it took a solid thirty seconds before either of them was fully awake their unitedcathay pacificroyal nepal flight had taken nearly thirtytwo hours sam sat up stretched his arms above his head then reset his watch to match the digital clock on his seatback screen beside him remis eyelids fluttered open my kingdom for a good cup of coffee she murmured well be on the ground in twenty minutes remis eyes opened the rest of the way ah id almost forgotten in recent years nepal had gotten into the coffee business as far as the fargos were concerned the beans grown in the countrys arghakhanchi region produced the best black gold in the world sam smiled at her ill buy you as much as you can drink my hero the plane banked sharply and they both stared out the window in the minds of most travelers the name kathmandu evokes exotic visions of buddhist temples and robed monks trekkers and mountaineers incense spice ramshackle huts and shadowed valleys hidden by himalayan peaks what doesnt occur to the firsttime visitor is the image of a bustling metropolis of people with a ninetyeight percent literacy rate seen from the air kathmandu seems to have dropped neatly into a craterlike valley surrounded by four towering mountain ranges the shivapuri phulchowki nagarjun and chandragiri sam and remi had been here on vacation twice before they knew that despite its population kathmandu on the ground felt like a conglomeration of mediumsized villages shot through with veins of modernism on one block you might find a thousandyearold temple to the hindu lord shiva on the next a cell phone store on major thoroughfares sleek hybrid taxis and colorfully decorated rickshaws competing for fares in a square located directly across from each other an oktoberfestthemed restaurant and a curbside vendor selling bowls of chaat to passersby and of course tucked into the mountain slopes and atop the craggy peaks surrounding the city hundreds of temples and monasteries some older than kathmandu itself experienced travelers that they were sam and remi were well prepared for customs and immigration and were passed through with a minimum of fuss soon they found themselves outside the terminal standing on the ground transportation sidewalk beneath a modern curved awning the terminals facade itself was done in pristine terracotta with a deeply sloped roof adorned with hundreds of rectangular insets where did selma book us the hyatt regency remi gave her nod of approval on their last visit to kathmandu in hopes of immersing themselves in nepali culture theyd stayed in a hostel that happened to be located next to a yakbreeding corral yaks they discovered had little concern for modesty privacy or sleep sam stepped to the curb to hail a taxi behind them came a male voice would you be mr and mrs fargo sam and remi turned and found themselves facing a man and woman both in their early twenties and both nearduplicate images of not only each other but charles king as wellsave one startling difference while the king children had been blessed with their fathers whiteblond hair blue eyes and big smile their faces also bore subtle yet distinct asian characteristics remi gave sam a sideways glance that he immediately and correctly interpreted her hunch about zhilan hsu had been at least partially right however unless the fargos were assuming too much her relationship went far beyond that of a common mistress we would be sam replied the man who also shared his fathers height but not his corpulence stuck out his hand and gave each of them a vigorous handshake im russell this is my sister marjorie sam remi we werent expecting a reception we decided to take the initiative marjorie said were here on some business for daddy so its no trouble russell said if youve never visited kathmandu before it can be a bit disconcerting weve got a car well be happy to take you to your hotel the hyatt regency was two miles northwest of the airport the ride went smoothly if not quickly inside the king childrens mercedesbenz sedan inside its soundcontrolled interior and tinted windows sam and remi found the trip a tad surreal at the wheel russell navigated the confusing narrow streets easily while marjorie in the front passengers seat gave them a running travelogue over her shoulder with all the charm of a canned tour guide script at last they pulled up to the hyatts covered lobby turnaround russell and marjorie were out of the car and holding open the backseat doors before sam and remi had touched the handles like the airport terminals the hyatt regencys architecture was a blend of old and new a sprawling sixstory facade in terracotta and cream topped by a pagodastyle roof the lush manicured grounds occupied twenty acres a bellman approached the car and russell barked something in nepali the man nodded vigorously and forced a smile then retrieved the luggage from the trunk and disappeared into the lobby well let you get settled in said russell then handed them each a business card give me a call later and we can discuss how youd like to proceed proceed sam repeated marjorie smiled sorry daddy probably forgot to tell you he asked us to be your guides while you look for mr alton see you tomorrow with almost synchronized smiles and waves the king children climbed back into the mercedes and pulled away sam and remi watched the receding car for a few seconds then remi murmured is anyone in the king family normal fortyfive minutes later they were settled into their suite and enjoying their coffee after spending the afternoon lying around the pool relaxing they returned to their suite for cocktails sam ordered a sapphire bombay gin gibson and remi asked for a ketel one cosmopolitan they finished reading the dossier zhilan had given them at the palembang airport while on the surface it seemed thorough they found little of substance on which they could start their hunt i have to admit remi said the combination of zhilan hsus and charlie kings genes produced interesting results thats very diplomatic of you remi but lets be honest russell and marjorie are scary combine their appearance with their overthetop friendliness and youve got a pair of hollywoodborn serial killers did you see specific traces of zhilan in them no and im half hoping there arent if shes their mother that means she was probably eighteen or nineteen when she had them which wouldve put king in his midforties at the time did you notice the lack of texas accents i think i caught a trace of ivy league in some of their vowels so daddy shipped them out of texas and off to college what i want to know is how did they know what flight we were on charlie king flexing his muscles showing us hes well connected probably that might also explain why he didnt tell us to expect the wonder twins as powerful as king is he probably fancies himself a master at keeping people off guard im not fond of having them shadow us everywhere neither am i but lets play along tomorrow and see what they know about franks activities i have a sneaking suspicion the king family knows a lot more than theyre letting on agreed remi replied it all adds up to one thing sam king is trying to play the puppet master the question is why because hes a control freak or because hes hiding something the door chimes rang as he moved to the door to retrieve an envelope that had just been slid under it sam said ah confirmation of our dinner reservations really well only if you can be ready to leave in thirty minutes replied sam love to and where are we going bhanchka and ghan responded sam how did you remember how can you forget such memorable food the ambience and nepalese cuisine in nepal twentyfive minutes later remi had changed into akris slacks and a top with a matching jacket thrown over her arm and sam freshly shaved wearing a blue robert graham shirt and dark gray slacks ushered her out the door remi was only marginally surprised to awaken at four am to find her husband not in bed but rather in an armchair in the suites sitting area when something was badgering sam fargos subconscious he rarely could sleep she found him under the soft glow of a lamp reading the dossier zhilan had given them using her hip remi gently shoved aside the manila folder then she settled into his lap and wrapped her long la perla silk robe tightly around her i think i found the culprit he said show me he flipped through a series of paperclipped pages the daily email reports that frank was sending king they start the day he arrived here and end the morning he disappeared do you notice anything different about the last three emails remi scanned them no he signed each one frank look at the ones prior remi did so she pursed her lips simply signed fa thats how he signed emails to me too whats it mean just speculating id say either frank didnt send the last three emails or he did and was trying to embed a distress signal i think thats unlikely frank would have found a more clever code so that leaves us with the other option he disappeared earlier than king believes and someone was posing as him remi concluded thirty miles north of kathmandu nepal in the predawn gloom the range rover pulled off the main road its headlights swept over green terraced fields as it followed the winding road to the bottom of the valley where it intersected another road this one narrower and rutted with mud the rover bumped along the track for several hundred yards before crossing a bridge below a river churned its dark waters lapping at the bridges lowermost girders on the opposite bank the rovers headlights briefly illuminated a sign in nepali it read trisuli another quarter mile brought the rover to a squat graybrick building with a patchwork tin roof beside a wooden front door a square window glowed yellow the rover coasted to a stop before the building and the engine shut off russell and marjorie king climbed out and headed for the door a pair of shadowed figures emerged from behind each corner of the building and intercepted them each man carried an automatic weapon diagonally across his body flashlights clicked on panned over the king childrens faces then clicked off with a jerk of the head one of the guards gestured for the pair to enter through the door a single man was sitting at a wooden trestle table aside from this and a flickering kerosene lantern the room was barren colonel zhou russell king grunted welcome my nameless american friends please sit they did so taking the bench across from zhou marjorie said youre not in uniform please dont tell us youre afraid of nepalese army patrols zhou chuckled hardly while im sure my men would enjoy the target practice i doubt my superiors would look kindly on my crossing the border without going through proper channels this is your meeting russell said why did you ask us here we need to discuss the permits you have requested the permits weve already paid for you mean replied marjorie semantics the area you wish to enter is heavily patrolled all of china is heavily patrolled russell observed only part of the area in which you wish to travel falls under my command this has never been a problem in the past things change youre squeezing us marjorie said her face was expressionless but her eyes were hard mean i dont know that expression bribery colonel zhou frowned thats harsh the truth is you are right you have already paid me unfortunately a restructuring in my district has left me with more mouths to feed if you understand my meaning if i do not feed those mouths they will begin talking to the wrong people perhaps we should be talking to them instead of you said russell go ahead but do you have the time as i recall it took you eight months to find me are you willing to start from the beginning again you were lucky with me next time you might find yourself imprisoned as spies it could still happen in fact youre playing a dangerous game colonel marjorie said no more dangerous than illegally crossing into chinese territory and i suppose no more dangerous than not having your men search us for weapons zhous eyes narrowed darted toward the door then back to the king twins you wouldnt dare he said she would russell said and so would i bet on it but not now not tonight colonel if you knew who we were you would think twice about extorting more money from us i may not know your names but i know your kind and i have a hunch about what you are after russell said how much to feed these extra mouths twenty thousandin euros not dollars russell and marjorie stood up russell said youll have the money in your account before days end well contact you when were ready to cross he could tell from the chill in the night air the utter lack of traffic sounds and the nearby and frequent clanking of yak bells that he was fairly high in the foothills blindfolded as soon as hed been shoved into the van he had no way of knowing how far from kathmandu theyd taken him ten miles or a hundred it didnt really matter once outside the valley in which the city rested the terrain could swallow a person wholeand had done so thousands of times ravines caves sinkholes crevasses a million places in which to hide or die the floor and walls were made of rough planking as was the cot his mattress was a strawfilled pad that smelled vaguely of manure the stove was an old potbellied model he guessed from the sound of the kindling hatch banging shut whenever his captors entered to stoke the fire occasionally over the tang of wood smoke he caught the faint smell of stove fuel the kind used by hikers and mountaineers he was being held in an abandoned trekkers hut somewhere far enough off the regular trails that it received no visitors his captors had spoken fewer than twenty words to him since his abduction all of them gruff commands given in broken english sit stand eat toilet on the second day however hed caught a snippet of conversation through the huts wall and while his grasp of nepali was virtually nonexistent he knew enough to recognize it hed been taken by locals who though terrorists or guerrillas he knew of none operating within nepal kidnappers he doubted it they hadnt forced him to make any ransom recordings or letters nor had they mistreated him he was fed regularly given plenty to drink and his sleeping bag was well suited for subzero temperatures when they handled him they were firm but not rough again he wondered who and why so far theyd made only one major mistake while theyd bound his wrists securely with what felt like climbing rope theyd failed to check the hut for sharp edges in short order hed found four of them the legs of his cot each of which jutted a few inches above the mattress the roughly cut wood was unsanded not exactly saw blades but it was a place to start kathmandu nepal as advertised russell and marjorie pulled into the hyatts turnaround precisely at nine am the next morning brighteyed and smiling the twins greeted sam and remi with another round of handshakes then ushered them toward the mercedes the sky was a brilliant blue the air crisp where to russell asked as he put the car in gear and pulled away how about the locations where frank alton seemed to be spending most of his time remi asked no problem replied marjorie according to the emails he was sending daddy he spent part of his time in the chobar gorge area about five miles southeast of here its where the bagmati river empties out of the valley they drove in silence for a few minutes sam said if it was your grandfather that was photographed in lo monthang you dont think it was russell said glancing in the rearview mirror daddy thinks it was just playing devils advocate if it was your grandfather do you have any idea why he would have been in that area cant think of a thing replied marjorie flippantly your father didnt seem familiar with lewiss work are either of you russell answered just archaeology stuff i suppose we never knew him of course just heard stories from daddy dont take this the wrong way but did it occur to you to learn what lewis was up to it might have helped in the search for him daddy keeps us pretty busy marjorie said besides thats why he hires experts like you two and mr alton sam and remi exchanged glances like their father the king twins seemed only marginally interested in the particulars of their grandfathers life their detachment felt almost pathological where did you two go to school remi asked changing the subject we didnt russell answered daddy had us homeschooled by tutors what happened to your accents marjorie didnt answer immediately oh i see what you mean when we were about four he sent us to live with our aunt in connecticut we lived there until we finished school then moved back to houston to work for daddy so he wasnt around much when you were growing up sam asked hes a busy man marjories reply was without a trace of rancor as though it were perfectly normal to bundle your children off to another state for fourteen years and have them raised by tutors and relatives you two ask a lot of questions russell said were curious by nature sam replied comes with the job sam and remi expected little to come of their visit to chobar gorge and they werent disappointed russell and marjorie pointed out a few landmarks and offered more canned travelogue back in the car sam and remi asked to be taken to the next location the citys historical epicenter known as durbar square which was home to some fifty temples predictably this visit was as unrevealing as the first shadowed by the king twins sam and remi walked around the square and its environs for an hour making a show of taking pictures checking their map and jotting notes finally shortly before noon they asked to be taken back to the hyatt youre done russell asked are you sure were sure said sam marjorie said were happy to take you anywhere youd like to go we need to do some research before we continue remi said we can help with that too sam put a little steel in his voice the hotel please russell shrugged suit yourself from inside the lobby they watched the mercedes pull away sam pulled his iphone from his pocket and checked the screen message from selma he listened to it then said shes dug something up on the king family back in their room sam put the phone on speaker and hit speed dial after thirty seconds of crackling the line clicked open selma answered with finally we were on a tour with the king twins productive only in that it reinforced our urge to get away from them said sam whatve you got for us first ive found someone who can translate the devanagari parchment you found at lewiss house fantastic remi said it gets better i think its the original translatorthe a kaalrami from princeton her first name is adala shes almost seventy and is a professor at care to guess no sam said kathmandu university selma youre a miracle worker remi said normally i would agree mrs fargo but this was dumb luck im emailing you professor kaalramis contact info okay next after hitting dry hole after dry hole in researching the king family i ended up calling rube haywood hes sending me information as he gets it but what weve got so far is interesting first of all king isnt the familys true surname its the anglicized version of the original german konig and lewiss first name was originally lewes why the change asked remi were not entirely sure at this point but what we do know is lewis immigrated to america in and got a teaching job at syracuse university a couple years later when charles was four years old lewis left him and his mother and started his globetrotting whats next i found out what business russell and marjorie are handling there one of kings mining concernssrg or strategic resources groupacquired permits from the nepalese government last year to conduct and i quote exploratory studies related to the exploitation of industrial and precious metals which means what exactly remi asked thats an awfully vague mission statement intentionally vague sam said selma replied the company isnt publicly traded so information is hard to come by i found two sites that are being leased by srg theyre to the northeast of the city a tangled web remi said weve got the king twins overseeing a family mining operation in the same place and at the same time frank disappears while looking for kings father who may or may not have been ghosting around the himalayas for the past forty years am i forgetting anything that about covers it sam said selma asked do you want the particulars on the srg sites hold on to it for now sam replied on the surface it seems unrelated but with king charlie you never know after asking the hyatts concierge to arrange a rental car they took to the road with sam driving and remi navigating a kathmandu city map flattened against the dashboard of the nissan xtrail suv one of the few lessons theyd learned and had since forgotten from their last visit to kathmandu some six years earlier came rushing back to them soon after leaving the hotel except for major thoroughfares like the tridevi and the ring road kathmandus streets rarely bore names either on maps or signs verbal directions were given relative to landmarks usually intersections or squaresknown as chowks or toles respectivelyand occasionally to temples or markets anyone unfamiliar with such reference points had little choice but to rely on a regional map and a compass in sam and remis case they were lucky kathmandu university lay fourteen miles from their hotel in the foothills on the extreme eastern outskirts of the city after spending twenty frustrating minutes finding the arniko highway they made smooth progress and arrived at the campus only an hour after setting out following signs in both nepali and english they turned left at the entrance then drove up a treelined drive to a brickandglass building fronted by an oval plot brimming with wildflowers they found a parking spot walked through the glass entrance doors and found an information desk the young indian woman sitting at the counter spoke oxfordtinged english good morning welcome to kathmandu university how may i help you were looking for professor adala kaalrami said remi yes of course one moment the woman tapped on a keyboard below the counter and studied the monitor for a moment professor kaalrami is currently meeting with a graduate student in the library the meeting is scheduled to end at three the woman produced a campus map then circled their current location and that of the library thank you sam said kathmandus campus was small with only a dozen or so main buildings centered atop a rise below were miles and miles of green terraced fields and thick forests in the distance they could see tribhuvan international airport to the north of this just visible were the pagodastyle roofs of the hyatt regency they walked a hundred yards east down a hedgelined sidewalk turned left and found themselves at the librarys entrance once inside a staff member directed them to a secondfloor conference room they arrived as a lone student was leaving inside seated at a round conference table was a plump elderly indian woman in a bright redandgreen sari remi said excuse me would you be professor adala kaalrami the woman looked up and scrutinized them through a pair of darkrimmed glasses yes i am she her english was thickly accented with a lightly musical quality common to many indian english speakers remi introduced herself and sam then asked if they could sit down kaalrami nodded to the pair of chairs opposite her sam said does the name lewis king mean anything to you bully she replied without hesitation yes she smiled broadly she had a wide gap between her front teeth oh yes i remember bully we were friends the glimmer in her eyes told the fargos the relationship had gone beyond mere friendship i was affiliated with princeton but had come to tribhuvan university on loan that was long before kathmandu university was founded bully and i met at a social function of some kind why do you ask this were looking for lewis king ah ghost hunters are you i take that to mean you believe hes dead remi said oh i do not know of course ive heard the stories about his periodic manifestations but i have never seen him or any genuine pictures of him at least not in the last forty years or so id like to think if he were alive he would have come to see me sam pulled a manila folder from his valise pulled out a copy of the devanagari parchment and slid it across the table to kaalrami do you recognize this she studied it for a moment i do that is my signature i translated this for bully in kaalrami pursed her lips thinking nineteen seventytwo what can you tell us about it sam asked did lewis tell you where he found it he did not remi said to me it looks like devanagari very good my dear close but incorrect it is written in lowa while not quite a dead language it is fairly rare at last estimate there are only four thousand native lowa speakers alive today they are mostly found in the north of the country up near the chinese border in what used to be mustang sam guessed yes thats right and you pronounced it correctly good for you most lowa speakers live in and around lo monthang did you know that about mustang or was it a good guess a guess the only current lead we have on lewis kings whereabouts is a photograph in which he supposedly appears it was taken a year ago in lo monthang we found that parchment at lewiss home do you have this picture with you no remi said then glanced at sam their shared expression said why didnt we ask for a copy of the picture rookie mistake im sure we can get it though if it is not too much trouble i like to think i would recognize bully if it were truly him has anyone else come to see you recently about king kaalrami hesitated again tapping an index finger on her lip a year ago perhaps a bit longer than that a pair of kids were here strangelooking pair twins blond hair blue eyes asian features yes i did not particularly like them i know that is not a charitable thing to say but i must be honest there was just something about them kaalrami shrugged do you remember what they asked you just general questions about bullyif i had any old letters from him or remember him talking about his work in the region i could not help them they didnt have a copy of this parchment no sam asked we never found the original translation would you mind i can give you the essence of it but a written translation will take a while i could do that tonight if youd like thank you said remi wed be most grateful professor kaalrami adjusted her glasses and centered the parchment before her slowly she began tracing her finger down the lines of text her lips moving soundlessly after five minutes she looked up she cleared her throat it is a royal edict of sorts the lowa phrase does not translate well to english but it is an official order of that im certain is there a date no but if you look here at the upper left corner theres a piece of text missing was it on the original parchment no i photographed it exactly as it appeared do you remember if the date was on the original you saw no im afraid not would you care to venture a guess do not hold me to this but i would estimate between six and seven hundred years old go on please sam prompted again you must wait for the written version we understand it is an order to a group of soldiers special soldiers called sentinels they are instructed to carry out a plan of some kindsomething detailed in another document i suspect the plan is designed to remove something called the theurang from its place of hiding and transport it to safety why something to do with an invasion does it explain what the theurang is i do not think so i am sorry most of this is only vaguely familiar to me this was four decades ago i remember the word because it is unusual but i do not think i followed up on it i am a classics teacher however i have no doubt there is someone on staff here who would be of more help with the word i can check for you wed appreciate that sam replied do you remember lewiss reaction when you gave him the translation kaalrami smiled he was elated as i recall but then again bully never lacked for enthusiasm he lived life to its fullest that man did he say where he found the parchment if he did i dont remember perhaps tonight while im translating this more will come back to me one last question remi said what do you remember about the time lewis disappeared oh yes i remember we spent the morning together we had a brunch picnic along a river the bagmati on the southwestern side of the city in unison sam and remi leaned forward sam asked chobar gorge professor kaalrami smiled and tilted her head at sam yes how did you know lucky guess and after the picnic lewis had his backpack with himthat was more common than not for him he was always on the move it was a beautiful day warm not a cloud in the sky as i recall i took pictures i had a new camera one of those first instant polaroid models the ones that folded up back then it was a marvel of technology please tell us you still have those pictures i may it will depend on my sons technical skills if youll excuse me professor kaalrami got up walked to the side table picked up a phone and dialed she spoke in nepali for a couple minutes then looked over to sam and remi and covered the phones mouthpiece do you have mobiles with email access sam gave her his address kaalrami spoke on the phone for another thirty seconds then returned to the table she sighed my son he tells me i need to come into the digital age last month he started scanningis that the right wordall my old photo albums he finished the ones from the picnic last week hes sending them to you thank you sam said and to your son remi said you were saying about the picnic we ate enjoyed each others company talked thenin the early afternoon i thinkwe parted company i got in my car and drove away the last i saw of him he was crossing the chobar gorge bridge kathmandu nepal the drive to chobar gorge went quickly as they first headed west back toward the city on arniko highway on the outskirts they turned south on the ring road and followed it along kathmandus southern edge to the chobar region from there it was a simple matter of following two signs an hour after leaving professor kaalrami they pulled into manjushree park overlooking the gorges northern cliff at five pm they got out and stretched their legs as he had been for the past hour sam checked his iphone for incoming mail he shook his head nothing yet hands on hips remi surveyed the surroundings what are we looking for she asked a giant neon marquee with bully was here flashing on it would be nice but im not holding my breath the truth was neither of them knew if there was anything to find theyd come here based on what might be little more than a coincidence both frank alton and lewis king had spent their final hours here before disappearing however knowing alton as they did it was doubtful hed come here without a good reason aside from a pair of men eating an early dinner on a nearby bench the parkitself little more than a low hill covered in brush and bamboo and a spiral hiking trailwas deserted sam and remi walked down the gravel entrance drive and followed the winding track to the head of the chobar gorge while the main bridge was built of concrete and wide enough to accommodate cars the gorges lower reaches and opposite bank were accessible only via three plankandwire suspension bridges all set at different heights and all reached by hiking trails on both sides of the gorge small temples were set into the hillside partially hidden by thick trees fifty feet below the bagmati frothed and crashed over clusters of boulders remi walked to an information placard attached to the bridges facade she read aloud the english version chovar guchchi is a narrow valley formed by the bagmati river the only outlet of the entire kathmandu valley it is believed that kathmandu valley once held a giant lake when manjusri first came upon the valley he saw a lotus on the surface he sliced open this hillside to drain the water from the lake and make way for the city of kathmandu sam asked who is manjusri im not sure exactly but if i had to guess i would say he was a bodhisattvaan enlightened person sam was nodding as he checked his email got it professor kaalramis son came through he and remi walked to a nearby tree to get out of the setting sun sam called up the pictures five in all and scrolled through them while they had been digitized well enough the photos had that old polaroid feel slightly washed out the colors a bit unnatural the first four photos were of young lewis king and adala kaalrami each reclining or sitting on a blanket plates and glasses and picnic supplies laid out around them none of them together remi remarked no timer sam replied the fifth photo was of lewis king this time standing facing the camera in threequarters profile on his back was an old framestyle backpack they studied the photos a second time sam exhaled heavily and said shouldnt have gotten our hopes up dont speak too soon remi said leaning closer to the iphones screen you see what hes holding in his right hand an ice ax no look closer sam did so a cavers ax and look at whats clipped to his back to the left of his sleeping bag you can just make out the curve of it sam kept his eyes fixed on the screen a smile spread on his face i dont know how i missed that ill be damned its a hard hat remi nodded equipped with a headlamp lewis king was going spelunking not knowing for sure what they were looking for but hoping they were correct they took only ten minutes to find it near the opposite shores bridgehead was a roofed openfronted kiosk with wooden slots containing informational brochures they found a recreational map of the gorge and scanned the numbered dots and description labels a mile upriver from the bridge on the northern bank was a dot labeled chobar caves closed to the public no unauthorized access its a long shot remi said for all we know lewis was headed into the mountains and frank was simply lost long shots are what we do sam reminded his wife besides its either this or we spend another day with russell and marjorie this did the trick remi said what are the odds kathmandu has an rei outlet as expected the odds were nil but they did find a nepalese army surplus shop a few blocks west of durbar square the equipment they purchased was far from modern but of decent quality while neither of them was remotely convinced an exploration of the chobar caves would further their cause it felt good to be taking action this had become one of their mottos when it doubt do something anything shortly before seven they pulled back into the hyatts parking lot as sam climbed out he spotted russell and marjorie standing beneath the turnaround awning sam muttered bandits at three oclock oh yuk dont open the tailgate theyll want to go with us russell and marjorie jogged over to them hey russell said we were getting worried about you we came by to see how you were doing and the concierge said youd rented a car and left marjorie asked everything okay we were mugged twice remi replied deadpan and i think i was tricked into marrying a goat sam added after a few seconds the king children broke into smiles oh youre kidding russell said we get it seriously though you shouldnt wander off sam cut him off russell marjorie i want you to listen to me do i have your attention he got two nods in return between the two of us remi and i have traveled in more countries than either of you can probably namecombined we appreciate your help and your enthusiasm but from this point on well call you if we need you otherwise leave us alone and let us do what we came here to do mouths hanging half open russell and marjorie king stared at him they glanced at remi who simply shrugged what he says he means are we clear sam asked them well yes sir but our father asked us thats your problem to solve if your father wants to talk to us he knows how to reach us any more questions i dont like this russell said marjorie added were just trying to help and weve thanked you now youre testing our limits of politeness why dont you two run along well call if we get into trouble we cant handle after a few moments hesitation the king children turned and walked back to their mercedes they pulled out and slowly passed sam and remi staring hard at them through russells rolleddown window before accelerating away if looks could kill remi said sam nodded i think we may have just seen the true faces of the king twins chobar gorge nepal they set out shortly before four the next morning hoping to arrive at the gorge before sunrise while they had no idea how strictly the chobar caves notrespassing rule was enforcedor whether the area was even patrolled by the policethey didnt want to take any chances at five they pulled into manjushree park and found a spot under a tree not visible from the main road headlights off they sat in silence for two minutes listening to the tickticktick of the nissans engine cooling down before climbing out opening the tailgate and gathering their gear did you really expect them to tail us remi asked settling her pack over her shoulders i dont know what to think anymore my gut tells me theyre bad to the core and i know without a doubt king didnt ask them to help us he ordered them to keep an eye on us i agree hopefully your hearttoheart with them will do the trick bad bet sam said and slammed the tailgate led by the glow of the rising sun they walked down to the bridgehead as advertised on their map twenty yards to the east of the bridge behind a copse of bamboo they found the trail with sam in the lead they headed upriver the first quarter mile was an easy hike the path three feet wide and covered in wellgroomed gravel but this soon changed as the grade steepened the trail narrowed and began going through a series of switchbacks the foliage closed in forming a partial canopy over their heads to their right and below they could hear the river gurgling softly they reached a fork to the left the trail headed due east away from the river to the right down toward the river they paused only a few moments to doublecheck their map and sams iphone compass then took the righthand path after another five minutes of walking they came to a fortyfivedegree slope into which rough steps had been cut at the bottom they found themselves facing not a trail but a rickety suspension bridge its left side affixed to the cliff by lag bolts vines had overrun the bridge so tightly twisted around the supports and wires that the structure looked half manmade half organic i have the distinct feeling that were looking down the rabbit hole remi murmured come on sam said its quaint with you ive come to equate that word with hazardous im crushed can you see how far it goes no keep ahold of the cliff side if the span goes the vines will probably hold another lovely word probably sam took a step forward slowly shifting his weight onto the first plank aside from a slight creaking the wood held firm he took another cautious step then another and another until hed covered ten feet so far so good he called over his shoulder on my way the bridge turned out to be a mere hundred feet long on the other side the trail continued spiraling first down the slope then up ahead the trees began thinning out round two sam said to remi what she replied then stopped short behind him oh no another suspension bridge i sense a trend remi said she was right on the other side of the second span they found another section of trail followed by yet another bridge for the next forty minutes the pattern continued trail bridge trail bridge finally on the fifth section of trail sam called a halt and checked his map and compass were close he murmured the cave entrance is below us somewhere they spread out searching up and down the trail for a way down remi found it on the river side of the trail a rusted cable ladder affixed to a tree trunk dangled in space sam dropped to his belly and with both of remis hands wrapped around his belt scooted forward through the underbrush he wriggled back theres a rock shelf he said the ladder stops about six feet above it well have to drop of course we will remi replied with a tight smile ill go first on her knees remi leaned forward and kissed sam bully kings got nothing on you sam smiled on either of us he shed his pack and handed it back to remi then crabwalked through the underbrush he wrapped his arms around the tree trunk then slowly lowered himself legs dangling and feet probing until he found the ladders top rung im on he told remi starting down he disappeared from view thirty seconds later he called im down drop the packs over the edge remi crawled forward and dropped the first one got it she dropped the second pack got it come on down ill talk you through it on my way when she had reached the secondtolast rung and her lower body was hanging in space sam reached out and wrapped his arms around her thighs ive got you she let go and sam lowered her to the shelf remi adjusted her skewed headlamp then looked around the shelf on which they were standing was six feet wide and jutted several feet over the river in the cliff face was a roughly ovalshaped cave entrance closed off by hurricane fencing screwed into the rock the bottom left corner of the fence had sprung free from the rock a redonwhite sign written in both nepali and english was affixed to the rock danger no trespassing do not enter below the words was a crudely painted skull and crossbones remi smiled look sam its the universal symbol for quaint funny lady he replied ready to spelunk have i ever said no to that question never bless your heart lead on their suspicion that the cave had been sealed off to keep curiosity seekers from getting lost or injured was confirmed seconds after they crawled through the gap in the fence while pushing himself to his feet sams arm slipped into a fissure in the floor barely larger than his forearm had he been moving even at a modest pace he would have broken a bone had he been walking it would have been his ankle bad omen or fair warning he asked remi with a half smile as she helped him to his feet im going with the latter reason why i love you he replied ever the optimist they shone their flashlights around the tunnel it was wide enough that sam could almost spread his arms to their full breadth but only a few inches taller than remi forcing sam to stand stoopshouldered the floor was rough like stucco magnified a hundred times sam turned his head sniffing smells dry remi ran her palm over the ceiling and wall feels dry with luck moisture was out of the equation or almost spelunking in a dry cave was dicey enough water made it hazardous with floors ceiling and walls that could collapse at the slightest disturbance even so they knew that unseen tributaries of the bagmati river could be running beneath their feet so the caves composition could change with little or no warning with sam in the lead they started forward the tunnel veered sharply left then right then suddenly they found themselves standing before their first obstacle this one also manmade a set of vertical iron bars running from wall to wall drilled into the floor and ceiling theyre not kidding around sam said shining his flashlight over the rusted steel how many curiosity seekers had triumphantly squeezed through the hurricane fence at the entrance only to find themselves thwarted here sam wondered remi knelt before the bars one by one she gave each a shake on the fourth try the metal let out a grating sound she smiled over her shoulder at sam the beauty of oxidation give me a hand together they began working the bar back and fourth until slowly it began to loosen in its socket stone chips and dust rained down from the ceiling after two minutes work the bar fell free striking the floor with a clang that echoed through the tunnel sam grabbed the bar and dragged it back through the gap he examined the ends its been cut he murmured then showed it to remi acetylene torch no scorch marks hacksaw would be my guess he shone his flashlight into the bars empty floor socket and could see a few inches down a stub of metal sam looked at remi the plot thickens somebodys been here before and didnt want anyone to know about it she added after taking a moment so sam could get a bearing on his compass and sketch a rough map in his moleskin notebook they squeezed through the gap refitted the bar in its upright position and continued on the tunnel began zigzagging and narrowing and soon the ceiling was at four feet and sams and remis elbows were bumping along the walls the floor began sloping downward they put away their flashlights and turned on their headlamps the floor steepened until they were sidestepping their way down a thirtydegree grade using rock protrusions as hand and footholds stop remi said suddenly listen from somewhere nearby came the gurgling of water sam said the river they descended another twenty feet and the tunnel flattened out into a short corridor sam shimmied ahead to where the floor began sloping upward again its nearly vertical he called back i think if were careful we can freeclimb sam take a look at this he turned around and made his way back to where remi was standing her neck craned back as she stared at the wall in the beam of her headlamp an object about the size of a halfdollar bulged from the rock it looks metallic sam said here climb aboard sam knelt down and remi climbed on his shoulders he slowly stood up allowing remi time to steady herself against the wall after a few seconds she said its a railroad spike say again remi repeated herself its buried in the rock up to the cap hold on i think i can there its tight but i managed to slide it out a few inches theres another one sam about two feet up and another one im going to stand up ready go she rose to her full height theres a line of them she said they go up about twenty feet to what looks like a shelf sam thought for a moment can you slide out the second one hold on done okay climb back down said sam once she was back on the ground he said good show thanks she said i can think of only one reason theyd be that high off the ground so theyd go unnoticed she nodded they look fairly old circa sam wondered aloud referring to the year lewis king disappeared could be unless i miss my guess it looks like bully or some other phantom spelunker built himself a ladder but to where as sams words trailed off they panned the beams of their headlamps up the wall one way to find out remi replied chobar gorge nepal as a ladder the vertical alignment of the spikes would make sams ascent awkwardif in fact he was able to reach the first rung to that end he uncoiled his rope tied a slipknot in one end and spent two minutes trying to lasso the second spike once done he used a bit of parachute chord to secure a stirruplike prusik knot to the rope to climbandslide his way up the wall with one foot perched on the lowermost rung and his left hand wrapped around the second rung he untied the slipknot and clipped it to his harness he then reached up slid out the third spike and started upward after five minutes of this he reached the top not that id care to try it sam called down but there are just enough handholds to make the ascent without the spikes it would have taken some skill to set them then and strength what do you see remi called sam craned his neck around until his beam shone over the rock shelf crawl space not much wider than my shoulders hang on ill drop you a line he withdrew the secondtolast rail spike and replaced it with a slcd springloaded camming device which locked itself into the hole to this he attached first a carabiner then the rope he dropped the coil down to remi got it she said wait there im going to scout ahead theres no sense in both of us being up here if its a dead end two minutes then im coming after you or if you hear a scream and a thud whichever comes first no screaming or thudding allowed remi warned be back in a flash sam adjusted his position until both his feet were perched on the uppermost spike and his arms were braced against the rock ledge he took a breath coiled his legs and pushed off while levering with his arms launching his torso onto the ledge he inchwormed forward until his legs were no longer dangling in air ahead sams headlamp penetrated only ten to twelve feet beyond that blackness he licked his index finger and held it upright the air was perfectly still not a welcome sign getting into caves was usually the easy part getting out often harder which was why any spelunker worth his salt was always on the lookout for secondary exits this was especially true of unmapped systems like this one sam brought his watch to his face and started the chronometer remi had given him two minutes and knowing his wife as he did at two minutes and one second shed be on her way up the rope he started crawling forward his gear clanked and rasped over the rock floor sounding impossibly loud in the cramped space tons the word appeared unbidden in his mind there were countless tons of rock hanging over his body at this very moment he forced the thought from his mind and kept going this time more slowly the primal part of his brain telling him tread carefully lest the world collapse around you he passed the twentyfoot mark and stopped to check his watch one minute gone he kept crawling the tunnel curved left then right then began angling upward gently at first then more steadily until he had to use a modified chimney crawl to keep moving thirty feet gone another time check thirty seconds to go he crossed over a hump in the floor and found himself in a wider flat area ahead his headlamp swept over an opening almost twice as wide as the crawl space he craned his neck and called over his shoulder remi are you there im here came the faint reply i think ive got something on my way he heard her crawling up behind him as her headlamp washed over the walls and ceiling she gripped his calf and gave it an affectionate squeeze howre you doing while sam wasnt clinically claustrophobic there were moments in particularly tight spaces when he had to exert strict control over his mind this was such a time it was remi had told him the downside of having a fertile imagination possibilities became probabilities and an otherwise stable cave became a death trap ready to collapse into the bowels of the earth at the slightest bump sam are you there remi asked yep i was mentally practicing wilson picketts in the midnight hour sam was a fair hand at the piano and remi at the violin occasionally when time permitted they practiced duets while composer picketts music didnt readily lend itself to classical instruments as lovers of vintage american soul they enjoyed the challenge whatve you found remi asked that its going to take a lot more practice and my blues voice needs more i mean ahead oh an opening lead on this crawl space is too tight for my liking unseen by remi sam smiled his wife was being kind while sams male ego wasnt a fragile thing remi also knew that offering a little facesaving was a womans prerogative here we go sam replied and started crawling forward it took only thirty seconds to reach the opening sam inched forward until his head was through he looked around then said over his shoulder a circular pit about ten feet across i cant see the bottom but i can hear water gurglingprobably a subterranean offshoot of the bagmati directly across from us is another opening but about twelve feet higher oh joy how are the walls diagonal stalagmites the biggest about as thick as a baseball bat the rest about half that no conveniently placed spike ladders sam took another look panning his headlamp along the pits walls no he called back his voice echoing but dangling directly over my head is a spear pardon me did you say yes its affixed to the wall by what looks like a leather cord theres a piece of cord hanging below the spear with a shard of wood attached trip wire remi commented my guess as well theyd seen similar trapsdesigned to foil intrudersin tombs fortresses and primitive bunkers however old this spear trap was it had likely been contrived to plunge into the neck of an unsuspecting interloper the question sam and remi knew was what had the booby trap been intended to protect describe the spear remi said ill do you one better sam rolled over on his back braced his feet against the ceiling and wriggled forward until his upper torso was jutting through the opening careful remi warned is my middle name sam finished well this is interesting theres only one spear but two more attachment points either the other two spears fell away or they found victims he reached up grasped the spears shaft above the point and pulled despite its halfrotted appearance the leather was surprisingly strong only after sam wriggled the shaft back and forth did the cordage give way he maneuvered the spear around twirling it like a baton then slid it back along his body toward remi got it she said a few seconds later this doesnt look familiar im no weapons expert mind you but ive never seen a design like this before its very oldat least six hundred years i imagine ill get some pictures in case we cant come back for it remi retrieved her camera from her pack and took a dozen shots while she was doing this sam took a closer look around the pit i dont see any more booby traps im trying to imagine what it must have looked like by torchlight terrifying is the word remi replied think of it at least one of your friends had just taken a spear to the back of the neck and plummeted into a seemingly bottomless pit and all youve got is a flickering torch to see by enough to turn away even the bravest of explorers sam agreed but not us remi replied with a smile sam could hear in her voice whats the plan everything depends on those stalagmites did you bring up the rope we left behind here sam reached back until he felt remis outstretched hand grabbed the carabiner and pulled the coil up to him he tied first a slipknot into the loose end followed by a stopper knot to this for weight he clipped the carabiner he maneuvered his body until his arms were free of the opening then tossed the line across the pit aiming for one of the larger stalagmites a few feet below the opposite tunnel opening he missed retrieved the rope tried again this time laying the slipknot over the tip of the protrusion he jiggled the line until the knot slid down to the base of the stalagmite then cinched the knot tight care to help me with a stress test sam asked remi on three pull with everything youve got one two three together they heaved on the rope doing their best to rip the stalagmite from the wall it held steady i think were okay sam said can you find a crack in the wall and im looking found one remi slid a springloaded cam into the crack and fed the rope through it then through a ratchet carabiner take up the slack sam did so heaving on the rope as remi slid the carabiner up to the cam until the line was as taut sam gave it a test pluck looks good remi said i suppose it goes unsaid what be careful yes it does but its nice to hear anyway luck sam wrapped both hands around the rope and shimmied forward slowly transferring his weight onto the line hows the cam look he asked steady sam took a steadying breath then pulled his lower legs free of the crawl space he dangled in the air not daring to move gauging the sag in the rope and listening for the sound of cracking rock until ten seconds had passed he then pulled his legs up hooked his ankles over the line and began inching across the pit holding steady on this end remi called when sam reached the halfway point sam reached the opposite wall transferred first one hand then the other to the stalagmite then swung his legs up and braced his right heel against another protrusion testing his weight as he went he contorted his body until he was sitting perched atop the stalagmite he took a moment to catch his breath then slowly stood up until he was level with the opening a quick boost with his hands and a shove off the stalagmite and he was inside the crawl space be right back he called to remi then scrabbled inside he was back thirty seconds later looks good it widens out farther on on my way remi answered in two minutes she was across and sam was pulling her into the opening they lay still together for a few moments enjoying the feeling of solid rock beneath them this reminds me a lot of our third date remi said fourth sam corrected her the third date was horseback riding the fourth was the rock climbing remi smiled kissed him on the cheek and they say guys dont remember those things whos they they who havent met you remi shone her headlamp around any sign of booby traps not yet well keep a sharp eye but if your estimate on the age of that spear is accurate i doubt any trip mechanisms would still be working famous last words you have my permission to put it on my tombstone come on sam started crawling with remi right behind him as sam had promised a few seconds later the crawl space opened into a kidneyshaped alcove roughly twenty feet wide and five feet tall in the opposite wall were three vertical clefts each no wider than eighteen inches they stood up and stoopwalked to the first cleft sam shone his headlamp inside dead end he said remi checked the next another dead end the third cleft while deeper than its neighbors also petered out a half dozen paces inside well that was anticlimactic sam said maybe not remi murmured then started toward the righthand wall her headlamp pointing at what looked like a horizontal slash of darker rock where the wall met the ceiling as they drew closer the slash seemed to grow taller rising into the ceiling until they realized they were looking at a slotlike tunnel standing side by side sam and remi peered into the opening which rose away from them at a fortyfivedegree angle for twenty feet before rounding over a jagged bump in the floor sam do you see what i think i do jutting over the ridge in the floor was what appeared to be the sole of a boot chobar gorge nepal the lack of treads on the boots sole told sam and remi they werent looking at a modern piece of footwear and the skeletal toe poking through a rotted patch in the boot told them the owner had long since departed the earthly plane is it strange that this sort of thing doesnt shock me anymore remi said staring at the foot weve stumbled across our fair share of skeletons sam agreed such surprises were part and parcel of their avocation see any trip wires no lets take a look around sam braced his legs against one wall his back against the other and let remi use his arm to pull herself up he made his way up the slope and over the hump in the floor after panning his headlamp around the space he called all clear youre going to want to see this remi she was beside him in an instant kneeling together they examined the skeleton protected from the elements and predators and entombed in the relative dryness of the cave the remains had partially mummified the clothes which appeared to be made mostly of laminated and layered leather remained largely intact i dont see any obvious signs of trauma remi said how old just speculating at least four hundred years in the same range as the spear right this looks like a uniform said sam touching a sleeve then that makes more sense replied remi pointing jutting from what had once been a belt sheath was the hilt of a dagger she panned her headlamp around the space then murmured home sweet home home perhaps sam replied but sweet i suppose everythings relative a few paces from the flat area on which the skeleton lay the tunnel widened into an alcove of roughly a hundred square feet in several handcarved niches in the rock walls were the stubs of crude candles at the base of one wall nestled in a natural hollow were the remains of a fire beside it a pile of small animal bones at the far end of the alcove were the remains of what looked like a bedroll and beside it a sheathed sword half a dozen crudely honed spears a compound bow and a quiver containing eight arrows a scattering of miscellaneous items occupied the remainder of the floor a pail a coil of halfrotted rope a leather pack a round woodandleather shield a wooden chest remi stood up and began walking around the space he was definitely expecting unfriendly company sam observed this has all the signs of a last stand but to what end maybe it has something to do with this remi said and knelt down beside the wooden chest sam walked over about the size of a small ottoman the chest was a perfect cube made of a dark heavily lacquered hardwood with leather carrying straps on three sides and double shoulder straps on the fourth sam and remi could find no hinges no locking mechanisms the seams were so well formed they were nearly invisible engraved into the top of the chest were four intricate asian characters in a twobytwo grid pattern do you recognize the language sam asked no this is remarkable sam said even with modern woodworking tools it takes incredible skill to create something like this he rapped on the side with his knuckles and got a solid thud in return doesnt sound hollow gently he rocked the chest from side to side from within came a faint rattling sound but it is fairly light too i dont see any other markings you remi leaned down and from side to side examining it she shook her head bottom sam tipped it remi checked then said nothing there either somebody went to a lot of trouble to build this said sam and it looks like our friend here was prepared to give his life to protect it it may be more than that remi added unless weve stumbled onto the mother of all coincidences i think we may have found what lewis king was looking for if so how did he miss this he was so close if he didnt make it across the pit remi replied could he have survived only one person knows the answer to that they turned their attention to documenting the contents of the cave not knowing how soon they would return and unable to take with them but a fraction of the artifacts they would have to rely on digital photographs drawings and notes luckily remis background and training made her well equipped to do just this after two hours of painstaking work she proclaimed the job done wait remi said then knelt beside the shield sam joined her what is it these scratches the light caught them i think she leaned over took a deep breath and blew on the shields leather surface an accumulation of rotted leather dust scattered not a scratch sam observed and blew clear some more dust then again and again until the shields surface was exposed as remi had suspected the scratches were in fact an etching burned into the leather itself is that a dragon remi asked or a dinosaur probably his crest or that of his unit sam guessed remi took a couple dozen shots of the etching and they stood up thatll do it she said what about the chest we have to take it my gut tells me it was why our friend had barricaded himself in here whatevers inside was something he thought worth dying for i agree it took only a few minutes for sam to juryrig a web of straps that allowed him to piggyback the chest on his own pack they took a last look around the cave nodded a goodbye to the skeleton and departed in the lead sam crawled up to the lip of the pit and peeked over now thats a problem care to be more specific remi said the ropes given way at the other end its dangling into the pit can you rig a not with any confidence were above the other opening at this angle if i try to cinch the slipknot into place itll just slide off thered be no way to take up the slack that leaves only one option then sam nodded down it took but a minute for sam to secure himself to the line as he did remi set up a second belay point by hammering a piton into a crack just below the opening once it was set sam began a slow rappel walking himself over and around the jutting stalagmites while remi kept watch from above occasionally telling him to pause and adjust position to minimize the rope chafing on the protrusions after two minutes of careful work he stopped ive reached the other cam good news the cam tore free if the rope had parted they would have had to splice their remaining line onto the loose end now he had sixty feet of line beneath him whether that would be enough to reach the bottom was still an unknown if what awaited them was the icy cold water of the bagmati river they would have fifteen minutes at most to find a way out before succumbing to hypothermia ill take that as a good omen replied remi foot by foot careful step by careful step sam kept descending his headlamp receding into a small rectangle of light i cant see you anymore remi called dont worry if i fall ill be sure to give out an appropriately terrified scream ive never heard you scream in your life fargo and cross fingers you wont this time howre the walls more of thewhoa what no response sam im okay just lost my footing for a second the walls are getting icy must be mist from the water below how bad just a thin coating on the walls cant trust any of the stalagmites though come back up well figure out another way im continuing on ive got another thirty feet of rope to play with two minutes passed sams headlamp was a mere pinpoint now jostling back and forth in the pits darkness as he maneuvered around the stalagmites suddenly there came the sound of shattering ice sams headlamp began spinning winking up at remi like a strobe light before she could open her mouth to call to him sam shouted im okay upside down but okay more description if you please got turned around in my harness and flipped good news though im staring at the water its about ten feet below my head i hear a but coming the currents fastthree knots at leastand it looks deep waisthigh probably though three knots was slower than a fast walking pace the depth and temperature of the water multiplied the hazard not only would it take only one minor misstep to be swept away but the exertion it would take to stay upright would speed up the hypothermia process come back up remi said no arguments agreed give me a second to hold on from the darkness came more cracking of ice followed by splashes talk to me fargo give me a second another thirty seconds of cracking then sams voice side tunnel after ten minutes of detailed work sam shouted its goodsized almost tall enough to stand in im going in give me a minute to set up a belay if remi went into the subterranean river this measure would give sam a fighting chance to reel her back inprovided there werent rocks downriver ready to bash remi into pulp once this was done and sam was braced and ready to take slack remi started her descent lighter and a bit more agile than her husband she covered the distance in less time pausing only to allow sam time to take up slack through the pitons belay point at last she descended into view and stopped even with the side tunnels entrance headlamps shining into one anothers faces they shared a relieved smile fancy meeting you here sam said damn what i had a mental bet you were going to go with whats a nice girl like you doing in a nearly bottomless pit like this sam laughed okay youre going to have to go superman in your rig and push off the opposite wall ill catch you remi took a few moments to catch her breath and then made the appropriate adjustments to her harness until she was hanging perpendicular in the pit flexing her body she slowly built up a swing until she could toepush off the opposite wall three more of these allowed her to fully coil her legs and push off arms extended she swung forward hands grasping the side wall rushed toward her face she ducked her head her arms slipped into the tunnel sams hands clamped on hers and she jolted to a stop got you sam said wrap both hands around my left wrist she did and sam used his right arm to slowly release some slack in the rope so remi could climb up his arm once her torso was inside the tunnel sam began backcrawling until her knees were also inside he fell back and let out a relieved sigh remi started laughing sam raised his head and looked at her what you take me to the nicest places after this a nice hot bubble bathfor two youre singing my song though twice as wide as their shoulders and tall enough to allow them to walk stooped over the tunnels floor was swiss cheeseso riddled with potholes that they could glimpse the rivers roiling black surface rushing beneath their feet plumes of cold air and ice crystals shot up through the gaps creating a fog that glittered and swirled in their headlamps like the pit behind them the tunnels walls and ceiling were coated in a membrane of ice as they walked pencilthin icicles broke from the ceiling and shattered on the floor like sporadic wind chimes though mostly clear of ice the heavily rutted floor forced them to brace themselves as they walked adding to the exertion not to be a wet blanket remi said but were assuming this leads somewhere we are indeed sam replied over his shoulder and if were wrong then we turn back scale the opposite side of the pit and leave the way we came in the tunnel twisted and turned rose and fell but according to sams compass bearings it maintained a rough easterly bearing they took turns counting steps but without a gps unit to measure their overall progress and only sams sketched map to go by they had no idea how much distance they were actually covering after what sam guessed was a hundred yards he called another halt and found a relatively solid section of tunnel and plopped to the ground after sharing a few sips of water and a quarter of their remaining jerky and dried fruit they sat in silence listening to the rush of the water beneath their feet what time is it remi asked sam checked his watch nine oclock while they had told selma where they were heading theyd also asked her not to press the panic button until the following morning local time even then how long would it take the authorities to arrange a rescue party and mount a search their only saving grace was that this tunnel had not branched if they chose to turn back theyd have no trouble finding the pit again but at what point did they make that decision was an exit around the next bend or miles away or nonexistent neither sam nor remi spoke of any of this they didnt need to their years together and the adventures theyd shared had put them on the same wavelength facial expressions were usually enough to convey what each was thinking im still holding you to that hot bubble bath promise remi said forgot to tell you ive added a relaxing massage to the pot my hero shall we sam nodded lets give it another hour if a red carpet exit doesnt materialize well turn back have a rest then tackle the pit deal accustomed to hardship of both the mental and the physical variety sam and remi fell into a rhythm walk for twenty minutes pause for two minutes to rest take a compass bearing and update the map then onward again the remaining time of their journey passed quickly left foot right foot repeat to conserve light remi had long ago turned off her headlamp and sam had set his to its lowest setting so they found themselves moving in the faintest of twilights the cold air gushing through the floor seemed colder their footing harder to maintain the tinkle of falling icicles jarring to their numbed brains suddenly sam stopped her reactions at half speed remi bumped into him sam whispered do you feel that what cold air sam its no in our faces ahead will you dig the lighter out of my pack remi did so and handed it to him sam took a few steps forward looking for a solid section of floor between plumes he found a suitable spot stopped and clicked on the lighter remi squeezed herself in next to sam and peered around his arm flickering yellow light danced off the icy walls the flame wavered then steadied and stood straight up wait sam murmured eyes on the flame five seconds passed the flame wobbled then shot sideways back toward sams face there are you sure remi asked the air feels warmer now too wishful thinking lets find out they walked for ten feet stopped checked the lighters flame again it angled backward this time more strongly they proceeded twenty more feet and repeated the process with the same result from remi i hear whistling wind me too another fifty feet brought them to a fork in the tunnel lighter held before him sam proceeded down the left tunnel without luck then down the right the flame quavered then a sudden gust nearly blew it out sam shed his pack wait here ill be back in a flash he switched his headlamp to its brightest setting and disappeared into the tunnel remi could hear his feet scuffing along the floor the sound growing fainter by the second remi checked her watch waited ten seconds checked it again sam she called silence sam answer ahead in the darkness his headlamp reappeared sorry he said remi let her head drop no red carpet sam continued but would daylight do remi raised her head took in sams wide smile she narrowed her eyes at him and gave him a punch in the shoulder not funny fargo as sam had promised there was no red carpet but after twenty feet of walking he brought her to something even better a set of natural steps winding up a shaft at whose top some fifty feet away was a fuzzy patch of sunlight two minutes later sam pushed himself off the top step and found himself peering down a short sideways tunnel instead of rock the sides and floor were earth at the far end through a tangle of grass was sunlight sam crawled toward it shoved his arms through the opening then dragged himself out remi appeared a few moments later and together they lay back in the grass smiling and staring up at the sky almost noon sam remarked theyd been underground all morning suddenly sam sat up his head turning this way and that he leaned over to remi and whispered radio static a portable radio sam rolled over crawled to a berm a few feet away and peeked his head over the side he ducked down and crawled back police a rescue party remi asked who wouldve called them just a guess but id say our erstwhile exploratory escorts the king twins how i dont know maybe im wrong lets play it safe they stripped themselves of anything that would indicate where theyd been and what theyd been doinghelmets headlamps backpacks climbing gear sams map remis digital camera the box theyd retrieved from the tomband shoved it all back into the tunnel then packed grass over the entrance with sam in the lead they headed east following a ravine and ducking between trees until theyd put a quarter mile between themselves and the tunnel they stopped and listened for radio static sam tapped his ear and pointed north a hundred yards away they could see several figures moving through the trees sam whispered put on your best forlorn face not much of stretch at this point replied remi sam cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted hey over here chobar gorge nepal the cell door creaked open a guard peeked inside scrutinized sam for a moment as though he were about to make a dash for freedom then stood aside clothed in a baggy light blue jumpsuit auburn hair pulled back in a ponytail remi stepped into the room her face was pink freshly washed the guard said in broken english please sit wait then slammed shut the door clothed in a similar jumpsuit sam stood up from the table walked over to remi and gave her a big hug he pulled back and looked her up and down and smiled ravishing simply ravishing she smiled idiot howre you feeling better amazing what a few minutes with a washcloth and hot water can do not quite a warm shower or a hot bath mind you but a close second together they sat down at the table the space in which the kathmandu police were keeping them wasnt so much a cell as it was a holding room the cinderblock walls and the floor were painted a light gray and the table and chairs all bolted to the floor were made of heavy aluminum before them across the table was a fourfootwide meshembedded window through which they could see the squad room half a dozen uniformed officers were going about their business answering phones writing reports and chatting so far except for a few polite but firm commands in rough english no one had spoken to them in the two hours since theyd been rescued riding in the back of the police van in the rapidly fading dusk light sam and remi had watched the passing scenery looking for the slightest clue as to where they had emerged from the cave system their answer had come almost immediately as they crossed over the chobar gorge bridge and turned northeast toward kathmandu proper their underground march to freedom had brought them to the surface a mere two miles from where theyd entered this realization brought first a smile to sams and remis lips and then to the bewilderment of the two police officers in the front seat a gale of laughter that lasted a full minute any clue as to who raised the alarm remi now asked sam none as far as i can tell were not under arrest we have to assume theyre going to question us whats our story going to be sam thought for a moment as close to the truth as possible we came out here a little before sunrise for a day hike we got lost and wandered around until they found us if they push just stick with im not sure unless they found our equipment they cant prove otherwise got it and providing we dont get thrown into a nepali prison for some obscure crime well need to retrieve the sam stopped talking his eyes narrowed remi followed his gaze through the window to the far left side of the squad room near the door standing at the threshold were russell and marjorie king i wish i could say i was surprised remi muttered just as we suspected across the squad room the sergeant in charge spotted the king twins and hurried over to where they were standing the trio began talking back and forth though neither sam nor remi could hear the conversation the sergeants mannerisms and posture told the tale he was subservient if not a little frightened finally the sergeant nodded and hurried back into the squad room russell and marjorie stepped back into the hallway a few moments later sam and remis door opened and the sergeant and one of his underlings stepped inside they took the seats opposite the fargos the sergeant spoke nepali for a few seconds then nodded to his underling who said in heavily accented but decent english my sergeant has asked that i translate our conversation is this acceptable sam and remi nodded the sergeant spoke and a few seconds later the translation came if you would please confirm your identities sam replied have we been arrested no the officer replied you are being temporarily detained on what grounds under nepali law we are not required to disclose the answer to that question at the present time please confirm your identities sam and remi did so and for the next few minutes they were taken through a series of routine questionswhy are you in nepal where are you staying what prompted your visitbefore getting down to substance where were you going when you got lost nowhere in particular remi responded it seemed like a lovely day for a hike you parked your car at chobar gorge why we heard it was a beautiful area said sam what time did you arrive before dawn why so early were restless souls sam replied with a smile what does that mean we like to stay busy said remi please tell us where your hike took you if we knew that sam said we probably wouldnt have gotten lost you had a compass with you how did you lose your way i flunked out of boy scouts said sam remi chimed in i only sold cookies in the girl scouts this is not a laughing matter mr and mrs fargo do you find this funny sam put on his best chastised expression apologies were exhausted and a little embarrassed were grateful you found us who alerted you we might be in trouble the officer translated the question his sergeant grunted something then spoke again my sergeant asks that you restrict yourselves to answering his questions you said you planned to go on a daylong hike where were your backpacks we didnt expect to be gone that long remi said were not the best planners either sam nodded sadly to emphasize his wifes point the officer asked you expect us to believe you went on a hike with no equipment whatsoever i had my swiss army knife sam said drily at this translation the sergeant glanced up and glared at sam then remi then stood up and stalked from the room please wait here the officer said and left the room not surprisingly the sergeant walked straight through the squadroom door to the hallway sam and remi could see only his back russell and marjorie were out of view sam stood up walked to the farright side of the window and pressed his face against it can you see them remi asked yep and the twins look unhappy not a smarmy smile in sight russells gesturing well this is interesting what hes mimicking the shape of a boxa box that looks remarkably like the same size as the chest thats good i imagine theyve searched the area in which they found us russell wouldnt be asking for whats already been found sam stepped back from the window and hurried back to his seat the sergeant and his officer stepped back into the room and sat down the questioning resumed this time with a bit more intensity and in a roundabout fashion designed to trip up sam and remi the gist of the queries remained the same however we know you had to have had belongings where are they sam and remi took their time and stuck to their story watching as the sergeants frustration grew at last the sergeant resorted to threats we know who you are and what you do for a living we suspect you have come to nepal in search of black market antiquities on what do you base your suspicions sam asked sources youve been misinformed said remi there are several statutes under which you can be charged all of which carry serious penalties sam leaned forward in his chair and fixed the sergeants gaze charge away right after were booked well want to talk to the legal attache at the us embassy the sergeant held sams eyes for a long ten seconds then leaned back and sighed he said something to his underling then stood up and left the room banging the open door against the wall as he left the underling translated you are free to go ten minutes later back in their own clothes sam and remi were out the front door of the police station and walking down the steps dusk was falling the sky was clear and a scattering of diamondspeck stars began to shine streetlights illuminated the cobblestoned street below sam remi expecting this neither of them were surprised when they turned to see russell and marjorie hurrying down the sidewalk toward them we just heard russell said trotting up are you okay tired a little embarrassed but no worse for wear sam replied theyd already decided to stick to their gotlostonahike story with the king twins it was a precarious dance everyone knew sam and remi were lying what would russell and marjorie do about it better question as it now seemed clear that charlie king had a wholly different agenda than the one hed shared with sam and remi how would they proceed what was king after and what was the true story behind frank altons disappearance well take you to your car marjorie said well collect it in the morning replied remi were going back to the hotel better we get it now russell said if youve got gear inside sam couldnt help but smile at this we dont good night sam took remis arm and together they turned and started walking in the opposite direction russell called well call you in the morning dont call us well call you sam replied without turning houston texas hell yes id say theyre off the reservation charles king barked reclining in his plush office chair behind him the cityscape filled his floortoceiling window half a world away russell and marjorie king said nothing over the speakerphone they knew better than to interrupt their father when he wanted to know something he would ask a question where the hell were they all day we dont know russell replied the man we hired to follow them lost them southwest of the hired what dya mean hired hes one of our security men at the dig site marjorie said hes trustworthy but incompetent how about gettin somebody with both those glowin attributes ever consider that whyd you hire someone what were you two doin we were at the site said russell were getting ready to ship the never mind doesnt matter could the fargos have been in that cave system its possible replied marjorie but weve been through it theres nothing to find yeah yeah the question is if they were howd they find out about it you gotta make sure theyre gettin only the info we want them to get understand yes dad replied marjorie and russell in unison what about their belongins we went through them said russell and their car our man in the police department questioned them for an hour but no luck did he twist their arms for gods sake as far as he could the fargos were unfazed he said whatd they say theyd been doin they claimed they got lost on a hike bull crap this is sam and remi fargo were talkin about ill tell you what happened you two screwed up somehow and the fargos got suspicious theyre runnin circles around you two put a bunch of people on em i want to know where theyre goin and what theyre doin you got that you can count on us dad said marjorie thatd be a nice change grumbled king in the meantime im not takin any more chances im sendin reinforcements king leaned forward and stabbed the speakerphones disconnect button standing on the other side of the desk her hands folded before her stood zhilan hsu you are hard on them charles she said quietly and you coddle em king shot back until this latest incident with the fargos theyve done well for you king frowned and gave an annoyed shake of his head i spose still i want you to get out there make sure this thing dont go too far off the rails somethins got the fargos backs up take the gulfstream and get out there fix em that alton character too hes useless now can you be more specific get the fargos to play their part failin that nepals a big place plenty of room for people to disappear hyatt regency hotel kathmandu nepal in the early morning the phone on remis nightstand was ringing sam did you do this on purpose a wakeup call do you know what time it is sam picked up the phone and said well be there in fortyfive minutes be where remi demanded as i promised a himalayan hot stone massage for you and a deep tissue massage for me fargo said remi with wide smile youre a treasure she slid out of bed and dashed to the bathroom as sam answered a knock on the door room service delivered the breakfast hed ordered the night before remis favorite corned beef hash and poached eggs and for him scrambled eggs with salmon hed also ordered coffee and two glasses of pomegranate juice while they ate they turned their attention to the mysterious chest that sat on the couch across from their table remi poured a second cup of coffee as sam dialed up selma do you think king had alton kidnapped selma asked to get us here remi offered taking a sip of coffee selma chimed in get you there on the pretext of looking for frank and then what false flag sam murmured then explained its an espionage term an agent is recruited by an enemy posing as an ally the agent thinks his mission is one thing but its actually something altogether different oh great remi remarked its a house of cards sam agreed if thats what king is up to his ego wouldnt let him entertain the idea of the plan derailing then you dont know if youre actually looking for lewis king or not or whether there was even a sighting of him charlie doesnt strike me as the sentimental type if i had to guess id say its not so much his father charlie is chasing but perhaps what his father was chasing the chest you found selma suggested as i said a guess replied sam the night before rather than returning to the hotel sam and remi had walked south of the police station until they were out of view then turned north and flagged a cab sam ordered the driver to meander around the city for ten minutes as he and remi watched for signs of surveillance they had little doubt the king twins intended to follow them and they were giving them no time to set up once certain they were not being followed sam ordered the driver to take them to a rental car agency on the southern outskirts of kathmandu where they hired a battered green opel an hour later they pulled into a motel parking lot a half mile from chobar gorge where they left the car and walked the remaining distance having memorized landmarks while being driven away by the police they took less than an hour to find their exit tunnel their gear was still inside and apparently untouched were sending it to you via fedex remi told selma if it is what king is after better we get rid of it besides selma you like puzzles youre going to love this one solve it and well buy you that fish for your tank the uh aquarium mr fargo a tank is something you put in a childs bedroom and the fish is a type of cichlid very rare very expensive its scientific name is in latin im sure sam finished with a chuckle open our nepali puzzle box and its yours you dont need to bribe me mr fargo this is part of my job then call it an early birthday present remi replied she and sam shared a smile selma did not enjoy celebrating birthdays especially her own by the way i heard back from rube selma said rapidly changing subjects he looked into zhilan hsu he said shesand i quoteall but invisible no drivers license no credit cards no public records of any kind save one her immigration record according to it she emigrated here on a work visa from hong kong in at the age of sixteen let me guess sam said employed by king oil correct but heres the kicker she was six months pregnant at the time ive done the math her due date roughly coincides with the birth date of russell and marjorie its official remi said i doubly dont like charlie king he probably bought her a safe bet sam agreed selma asked whats your next step back to the university we got a voice mail from professor kaalrami shes finished the translation of the devanagari parchment lowa remi corrected she said it was written in lowa right lowa sam replied with any luck her colleague can shed some light on the tomb we foundor at least rule out a connection and what about frank assuming kings behind his kidnapping our only chance to get him back is leverage if king thinks we have something he wants well be in a better position to bargain until then we can only hope king is smart enough not to kill frank kathmandu university after making certain they were not being followed sam and remi found a fedex office and mailed the chest it would take two days and six hundred dollars the agent told them but the package would be on a plane by early evening a bargain sam and remi decided knowing the chest would be beyond marjorie and russells reachprovided it was in fact of interest to king anyway they had neither the time nor the resources to devote to opening the chest it was better off in the hands of selma pete and wendy sam and remi reached the university campus shortly after one oclock and found professor kaalrami in her office after exchanging pleasantries they settled around her conference table this was challenging professor kaalrami began the translation took me nearly six hours were sorry it took so much of your time remi replied nonsense it was better than spending the evening watching television i enjoyed the brain exercise i have a written translation for you she slid a typewritten sheet of paper across the table to them i can confirm the essence of the document it is a military decree ordering the evacuation of the theurang from the capital city of lo monthang in the kingdom of mustang when asked sam the decree does not say said professor kaalrami the man we are going to meet after thismy colleaguemay be better equipped to answer that there may be some clue in the text that i missed this theurang remi prompted aside from it also being referred to as the golden man im afraid i found no explanation but as i said my colleague may know i can tell you the reason the decree was issued an invasion an army was approaching lo monthang on behalf of the royal house the leader of the mustang armyi gather the position is similar to that of a marshal or chief of staffordered that the theurang be carried from the city by a special group of soldiers known as sentinels there is no description beyond that just their name evacuated to where asked sam the decree does not say the phrase as ordered is used several times which suggests the sentinels may have received a separate more specific briefing anything else remi asked one item that caught my attention professor kaalrami replied the decree praises the sentinels willingness to die in order to protect the golden man fairly standard military language sam said a pep talk by the general before no im sorry mr fargo i used the wrong word the praise was not for their willingness to give their lives in the line of duty the language used was one of certitude whoever wrote this document fully expected the sentinels to die none of them were expected to return to lo monthang alive shortly before two oclock the time professor kaalrami had arranged for them to meet with her colleague sushant dharel they left her office and walked across campus to another building they found dharela pencilthin man in his midthirties wearing khaki pants and a shortsleeved white shirtfinishing a class in a woodpaneled classroom they waited until all the students had filed out and then professor kaalrami made the introductions upon hearing kaalramis description of sam and remis interest dharels eyes lit up you have this document with you and the translation professor kaalrami replied and handed them over dharel scanned both his lips moving wordlessly as he absorbed the contents he looked up at sam and remi where did you find this in whose possession was he stopped suddenly forgive my excitement and my bad manners please sit down sam remi and professor kaalrami took chairs in the first row dharel pulled a chair from around his desk and sat before them if you would where did you find this it was among the belongings of a man named lewis king a friend of mine from long ago professor kaalrami added it was long before your time sushant i believe my translation is fairly accurate but i could not give mr and mrs fargo much context as our resident expert on nepalese history i thought you might help of course of course dharel said eyes again scanning the parchment after a full minute he looked up again do not be offended mr and mrs fargo but for the purposes of clarity i will assume you have no knowledge of our history a safe assumption sam replied i should also admit that much of what i am about to tell you is considered by many as more legend than history we understand remi said please go on what you have here is known as the himanshu decree it was issued in the year by a military commander named dolma here at the bottom you can see his official stamp it was common practice then stamps and seals were meticulously crafted and closely guarded tools often highranking personnelboth military and governmentalwere accompanied by soldiers whose sole purpose was to guard official seals given time i can confirm or refute the provenance of this stamp but at first glance i believe it to be genuine professor kaalramis translation suggests the decree was ordering the evacuation of an artifact of some kind sam prompted the theurang yes quite right it is also known as the golden man this is where history becomes muddled with myth im afraid the theurang is said to have been a lifesized statue of a manlike creature or depending on whom you ask the skeleton of the creature itself the story behind the theurang is similar to that of genesis from the christian bible in that the theurang is said to be the remains of the earths dharels voice trailed off as he searched for the correct phrase life giver the mother of mankind if you will thats quite a job title sam said dharels brows furrowed for a moment then he smiled oh yes i see yes a heavy burden to carry that of the theurang at any rate whether real or mythological the golden man became a symbol of reverence for the people of mustangand for much of nepal for that matter but the legendary home of the theurang is said to have been lo monthang this birth giver moniker remi said is it believed to be metaphorical or literal dharel smiled shrugged as with any religious story the interpretation is in the mind of the believer i think it is safe to say that at the time this decree was issued there were more literal believers what can you tell us about these sentinels asked sam they were elite soldiers the equivalent of todays special forces according to some texts they were trained from youth for one purpose to protect the theurang professor kaalrami mentioned a phrase in the decreeas orderedin relation to the evacuation plan the sentinels were supposed to carry out what are your thoughts i have no knowledge of the specific plan dharel replied but as i understand it there were only a few dozen sentinels upon evacuation each of them was to leave the city carrying a chest a chest designed to confuse invaders in one of the chests was to be the disassembled remains of the theurang sam and remi exchanged sideways smiles dharel added only a select few in the military and government knew which sentinel carried the genuine remains sam asked and inside the other chests dharel shook his head i do not know perhaps nothing perhaps a replica of the theurang at any rate the plot was designed to overwhelm any pursuers equipped with the best weapons and the fastest horses the sentinels would race from the city and separate in hopes of dividing the pursuers with luck and skill the sentinel carrying the theurang would escape and hide it in a predetermined location can you describe the weapons only generally a sword several daggers a bow and a spear theres no account of whether the plan succeeded asked remi none what did the chest look like said remi dharel retrieved a pad of paper and pencil from his desk and sketched a wooden cube that looked remarkably similar to the chest they recovered from the cave dharel said as far as i have found there is no description beyond this the chest was said to have been of an ingenious design the hope being that each time an enemy recovered one of them he would spend days or weeks trying to open it and in the process buy more time for the other sentinels said sam exactly so similarly the sentinels had no family no friends an enemy could use against them they were also trained since youth to withstand the worst kinds of torture amazing dedication remi remarked indeed can you describe the theurang asked sam dharel nodded as i mentioned it is said to have manlike features but an overall beastly appearance his bones were made of the purest gold his eyes made of some kind of gemrubies or emeralds or the like the golden man remi said yes here i have an artists rendering dharel stood up walked around to his desk and rummaged through the drawers for half a minute before returning to them with a leatherbound book he flipped through pages before stopping he turned the book around and handed it to sam and remi after a few seconds remi murmured hello handsome though highly stylized the books rendering of the theurang was nearly identical to the etching on the shield they had found in the cave an hour later back at the hotel sam and remi called selma sam recounted their visit to the university amazing selma said this is the find of a lifetime we cant take credit for it remi replied i suspect lewis king beat us to it and rightly so if he had in fact spent decades hunting for this its all hisposthumously of course youre assuming hes dead then a hunch sam replied if anyone else had found that tomb before us it would have been announced an archaeological site would have been set up and the contents removed remi continued king must have explored the cave system set those railroad spikes discovered the tomb then fell while trying to recross the pit if thats what happened lewis kings bones are scattered along some underground tributary of the bagmati river its a shame he was so close but were getting ahead of ourselves sam said for all we know the chest we found was one of the decoys it would still be a significant find but not the grand prize selma said well know ifwhenwe get it open they chatted with selma for a few more minutes then disconnected what now asked remi i dont know about you but ive had enough of the creepy king twins you even have to ask theyve been nipping at our heels since we got here i say its time we turn the tables on themand on king senior himself covert surveillance remi said with a gleam in her eye sam stared at her a moment then smiled thinly sometimes your eagerness scares me i love covert surveillance i know you do dear we may or may not have what king is after lets see if we can convince him we do well shake the tree a little bit and see what falls out kathmandu nepal knowing the king twins were in nepal minding one of their fathers mining concerns selma took but a few hours to ferret out the details working under the banner of one of kings many subsidiaries the exploratory dig camp was located north of kathmandu in the langtang valley after another trip to the surplus store sam and remi packed their gear into the back of their newly rented range rover and set out though it was nearly five oclock and nightfall less than two hours away they wanted to get far away from the king twins who sam and remi felt certain werent about to leave them alone as the crow flies the mining camp was not quite thirty miles north of the city by road it was over three times that distancea short drive in any western country but a daylong odyssey in nepal judging by this map remi said in the passengers seat what they call a highway is actually a dirt road thats a bit wider and slightly better maintained than a cow path once we pass trisuli bazar well be on secondary roads god knows what that means though how far to trisuli with luck well be there before nightfall sam goat sam looked up to see a teenage girl escorting a goat across the road seemingly oblivious to the vehicle bearing down on them the range rover skidded to a stop in a cloud of brown dust the girl looked up and smiled unfazed she waved sam and remi waved back lesson relearned sam said no crosswalks in nepal and goats have the rightofway remi added once clear of the city limits and into the foothills they found the road bracketed by terraced farm fields lush and green against the otherwise barren and brown slopes to their immediate left the trisuli river swollen with spring runoff churned over boulders the water a leaden gray color from scree and silt here and there they could see clusters of shacks nestled against the distant tree line far to the north and west stood the higher himalayan peaks jagged black towers against the sky two hours later just as the sun was dipping behind the mountains they pulled into trisuli bazar tempted as they were to stay in one of the hostels sam and remi had decided to err on the side of slight paranoia and rough it however unlikely it was that the kings would think to look for them here sam and remi decided to assume the worst following remis directions sam followed the range rovers headlights out of the village then turned left down a narrow service road to what the map described as a trekkers waypoint they pulled into a roughly oval clearing lined with yurtlike huts and rolled to a stop he doused the headlights and turned off the ignition see anyone sam said looking around no it looks like we have the run of the place hut or tent seems a shame to waste the ugly patchwork pup tent we paid so much money for remi said thats my girl fifteen minutes later under the glow of their headlamps they had their camp set up a few hundred yards behind the huts in a copse of pine as remi finished rolling out their sleeping bags sam got a fire going sorting through their food supply sam asked dehydrated chicken teriyaki or dehydrated chicken teriyaki whichever one i can eat the fastest remi replied im ready for bed got a terrible headache its the thin air were around nine thousand feet itll be better tomorrow sam had both food packets ready in minutes once they finished eating sam brewed a couple cups of oolong tea they sat before the fire and watched the flames dance somewhere in the trees an owl hooted if the theurang is what king is after i wonder about his motivation remi said theres no telling sam replied why all the subterfuge why the heavyhandedness with his children hes a powerful man with an ego the size of alaska and a domineering control freak that too maybe this is how he operates trust no one and keep an iron thumb on everything you may be right sam replied but whatever is driving him im not inclined to hand over something as historically significant as the theurang remi nodded and unless weve misjudged his character i think lewis king would agreealive or dead hed want it handed over to nepals national museum or a university just as important sam added if for whatever twisted reason king had frank kidnapped i say we do our level best to make sure he pays for it he wont go down without a fight sam and neither will we spoken like the man i love remi replied she held up her mug and sam put his arm around her waist and drew her close they were up before dawn the next day fed and packed and back on the road by seven as they gained altitude and passed through hamlet after hamlet with names like betrawati manigaun ramche and thare the landscape changed from green stairstep fields and monochromatic hills to triplecanopied forest and narrow gorges after a brief lunch at a scenic overlook they continued on and reached their turnoff an unmarked road just north of boka jhunda an hour later sam stopped the rover at the intersection and they eyeballed the dirt road before them barely wider than the rover itself and hemmed in by thick foliage it looked more like a tunnel than a road im having a bit of deja vu sam said werent we on this road a few months ago but in madagascar it bears an eerie resemblance remi agreed doublechecking she traced her index finger along the map occasionally checking her notes as she went this is the place according to selma the mining camp is twelve miles to the east theres a larger road a few miles north of here but its used for camp traffic best to sneak in the back window then do you have a signal remi grabbed the satellite phone from between her feet and checked for voice messages after a moment she nodded held up a finger and listened she hung up professor dharel from the university he made some calls evidently theres a local historian in lo monthang who is considered the national expert on mustang history hes agreed to see us how soon whenever we get there sam considered this and shrugged no problem providing we dont get caught invading kings mining camp we should make lo monthang in three or four weeks he shifted the rover into drive and pressed the accelerator almost immediately the grade steepened and the road began zigzagging and soon despite an average speed of ten miles per hour they felt like they were on a rollercoaster ride occasionally through the passing foliage they caught glimpses of gorges surging rivers and jagged rock outcroppings soon gone absorbed by the forest after nearly ninety minutes of driving sam came around a particularly tight bend remi shouted big trees i see them sam replied already slamming on the brakes looming before the windshield was a wall of green tell me it isnt so sam said selma made a mistake no chance they both climbed out ducking and weaving their way through the foliage surrounding the rover until they reached the front bumper and no valet either sam muttered to the right remi said ive got a path sam walked over as promised a narrow rutted trail disappeared into the trees sam dug out his compass and remi checked their bearing against the map two miles down that trail she said so translated to nepalese distances ten days give or take give or take remi agreed the trail took them through a series of downsloping switchbacks before bottoming out beside a river flowing from north to south the water crashed over a series of mosscovered boulders sending up plumes of spray that left sam and remi dripping wet in a matter of seconds they followed the path south along the river to a relatively calm section where they found a wooden suspension bridge barely wider than their shoulders the canopy from both banks spanned the water vines and branches draped over the bridge and obscured the other side sam shed his pack and with both hands clenched on the rope side rails crept onto the bridges head probing with his foot for cracks or loose planks before transferring his weight when he reached the bridges midpoint he tried a test hop sam seems sturdy enough dont do that again she saw the half smile on his face and her eyes narrowed if i have to jump in after you he laughed then turned and walked back to where she was standing come on itll hold us he donned his pack and led the way back on the bridge after two brief pauses to let the bridges swaying slow they reached the other side for the next hour they followed the trail as it weaved up and down forested slopes and across gorges until finally the trees began to thin ahead they topped a crest and almost immediately heard the rumble of diesel engines and the beepbeepbeep of trucks backing up down sam rasped and dropped to his belly dragging remi with him what she said i didnt see anything directly below us he gestured for her to follow then turned his body left and crawled off the trail into the underbrush after twenty feet he stopped glanced back and curled his finger at remi she crawled up beside him using his fingertips sam parted the foliage directly below them was a footballshaped earthen pit forty feet deep two hundred yards wide and nearly a quarter mile long the sides of the pit were perfectly vertical an escarpment of black soil dropping away from the surrounding forest as though a giant had slammed a cookie cutter into the earth and scooped out the center in the center of the pit itself yellow bulldozers dump trucks and forklifts moved to and fro on wellworn paths while along the edges teams of men worked with shovels and picks around what looked like horizontal shafts that disappeared into the ground at the far end of the pit an earthen ramp led up to a clearing and sam and remi assumed the main service road construction trailers and quonsetstyle huts lined the sides of the clearing sam continued to look around the site ive got guards he muttered stationed in the trees along the rim and in the clearing armed yes assault rifles not your runofthemill aks though i dont recognize the model whatever it is its modern this isnt like any exploratory mine site ive ever seen sam said outside of a banana republic that is remi stared at the steep slope of the pit i count thirteen no fourteen side tunnels none of them are big enough for anything but men and hand tools the bulldozers and trucks seemed to be skirting the edges of the pit occasionally however a forklift would approach one of the tunnels pick up a tarpcovered pallet then scale the ramp and disappear from view i need the binoculars remi said sam dug them out of his pack and handed them over she scanned the pit for half a minute then handed them back to sam do you see the third tunnel from the ramp on the right side hurry before they cover it up he panned the binoculars i see it zoom in on the pallet sam did so after a few seconds he lowered the binoculars and looked at remi what the hell is that its not my area of expertise remi said but im pretty sure its a goliath ammonite its a type of fossil like a giant nautilus this isnt a mining camp sam this is an archaeological dig langtang valley nepal a dig sam repeated why would king be conducting a dig no way to tell for sure remi said but whats going on here breaks about a dozen nepalese laws they take archaeological excavation very seriously especially anything dealing with fossils black market trade sam speculated thats the first thing that popped into my head remi replied in the last decade the illegal excavation and sale of fossils had become big business especially in asia china in particular had been cited as a primary offender by a number of investigative bodies but all of them lacked the teeth to enforce penalties within her borders the previous year a report by the sustainable preservation initiative estimated that of the thousands of tons of fossil artifacts sold on the black market less than one percent of them are interceptedand of these none led to a single conviction its big money remi said private collectors are willing to pay millions for intact fossils especially if its of one of the sexier species velociraptor tyrannosaurus rex triceratops stegosaurus millions of dollars is pocket change to king youre right but theres no denying whats in front of us wouldnt this qualify as leverage sam he smiled it would indeed were going to need more than pictures though how do you feel about a bit of skullduggery im a big fan of skullduggery sam checked his watch weve got a few hours until nightfall remi turned around and retrieved their digital camera from her pack ill make the most of what daylight we have left whether a trick of light or a genuine phenomenon twilight seemed to last hours in the himalayas an hour after sam and remi hunkered down in the foliage to wait the sun began dipping toward the peaks to the west and for the next two hours they watched dusk ever so slowly settle over the forest until finally the bulldozers and trucks headlights popped on theyre finishing up sam said pointing along the perimeter of the pit digging crews were emerging from the tunnels and heading toward the ramp working from dusk till dawn remi remarked and probably for pennies an hour replied sam if that maybe their pay is not getting shot at to their right they heard a branch snap they froze silence and then faintly the crunch of footsteps moving closer sam gestured to remi with a flattened palm and together they pressed themselves against the ground their faces turned right toward the sound ten seconds passed a shadowed figure appeared on the trail dressed in olive drab fatigues and a floppy jungle hat the man carried his assault rifle diagonally across his body he walked to the edge of the pit stopped and gazed down he raised a pair of binoculars to his eyes and scanned the pit after a full minute of this he lowered his binoculars then turned stepped off the trail and disappeared from view sam and remi waited for five minutes then rose up onto their elbows did you see his face she asked i was too busy waiting to see if he was going to step on us he was chinese are you sure yes sam considered this looks like charlie kings got himself some partners one bit of good news though what he wasnt carrying nightvision binoculars now all we have to worry about is bumping into one of them in the dark ever the optimist remi replied they continued to watch and wait not only for the last of the men and equipment to make their way up the ramp and out of sight but also for any signs of further patrols an hour after night had fully fallen they decided it was safe to move having decided against bringing rope of their own they tried the organic approach and spent ten minutes quietly rummaging about the forest floor until they found a vine long enough and strong enough for their needs after securing one end to a nearby tree trunk sam dropped the coil over the side into the pit well have a drop of about eight feet i knew my paratrooper training would come in handy someday remi replied give me a hand before sam could protest remi was wriggling sideways sliding her lower body over the edge he grasped her right hand as she clamped onto the vine with her left see you at the bottom she said with a smile and dropped from sight sam watched her descend to the bottom of the vine where she let go hit the ground and performed a shoulder roll that brought her back to her knees showoff sam muttered then went over the side he was beside her a few moments later having performed his own roll though not as gracefully as his wife youve been practicing he told her pilates she replied and ballet you never did ballet i did as a little girl sam grumbled and she gave him a conciliatory kiss on the cheek where to she asked sam pointed to the nearest tunnel entrance fifty yards to their left hunched over they dashed along the pits earthen side and followed it to the entrance they crouched just inside ill have a peek remi said then slipped inside a few minutes later she reappeared beside him theyre working on a few specimens but nothing earthshattering moving on sam replied they sprinted to the next tunnel and repeated the drill with similar results then moved on to the third tunnel they were ten feet from the entrance when on the far end of the pit a trio of polemounted klieg lights glowed to life casting half the pit in stark white light fast sam said inside they skidded to a halt inside the entrance and dropped to their bellies did they spot us remi whispered if they had wed be taking fire right now sam replied i think one way or another well know shortly they waited breaths held half expecting to hear the pounding of footsteps approaching or the crack of gunshots but neither happened instead from the ramp area they heard a womans voice shout something a barked command did you catch that sam asked is it chinese remi nodded i missed most of it something like bring him i think they crawled forward a few inches until they could see around the corner of the entrance a group of two dozen or so workers were walking down the ramp flanked by four guards at the head of the column was a small female figure in a black jumpsuit once the group reached the bottom of the pit the guards herded the workers into a line facing in the direction of sam and remis hiding spot the woman continued walking sam grabbed his binoculars and zoomed in on her sam lowered the binoculars and looked sideways at remi youre not going to believe this its crouching tiger scary lady herself he said zhilan hsu remi grabbed her camera and stared snapping pictures i dont know if i got her she said hsu stopped suddenly whirled on the assembled workers and began shouting and gesticulating wildly remi closed her eyes trying to catch the words something about thieves she said stealing from the site missing artifacts hsu stopped abruptly paused then pointed an accusatory finger at one of the workers the guards were on him immediately one slamming the butt of his rifle into the small of his back sending him sprawling forward a second guard heaving him back to his feet and half dragging half walking him forward the pair stopped a few feet before hsu the guard released the man who fell to his knees and began chattering hes begging remi said he has a wife and children he stole only one small piece without warning zhilan hsu drew a pistol from her waistband took a step forward and shot the man in the forehead the man toppled sideways and lay still hsu began speaking again though remi was no longer translating it took little imagination to understand the message if you steal you die the guards began shoving and prodding the workers back up the ramp hsu followed and soon the pit was empty again save the mans corpse the klieg lights flickered out sam and remi were silent for a few moments finally he said whatever sympathy id developed for her just went out the window remi nodded we need to help these people sam absolutely unfortunately theres nothing we can do tonight we can kidnap hsu and feed her to with pleasure sam interrupted but i doubt we could do that without raising the alarm we wouldnt make it a mile before wed be caught the best we can do is blow the whistle on kings operation remi considered this then nodded pictures wont be enough she reminded him agreed one of those trailers up there has to be an office if theres any hard documentation thats where well find it after waiting until they were fairly certain the commotion had died down they visited each of the tunnels in turn sam standing watch as remi took pictures theres a chalicotherium specimen in there its in almost pristine condition a what chalicotherium its a threetoed ungulate from the lower pliocene eraa longlimbed horserhino hybrid they died out about seven million years ago theyre very interesting really remi what maybe later she smiled right sorry how valuable id just be guessing but maybe half a million dollars for a good specimen sam scanned the ramp and clearing for signs of movement but could see only one guard patrolling the area something tells me theyre not so worried about people getting in as they are about people getting out after what we just saw id have to agree whats our plan if we stay low weve got a blind spot almost to the top of the ramp we stop there wait for the guard to pass then sprint to that first trailer on the left and dive under from there its just a matter of finding the office just like that huh sam gave her a grin like taking a fossil from a billionaire he paused almost forgot can i borrow your camera she handed it over sam sprinted into the middle of the pit and knelt beside the corpse he searched the mans clothes then rolled him over took a picture of his face then sprinted back to remi he said by morning hsu will have the body buried in this pit its a long shot but perhaps we can at least let his family know what happened to him remi smiled youre a good man sam fargo they waited for the roving guard to again disappear from view then slipped from the tunnel and ran along the pits wall to where it met the ramp they turned again and followed this route to the base thirty seconds later they were lying on their bellies near the top they now had a mostly unobstructed view of the entire clearing on either side of it were eight trailers three in a line to the left five in a wide crescent to the right the curtained windows of the lefthand trailers were lit and sam and remi could hear the murmur of voices coming from inside of the five trailers to the right the closest three showed lights and the last two were dark directly ahead of where sam and remi lay were four warehousestyle quonset huts between these the main road leaving the camp mounted above the door of each hut was a sodiumvapor lamp casting the road in sickly yellow light garages for the equipment remi guessed sam nodded and if i had to put money on which one of these trailers is the office id go with one of the dark ones i agree getting there is going to be the tricky part remi was right they did not dare head straight for the trailers in question all it would take was the sudden appearance of a guard or a glance out a window and theyd be caught well take it slow and use the first three trailers for cover and if the office is locked a bridge well cross if we have to sam checked his watch the guard should be along anytime now as predicted twenty seconds later the guard walked around the corner of the nearest quonset hut and headed for the trio of trailers on the left after scanning each trailer with a flashlight he walked across the clearing repeated the routine with the other five then disappeared from view sam gave him twenty more seconds then nodded at remi in unison they stood up jogged up the remainder of the ramp then veered right for the first trailer they stopped at its back wall and dropped down using one of the trailers support pylons as cover see anything sam asked all clear they stood up and crept along the back wall to the next trailer where they stopped again looked and listened before moving on when they were stopped behind the third trailer sam tapped his watch and mouthed the word guard through the wall above their heads they could hear voices speaking in chinese and the faint strains of radio music sam and remi spread themselves flat on the ground and went still their wait was a short one almost precisely on time the guard walked into the clearing to their left and began his flashlight scan as he drew even with their trailer they watched collective breath held as the flashlight beam skimmed over the ground beneath the trailer the beam stopped suddenly it tracked backward to the support pylon shielding sam and remi then stopped again they were lying side by side their arms pressed against each other when sam gave remis hand a reassuring squeeze wait dont move a muscle after what seemed like minutes but was probably less than ten seconds the beam moved on the crunch of the guards boots on the gravel faded away cautiously sam and remi got back to their feet and circled the trailer looking left and right for signs of movement they crept around the front of the trailer and picked their way to the steps of what they hoped was the office sam tried the knob it was unlocked they shared a relieved smile sam eased open the door and peeked inside he pulled back shook his head and mouthed supplies they moved to the next trailer again thankfully the door was unlocked sam checked inside then stuck his arm back through the door and gestured for remi to enter she did and carefully swung the door shut behind her the back wall of the trailer was dominated by filing cabinets and storage shelves a pair of battered graypainted steel desks with matching chairs flanked the door time remi whispered sam checked his watch and nodded a few moments later the guards flashlight beam flickered through the trailers windows then disappeared again were looking for anything with detail sam said company names account numbers manifests invoices anything investigators could sink their teeth into remi nodded we should leave everything as is she said if anything goes missing we know wholl get the blame and a bullet good point he checked his watch weve got three minutes they began with the filing cabinets checking each drawer each folder and file remis camera could hold thousands of digital pictures so she photographed anything that looked remotely important using the ambient light from outside the trailer as the threeminute mark approached they stopped and went still the guard passed by performed his scan and was gone again they resumed their search four more times they repeated the cycle until satisfied theyd collected all they could time to go sam said well retrace our steps to the rover and outside an alarm began whooping sam and remi froze for a moment then he said behind the door they pressed themselves flat against the wall outside doors banged open footsteps pounded on gravel voices shouted sam asked remi can you make out anything she closed her eyes listening intently her eyes sprung open again sam i think they found the range rover langtang valley nepal before sam could reply the trailer door swung open using his fingertips sam stopped the door a few inches from their faces one of the guards stepped across the threshold his flashlight skimming through the space the guard stopped sam saw his shoulders begin to pivot signaling a turn in their direction sam hipbumped the door closed took a single stride forward then lashed out with a toe kick that stuck the guard behind the knee as he fell sam grabbed his collar and heaved forward smashing the mans forehead on the edge of the desk he groaned and went limp sam pulled him backward and dragged him behind the door he knelt down checked the mans pulse hes alive but wont be waking up anytime soon he rolled the man over tugged the slung rifle off his shoulder and stood up wideeyed remi stared at her husband for several seconds that was very james bondish dumb luck and a steel desk he replied with a shrug and a smile an unbeatable combination i think you deserve a reward remi replied with a smile of her own later if there is a later id like there to be a later you have a plan auto theft sam replied he turned around moved to the nearest of the trailers rear windows and pulled back the curtain a tight squeeze but i think we can make it you check the front remi said ill get the back window sam walked to the front window fingered back the curtain and peeked outside the guards are assembling in the clearing about ten of them i dont see the dragon lady she probably just stopped by to do kings dirty work it looks like theyre trying to decide what to do well know in a second if they realize theyre missing a man windows open remi said its about an eightfoot drop to the ground there are some thick trees about ten feet away sam let the curtain slip back into place we might as well go now before they have a chance to get organized he unslung the rifle and examined it this is stateoftheart can you handle it safety trigger magazine hole where the bullet comes out i think ill manage abruptly the alarm went silent sam walked to the front door and locked it it might delay them he explained he grabbed the nearest chair and carried it to the rear window remi climbed up and began squeezing out the window once she was down and clear sam followed they ducked into the tree line and began picking their way toward the quonset hut when the rear wall came into view through the trees they stopped and took a few moments to scan their surroundings in the distance they could hear the guards still shouting over one another sam and remi moved forward sam in the lead his rifle lowered and tracking back and forth they reached the quonset hut remi whispered door and pointed sam nodded remi now in the lead they slid along the wall until her shoulder bumped the jamb she tried the knob it was open she opened the door silently and peeked her head through she pulled back theres two trucks inside parked side by side they look militarygreen double tires canvas sides a tailgate feel up to driving asked sam sure you get behind the wheel of the one on the left ill disable the other one then join you be ready to start the engine and tear out got it remi opened the door just wide enough for them to slip through they were halfway to the trucks when they heard footsteps pounding on the road outside sam and remi skidded to halt against the righthand trucks tailgate sam peeked around the corner four men he said theyre climbing into the trucks two in each cab part of their emergency plan remi suggested probably sam replied okay plan b we stow away almost in unison the trucks engines rumbled to life stepping carefully lest their shifting weight alert the guards sam and remi mounted the trucks bumper then highstepped over the tailgate with a loud thunk the transmission engaged and the truck surged ahead arm in arm sam and remi stumbled and fell facefirst into the bed their truck was in the lead lying flat in the relative darkness of the bed with the second trucks headlamps glowing green through the tailgates canvas flap sam and remi allowed themselves to take a full breath for the first time in ten minutes on either side of them wooden crates of various sizes were strapped to eyebolts in the trucks bed we made it remi whispered cross fingers whats that mean im pretty sure this is a chinese army truck youre not suggesting what i think youre suggesting are you i am it seems clear king is in bed with someone in the chinese military the guards are chinese and so are their weapons probably and we know whats in these crates how far to the border twenty miles maybe twentyfive four hours give or take plenty of time to make our exit the question is how far from civilization will we be youre starting to spoil my otherwise sunny disposition she said then laid back in the crook of sams shoulder despite the hardness of the trucks bed and the constant jostling sam and remi found the muffled growl of the engine soothing they half dozed in the twilight sam occasionally waking to check his watch after an hour of traveling they were jolted awake by the squeal of the trucks brakes the following trucks headlights enlarged and brightened through the rear flap sam sat up and pointed the rifle toward the tailgate remi sat up beside him her eyes questioning but she said nothing the truck slowed then ground to a halt the following trucks headlights went dark cab doors opened slammed shut from either side of the bed came the crunch of footsteps they stopped at the tailgate and voices began murmuring in chinese sam and remi could smell cigarette smoke sam turned his head and whispered in remis ear stay perfectly still she nodded moving slowly carefully sam curled his legs beneath him then rose into a crouch onto the balls of his feet he took two crab steps toward the tailgate and turned his head to listen after a moment he turned back to remi and held up four fingers four guards were standing on the other side of the tailgate he pointed to his rifle then in the direction of the soldiers she handed him the rifle sam laid it across his legs then pressed his wrists together she nodded he gestured for her to lie flat she did so sam made sure the rifles safety was off adjusted himself and took a deep breath then reached up with his left hand grasped the canvas and jerked it aside hands up he shouted the two soldiers closest to the bumper spun around while simultaneously backpedaling they stumbled into their comrades who were struggling to unsling their rifles dont sam said and raised his rifle to his shoulder despite the language gap the soldiers got the message and stopped moving sam gestured with the barrel of his rifle several times until the men got the message slowly each man unslung his rifle and let it drop to the ground sam backed them up a few feet then climbed over the tailgate and hopped down all clear he said to remi she dropped to the ground beside him they look terrified she said perfect the more terrified they are the better for us sam said would you do the honors remi collected their rifles and dumped all but one into the truck bed sam said safety off i think lever switch above the trigger on the right side got it okay sam and remi and the four chinese soldiers stared at one another for ten seconds no one spoke finally sam asked english the soldier on the far right said small english right okay you are my prisoners remi sighed heavily sam sorry ive always wanted to say that now that youve got that out of your system what do we do with them we tie them up and oh no thats not good what remi glanced at her husband sams narrowed eyes were staring over the heads of the soldiers toward the cab of the second truck she followed his gaze and saw a silhouetted figure sitting in the cab the figure ducked down suddenly we miscounted sam muttered i see that get in the drivers seat remi start the engine check for you can be sure of it she replied then turned on her heel and sprinted toward the front of the truck a moment later the engine started the four soldiers shuffled nervously and glanced at one another all aboard remi shouted out the cab window coming dear sam replied without turning sam shouted at the soldiers move move and gestured with the rifle the men sidestepped away leaving sam a clear shot at the trucks radiator he raised his rifle and took aim the fifth man until now hidden in the second trucks cab suddenly stuck his torso out the drivers window sam saw the silhouette of his rifle coming around toward him stop the man kept twisting his body the rifle coming around sam adjusted his aim and fired two shots through the windshield the soldiers scattered diving into the underbrush bordering the road sam heard a crack something thudded into the tailgate beside him he ducked down lurched sideways around the opposite bumper turned again and snapped off a trio of shots into what he hoped was the trucks radiator or engine block he turned raced to the trucks passengers door jerked it open and climbed in weve worn out our welcome he said remi put the truck in gear and mashed the accelerator they hadnt gotten a hundred yards before realizing sams gunshots had either missed their mark or had been insufficient in the side mirrors he and remi saw the trucks headlights pop on the four soldiers scrambled from cover and hopped aboard two in the cab the other two in the bed the truck surged forward remi called narrow bridge ahead sam looked though still a couple hundred yards away the bridge in question looked not just narrow but barely wider than their trucks girth speed remi he warned im going as fast as i can i meant slow down joking hold on the truck hit a rut in the road and slewed sideways lurched upward then slammed back down the bridge loomed in the windshield fifty yards to go oh of course remi said annoyed it had to be one of these though wider and more heavily buttressed the bridge was simply a larger version of the one theyd crossed on foot earlier that day the truck lurched again sam and remi were bounced from their seats heads hitting the cabs roof remi grunted wrestling with the steering wheel the bridgehead was almost upon them at the last second remi slammed on the brakes the brakes squealed and the truck skidded to a stop a cloud of dust enveloped them sam heard the clankclank of gears and looked over to see his wife shifting the transmission into reverse remi whats on your mind he asked a little reverse chicken she said with a grim smile risky as opposed to everything else weve done tonight touche sam conceded remi slammed down on the accelerator with a groaning whir from the engine the truck started backing up slowly at first but rapidly gaining speed sam glanced in the side mirror through the dust cloud created by remis hasty stop all he could see of the second truck was headlights he leaned out the window and fired a threeround burst then a second the truck slewed sideways out of sams view eyes fixed on her own mirror remi said theyre stopping they see us theyre backing up over the roar of the engine they heard the poppoppop of gunfire they ducked down with her head below the dashboard remi leaned sideways for a better view of her mirror the pursuing truck was in full reverse mode now but the combination of remis collisioncourse ploy and sams gunfire had clearly rattled the driver the truck careened from one side to the other the tires bumping over the berm alongside the road brace for impact remi shouted sam leaned back in his seat and jammed his feet against the dashboard a moment later the truck jolted to a stop remi glanced at her mirror theyre off the road lets not stick around sam prompted right remi shifted back into drive and pressed the gas pedal once again the head of the bridge appeared it didnt take remi announced theyre back on the road persistent arent they hold the truck steady for a bit he said then opened his door sam what are ill be in back if you need me he slung the rifle around his neck and then using the cabs doorframe for support climbed down onto the running board with his free hand he grabbed the canvas side cover and jerked ripping free the snap enclosures he grabbed the vertical brace hooked his left leg over the side then pulled himself into the bed he crawled to the cabs rear wall and slid back the slot window hi he said hi yourself hold tight im closing your door remi jerked the truck to the right then to the left sams open door banged shut she asked whats your plan sabotage how close are they fifty yards we hit the bridge in ten seconds got it sam crawled to the tailgate in the dim light he groped along the truck bed until his hand found one of the other rifles he picked it up and dropped his own then hurriedly collected the other magazines bridge remi shouted slowing down sam waited until he heard the overlapping thud of the trucks tires bumping over the planking then stuck his upper torso through the rear flap aimed the rifle at the bridge deck and opened fire the bullets thudded into the wood punching through the gaps and sending up plumes of wood chips he ducked back through the flap changed magazines then opened fire again this time alternating between the bridge deck and the oncoming truck which had just crossed onto the bridge their truck swerved left bumped into the side rail then straightened out sam saw an orange muzzle flash from the window a trio of bullets slammed into the tailgate below him he threw himself backward onto the bed another salvo of gunfire shredded the rear flap and peppered the cab wall sam remi called it didnt work so i gathered how do you feel about the wanton destruction of fossil artifacts generally against it but this a special occasion buy me some time remi began braking then speeding up in hopes of spoiling the shooters accuracy sam flipped over onto his belly groped until he found the first ratchet strap securing the crates and hit the release button in short order he had the remainder of the straps free he crawled to the tailgate and flipped the release it crashed down bombs away sam called and shoved the first crate out it bounced off the bridge deck slammed squarely into the trucks bumper and burst open wood shards and packing hay went flying no effect remi called sam waddled backward put his shoulder to the entire stack of crates then braced his feet against the cab wall and began pushing with a groan the stack began sliding along the bed sam paused coiled his legs and shoved hard like a linebacker going after a blocking sled the line of crates slid off the tailgate and began tumbling toward the pursuing truck sam didnt wait to see the results but instead sidestepped to the other stack of crates and repeated the process from behind came the squeal of brakes shattering glass the crunch of metal impacting wood that did the trick remi called theyre stopped dead in their tracks sam rose to his knees and looked through the slot at remi but for how long she glanced at him offered a quick smile however long it takes them to dislodge a half dozen crates from under their chassis hyatt regency hotel kathmandu nepal sam stepped out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist and rubbing his hair with another you hungry for a nice breakfast famished replied remi she was sitting at a table in front of a mirror tying her hair into a ponytail she wore the standard white towel of the hotel room service or go down to the dining room the weather is perfect lets dine out on the balcony sounds good sam walked over to an end table picked up the phone and dialed room service id like one salmon and a bagel one eggs benedict a bowl of fruit and sourdough toast and coffee he waited until the voice in the kitchen repeated the order correctly then he rang off and called the bar when the bartender answered sam asked id like two ramos fizzes yes a ramos fizz you know how to treat a lady said remi dont get your hopes up he doesnt know how to make one sam tried again how about a harvey wallbanger wallbanger its made with vodka galliano and orange juice i see no galliano sam shook his head and tried once more all right send up a bottle of veuve clicquot remi laughed you really know how to treat a lady thats the best you can do said sam into the phone okay send it up well chilled he set the receiver back in its cradle no champagne the only thing left after a political convention is a sparkling white from china i didnt know the chinese made anything sparkling she looked at him with a sarcastic smile is that the best you can do sam shrugged any port in the storm the phone rang sam picked it up one moment he switched on the speaker morning rube sam said into the speakerphone for you maybe rube replied its dinner time here i hear you and your lovely bride are enjoying yet another relaxing vacation everything is relative rube remi replied howre kathy and the girls great theyre at chuck e cheeses right now your call saved me from going dont let us keep you sam said with a half smile we can talk later oh no my friend theres nothing more important than this trust me okay brief me are you in jail how many local laws have you broken no and none that were aware of remi replied ill let sam explain though aware rube had already received some information from selma sam started at the beginning with zhilan hsu boarding their boat near pulau legundi and ending with their escape from kings covert archaeological site the night before after leaving their pursuers stalled on the bridge sam had driven through the darkness looking for signs or landmarks that remi could match to her map after several hours of fruitless turns and dead ends they finally crossed a recognizable mountain passthe laurebinaand not long after pulled into the outskirts of pheda some twenty miles due east of the camp predictably theyd found the village dark and lifeless save a cinderblock and tinroofed building that turned out to be the local pub after breaking through the considerable language barrier they managed to make a trade with the owner their truck for his cara thirtyyearold orangeandprimer gray peugeotand directions back to kathmandu just before dawn they pulled into the hyatt regencys parking lot rube listened to sams story without speaking finally he asked let me make sure i understand this you snuck into kings camp witnessed a murder wreaked havoc with what were probably a guard contingent of chinese soldiers then stole one of their trucks that happened to be loaded with black market fossils which you then used as depth charges to stop your pursuers does that about cover it more or less sam said remi added and the thirty or so gigabytes of intelligence we collected rube sighed you know what i did last night i painted our master bathroom you two okay send me your data selmas already got it contact her and shell give you a link to a secure online storage site got it i know my bosses at langley will be interested in the chinese angle and im sure we can find someone at the fbi interested in kings black market fossil operation i cant promise any of it will pan out but ill run with it thats all we ask sam said theres a betterthanaverage chance that kings already ordered the site shut down by now it could be just an abandoned pit in the middle of the forest we know what about your friend alton were half hoping half guessing weve found what king wants remi replied or at least enough to get his attention were calling him after we hang up with you king charlie is scum rube warned people have been trying to take him down all his life theyre all dead or ruined and hes still standing remi replied something tells us what weve got is very personal for him the theurock theurang remi corrected the golden man right its a gamble rube replied if youre wrong and king doesnt give a damn about the thing all youve got are allegations of black market fossil tradeand like i said theres no guarantee anything will stick to him we know sam replied and youre going to roll the dice anyway yes said remi big surprise by the way before i forget ive learned a little more about lewis king i assume youve both heard of heinrich himmler hitlers best friend and nazi psychopath sam asked weve heard the name himmler and most of the upper echelon of the nazi party were obsessed with the occult especially as it pertained to aryan purity and the thousand year reich himmler was arguably the most intrigued by it back in the thirties and throughout world war two he sponsored a number of scientific expeditions to the worlds darkest corners in hopes of finding evidence to support the nazis claims one of them organized in a year before the war started was dispatched to the himalayas in search of evidence of aryan ancestry care to guess the name of one of the lead scientists lewis king remi replied or as he was known then professor lewes konig sam said charlie kings father was a nazi yes and no my sources tell me he probably joined the party out of necessity not zealousness back then if you wanted government funding you needed to be a party member there are plenty of accounts of scientists joining and doing perfunctory research into nazi theories so they could conduct pure scientific research on the side lewis king was a perfect example of this by all accounts he was a dedicated archaeologist he didnt give a damn about aryan bloodlines or ancestry so why did he go on the expedition i dont know but what you found in the cavethis golden man businessis a strong possibility unless king was lying it sounds like soon after lewis king immigrated to the us he started his globetrotting maybe he found something on himmlers expedition that piqued his interest sam speculated something he didnt want to end up in the hands of the nazis remi added he kept it to himself bided his time through the war then picked up his work again years later the question is rube said why is charlie king picking up where his father left off from what we know about him he never showed the slightest interest in his fathers work maybe its the theurang sam said maybe to him its just another fossil to sell you could be right if the description of this thing is even remotely accurate it would be worth a fortune remi asked rube do we know whether the nazi accusations against lewis ever impacted charlie not that i could find i think his success speaks for itself and given how ruthless he is i doubt anyone has the guts to bring it up anymore thats about to change sam said time to push king charlies comfort zone they hung up talked strategy for a few minutes then sam dialed kings direct line the man himself picked up on the first ring king mr king sam fargo here i was wonderin when youd get around to callin your pretty wife with you safe and sound remi replied sweetly it seems our partnership has hit a rocky patch king said my kids tell me you aint playin ball were playing ball sam replied just a different game than you are charlie did you have frank alton kidnapped kidnapped why would i do somethin like that thats not an answer remi pointed out i sent frank alton out there to do a job for me he got himself in over his head pissed off the wrong people i have no idea where he is another nonanswer answer sam said okay lets move on all you have to do is listen weve got what youre after and whats that youre not listening weve got what youre afterwhat your dad spent his lifetime hunting for and as you probably guessed we paid a visit to your concentration camp in the langtang valley i got no idea what youre talkin about we collected thousands of photosmostly of documents we found laying around in an office trailerbut a few of them of your wife or concubine or whatever you call her in the privacy of your gulfstream as luck would have it when we took the pictures she was murdering one of your employees weve got a picture of his face as well charlie king did not respond for a long ten seconds finally he sighed i think youre fulla horse crap sam but clearly somethins got you excited youve got my attention first things first release frank i told you i dont shut up release frank alton when we get a call from him saying hes safe and unharmed in the comfort of his home well meet with russell and marjorie and reach an understanding now whos sayin a lot without sayin much king replied its the only deal youre going to get sam replied sorry friend im goin to decline i think youre bluffin suit yourself sam said and hung up he laid the phone on the coffee table he and remi looked at each other she asked odds sixtyforty it rings in under a minute she smiled no bet at the fiftysecond mark sams phone trilled he let it go off three more times then picked up charlie king said youd make a decent poker player sam fargo glad we could reach an understanding ill make some calls and see what i can find out about frank alton cant promise nothin of course but if we dont hear from him in twentyfour hours the deal is off charlie king was silent for a few beats then keep your phone nearby sam disconnected remi asked what if king thinks weve got the evidence with us he knows better than that do you think hell follow through sam nodded kings smart enough to have insulated himself whoever took frank probably made sure their faces were hidden therell be no trail leading back to king so hes got nothing to lose and everything to gain by going along then why do you look so worried remi asked her husband do i youve got the squintyeyed thing going on sam hesitated tell me sam we just got done beating up on one of the worlds richest men a sociopathic control freak who got where he is by crushing his enemies hell release frank but something tells me king is sitting in his office planning a counterattack houston texas eight thousand miles away charles king was doing just that after hanging up the phone he paced his office staring straight ahead but seeing nothing beyond his rage muttering to himself king stalked to his office window and stared out over the city to the west the sun was setting fine fargos he rasped round goes to you enjoy it aint gonna happen again he walked to his desk and stabbed the intercom button marsha get me russell and marjorie yes mr king one moment thirty seconds passed then dad shut up and listen is marjorie there im here daddy zhilan yes mr king what in blazes do you three idiots think youre doin out there the fargos just called me and whipped me from pillar to post they say they got pictures of you zee killin some local at the langtang site what went on there russell answered i got a call this morning from the head of site security he said they found a suspicious vehicle and raised the alarm they found one man unconscious but nothing appeared to be missing howd he get knocked out theyre not sure he may

whats this about a killin is it true yes one of the workers was caught stealing i had to set an example his body has already been disposed of king paused then grunted okay then good work as for you two morons the fargos told me theyve got the golden man how marjorie asked where theyve got to be lying russell added maybe so but this kind of stuff is their bailiwick its why we brought em into this guess we underestimated them figured alton would be enough to keep em in line marjorie said dont be too hard on yourself daddy shut up we gotta assume theyre tellin the truth they want alton set loose

put alton on the jet and leave the rest to me the fargos wanna play hardball theyre about to see what real hardball feels like jomsom village dhawalagiri zone nepal the singleengine piper cub banked sharply and descended through three thousand feet sitting on opposite sides of the aisle sam and remi watched the chalky gray cliffs rise up seemingly swallowing the plane as it lined up for the final approach to the airstrip above and beyond the cliffs rose the dark snowveined peaks of the dhawalagiri and nilgiri ranges their upper reaches half hidden in clouds though theyd left kathmandu only an hour earlier their arrival here was just the beginning of the journey the remainder would take another twelve hours by road as with everything in nepal distances measured on a map were all but useless their ultimate destination the former capital of the kingdom of mustang lo monthang lay only a hundred forty miles northwest of kathmandu but was inaccessible by air instead their chartered plane would drop them here in jomsom a hundred twenty miles due east of kathmandu they would then follow the kali river valley north for fifty miles to lo monthang where they would be met by sushant dharels local contact for sam and remi it felt good to be far from the relative bustle of kathmandu and hopefully beyond the reach of the king clan the plane continued to descend rapidly bleeding off airspeed until it was sam estimated flying only a few knots above stall speed remi looked at her husband questioningly he smiled and said short runway its either bleed airspeed up here or slam on the brakes when were down oh joy with a squelch and a shudder the landing gear kissed the tarmac and soon they were coasting toward a cluster of buildings at the southern end of the runway the plane braked to a stop and the engines began winding down sam and remi collected their backpacks and headed for the door which was already open a ground crewman in dark blue coveralls smiled and gestured to the stepladder below the door remi climbed down followed by sam they started walking toward the terminal building to their right a cluster of goats nibbled at brown grass beside the hangar beyond them on a dirt road they could see a line of musk ox being herded by an old man in a red beanie and green trousers occasionally he tapped a wayward ox with a switch while making a clucking sound with his mouth remi gathered the collar of her parka closer to her neck and said i think this qualifies as brisk i was going to go with bracing sam replied were at about ten thousand feet but theres a lot less cover and a lot more wind as if to punctuate remis point a gust whipped across the tarmac clouds of ochre dust obscured their vision for a few seconds before clearing revealing in greater detail the scenery behind the airport buildings several hundred feet tall the taupecolored cliffs were deeply grooved from top to bottom as though carved by giant fingertips smoothed by time and erosion the patterns looked almost manmadelike the walls of some ancient fortress behind them a voice said most of mustang looks like that at least the lower elevations sam and remi stopped and turned to see a midtwenties man with shaggy blond hair smiling at them he asked first time yes sam replied but not yours im betting fifth im a trekking junkie i guess you could say jomsoms sort of the base camp for trekking in this region im wally sam introduced himself and remi and the trio continued walking toward the terminal buildings wally pointed to several groups of people standing along the tarmacs edge most were dressed in brightly colored parkas and standing beside heavyduty backpacks fellow trekkers asked remi yep a lot of familiar faces too were part of the local economy i guess you could say trekking season keeps this place alive cant go anywhere here without being attached to a guide outfit and if youd prefer not to asked sam theres a company of nepalese army troops stationed here wally replied its a bit of a racket really but you cant blame them most of these people make less in a year than we make in a week its not so bad if you prove you know what youre doing most of the guides just tag along and stay out of the way from a nearby group of trekkers a woman called hey wally were over here he turned gave her a wave then asked sam and remi where are you headed lo monthang cool place its downright medieval man a real time machine you already got a guide sam nodded our contact in kathmandu arranged one remi asked how long should it take to get there according to the map its maps wally replied with a chuckle theyre not bad fairly accurate on the horizontal but the terrain here is like a piece of waddedup newspaper thats only been half flattened out everything changes one day you could pass a spot thats nice and flat the next day its half choked by a landslide your guide will probably follow the kali gandaki river ravine most of the wayit should be mostly dry right nowso you should figure sixty miles total at least twelve hours drive time which means overnight sam replied yep ask your guide hell either have a nice tent set up or a trekkers hut reserved for you youre in for a treat the trail that follows the kali gandaki ravine is the deepest in the world on one side you got the annapurna mountains the other the dhawalagiri in between eight of the twenty highest mountains in the world the ravine trail is like a cross between utah and mars man the stupas and caves alone are the woman called again wally he said to sam and remi hey i gotta go nice meeting you travel safe and stay out of chokes after dusk they shook hands all around and wally starting jogging toward his group sam called chokes your guide will tell you wally called over his shoulder sam turned to remi stupas most commonly known as a chortens here theyre essentially reliquariesmoundlike structures containing sacred buddhist artifacts how big they can range from the size of a garden gnome to a cathedral one of the largest is back in kathmandu in fact the boudhanath the dome draped in all the prayer flags thats the one mustangs got a huge concentration of them mostly of the gnomesized variety some estimates put the number in the low thousands and thats just along the kali gandaki river up until a few years ago mustang was all but offlimits to tourism for fear of desecration fargos a male voice called fargos a bald nepalese man in his midforties picked his way through a crowd of milling trekkers and trotted toward them panting fargos yes yes sam replied i am basanta thule the man replied in decent english i am your guide yes youre a friend of pradhans remi said the mans eyes narrowed i do not know who that is i was asked by mr sushant dharel to meet you you were expecting someone else here i have identification thule began reaching into the side pocket of his jacket no thats fine sam replied with a smile good to meet you and you and you here i will take those thule grabbed their backpacks and gestured with his head toward the terminal building my vehicle is this way follow if you will he trotted off sam said to remi very tricky mizz bond am i growing paranoid in my advancing age no sam replied with a smile just more beautiful come on lets catch up or were going to lose our guide after a cursory stop at the customs desk to satisfy what sam and remi guessed was mustangs firm if tacit belief in its semiautonomous status sam and remi stepped outside and found thule at the curb beside a white toyota land cruiser judging by the dozens of nearly identical vehicles lining the street each of which seemed to bear a unique trekking company logo toyota was the fourwheeler of choice for the region thule smiled at them shoved the remainder of sams backpack in the toyotas cargo area and slammed shut the hatch i have arranged accommodations for the night thule announced were not leaving for lo monthang immediately remi asked no no very bad luck to start a journey at this time of day better to start tomorrow morning you will eat and rest and enjoy jomsom and then we will depart first thing in the morning come come wed prefer to leave now sam said not moving thule paused he pursed his lips thinking for a moment then said it is your choice of course but the landslide will not be cleared until morning what landslide replied remi yes between here and kagbeni we would not get more than a few kilometers up the valley and then there will be the traffic jam of course many trekkers in mustang now better to wait until morning yes thule opened one of the toyotas rear passenger doors and flourished his arm toward the backseat sam and remi looked at each other shrugged then stepped into the suv after ten minutes of the toyota winding through the narrow streets thule brought it to a stop before a building a few miles southeast of the airstrip the brownonyellow sign read moonlight guest house tub bathsattached bathroomscommon bathrooms with a smile and a raised eyebrow remi said it appears bathrooms are the big draw in jomsom and monochromatic architecture sam added from the front seat thule said indeed jomsom offers the best accommodations in the area he got out hurried around to remis door and opened it he offered his hand to her she graciously took it and climbed out followed by sam thule said i will collect your luggage you go inside madame roja will assist you five minutes later they were in the moonlight guest houses royal executive suite complete with a queen bed and a sitting area filled with an assortment of wickeresque lawn furniture as madame roja had promised their bathroom was in fact attached to their suite i will return for you at eleven oclock tomorrow morning yes thule said from the doorway why so late sam asked the landslide will have the traffic jam sam finished thanks mr thule well see you then sam shut the door from the bathroom he heard remi say sam look at this he found a wideeyed remi standing beside a gigantic copper clawfoot tub its a beasley i think the more common term is bathtub remi very funny beasleys are rare sam the last one was made in the late nineteenth century do you have any idea what this is worth no but something tells me you do twelve thousand dollars give or take this is a treasure sam and its the size of a studebaker dont even think of trying to fit it into your carryon remi tore her eyes from the tub and looked at him mischievously it is big isnt it sam returned her smile indeed care to be my lifeguard at your service madam an hour later clean and happy and pruneskinned they settled into the sitting area through the balcony windows they could see the peaks on annapurna in the distance sam checked his phone voice message he said he listened to it gave remi a wink and redialed selmas voice came over the speaker thirty seconds later where are you in the land of wicker and copper sam replied pardon nothing do you have good news for us here hang on a moment later a male voice came on the line it was frank alton sam remi i dont know how you did it but i owe you my life nonsense remi replied you saved ours in bolivia a few times over are you okay sam asked a few bumps and bruises but nothing permanent have you seen judy and the kids yes as soon as i got home sam said selma how are things absolutely awful she replied glad to hear it based on a healthy respect of charles kings reach and perhaps a tinge of paranoia sam and remi had instituted the duress rule had selma or any of them been at gunpoint or otherwise in jeopardy an answer other than awful would have raised the alarm remi said frank what can you tell us not much more than you already know im afraid selmas brought me up to speed while i agree kings a snake and hes not telling the whole truth i have no proof he was behind my kidnapping i was knocked out and snatched off the street i never saw them coming cant tell you where i was held when i woke up i was blindfolded until they shoved me out of the van again when i took the blindfold off i was standing before the stairs to a gulfstream jet speaking of eerie did you meet the king twins oh those two they were waiting for me at the airport i thought id walked into a tim burton remake of the addams family im guessing theyre the product of king and his dragon lady yes sam replied whats your take on lewis king a hundredtoone that hes been dead for decades i think i was just bait for you two our thought as well remi agreed were still working out the details but we think it was something to do with an old himalayan legend the golden man replied frank right the theurang from what little i was able to gather before i was taken thats what lewis king was after when he disappeared he was obsessed by it whether the thing is real or not i dont know we think it is sam replied were going to see a man in lo monthang tomorrow with any luck hell be able to shed more light on the mystery kali gandaki gorge dhawalagiri zone nepal for the fourth time in an hour basanta thule brought the toyota land cruiser to a stop the knobby tires crunching on the gravel that blanketed the valley floor above the sky was a cloudless royal blue the crisp air was perfectly still more stupas thule announced pointing out the side window there and there you see we do sam replied he and remi glancing out sams rolleddown window shortly after leaving jomsom that morning theyd made the mistake of expressing an interest in chortens since then thule had made it his mission to point out each and every one theyd covered less than two miles so far for politenesss sake sam and remi climbed out walked around and took a few pictures while none of the chortens were taller than a few feet they were nonetheless impressiveminiature temples painted snowwhite sitting atop the ridge lines overlooking the gorge like silent sentries they climbed back into the toyota and set out again driving in silence for some time before remi said wheres the landslide there was a long pause we passed it some time ago thule replied where twenty minutes ago the slope of loose gravel beside the boulder we saw it does not take much to block the way you see after another pause for lunchand a chortenviewing stop that sam and remi tactfully declared their lastthey continued north following the serpentine course of the kali gandaki and passing a series of hamlets that were largely indistinguishable from jomsom occasionally they would spot trekkers in the foothills above antlike against the mountains in the distance shortly after five oclock they entered a narrower section of the gorge the cliffs towering fifty feet above them closed in and the sun dimmed the air wafting through sams open window grew chilled finally after slowing to a walking pace thule steered them through an archway of rock barely wider than the toyota and then into a winding tunnel the tires sloshed through the stream and echoed off the walls fifty yards later they rolled into an elongated clearing measuring forty feet wide and a quarter mile long at the northern end of the ravine was a second slot opening in the rock to their right the river gurgled through an undercut section of the cliff thule steered left made a wide circle so the toyotas nose was pointed back the way theyd come and then braked to a stop we will camp here he announced we will be protected from the wind why so early thule turned in his seat and gave them a broad smile here night falls quickly along with the temperature best to have the shelters erected and the fire started before dark with the three of them working together they quickly had the sheltersa pair of older vango siegestyle tentsset up and ready for occupancy complete with eggshell mattress pads and subzero sleeping bags as thule got a small fire started sam ignited a trio of kerosene lanterns that hung from poles at the edge of their camp flashlight in hand remi was taking a tour of the ravine thule had mentioned that trekkers had in the past found kang admi tracks in this area of the gorge translated loosely as snowman the term was one of dozens used to describe the yeti the himalayan version of bigfoot while not necessarily a blind believer in the legend the fargos had encountered enough oddities in their travels that they knew better than to discount it out of hand remi had decided to indulge her curiosity after twenty minutes she wandered back into the yellow glow of lanterns around the camp sam handed her a wool cap and asked any luck not so much as a toe track remi replied tucking a few strands of loose auburn hair beneath the cap do not give up hope thule remarked from beside the fire we may hear the beasts call during the night and what are we listening for sam asked that depends upon the person yes as a child i heard the cry once it sounded like part man part bear in fact one of the tibetan words for yeti is mehtehmanbear mr thule this sounds like a tall tale designed to enthrall tourists remi said not at all miss i heard it i know people who have seen it i know people who have found its tracks i personally have seen a musk ox whose head had been we get the picture remi interrupted so whats for dinner dinner consisted of prepackaged dehydrated meals that when combined with boiling water morphed into a goulash melange sam and remi had tasted worse but by only a narrow margin after they finished eating thule redeemed himself with steaming mugs of tongba a slightly alcoholic nepalese millet tea which they sipped as night enveloped the gorge they chatted and sat in silence for another thirty minutes before dimming the camp lanterns and retreating to their respective tents once nestled into their sleeping bags remi sat reading a trekkers guide shed downloaded onto her ipad while sam studied a map of the area under the beam of a flashlight remi whispered sam remember what wally mentioned at the airport about the chokes we never asked thule about it in the morning i think now would be better she replied and handed sam her ipad she pointed to a section of text he read known colloquially as the chokes these narrow ravines found along the length of the kali gandaki gorge can be treacherous in the springtime at night meltwater runoff from the surrounding mountains frequently flash floods the ravines with little notice rising to a height of sam stopped reading handed the ipad back to remi and whispered pack your gear just the essentials quietly then aloud he called mr thule no answer mr thule after a few moments delay they heard the scuff of a boot on gravel followed by yes mr fargo tell us about the chokes a long pause uh i am afraid i am not familiar with that phrase more scuffing on gravel the distinctive click of one of the toyotas doors being opened hurrying now sam unzipped his sleeping bag and rolled out already mostly clothed he grabbed his jacket slipped it on and quietly unzipped the tent he crept out looked left and right then stood up thirty feet away he could just make out thules silhouette leaning through the toyotas driversside door he was rummaging around the interior on his feet sam began creeping toward the toyota he was twenty feet away when he stopped suddenly and cocked his head faintly at first then more distinctly he heard the rush of water across the ravine he could see the stream was roiling white water lapping at the sides of the cliff from behind sam heard a tsst and turned around to see remi poking her head from the tent flap she gave him a thumbsup and he replied with a palm out wait sam crept toward the toyota when hed closed the gap to ten feet he ducked down and continued on stooped over around the rear bumper to the drivers side of the vehicle sam stopped peeked around the corner thule was still leaning into the toyota with only his legs visible sam eyed the distance between them five feet he extended his leg carefully planted his foot and began shifting his weight forward thule whipped around clutched in his hand was a stainlesssteel revolver stop mr fargo sam stopped stand up thules charmingly stunted speech had vanished only a slight accent remained sam stood up he said something tells me we should have checked your id when you offered that would have been wise how much did they pay you for rich people like you and your wife a pittance for me five years worth of wages do you want to offer me more would it do any good no the people made it clear what would happen to me if i betrayed them out of the corner of his eye sam could see the river had begun expanding outward and far behind the rush of water was gaining in volume sam knew he needed to play for time hopefully the man before him would let down his guard if only momentarily wheres the real thule sam asked two feet to your right you killed him it was part of the task once the waters recede he will be found along with you and your wife his head crushed by the rocks along with you pardon unless you have a spare spark ignition wire laying around sam replied patting his jacket pocket on impulse thules eyes darted toward the toyotas interior anticipating this sam had started moving even as hed patted his pocket he was in midleap his hands a foot from thule when the man spun back around the barrel of his revolver lashing out it caught sam high on the forehead a glancing blow that nevertheless gashed his scalp he stumbled backward and dropped to his knees gasping thule stepped forward and cocked his leg sam saw the kick coming and braced himself while trying to roll away the top of thules foot slammed into his side and flipped him onto his back sam shouted remi he rolled his head to the right and saw remi sprinting toward him get the gear sam croaked follow me follow you follow you where the toyotas engine grumbled to life moving on instinct sam rolled onto his belly pushed himself onto his knees then got to his feet he stumbled toward the nearest lantern six feet to his left through his painhazed vision he saw down the ravine a twentyfoottall wave of white water churning through the slot sam snatched the lantern off the pole with his left hand then turned back toward the toyota and forced his legs into a shuffling sprint the toyotas transmission engaged the wheels sprayed gravel peppering sams lower legs he ignored it and kept moving as the toyota lurched forward sam jumped his left leg landed on the rear bumper he clamped his right hand on the roof racks rail the toyota surged ahead fishtailing on the gravel and jerking sam from side to side he held on pulled himself closer to the cargo hatch thule straightened the toyota out and sped toward the ravine entrance now fifty yards away sam stuck the lanterns handle between his teeth and used his left hand to turn the wick knob the flame guttered then brightened he grasped the lantern in his left hand again one chance sam muttered to himself he took a breath let the lantern dangle at arms length for a moment then heaved it like a grenade the lantern twirled upward over the toyotas roof and crashed onto the hood shattering flaming kerosene splashed across the windshield the effect was immediate and dramatic startled by the wave of fire across his windshield thule panicked jerking the wheel first left then right the double slewing motion sending the toyota up on two wheels sam lost his grip he felt himself flying saw the ground rushing toward him he curled himself into a ball at the last instant smashed into the ground on his hip and let himself roll dully in the back of his mind he heard a crash glass shattering and the crunch of metal he rolled over blinked his vision clear the toyota had crashed with its hood wedged into the narrow rock arch sam heard footsteps then remis voice as she knelt beside him sam sam are you hurt i dont know i dont think so youre bleeding sam touched his fingers to his forehead and looked at the blood scalp wound he muttered he grabbed a handful of dirt from the ground and patted it on the wound remi said sam dont see all better anything broken not that i can tell help me up she ducked under his shoulder and they stood up together sam asked wheres the in answer to his question water washed across their feet within seconds it rose to their ankles speak of the devil sam said in unison they turned around water was rushing through the northern end of the ravine the water was roiling around their calves thats cold remi said cold doesnt even begin to describe it sam replied our gear everything worthwhile is in my pack remi replied turning her shoulder so he could see it is he dead either that or unconscious if not i think hed be shooting at us by now we need to get that thing started its our only chance to outrun the flood they headed toward the toyota remi in the lead and sam limping behind her she slowed as she reached the vehicles rear bumper then crept around to the drivers door and peeked inside she called hes out sam shuffled up and together they opened the door and dragged thule out he plunged into the water to remis unspoken question sam said we cant worry about him in a minute or so this is all going to be underwater remi climbed into the toyota and across to the passengers seat sam followed and slammed the door shut behind him he turned the key the starter whined and clicked but the engine refused to start come on sam muttered he turned the key again the engine caught sputtered died one more time remi said gave him a smile and held up crossed fingers sam closed his eyes took a breath and turned the key again the starter clicked over the engine coughed once then again then roared to life sam was about to shift into gear when they felt the toyota lurch forward remi turned in her seat and saw water lapping at the lower edge of the door sam remi warned eyes on the rearview mirror sam replied i see it he shifted into reverse and pressed the accelerator the toyotas fourwheel drive bit down the vehicle began inching backward the quarter panels shrieking as they were dragged along the rock walls they were shoved forward again im losing traction sam said worried that the rising water would drown the engine he pressed the accelerator again and they felt the tires grab hold only to give way again sam pounded the steering wheel damn were afloat remi said even as the words left her mouth the toyotas hood was being shoved deeper into the slot noseheavy from the engine the vehicle began tipping downward as the tide shoved the rear upward sam and remi were silent for a moment listening to the water rush around the car and bracing themselves against the dashboard as the toyota continued pitching downward how long would we last in the water remi asked providing were not instantly crushed to pulp five minutes until the cold gets us past that we lose motor control and go under water began gushing through the door seams remi said lets not do that then right sam closed his eyes thinking then the winch weve got them on each bumper he searched the dashboard for the controls he found a toggle switch labeled rear and flipped it from off to neutral he said to remi when i give the word flip that to engage you think its powerful enough to drag us no sam replied i need a headlamp remi rummaged around the backpack and came out with the headlamp sam settled it on his head gave her a quick peck on the cheek then climbed over the seat using the headrest as a handhold he repeated this maneuver until he was wedged into the toyotas cargo area he unlatched the glass hatch shoved it open then lying with his back pressed against the seat mulekicked the hatch until the glass tore free from its hinges and plunged into the water he stood up below the water churned over the toyotas undercarriage icy mist billowed around him remi called the engines dead sam hinged forward at the waist reached down and grabbed the winch hook with both hands hand over hand he began taking up the slack the winch froze climb up to me remi scrabbled over the front seat reached back retrieved the backpack and handed it to sam then used his extended arm to climb into the cargo area no she cried what sam looked down the beam of his headlamp illuminated a ghostly white face pressed against plastic sheeting sorry sam said i forgot to tell you meet the real mr thule poor man the toyota shuddered slid sideways a few feet then stopped wedged tightly in the rock archway and standing perfectly upright remi tore her eyes off the dead mans face and said i assume were climbing again with any luck sam peeked over the tailgate the water had enveloped the rear tires how long she asked two minutes help me he turned his body sideways and remi helped him don the backpack next he flipped his right leg over the tailgate then his left then slowly stood up arms extended for balance once steady he shone his headlamp over the rock face beside the toyota it took him three passes before he found what he needed a twoinchwide vertical fissure fifteen feet above them and three feet to the right above that a series of handholds that led to the top of the cliff okay hand it up sam said to remi she extended the winch hook toward him he leaned down grabbed it his foot slipped and he crashed onto one knee he regained his balance and stood erect again this time with his left arm braced on the toyotas roof rack go get em cowboy remi said with a brave smile winch hook dangling from his right hand sam swung the cable like a propeller until hed gained enough momentum then let it fly the hook clinked against the rock face slid sideways over the fissure and plunged into the water sam retrieved the hook and tried again another miss he felt cold water envelop his left foot he looked down the water was past the bumper and was now lapping up against the tailgate weve sprung more leaks remi said sam tossed the hook again this time it slid cleanly into the fissure and bit down momentarily before coming free fourth times the charm right i think the phrase is work with me fargo sam chuckled right sam took a moment to tune out the churning water and the pounding of his heart he closed his eyes refocused then opened his eyes and began swinging the cable again he let go the hook sailed upward clanked off the rock and began sliding toward the fissure sam realized the speed was too great as the hook skipped over the crack he snapped the cable sideways the hook snapped backward like a striking snake and wedged itself in the fissure gently sam gave the cable a tug it held another tug the hook slipped then bit down again then hand over hand he began taking up tension on the cable until the hook was buried up to its eyelet yeehaw remi called sam extended his hand and helped remi over the tailgate water was sloshing over their feet and tumbling into the toyotas interior remi nodded toward the corpse of mr thule i dont suppose we could take him with us lets not push our luck sam replied we will however add him to the list of things charlie king and his evil spawn have to answer for remi sighed nodded sam gestured grandly to the cable ladies first lo monthang mustang nepal twenty hours after sam and remi climbed over the cliff top and left the toyota to the waters of the kali gandaki the pickup truck in whose bed they were riding coasted to a stop at a fork in the dirt road the driver mukti a gaptoothed nepali with a crew cut called through the back window lo monthang and pointed at the road heading north sam gently shook remi awake from her curled position against a bag of goat feed and said home sweet home she groaned pushed aside the coarse cotton and sat up yawning i was having the weirdest dream she said something similar to the poseidon adventure but we were trapped inside a toyota land cruiser truth is stranger than fiction are we there more or less sam and remi thanked the driver climbed out and watched as the truck turned onto the south fork and disappeared around the bend too bad about the language barrier remi said with only a smattering of nepali words and phrases between them neither sam nor remi had been able to tell their driver that he had possibly saved their lives for all he knew hed simply picked up a pair of wayward foreigners whod somehow lost their tour group his indulgent smile suggested this was not a rare event in these parts now exhausted but thankfully warm and dry they stood on the outskirts of their destination surrounded by a tall wall of patchwork rock brick and mudthatch mortar the ancient capital of the oncegreat kingdom of mustang was small occupying a half mile square in a shallow valley surrounded by low rolling hills inside lo monthangs walls most of the structures were also constructed from a mishmash of mud and brick all of it painted in shades of white ranging from grayish to brownish and bordered with layered thatch roofing four structures rose above the rest the royal palace and the redroofed chyodi champa and tugchen temples civilization remi said everything is relative sam agreed after they had wandered the wilds of mustang for what seemed like days the otherwise medieval lo monthang seemed positively metropolitan they started walking up the dirt road toward the main gate halfway there a boy of eight or ten appeared and sprinted toward them calling fargos fargos sam raised his hand in greeting and called in nepali namaste hoina hello yes the boy now beaming skidded to a stop before them and said follow yes follow hoina remi replied after leading them through the winding alleys of lo monthang under the curious gaze of hundreds of villagers the boy stopped before a thick wooden door set in a whitewashed wall he lifted the tarnished brass knocker rapped twice then said to sam and remi pheri bhetaunla then scampered off down a side alley they heard footsteps clicking on wood from inside the building and a few seconds later the door swung open revealing a frail midsixties man with long gray hair and a matching beard his face was heavily lined and brown to their surprise he greeted them with an uppercrust british accent good morning sam and remi fargo i presume after a moments hesitation sam said yes good morning were looking for a mr karna sushant dharel from kathmandu university arranged a meeting indeed he did and indeed you have pardon remi replied i am jack karna well where are my manners please come in he stood aside and sam and remi stepped inside similar to the exterior of the building the interior walls were whitewashed and the floor was constructed with old but wellscrubbed wooden planks several tibetanstyle rugs covered the floor and the walls were dotted with tapestries and framed bits of parchment along the west wall beneath thick casement windows was a seating area with cushions and pillows and a low coffee table against the east wall was a potbellied stove a small hallway led out of the room and into what looked like a sleeping area karna said i was about to send out a search party for you you look a bit travel worn are you quite all right we had a bit of a hiccup in our travel plans sam offered indeed you did news reached me a few hours ago some trekkers found a guide vehicle destroyed in one of the chokes south of here two bodies washed ashore near kagbeni i feared the worst before they could answer karna ushered them toward the pillows where they sat down the tea is ready give me just a moment a few minutes later he placed a silver tea service on the table along with a plate piled high with scones and crustless cucumber sandwiches karna poured tea and then sat down across from them now do tell me your tale mr karna prompted sam recounted their journey beginning with their arrival in jomsom and ending with their arrival at lo monthang he left out any mention of kings involvement in the assassination attempt through it all karna asked no questions and aside from a few arches of his eyebrow gave no reaction extraordinary he said at last and you have no idea of this impostors name no said remi he was in a bit of a hurry i can imagine your escape is the stuff of hollywood par for the course unfortunately sam said karna chuckled before we go on i should make the local brahminsthe councilaware of what happened is that necessary sam asked necessary and of benefit to you you are in lo monthang now mr and mrs fargo we may be a part of nepal but we are quite autonomous have no fear you will not be held responsible for what happened and unless the council considers it absolutely necessary the nepalese government will not be involved you are safe here sam and remi considered what he had said then gave their assent karna picked up a brass bell from the floor beside his cushion and rang it once ten seconds later the boy who greeted them on the approach road appeared from the side hallway he stopped before karna and bowed sharply in what sounded like rapidfire lowa karna spoke to the boy for thirty seconds the boy asked a single question then bowed again walked to the front door and stepped out karna said fear not all will be well forgive us remi said but the curiosity is killing us your accent is oxford through and through yes i am in fact british though i havent been home for fifteen years i suppose i have lived in mustang for thirtyeight years this summer most of that time in this very house how did you come to be here sam asked i came as a student actually anthropology mainly with a few side interests i spent three months here in then went home i wasnt there for two weeks before i realized mustang had gotten under my skin as they say so i returned and never left the local priests believe i am one of themreincarnated of course mr karna smiled shrugged who can say without doubt though i have never felt more at home anywhere else fascinating sam replied what do you do i suppose i am an archivist of sorts and an historian my main focus is documenting mustangs history not the history you read on wikipedia though he saw remis confused expression and said with a smile yes i know about wikipedia i have satellite internet here quite extraordinary given the remoteness of the place quite remi agreed i amand have been for nearly twelve yearswriting a book that will with any luck serve as a comprehensive history of mustang and lo monthang a hidden history if you will which explains why sushant thought you were the person we should see said sam indeed he told me you were particularly interested in the legend of the theurang the golden man yes replied remi he did not however tell me why karna was now serious his eyes peering hard at sam and remi before they could answer he went on please understand i mean no offense but your reputation has preceded you you are professional treasure hunters are you not its not the term we prefer sam replied but its technically accurate remi added we keep none of what we find for ourselves any financial compensation goes to our foundation yes i read that your reputation is in fact quite good the trouble is you see i have had visitors before people after the theurang for what i fear were nefarious reasons did these people happen to be a young man and woman sam asked caucasian twins with asian features karnas left eyebrow arched spoton they were here a few months ago sam and remi shared a glance silently they agreed they could and should trust karna they were in as remote a location as theyd ever been and the attempt on their lives the day before told them charles king had taken the gloves off not only did they need karnas knowledge but they needed a trustworthy ally their names are russell and marjorie king their father is charles king king charlie karna interrupted i read an article about him in the wall street journal last year bit of a cowboy i gather a bumpkin yes a very powerful bumpkin remi replied why on earth does he want you dead why precisely were not sure sam replied but were convinced hes after the theurang sam went on to recount their affiliation with charles king he left nothing out he told karna what they knew what they suspected and what remained a mystery well one mystery i can address immediately karna said these evil twins the king children clearly gave me a bogus name but during their visit they did mention the name lewis bully king when i told them what im about to tell you they reacted with no apparent shock strange given who they are what did you tell them that lewis king is dead he died in lo monthang mustang nepal shocked sam and remi didnt speak for several moments finally remi said how did he die fell into a crevasse about ten miles from here in fact i helped recover his body he is buried in the local cemetery and you told the king twins this sam asked indeed their reaction was one of disappointment i suppose now knowing who they are it seems particularly coldhearted doesnt it in keeping with the family character remi replied did they tell you why they were looking for him they were very evasive which is why i found an excuse to cut our visit short all i could gather was they were looking for king and had an interest in the theurang i didnt much care for the cut of their jib its nice to know my instincts were right so it seems clear that charles king knew his father was dead when he contacted you and knew it when he hired alton sam said the report about the photo showing lewis here was another fabrication all designed to get you involved in the hunt for the golden man karna added not much of a deep thinker this king is he he expected you would come here to find your friend then pick up the hunt for the theurang without getting suspicious then lead the twins straight to it so it seems remi said the bestlaid plans of country cretins and loathsome offspring karna finished the larger question is why is the theurang so important to king you dont suppose hes some kind of closet nazi do you picking up the banner of his fathers expedition we dont think so said sam weve started to wonder if its simply an obsession or a side business like his black market fossil endeavors either way the kings have kidnapped and murdered for the theurang not to mention enslaved remi added the people at the dig site cant come and go as they please that too regardless of his motives we cant let the golden man fall into his hands karna picked up his teacup and raised it in salute its decided then we are at war with the king family all for one sam and remi raised their cups and said in unison and one for all tell me more about the burial chamber you found karna said leave nothing out remi briefly described the alcove theyd found in the chobar gorge cave then retrieved her ipad from the backpack and brought up the gallery of photos shed taken during their exploration she handed it to karna fascinated by the ipad he spent a minute turning it over in his hands and playing with the interface before looking up wideeyed at sam and remi i really must get one of these all right to business he spent the next ten minutes studying remis photos panning and zooming the ipads interface clicking his tongue and muttering words like wondrous and astonishing at last he handed the ipad back to remi you have both made history karna said while i dont imagine the larger world will realize the significance of the find the people of mustang and nepal certainly will what you have there in fact is the final resting place of a sentinel the four characters engraved into the top of the box do you have a better photos of them no sorry where is the box right now sam replied in san diego with selma our chief researcher oh goodness is she fully qualified remi said shes trying to open itcarefully without damaging it very good i may be able to help her with that do you know whats inside i may ill come to that shortly how much did sushant tell you about the sentinels and the theurang a good overview remi said but he made it clear youre the expert thats very true well sentinels were guardians of the theurang the honor was handed down from father to son they were trained from the age of six for one purpose and one purpose alone the himanshu decree of was one of four times the theurang has been evacuated from lo monthang the previous three instances all of which preceded an invasion ended favorably and the theurang was subsequently returned to the capital the invasion of was different however the marshal of the army at the time dolma convinced the king and his advisers that this invasion would be different he was certain it would spell the beginning of the end of mustang not to mention the prophecy prophecy sam prompted yes ill spare you the particulars most of which involve buddhist legend and numerology but the prophecy stated that a time would come when the kingdom of mustang would fall and the only way it would ever rise again was if the theurang was returned to its birthplace here remi said thats what sushant told us my dear friend is mistaken not his fault really the popular history of mustang and the theurang is spotty at best first you must understand something the people of mustang never considered themselves owners of the golden man but rather its caretakers how exactly did sushant describe the nature of the theurang its appearance no its nature i think the term he used was birth giver karna considered this for a moment then shrugged as a metaphor perhaps mrs fargo youre an anthropologist by training are you not thats right good good give me just a moment karna stood up and disappeared down the side hall they heard what sounded like books being shuffled on a shelf then karna returned carrying two leatherbound tomes and an inchthick manila folder he sat back down leafed through the books until he found the pages he was looking for then set them aside facedown on the floor he said the kingdom of mustang was never a grand place the architecture is more functional more modestlike its peoplebut long ago they were quite learned far ahead of the western world in many ways karna turned to remi he asked youre an anthropologist what do you know about ardi the archaeological find indeed remi thought for a moment its been a while since i read the reports but this is what i remember ardis the nickname given to a fourandahalfmillionyearold fossil found in ethiopia as i recall the scientific name is ardipithecus ramidus though theres a lot of debate surrounding the find the consensus is that ardi is something of a missing link in human evolutiona bridge between higher primates like monkeys apes and humans and their more distant relatives like lemurs very good and its characteristics skeleton similar to a lemurs but with primate attributes grasping hands opposable thumbs clawless digits with nails and short limbs did i miss anything top marks replied karna he opened his manila envelope pulled out an eightbyten color photograph and handed it to sam and remi this is ardi as remi had described the fossilized creature lying on its side in the dirt looked like a cross between a monkey and a lemur now karna said heres a popular artists rendering of the theurang he withdrew a piece of paper from his folder and handed it across the color printout showed a drawing of a gorillalike creature with massive arms and a squat head dominated by a wide fangfilled mouth and an enormous jutting tongue instead of having legs it was supported by a column of muscle that ended in a single webbed foot notice any similarities to ardi karna asked none sam replied this looks like a cartoon indeed it comes from a legend involving tibets first king nyatri tsenpo who was said to have descended from the theurang in tibet over the millennia the theurang became something of a boogeyman the mustang version however is quite different karna picked up one of the books and handed it to sam and remi the page was open to a crude but highly stylized drawing the tone was decidedly buddhist in nature but there was no mistaking the subject of the rendering remi murmured ardi yes karna answered as if suddenly animated this i believe is the most accurate portrayal of the theurang what youre looking at mr and mrs fargo is the golden man sam and remi were silent for a full minute as they stared at the drawing and tried to absorb karnas words finally sam said youre not suggesting this creature was alive in contemporary mustang no of course not i suspect the theurang is a distant cousin of ardis probably a much later missing link but certainly millions of years old i have other drawings that show the theurang with all of ardis attributes the grasping hands the opposable thumbs other drawings show it with more primatelike facial features why is it called the golden man asked sam legend has it that when on display in lo monthangs royal palace the theurang was fully assembled and articulated in such a way that it appeared human in shortly after lo monthang was founded the first king of mustangame paldecided the theurangs aspect wasnt sufficiently glorious he had the bones gilded with gold and the eye sockets adorned with gems along with the fingertips the teeth which were said to have been mostly intact were covered in gold leaf he must have been quite a sight remi said gaudy is the word i use karna replied but who am i to argue with the ame pal remi said are you suggesting the people here developed a theory of evolution before darwin did theory no a firm belief absolutely in the nearly thirty years ive spent here ive found texts and artwork that make it clear the people of mustang firmly believed man sprang from earlier creaturesprimates in particular i can show you cave murals that depict a distinct line of progression from lower forms to modern man more important despite popular belief the theurang was revered not in a religious sense but rather an historical one where did the legend originate sam asked where and when did they find the theurang no one knowsor at least no one ive found its my hope that before i die i can answer that exact question maybe your discovery will be the lost puzzle piece do you think the theurang is in the box we found not unless a terrible mistake had been made one of the skills the sentinels had to master was celestial navigation no im quite certain you found the sentinel where you did because thats where he was ordered to go then what do you think is inside either nothing or a clue to the theurangs birthplacethe location to which it was allegedly taken in what kind of clue asked remi a disk roughly four inches in diameter hewn from gold and engraved with symbols of some kind the disk when used in conjunction with two other disks and a special map would pinpoint the theurangs final resting place you know nothing else about it sam said i know the name of the place which is the ancient translation is a bit complicated but you would it know it by its popular moniker shangrila lo monthang mustang nepal karna said i can see by your expressions you think im winding you up you dont strike us as a windingup kind of guy sam said but you have to admit that shangrila is a bit of a fairy tale is it what do you know about it its a fictional utopia a valley located somewhere in the himalayas filled with ridiculously happy and worryfree people you forgot immortal remi said right sorry immortal thats shangrila as depicted in the novel james hiltons lost horizon another example of popular culture shanghaiing and adulterating a fascinatingand possibly truetale you have our attention remi said mention of shangrila and its analogues can be found in many cultures in asia tibetans refer to it as nghebeyul khimpalung they believe it is in the makalubarun region or the kunlun mountains or the most recent candidate the ancient city of tsaparang in western tibet several places in india have also been proposed as the true location as well as dozens in china including yunnan sichuan zhongdian add to the list bhutan and the hunza valley in northern pakistan now heres the truly interesting part as you know the nazis were a bit mad for the occult the expedition lewis bully king was a part of in one of its objectives was to find shangrila they felt certain it would be home to an ancient master race aryans unspoiled by time and genetic impurities we didnt know that remi said perhaps king charles isnt after the theurang alone but shangrila as well karna said anythings possible sam replied but king doesnt strike me as a big believer in the fantastic true or otherwise if he cant touch it see it or smell it or sell it remi added or sell it hes not interested sam finished what do you believe karna i assume you believe its real of all the possibilities you presented which one fits none of the above my research and my instincts tell me that for the people of mustang shangrila represented a wellspringboth the birthplace and the eternal resting place of the theurang a creature they believed was their universal ancestor i suspect what we today call shangrila was where the theurang was originally discovered how long ago i cannot say but thats what i believe and if you had to place money on its location remi asked i think the tibetan etymology holds the key shang which is also tsang combined with ri together means mountain and la means pass so tsang mountain pass remi said not quite in the royal dialect of ancient mustang la also means gorge or canyon the tsangpo gorge sam replied thats a lot of territory the river that runs through itthe yarlung tsangpois how long a hundred twenty miles one hundred fifty karna answered bigger than your grand canyon in many ways and the mountains are thickly forested some of the most daunting terrain in the world if youre right about the location and the legend remi said its no wonder shangrilas remained hidden all this time karna smiled as we sit here together we may be closer to finding itand the golden manthan anyone else in history closer perhaps sam replied but not there you said we need all three disks lets say the chest selma has contains one of them well still need the other two and the map said remi the map is the least of our hurdles karna said ive located four candidates one of which im certain will serve our purposes as for the other two disks how do you feel about the balkans sam and remi exchanged glances remi said we once had some bad lamb in bulgaria but aside from that we have nothing against it glad to hear it karna said with a mischievous smile what im about to tell you ive never shared with anyone despite the high regard in which im held here i am not sure how my adopted countrymen would welcome my theory again you have our attention sam said three years ago i uncovered some texts i believe were written by the personal secretary to the king in the weeks leading up to the invasion what kind of texts a personal diary of sorts the king had of course been informed of the strength of the invading army and he agreed with the prophecy that mustangs demise was at hand further he had his doubts that the sentinels could carry out their duties he felt the odds against them were overwhelming he was also convinced someone from within his inner circle had turned traitor and was feeding the enemy information in secret he assigned the finest of the sentinelsa man known as dhakalthe task of transporting the theurang to shangrila in two of the three chests ostensibly containing the disks he placed fakes one was genuine and the other two disks asked remi given to a pair of priests from the eastern orthodox church neither remi nor sam spoke immediately karnas non sequitur was so abrupt they werent sure theyd heard him correctly say that again said sam a year before the invasion lo monthang was visited by a pair of priests from the eastern orthodox church this was the fifteenth century remi said at that time the nearest outpost of the church would have been she trailed off with a shrug in presentday uzbekistan karna replied fourteen hundred miles from here and to answer your question no i have found no mention in church histories referring to missionaries traveling that far east i have something better ill get to that shortly as the kings diary tells he welcomed the missionaries into his court and they soon became friends a few months after they arrived an attempt was made on the kings life the priests came to his aid and one of them was wounded he became convinced these two foreigners were part of the prophecy sent to ensure the theurang could one day be returned to lo monthang so he gave each of them a disk for safekeeping and sent them back to their home countries before the invasion remi guessed exactly so please tell me you found references to them somewhere sam asked karna smiled i did fathers besim mala and arnost deniv both names appear in church records from the fifteenth century both men were dispatched to samarkand uzbekistan in with the death of genghis khan the weakening of the mongol empire and the rise of tamerlane the eastern orthodox church was keen on spreading christianity to the heathens as it were what became of our intrepid priests remi asked mala died in on the albanian island of sazani deniv died six years after that in sofia bulgaria the time line fits said sam if they left lo monthang in they would have made it back to the balkans a year or so later sam and remi fell silent each lost in thought karna said a bit fantastic isnt it im glad you said it sam replied i didnt want to be rude im not offended i know how it sounds and youre right to be skeptical i myself spent the first year after i found the diary trying to debunk it with no success heres what i propose i will turn over my research notes to this selma of yours if she can disprove my theory so be it if not then balkans here we come remi said from his living quarters karna retrieved his laptop an apple macbook pro with a seventeeninch screen which he placed on the coffee table before them he connected one end of an ethernet cable to the laptops port and the other to a wall jack leading up to what sam and remi guessed was karnas satellite dish soon selmas face appeared in the ichat window standing behind her looking over each shoulder were pete jeffcoat and wendy corden and behind them the workspace in the fargos san diego home predictably selma was in her uniform of the day hornrimmed glasses on a neck chain and a tiedyed tshirt accommodating a threesecond satellite transmission delay remi made the introductions then brought selma and the others up to speed as was her way selma asked no questions during remis report and was silent for a full minute afterward as she mentally collated the information interesting was all she said thats it sam asked well i assume youve already told mr karna in your own diplomatic way how farfetched this sounds at this jack karna chuckled they did indeed ms wondrash selma jack then do you have your research material digitized of course selma gave karna a link to the offices server then said upload it there and ill start working through it in the meantime ill turn the chest over to pete and wendy the three of you can see about opening it it took twenty minutes to upload all of karnas research notes once done and after badgering sam and remi into having a nap in his guest room karna pete and wendy went to work on the box karna first asked to see enhanced pictures of the chest including a closeup of the engraved characters he peered at them on his laptop screen tilting his head first one way then the other until muttering something under his breath he stood up suddenly marched down the hallway and returned a minute later with a tiny book bound in reddyed textile this he flipped through for several more minutes before calling aha just as i thought the characters are a derivation of lowa and yet another royal dialect the inscription is meant to be read vertically from right to left roughly translated it says through fulfillment prosperity through resistance anguish wendy said i think i read that in a selfhelp book once i have no doubt karna said but in this case its intended as a warninga curse i suspect these characters were inscribed on each of the sentinels boxes pete said in short take this to its destination and youll find happiness interfere with or impede that and youre screwed impressive young man said karna not the words i would use of course but you arrested the gist of the message would this have been intended for the sentinels wendy asked no i dont think so it was designed for the enemy or anyone who came into possession through illicit means but if the dialect is that obscure who aside from mustang royalty would have been able to understand the warning thats beside the point the curse stands ignorance be damned harsh said pete lets take a closer look at this box shall we in one of remis pictures i noticed the tiniest of seams along a bottom edge of the box we noticed that too wendy replied hold on weve got a closeup a few clicks of the mouse later the image in question filled karnas screen he studied the photo for several minutes before saying do you see the seam im talking about the one that looks like a series of eight dashes yes said pete and the full seam opposite that got it forget that one its a decoy unless i miss my guess the dashed seam is a combination lock of sorts the gaps are almost paperthin said wendy how can two millimeters i would say youll need a shim of sorts a thin but strong type of metal or alloy inside each of those dashes will be a brass or bronze flange each with three vertical depression settings up middle and fully down hold on wendy said im doing the math thats over sixtyfive hundred possible combinations not overly daunting pete said with enough patience and time you could eventually pick it karna said true if not for one fact you only get one crack at it enter the wrong combination and the internal mechanism locks itself that does complicate things weve not yet begun to unravel the complications my boy once past the combination the real challenge begins how wendy said what have you ever heard of a chinese puzzle box yes think of what you have before you as the mother of all chinese puzzle boxes as it so happens i believe i have the combination to the initial locking mechanism shall we get started three hours later sam and remi now awake refreshed and armed with cups of tea joined karna before his laptop just in time to hear pete exclaim through the ichat window got it onscreen he and wendy were leaning over the worktable the sentinel box between them it was brightly illuminated by an overhead halogen lamp another ichat screen popped up on the screen this one displaying selmas face got what its a chinese puzzle box replied wendy once we got past the combination a narrow panel popped open inside were three tiny wooden switches following jacks directions we flipped one another panel opened then more switches and so on how many moves now jack sixtyfour one more to go if weve done our job itll open if not we may lose the contents forever explain that sam said oh goodness i didnt mention the booby trap did i so sorry mention it now remi said if the box contains a disk it will be suspended in the middle of the primary compartment set into the sides of that compartment will be glass vials filled with corrosive liquid if your last move is the wrong one or you try to force the compartment open karna made a hissing sound you get an unidentifiable lump of gold i hope im wrong said selma but i dont think theres a disk in there why asked pete odds sam and remi stumble upon the only sentinel box ever found and it just happens to contain the one genuine disk in the bunch karna said but they didnt stumble upon it did they they were following in the footsteps of lewis kinga man who had spent at least eleven years chasing the theurang whatever his motives i doubt he was on a goose chase that day at chobar gorge it appears he never found the sentinels burial chamber but i suspect he wasnt there for an empty box selma considered this logical was all she said one way to find out sam said whos going to do the honors pete wendy pete said im nothing if not chivalrous go ahead wendy wendy took a deep breath reached into the box and flipped the appropriate switch an inchwide rectangular hatch slid open beside her fingers karna said softly now gently slide your pinkie finger up along the inside of the box until you feel a square button wendy did so okay got it slide that button let me see slide it to the rightno left slide it to the left left wendy repeated are you sure karna hesitated a moment then nodded firmly yes left here i go through the laptops speaker sam and remi heard a wooden snick wendy cried the tops open now carefully lift the lid straight upward if its there the disk will be suspended from the underside moving with exaggerated slowness wendy began lifting the lid an inch at a time its got some heft to it dont let it swing karna whispered a little more pete rasped i can see a cord hanging down looks like catgut or something similar wendy kept lifting the halogen light reflected off something solid a curved edge a glint of gold be ready peter said karna wendy lifted the lid the rest of the way the remainder of the cord rose from the box dangling at its end the prize a fourinchwide golden disk with latexgloved hands pete reached out wendy lowered the disk into his palms and he transferred it to a foamlined tray on the table the group let out a collective breath now comes the hard part karna said what wendy said with exasperation that wasnt the hard part im afraid not my dear now we must ascertain whether we do in fact have the genuine article vlore albania the fiats dashboard clock clicked over to nine am just as sam and remi passed the welcome sign for vlore albanias secondlargest city of a hundred thousand souls sat nestled on a bay on the west coast overlooking the adriatic with its back to the mountains and with any luck sam and remi hoped vlore was still home to one of the sentinel disks an hour after wendy and pete had extracted the theurang disk from the box and set about determining its provenance with karna selmas face reappeared in an ichat window on karnas laptops screen in her characteristically curt manner she said jack your research methods are impeccable sam remi i think his theory about the two priests holds water whether we can find them and the other two disks is another matter what else have you been able to discover asked sam at the time of their deaths both besim mala and arnost deniv had risen to the rank of bishop and were highly respected in their communities both had helped found churches and schools and hospitals throughout their home countries which suggests their burial sites could be more elaborate than a sixfootdeep rectangle in the earth karna said i found no mention of the particulars but i cant fault your reasoning replied selma in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the eoc the what asked remi eastern orthodox church the eocespecially those based in the balkans and southern russiatended to make a big deal of such deaths crypts and mausoleums appear to be the customary method of interment the question is karna said where exactly were they laid to rest still working on deniv but church records state that bishop besim malas final posting was in vlore albania with time to kill until selma could give them a more specific target area sam and remi spent an hour touring vlore marveling at its beautifully blended architecture that felt at once greek italian and medieval shortly before noon they pulled into the parking lot of the hotel bologna overlooking the blue waters of the harbor and took a seat in a palm treelined outdoor cafe sams satellite phone trilled it was selma sam put the phone on speaker i have jack here as well selma said we have if this is going to a bad newsgood news call selma just give it to us remi said were too tired to choose actually this is an all good news callor potentially good news that is shoot said sam jack karna said the sentinel disk is genuine i believe i cant be one hundred percent sure until i can check it against the wall maps i mentioned but im optimistic selma said as for the final resting place of besim mala i can narrow your search grid to about a half mile square is it underwater sam asked skeptical no an alligatorinfested swamp remi chimed in no let me guess sam said a cave its in a cave karna said strike three to appropriate an american phrase based on our research we believe bishop mala was laid to rest in the graveyard of the monastery of saint mary on zvernec island which is where asked remi six miles north up the coast find a wifi hot spot and ill download the particulars to your ipad mrs fargo they took a short time to relax in the hotels cafe sam and remi ordered a flavorsome albanian lunch of ground lamb meatballs scented with mint and cinnamon baked dough with spiced spinach and grape juice enhanced with sugar and mustard as luck would have it the cafe had free wifi so between bites of a delicious lunch they perused their travel packet as selma called it predictably it was exhaustive with driving instructions local history and a map of the grounds of the monastery the only detail she could not find was the actual location of bishop malas grave site after paying the bill sam and remi pointed the fiats hood north after ten miles they pulled into the village of zvernec and followed a lone sign to narta lagoon the lagoon was large nearly twelve square miles upon turning onto the dirt road encircling the lagoon sam drove north until they came to a gravel parking lot on a patch of land jutting into the lagoon the lot was empty sam and remi got out and stretched the weather was unseasonably warm seventy degrees and sunny with only a few billowy clouds inland i take it thats our destination remi said pointing at the shore a narrow pedestrian bridge led to zvernec island eight hundred feet away that was home to st mary monastery a collection of four medievalstyle church buildings occupying a twoacre triangle of grass on the shoreline they walked to the head of the bridge where remi paused she stared at the bridge nervously the ramshackle crossings theyd encountered first in chobar gorge then again on their way to kings secret dig site in the langtang valley had clearly made more of an impact than shed realized sam walked back to where she was standing and wrapped an arm around her shoulders its solid im an engineer remi this monastery is a tourist attraction tens of thousands of people cross this bridge every year eyes narrowed she looked at him sideways youre not humoring me are you fargo would i do that you might not this time come on he said with an encouraging smile well cross together itll be like strolling along a sidewalk she nodded firmly back on the horse sam took her hand and they started across halfway there she stopped suddenly she smiled i think im all better cured i wouldnt go that far but im okay lets keep moving within a couple minutes theyd reached the island from a distance the church buildings appeared almost pristine sunbleached rock walls and redtiled roofs now standing before the structures it was clear to sam and remi the buildings had seen better days the roofs were missing tiles and several of the walls were either sagging or partially crumbling one belfry was missing a roof altogether its bell slouching sideways from its support beam a wellgroomed dirt path wound its way through the grounds here and there pigeons sat clustered on eaves cooing and staring unblinkingly at the islands two new visitors i dont see anyone sam said you remi shook her head selmas brief mentioned a caretaker but no tourist office then lets explore sam said how big is the island ten acres shouldnt take long to find the cemetery after taking a cursory stroll through each of the buildings they followed the path into the pine forest beyond the clearing once they were inside the tree line the sun dimmed and the trunks seemed to tighten around them this was oldgrowth forest with kneehigh tangles of undergrowth and enough rotting logs and stumps to make passage a bit of a challenge after a few hundred yards the path forked of course remi said no sign flip a mental coin left they took the lefthand fork and followed the winding trail before coming to a rickety halfrotted dock overlooking a marsh bad flip remi said they backtracked to the fork and began heading down the righthand path this took them generally northeast deeper into the forest and toward the wider end of the island sam jogged ahead on a scouting mission turned and called back to remi spotted a clearing a few moments later he appeared from around a bend in the trail and stopped before her he was smiling broadly you generally dont get this excited about clearings remi said i do if the clearing has tombstones lead on bwana together they walked down the path to where the pine forest parted ovalshaped and roughly two hundred feet across the clearing was indeed a cemetery but almost immediately sam and remi realized there was something very wrong here on the far side was a jumbled stack of pine logs beside this stack several househigh bales of withered boughs and branches the earth in the clearing was pockmarked as though it had undergone an artillery bombardment and about half of the graves appeared to have been freshly churned to the east was a second opening in the trees this one a nearly straight corridor at the end of which they could see the waters of the lagoon of the dozens of tombstones visible only a few were undamaged all the others were either cracked or partially uprooted from the ground sam and remi counted fourteen mausoleums all of these showed signs of damage as well either canted on their foundations or their walls and roofs caved in what happened here remi asked a storm im guessing said sam came off the ocean and ripped across the island like a chain saw its a shame remi nodded solemnly on the bright side it may make our job easier we wont technically be breaking into malas mausoleum good point but there is one more hurdle sam said to remi what lets look first i dont want to jinx us they split up sam taking the east side and moving north remi taking the west side and moving north skipping grave markers each headed for the nearest mausoleum stopping only long enough to read the name engraved on the stone facade at last remi reached the graveyards northeast corner near the jumble of pine logs as she approached the last mausoleum in her line it seemed to be the least damaged of the lot with only a few cracks showing in the walls it was also uniquely decorated she realized her heart skipping a beat she called sam i think we may have a winner he walked over why do you think so thats the biggest cross ive seen you yes the wall closest to them bore a fourbyfivefoot eastern orthodox cross with its three crossbarstwo horizontal ones close together near the top and one near the bottom canted sideways ive seen a lot of those but none this big im curious why the slanted bottom crosspiece i assume its symbolic of something ah the mysteries of religion said sam they walked the last few feet to the mausoleum then split up each walking around a side to the front which they found was surrounded by a calfhigh wroughtiron fence one side was smashed flat against the ground at the bottom of three stone steps the mausoleum door was openor to be more accurate gone beyond that the interior was dark carved into the pediment beneath the mausoleums sloped roof were four letters m a l a nice to finally find you your eminence sam murmured sam stepped over the fence followed by remi and descended the steps they stopped before the opening the stench of mildew filled their nostrils sam dug into his pocket and came out with his micro led flashlight they stepped onto the threshold and sam clicked on the light empty remi murmured sam panned the beam around the interior hoping there was a lower antechamber but he saw nothing do you see any markings he asked no that smell isnt normal sam its like stagnant water he clicked off the flashlight they turned around and climbed the steps sam said somebody took him somewhere all the mausoleums i checked were also empty mine too someone disinterred these people sam back on the monastery grounds they spotted a man atop a wooden ladder leaning against the damaged belfry he was middleaged stocky and wearing a black bicycleracingstyle cap they walked over excuse me remi said in albanian the man turned and looked down at them a flisni anglisht do you speak english the man shook his head jo damn remi murmured and pulled out her ipad the man called out earta a little blond girl scampered around the edge of the building and skidded to a stop before sam and remi she smiled at them then up at the man po he spoke to her in albanian for a few seconds then she nodded to sam and remi she said good afternoon my name is earta i speak english and very well sam said then introduced himself and remi very nice to meet you you would like to ask my father a question yes remi said is he the caretaker eartas brows furrowed care taker caretaker oh yes he is the caretaker we were curious about the graveyard we were just there and a shame about what happened yes yes what did happen earta put the question to her father listened to his answer then said two months ago a storm came in from the bay heavy winds there was much damage the next day the sea rose and flooded the lagoon and part of this island the graveyard was underwater much damage there too sam said what happened to the occupants earta asked her father then asked them why do you ask remi replied i may have distant relatives from here my aunt told me one of them was buried here oh earta said with some consternation i am sorry to hear that she spoke to her father again who replied at length earta said to remi about half of the graves were undamaged the others when the water receded the people were no longer under the ground my father my sisters and i were finding them for several days afterward eartas eyes brightened and she smiled there was even a skull in a tree just sitting there it was funny remi stared at the beaming girl for a moment okay then the government came and decided the bodies should be taken away until the cemetery can be um fixed is that the right word sam smiled yes come back next year it will be much nicer then less stinky where are the remains now said remi earta asked her father she nodded at his explanation then said to sam and remi sazan island she pointed toward the bay of vlore there is an old monastery there older than this one even the government took them all there vlore albania well thats a bit of bad luck selma said a few minutes later when sam and remi shared the news they were sitting on the hood of their fiat in the parking lot hang on let me see what i can find out about sazan island they heard thirty seconds worth of keyboard clicking then selma was back here we go sazan island largest island in albania at two square miles strategically located between the strait of otranto and the bay of vlore in albania unpopulated as far as i can tell the waters around the island are part of a national marine park its changed hands a number of times throughout the centuries greece roman empire ottoman empire italy germany then back to albania looks like italy put some fortifications on it during world war two and yes here it is they converted the byzantineera monastery into a fortress of some kind selma paused oh well this could be trouble looks like i was mistaken caves sam predicted swamps alligatorsoh my remi chimed in no about it being uninhabited theres a park rangers installation on the island its home to three or four patrol boats and about three dozen rangers therefore offlimits to civilians remi added i would imagine mrs fargo agreed selma sam and remi were silent for a few moments neither had to ask the other about what came next sam simply said to selma how do we get there without being sunk by marine park rangers after skipping selmas first and predictable suggestion of dont get caught they began exploring their options first of course they would need transportation an easy enough task selma assured them leaving selma to her task sam and remi drove the fiat south back to vlore where they regrouped at their de facto headquarters the outdoor cafe at the hotel bologna from their seats they could see in the distance sazan island a speck of land rising from the adriatics blue waters selma called an hour later how do you feel about kayaks as long as theyre nice to us sam quipped remi swatted sam on the arm go ahead selma on the northern tip of the peninsula theres a recreation area beaches rock climbing sea caves coves for swimming that sort of thing from the tip of the peninsula to sazan island its just over two miles heres the catch they dont allow motorized craft in the area and it closes at dusk i presume you would prefer to do your skullduggery at night you know us so well sam replied youve found a trustworthy kayak emporium i assume i have ive taken the liberty of renting a pair for you what about weather and tides said remi partly cloudy and calm tonight with a quarter moon but theres a storm moving in tomorrow morning based on the online nautical charts ive been able to find the current within the bay is fairly gentle but go too far east of sazan island and the peninsula and youre in the adriatic from what ive read the current there is unforgiving sam said in other words a oneway trip south to the mediterranean sea if you even get that far without being we understand selma remi interrupted east is bad sam and remi looked at each other and nodded sam said selma how long until dusk as it turned out the approach of nightfall was the least of their worries while the shoplocated in orikum a resort municipality ten miles south of vlore in the crook of the bayhad a wide selection of injectionmolded plastic kayak models available none of them came in anything but retinaburning reds yellows or oranges or a jackson pollockesque mix of the three with no time to shop for stealthier color schemes they bought the best pair of the lot along with doubleended oars and life jackets after a quick stop at a hardware store they returned to vlore having had good luck with them since kathmandu they found a military surplus store and bought an allblack outfit for each of them boots and socks long underwear wool pants knit cap and an oversized longsleeved turtleneck sweater to cover the neon orange life jacket a bag of justincase odds and ends and a pair of dark rucksacks rounded out the spree then they set out sam drove around the recreation area for several minutes but they saw no one the parking lots and beaches were empty from a cliff overlook they scanned the waters below and again saw no one probably too early in the year sam said schools still in session we should assume therell be patrols remi said park rangers or local police sam nodded good point if found the fiat would either be ticketed or towed in either case it was a complication they didnt need worse still the local authorities might push the panic button and assume they had a pair of vacationers lost at sea which would undoubtedly attract the attention of the navy andor coast guardthe very thing sam and remi were trying to avoid after twenty minutes of tooling around the recreation areas dirt roads sam found a brushchoked drainage ditch into which he backed the fiat under remis careful eye for detail they rearranged the brush until the vehicle was invisible from the road together they stepped back to admire the job they could have used you in england before dday sam remarked its a gift remi agreed rucksacks on their backs they dragged their kayaks down the hill to a secluded cove theyd spotted earlier measuring less than forty feet wide with a shallow white sand beach the inlet leading out to sea was two hundred yards long and curved protecting them from prying eyes with fortyfive minutes of light remaining they set about camouflaging the kayaks using cans of black and gray marine spray paint they emblazoned the sides tops and bottoms of the craft in jagged overlapping stripes until not a sliver of neon plastic showed sams paint job while functional lacked the artistic flair of remis work her kayak bore a striking resemblance to the slashed camouflage pattern found on world war i warships he stepped back a few paces studied each kayak in turn then said are we sure you arent reincarnated from some oss operative not entirely she nodded at his kayak do you mind have at it a couple of minutes and half a can of spray paint later sams kayak looked almost identical to her own she turned to him what do you think i feel unmanned remi walked over and kissed him she smiled if it helps i think your kayak is bigger than mine very funny lets get changed after they donned their surplus clothes their regular clothes went into the rucksacks which in turn each went into the bow compartment of each kayak with nothing else to do they sat together in the sand and watched the suns descent watched as the shadows lengthened over the water and darkness slowly engulfed the inlet when night had fully fallen they dragged the kayaks down to the water each shoving halfway out before climbing in and pushing off with the tip of an oar soon they were moving through the inlet they took ten minutes to practice maneuvering the kayaks getting a feel for the oars and the balance until they were confident they were ready with sam in the lead remi behind and to his right they paddled down the inlet oars making a barely perceptible hiss as they cut through the water soon the mouth of the inlet came into view beyond that a vast dark carpet of water as selma had predicted the sky was partially overcast with only the faintest moon glow reflecting off the water two miles ahead almost due north they could see the dark lump of sazan island sam suddenly stopped paddling he held up a closed fist stop remi took her oar out of the water laid it across her lap and waited using exaggerated and slow movements sam pointed to his ear then up toward the top of the cliff to the right ten seconds passed then remi heard it an engine followed by the soft squeal of brakes sam looked back at remi pointed to the rock wall then put his oar back in the water and headed in that direction remi followed sam turned his kayak parallel with the cliff then rotated in his seat placed a hand on remis bow and steered her in ranger remi whispered lets hope so they sat still eyes cast upward at the edge of the cliff a match flared then went out and was replaced by the glowing tip of a cigarette in the faint glow sam glimpsed the brim of a militarystyle cap for five minutes they sat motionless watching as the man finished his smoke at last he turned and walked back the way hed come a car door opened then slammed shut the engine started and the car began moving away tires crunching on the gravel sam and remi waited another five minutes in case of a double back then set out again a quarter mile into the bay it became clear that selmas tide prediction was similarly accurate while neither sam nor remi were surprised they also knew the ocean was a fickle beast even a relatively gentle oneknot eastward current would have made the crossing twice as hard forcing them to make constant course adjustments to compensate for the surge fail at this and they could easily find themselves caught in the adriatic and on their way to greece soon they found their rhythm stroking in unison and quickly eating up the distance to sazan at the halfway point they stopped for a break remi brought her kayak alongside sams and they sat in silence for a few minutes enjoying the gentle rocking of the waves patrol remi said suddenly to the northeast a large speedboat came around the islands headland from the direction of the base it kept turning bow coming about until it was pointed directly at them sam and remi sat frozen watching and waiting though wellcamouflaged their kayaks wouldnt escape the attention of a spotlight a quarter mile away on the boats bow a spotlight popped on skimmed over the islands southern shoreline then went dark again the patrol boat kept coming toward them come on sam muttered go take some shore leave the boat swerved to the east remi said good boy keep going it did they watched for a few more minutes as the boats navigation lights grew more distant then finally merged with the light clutter of vlore in the distance sam looked at his wife ready ready they covered the remaining mile in about twenty minutes having already done a virtual reconnaissance of the island with google earth sam had picked out their landing point measuring roughly three miles from north to south and a mile at its widest point sazan resembled sam thought a misshapen guppy the park station was on the guppys back a cove on the northeastern coast while their landing site was the guppys tail at the extreme southern tip near the old world war iiera fortifications mostly devoid of vegetation save ground brush and a few patches of dwarf pines the rocky terrain was dominated by two high hills near the islands center it was on one of these hills that they hoped to find the old monastery and if eartas information was accurate the occupants of the zvernec island graveyard including the late bishop besim mala as was normal for sam and remi they were traveling far and jumping through a lot of hoops based on a big if such was the life of professional treasure hunters theyd learned during their years of searching as they neared the shore the waves got choppy crashing on jutting rocks and halfsubmerged coquina flats the plastic kayaks performed admirably bouncing off the rocks and skidding over shoals until sam and remi were able to half paddle half push themselves into the shallows where they climbed out and waded ashore they crouched down to catch their breath and survey their surroundings the rockstrewn beach was barely deeper than their kayaks were long and was backstopped by a fourfoottall rock wall beyond this wall a steep hill dotted with green scrub halfway up the hill a garagesized structure was built into the hillside pillbox sam whispered higher up the hill stood what looked like a stone shacka lookout post perhapsand higher still a hundred yards away on the crest of the hill was a threestory brick barracksstyle building black glassless window openings stared out over the sea after five minutes of looking and listening sam whispered nobody home anything catch your eye no i dont see any graffiti sam remarked does that mean something if i were a kid living in vlore i doubt i could resist sneaking out here while it wasnt my thing as a teenager i knew plenty of guys who wouldve spraypainted the hell out of that pillbox just to prove theyd been here remi nodded so either albanian youth are particularly lawabiding or nobody who sneaks over here stays free long enough to make mischief sam finished sazan island albania under the light of a halfmoon they began slogging their way up the hill road though the crest was only a crows flight mile away and a few hundred feet higher than the barracks the roads serpentine path doubled the actual distance finally they reached the last bend in the road once around it they spotted the crest of the hill sam gestured for remi to wait then ducked off the road and picked his way through the scrub brush until he could see over the crest he gave her an all clear wave and she joined him she said the promised land a promised land thats seen much better days sam replied though before leaving for the peninsula theyd studied the structure on google earth the overhead view had shown the church as merely an unremarkable crossshaped building now up close they could see a conical belfry tall boardedup windows and a oncered tiled roof bleached pink from centuries of sunlight they found the main double doors locked so they circled the church on the north side they found two items of interest a waisthigh ragged hole in the brick wall and an unrestricted view of the northern half of sazan including the park rangers station half a mile below situated on a manmade breakwater cove illuminated by polemounted lights sam and remi counted three boats and three buildings remi said lets find bishop mala and get out of here sazan island albania as soon as they ducked through the hole in the wall they realized their task was going to be much harder than theyd anticipated instead of stepping into an open space they found themselves standing in a labyrinth on either side and ahead of them eroding wooden coffins were stacked eight high and four deep forming a corridor that was barely wider than their shoulders headlamps illuminating the way they walked to the end of the corridor they found themselves at a tturn to the left and right more coffins are you keeping count sam whispered a hundred ninetytwo so far the zvernec graveyard isnt that big it is if they were packing them shoulder to shoulder and stacking them we know mala died in even if his was the first burial we could be talking about fiveplus centuries i just got a shiver down my spine left or right remi chose left they walked a few paces ahead sams headlamp washed over an exterior brick wall dead end he said was that a pun freudian slip they turned around and with remi in the lead proceeded past the tturn and down the adjoining corridor at the end of this a right turn followed by another sixtyfour coffins followed by a left turn and more coffins the pattern continued through another five turns until the body count exceeded six hundred at last they entered an open space here the coffins were also stacked eight high all the way to the vaulted ceilings crossbeams sam and remi turned in a circle headlamps sweeping over walls of white pine there sam said suddenly on the western wall behind a mountain of rotting pine was a row of stone sarcophagi fourteen remi said the same as the number of mausoleums in the graveyard thats a bit of good luck sam replied he counted the coffin wall behind the sarcophagi unbelievable he murmured remi there are over a thousand corpses in this building earta must have been mistaken after the storm and flood they must have taken all the bodies zvernec isnt so much a graveyard as it is a charnel pit theres no smell according to selma the last burial was in even with embalming theres probably little flesh left sam smiled and sang softly dem bones dem bones dem dry bones dont give up your day job lets check for markings malas mausoleum bore a huge patriarchal cross maybe they did the same for his sarcophagus a quick check of the end of each sarcophagus showed no crosses sam and remi walked along the row using their headlamps to peer on the top of each stone coffin of the fourteen three had been chiseled with the eastern orthodox church symbol they sat together on the floor and stared at it remi asked how heavy do you think each one is four five hundred pounds then after a moment but the lid thats a different story crowbar pardon remi asked with a smile she was used to her husbands cerebral non sequiturs they were his way of working through problems we forgot a crowbar that lid weighs a hundred pounds at most but prying open that seam while the sarcophagus is wedged in there damn i knew i had that were forgetting something important feeling luckily you have a plan sam nodded luckily i have a plan having long ago learned the universal value of three itemsrope wire and duct tapesam and remi rarely went into the field without them even when the specific task or journey didnt obviously call for any of them this time in a hurry to beat nightfall theyd forgotten one of the trio in addition to the crowbar wire the fiftyfoot coil of climbing rope and the duct tape would be enough sam hoped it took only a few minutes of scrabbling over the churchs crossbeams before they found what they needed a loose l bracket after twisting it free sam used his body weight to smash it closed over the ropes center point next he crawled over the sarcophagus and wriggled the bracket into the rear seam beneath the lid then grasping the rope like reins he tugged until the l bracket was firmly seated in place finally he and remi tossed the ends of the rope over a beam and used their combined body weight to slowly take up the slack until the far end of the lid began rising ive got it remi said through clenched teeth taking sams end go ahead sam hurried forward bent over the lid and slipped his fingers under its near side he leaned backward and straightened his legs the lid popped up and slid free between his legs the l bracket popped free with a metallic twang together they stepped around the lid and leaned forward their headlamps panning over the sarcophaguss contents bones bones and more bones remi said and not a glint of gold in sight sam replied one down two to go though neither of them voiced the worry sam and remi both had the gut feeling that whichever sarcophagus they chose next it too would be the wrong choice similarly neither of them dared acknowledge the nagging voice of doubt in the back of eachs headthat fatherbishop besim mala had not been faithful to the king of mustangs request and that the second theurang disk had been long ago discarded or lost along with the golden man and if jack karna were right the location of shangrila thirty minutes and a second sarcophagus lid later they found themselves staring at a second set of bones and a second strikeout ninety minutes after they entered the church they slid back the lid of the third and final sarcophagus exhausted sam and remi sat before it and took a minute to catch their breath ready sam said not really but lets get it over with replied remi on hands and knees they crawled forward went on either side of the stone lid and after taking a deep breath peeked over the edge into the sarcophagus from the blackness a sliver of gold winked back at them sofia bulgaria shortly after dawn exhausted but triumphant they were back on the peninsula and on their way to the hotel in vlore having already expressed to selma concern over shipping the theurang disk back to san diego via standard means sam and remi found their chief researcher had predictably made alternative arrangements rube haywood their old cia friend had given her the name and address of a reliable and discreet courier service in sofia whether the service was somehow affiliated with his employer rube declined to say but the sign over the buildings door which read sofia academic archivist services ltd told sam all he needed to know itll be there no later than noon tomorrow local time sam told remi you have directions for me remi smiled and held up her ipad plugged in and ready to go sam put the fiat into gear and pulled out when they got to within a half mile of their destination remis ipad became unnecessary signs in both cyrillic and english led them down vasil levski street then past the parliament building and the academy of sciences then into the plaza encircling sofias religious heart the alexander nevsky cathedral the crossdomed basilica dominated the square its goldplated central dome rising a hundred fifty feet above the street and its bell tower twentyfive feet above that reading from her downloaded tourist guide remi said twelve bells at a total weight of twentyfour tons ranging in weight from twenty pounds to twentyfour thousand pounds impressive sam replied following the flow of vehicles around the cathedral and deafening i would imagine they circled the treelined square twice before sam pulled onto a side street and found a parking spot their stop at alexander nevsky cathedral would merely be a launching pad they both knew while both selma and karna agreed that bishop arnost deniv had died in sofia in neither had been able to find any details about his final resting place they hoped the head librarian at alexander nevsky would be able to point them in the right direction they got out and walked into the square following the stream of locals and tourists to the cathedrals west side where they mounted the steps headed toward the massive wooden doors as they approached a blond woman with a bobbed haircut smiled at them and said something in bulgariana question based on the inflection they caught the word english assumed the gist of the query and repeated english welcome to alexander nevsky cathedral how may i help you she said we would like to speak with the head of your library replied remi library the woman repeated oh you mean archivist yes i am sorry there is no archivist here sam and remi exchanged puzzled glances remi got out her ipad and showed the woman the pdf file selma had sent them a brief on bulgarias eastern orthodox church remi pointed out the passage and the woman read it her lips moving silently ah she said sagely this is old information you see that person now works in the palast of the synode the woman pointed to the southeast at a building surrounded by a copse of trees it is there you go there and they will help and what is the synode asked sam the woman slipped into tourguidespeak the synode is home to a group of metropolitans or bishops who in turn elect patriarchs and similarly important officials of the bulgarian orthodox church the tradition of the synode goes back to the days of the apostles in jerusalem with that the woman smiled and tilted her head as if to ask is there anything else sam and remi thanked the woman turned around and walked to the palast once inside and standing before the lobby information desk they explained the reason for their visitresearch for a book on the history of the eastern orthodox churchand they were told to be seated after an hour a blackrobed priest with a long saltandpepper beard appeared and escorted them to his office where it quickly became clear he spoke little english and sam and remi even less bulgarian an interpreter was summoned they repeated their story then produced the publishers letter of introduction wendy had created for them using photoshop the priest listened intently as the interpreter read the letter and he sat back and stroked his beard for a full minute before answering i am afraid we cannot help you the interpreter said for him the records you seek are not kept at the palast the person you spoke with at the cathedral was mistaken does he know where we might look next sam said the interpreter put the question to the priest who pursed his lips stroked his beard a bit more then picked up the phone and spoke to someone on the other end after some back and forth he hung up the translator told sam and remi personnel records for that period are housed in the sveta sofia im sorry the hagia sophia church and where would we find that asked remi directly east of here the translator replied one hundred meters on the other side of the square sam and remi were there ten minutes later where they again waited this time for a mere forty minutes before being ushered into yet another priests office this one spoke english very well so they had their answer in short order not only was the guide at alexander nevsky cathedral mistaken but the priest at the palast of synode was as well records prior to the first bulgarian exarch antim i who reigned until the outbreak of the russoturkish war in are maintained in the methodius sam and remi looked at each other took a breath and asked what exactly is the methodius why its the national library of bulgaria and where would we find it just east of here opposite the national gallery of foreign art two hours after leaving their car sam and remi found themselves back standing beside it and standing across the street from the bulgarian national library without realizing it theyd parked ten paces from their ultimate destination or so they thought this time after a mere twenty minutes with a librarian they learned that the methodius had no record of a metropolitan named arnost deniv dying in the early fifteenth century after apologizing the librarian left them sitting alone at a reading table our shell game with the coffins on sazan is starting to feel like a cakewalk sam said this cant be the end remi said we know arnost deniv existed how can there be no record of him from the table beside theirs a smooth basso voice said the answer my dear is there are several arnost denivs in the history of the bulgarian orthodox church and most of them lived prior to the russoturkish war sam and remi turned and found themselves looking at a silverhaired man with twinkling green eyes he gave them an easy open smile and said apologies for eavesdropping not at all remi replied the man said the trouble with the library is theyre in the middle of digitizing their records they havent fully crossreferenced the catalog consequently if your request is not painstakingly specific you miss the mark were open to any and all advice sam said the man gestured for them to move to his table once they were seated and he had restacked the books piled around him he said as it happens im working on a little history myself of the eastern orthodox church asked remi the man smiled knowingly among other things my interests are eclectic i suppose you could say interesting that our paths would cross here sam said studying the mans face truth is stranger than fiction i believe this morning while i was researching the ottoman rule of bulgaria i came across the name arnost deniva metropolitan from the fifteenth century remi replied but the librarian said there was no she said they had no record of a metropolitan by that name dying during that period the book in which i found him hasnt been digitized yet you see when the ottoman empirewhich was devoutly muslimconquered bulgaria thousands of clergy were killed often those who survived were demoted or exiled or both this was the case with arnost deniv he was quite influential and this worried the ottomans in after returning from missionary work in the east he ascended to the level of metropolitan but four years later he was demoted and exiled under pain of death he was ordered by the ottomans to restrict his ministrations to the village in which he died two years later and let me guess sam said the ottomans did their best to destroy much of the eocs history during that period correct the man said as far as many of the history texts of that time are concerned arnost deniv was never more than a lowly priest in a tiny hamlet then you can tell us where hes buried asked remi not only can i tell you that but i can show you where all his worldly possessions are on public display sofia bulgaria their benefactors instructions were simple drive ten miles north to the town of kutina in the foothills of the stara planina mountains find the kutina cultural history museum and ask to see the deniv exhibit they pulled into kutina shortly after one in the afternoon and stopped at a cafe for lunch using cobbledtogether phrases sam and remi were able to get directions to the museum by the way sam said as he opened the fiats drivers door did you get that mans name for the life of me i cant remember with her own door half open remi paused her brows furrowed thats funny neither can i something that began with a c i think sam nodded yes but was that his first name or his last name or both having seen more than their fair share of eastern orthodox churches sam and remi were relieved to find the museum was located in an old butter yellow farmhouse overlooking the iskar river on either side of the structure was lush green horse pasture they parked in the museums gravel turnaround got out and climbed the porch steps in the front doors mullioned window was a universal be back at clock sign but in cyrillic the hands were pointed at twothirty twenty minutes sam said they sat down on the porch swing and rocked back and forth chatting and killing time a light rain began to fall pattering on the roof above remi asked why dont we have one of these its relaxing we do sam replied i bought it for you for arbor day four years ago sam liked to surprise his wife with gifts on obscure holidays i havent had the time to put it together yet ill move it to the top of my to do list remi hugged his arm oh thats right arbor day are you sure it wasnt groundhog day no we were in ankara on groundhog day are you sure i could have sworn ankara was in march at an old green bulgaralpine coasted into the turnaround and pulled to a stop on the lawn a lanky woman in granny glasses and a beret climbed out saw them on the porch and waved sdrawei she called sdrawei sam and remi replied in unison hi there and do you speak english were two phrases they tried to commit to memory whenever they visited a new country sam now used the second phrase as the woman started up the porch steps she replied yes i speak english my sister she lives in americadearborn michigan america she teaches me over the internets i am sovka sam and remi introduced themselves sovka asked you have come to see the museums yes said remi good then follow in please sovka unlocked the front door and stepped inside sam and remi followed the interior smelled of old wood and cabbage and the walls were painted in a similar tone as the exterior faded butter yellow after hanging up her coat in the foyer closet the woman led them into a small office in the converted front room what brings you to this museums the woman asked sam and remi had discussed their approach on the way to kutina and had decided on directness were interested in father arnost deniv someone at the bulgarian national library in sofia suggested you might have some artifacts related to him sovkas eyes widened the methodius they know about our museums at the methodius in sofia remi nodded indeed they do oh i will be putting this into our soon news flyer paper what a proud moment for us to answer question no you are mistaken we do not have some of father denivs personal matters we have all of his personal matters here may i ask why are you interested with him sam and remi explained their book project and sovka nodded solemnly a dark time for the church good that you are writing about it come they followed sovka out of the office down the hall then up a set of switchback steps to the second floor here the walls had been torn down turning what looked like a thousand square feet of bedrooms into an open space sovka led them to the southeast corner of the house where a cluster of glass display cases and hanging tapestries had been arranged to form an alcove ceiling pot lights shone down on the cases remi saw it first followed a moment later by sam do you see i do he replied sovka asked over his shoulder pardons me nothing remi replied even from ten feet away the curved edge of gold seemed to leap out at them from the case near the wall hearts pounding sam and remi stepped into the alcove there on the top shelf resting on a folded jetblack cassock trimmed in burnt orange was the theurang disk sovka spread her arms with a flourish and said welcome to the deniv collections everything in his possessions at the time of death is here sam and remi tore their eyes from the disk and looked around in all there were perhaps twenty items most of it clothing grooming tools writing instruments and a few scraps of correspondence mounted in shadow boxes whats this item here remi said as casually as possible sovka looked at the theurang disk we are not to be certain we believe it is a keepsake of sorts perhaps from within his missionary quest in savage lands its fascinating sam said leaning closer well just have a look around if you dont mind of course i am over here if help is needed sovka wandered off but never strayed out of eyesight this complicates matters remi whispered to sam relieving besim mala of his theurang disk had been an easy decision here however arnost denivs disk was a part of recognized history breaking into the museum after hours would be easy enough they knew but neither sam nor remi felt good about that option lets confer with our experts remi suggested they told sovka they would be back shortly then stepped out onto the porch they dialed selma asked her to conference in jack karna then waited through two minutes of squelches and clicks as she made the appropriate connections once karna was on the line sam explained their situation remi asked jack what exactly do you need from the disks to make them compatible with the mural map is it the disk itself or the markings on it both i suspect is there any chance she would lend it to you doubtful sam replied this is her pride and joy and im worried that if we ask shell get suspicious right now shes helpful and cooperative we dont want that to change selma asked jack how similar in size and shape are the disks from my research i would say nearly identical youll know for sure when you compare the one sam and remi just sent you with the one you retrieved from the chest remi said selma what are you thinking too early to say mrs fargo but if youll all hold for a bit the line clicked and went silent true to her word selma was back in three minutes i can build one she said without preamble well not me but i have a friend of a friend who can replicate one with toolanddie cadcam precision if we supply him with enough of the right kind of pictures he can model the missing disk sam said i assume you have a specifications list sending it to you right now after securing sovkas agreement to let them photograph the deniv collection in return for a small donation to the museums new roof fund sam and remi drove back to sofia and following both selmas directions and her shopping list they collected what they needed two professionalquality trianglescale rulers a lazy susan turntable a black inchhigh display stand on which the disk could rest and lights and a tripod for remis camera they were back in kutina by four and shooting thirty minutes after that careful to pay the right amount of attention to every artifact in the collection lest sovka become too interested they photographed each in turn leaving the theurang disk for last having become bored with the process sovka had disappeared into her downstairs office this would be much easier if we were unscrupulous sam observed think of it as good karma besides who knows what the penalty for historical artifact theft is in bulgaria both valid points with the light box erected and white linen backdrop in place sam set up the lights according to selmas instructions once done remi placed the display stand on the turntable then the disk flat on the stand finally the scaled rulers were put in place forming an l around the disk after taking a series of test shots and making some adjustments to the camera remi began shooting five pictures for each eightdegree turn of the turntable for a total of fortyfive turns or two hundred twentyfive pictures in all they repeated the process for the disks opposite side then shot another series with it standing upright on its stand then last a series of closeups of the disks twin faces concentrating on the symbols eight hundred pictures remi said straightening up from her tripod how big is the file remi checked her cameras lcd screen wow eight gigabytes far too big for standard email i think i know how we can get around that sam replied lets pack up and get going after a quick call to selma who in turn called rube who in turn called his friends at the sofia academic archivist services ltd sam and remi found the office open when they arrived back in sofia at sixthirty as with his first visit sam was asked only to identify himself and offer a code phrasethis one different than the firstbefore he was led to an adjoining office and a computer terminal the offices highspeed internet line made short work of the picture files uploading them to selmas storage site in less than three minutes sam waited for the confirmation message then returned to the fiat and remi where to now she asked sam hesitated frowned theyd been moving so fast since arriving in kathmandu theyd had no chance to consider the question sam said i vote we go home and regroup seconded goldfish point la jolla california great thanks well look for him selma hung up the phone and turned to the group gathered around the maple worktable sam remi pete and wendy selma said that was george the theurang disk model is done hes sending it over by bike messenger cant wait to see what eight hundred photos look like in three dimensions remi said arriving home after their sofiafrankfurtsan franciscosan diego flight sam and remi had made their greetings then promptly went to bed for a blissful ten hours refreshed and their bodies mostly realigned with california time theyd met the team in the workroom for a getuptospeed meeting no matter how good the model is pete said it cant compare to the real thing resting in their formfitting black foam trays the two genuine theurang disks gleamed under the hard glare of the halogen pendant lights in looks yes sam replied but in utility value as long as it helps point us where we need to go its golden to me selma asked do you believe any of it which parts the prophecy jacks theory about the theurang being an evolutionary missing link shangrila all of it remi answered well jack admitted it himself we only have drawings of the theurang and theres no telling how much theyre based on myth and how much on direct observation i do think his argument is compelling enough that we should see this through to the end sam nodded his agreement as for shangrila a lot of legends are based on a kernel of truth in modern popular culture shangrila is synonymous with paradise for the people of mustang it may have been nothing more than where the theurang was originally foundand where it should rightfully be laid to rest place names are trivial its the meaning we attach to them that counts sam thats almost poetic remi said he smiled i have my moments the intercom buzzed selma answered it then walked out she returned a minute later carrying a cardboard box she opened the box examined the contents then removed them she placed the modeled theurang disk on the foam tray the disk was nearly indistinguishable from its mates im impressed sam said good call selma thank you mr fargo should we call jack in a bit first though i think its time we touch base with king charlie id like to get him riled enough to talk what do you mean asked wendy depending on how reliable his sources in mustang are he may believe his plan to drown us in the kali gandaki succeeded lets see if we can rattle his cage selma can you get me a secure line on the speaker here yes mr fargo one moment soon the line clicked open and began ringing charlie king answered with a gruff king here good morning mr king said sam sam and remi fargo here hesitation then a boisterous morning to you too havent heard from you for a while i was gettin a bit worried you two were renegin on our deal which deal is that i got your friend released now youre gonna turn over to me what youve found youre experiencing a case of wishful memory charlie the deal was that wed meet with russell and marjorie and reach an understanding well dammit son whatd you think that meant i give you alton and you give me what i want remi said weve decided youre in breach of contract charlie whatre you talkin about were talking about the bogus tour guide you hired to kill us in mustang i did no such sam interrupted difference without a distinction you ordered your children or your wife to get it done you think so huh well go ahead and prove it i think we can do better than that sam replied beside him remi mouthed what sam shrugged and mouthed back im playing it by ear king said fargo i been threatened by tougher and richer men than you i hose their blood off my boots just bout everyday how bout you just give me what i want and well part company friends its too late for thatthe friends part that it as for the prize youre afterthe prize your father spent most of his adult life hunting forweve got it its sitting right in front of us bull mind your manners and we might send you a picture first though why dont you explain your interest in it how bout you tell me what you think you found a wooden chest shaped like a cube in the possession of a soldier whod been dead for half a millennium or so king didnt respond immediately but they could hear him breathing on the line finally in a hushed tone he said you really have it we do and unless you start telling us the truth were going to open it and see whats inside for ourselves no hold it right there dont go doin that tell us whats inside could be one of a couple things a big coinshaped thing or a bunch a bones either way they wont mean much to you then why do they mean so much to you none of your business from across the table selma standing behind her laptop held up an index finger sam said mr king can you hold for just a moment without waiting for a response pete reached over to the speakerphone and tapped the mute button selma said forgot to tell you ive been doing a little more digging into kings teen years i came across a blog written by a former reporter at the new york times the woman claims that during an interview with king three years ago she asked him a question he didnt like after staring daggers at her he terminated the interview two days later she was fired she hasnt been able to find a legitimate job in journalism since then king blackballed her remi asked what did she ask him she asked why in kings high school yearbook everyone referred to him by the nickname adolf thats it said sam thats all thats it wendy said we already know lewis king was a nazi in name only and charlie had nothing to do with any of it so why would kids being kids remi replied think about it lewis king was largely absent from charlies life from an early age on top of that everywhere charlie went he probably got teased mercilessly about his nazi roots it doesnt sound like much from our perspective but for a kid for a teenager sam this could be kings hot button back then he was a petulant child with no power now hes a petulant billionaire with more power than many heads of state sam considered this he nodded at pete who unmuted the phone apologies charlie where were we oh thats right the box you said it could contain a coin or some bones correct thats right and your father wanted them for what some obscure nazi occult ritual something himmler dreamed up with adolf shut up fargo your dad spent his life hunting for this how can you be sure he didnt have some ties to a secret postwar nazi organization im warnin you shut your mouth is that why you want the golden man charlie are you trying to finish what your goosestepping dad couldnt from the speaker came the sound of something heavy crashing down on wood followed by jumbled static kings voice came back on the line i aint no nazi the apple never falls far from the tree charlie heres how i think it happened your dad learned about the existence of the theurang during the expedition then after the war the family moves to america where he continues your nazi indoctrination in your twisted minds the theurang is some kind of holy grail lewis disappeared trying to find it but he taught you well youre not going to that bastard that idiot he traipses off leaving my mother back in germany then does the same damned thing when she gets here when my mom swallows a bottle of pills he dont even bother comin back for the funeral he killed her and he dont even have the decency to show up good ol eccentric lewis he dont give a damn what they say about him and he cant understand why itd bother me every day every damned day i had to listen to them whispering behind my back giving me that damned heil hitler all that and i still beat em beat em all i could buy and sell every single one of em now you think im after the golden man cause it meant so much to my dad you think im some kind of dutybound son what a joke when i get my hands on that thing im going to crush it into dust and if theres a god in heaven my dad will be watching king paused and let out a forced chuckle besides you two have been thorns in my paw since day one ill be damned if youre gonna take whats rightfully mine sam didnt respond immediately one look at remi told him they were of like minds for the child charlie king they felt absolute pity but king was no longer a child and his insane mission to exact revenge on his longdead father had cost people their lives sam said thats what this is a tantrum king youve murdered kidnapped and enslaved people youre a sociopath fargo you dont know what youre i know what youve done and i know what youre capable of doing before this is all over im going to make you a promise king not only are we going to make sure you dont get the golden man but were going to make sure you go to prison for what youve done fargo you listen to me i will kill sam reached out and hit the disconnect button the line went dead there was silence around the worktable then softly from selma well he sounds a tad peeved her gross understatement broke the tension they all broke out in laughter when it died away remi said the question is if we follow through on our promise will king end up in prison or a rubber room thisuli nepal colonel zhou had agreed to the latenight meeting partially out of curiosity partially out of necessity his arrangement with the strangefaced american zazhonghalfbreedshad thus far been lucrative but now that he knew their true identities and that of their father zhou was anxious to change the terms of their partnership what charles king was doing in nepal didnt bother zhou what annoyed him was how little he had charged them in handling fees as the americans say getting the fossils to lhasa and through customs was easy enough but finding and securing trustworthy distributors for such banned merchandise was far trickierand as of tonight much pricier a few minutes before midnight zhou heard the growl of an suv engine outside the two soldiers behind the colonel rose from their chairs and brought their assault rifles to the low ready position ive ordered them searched this time he told his men still do not let your guards down one of the exterior guards stepped across the threshold gave zhou a nod then disappeared a moment later marjorie and russell king stepped out of the darkness into the flickering glow of the kerosene lantern they were not alone a third figure a willowy grimfaced chinese woman stepped into the room the king childrens body language told zhou this new woman would be speaking for the trio and then he saw it the similarities in the eyes and nose and cheekbones mother and children zhou thought interesting he decided to play out the hand he rose from his seat at the trestle table and nodded respectfully at the woman shall i call you mrs king no hsu zhilan hsu please sit down zhilan took the bench her hands folded neatly on the table before her the king children remained standing mirroring the atattention posture of colonel zhous soldiers zhou sat down to what do i owe the pleasure he asked my husband requires something of you does he yes first he requires that you understand this we know that your name is not zhou and you are not a colonel in the peoples liberation army your name is in fact is feng and you are a general general feng felt like his stomach had turned to a block of ice it was an act of will to keep the panic from showing on his face is that so it is we know everything about you including all of your other illicit activities smallarms dealing heroin smuggling and so on we also know who in your chain of command is an ally of yours and who is an enemy in fact my husband is on quite good terms with a certain general named gou do you know the name feng swallowed hard he felt his world crumbling around him he managed a barely perceptible i do general gou is not fond of you is he no have i made my point zhilan hsu asked you have lets talk about our partnership my husband in fact is pleased with the services you have provided and would like to offer you a fifteen percent increase on all transactions thats very generous my husband is aware of that he also asks a favor of you even as the words were leaving his mouth feng was cursing himself a favor suggests no compensation zhilans hard obsidian eyes stared at feng for a few moments before answering i misspoke perhaps task is a better word of course he is happy to compensate you in the amount of two hundred thousand us dollars but only if you succeed feng struggled to keep the smile from his face of course that is only fair whats the nature of this task there are peopletwo of them to be specificwho are threatening our business interests here we expect that they will be traveling along the border in the coming weeks perhaps even crossing into the tar zhilan said referring to the tibet autonomous region we want you to intercept them you will need to be more specific captured and held for us or killed i will give you the order when the time comes how close to the border will they be traveling in some places less than a few miles the border is many hundreds of miles long how would one find two individuals in all of that dont be obtuse zhilan said her voice taking on a harder edge you have under your command fourteen harbin z helicopters equipped with infrared radars nightvision cameras and missiles both antiair and antitank feng sighed you are extraordinarily well informed your command also maintains seventynine observation posts along the border is this also correct yes we suspect the people will have to use a helicopter to transit some of the more remote areas there are a limited number of charter companies in nepal that offer such services in order to make your task easier we will be monitoring these companies then why not intercept these people before they board we will allow them to complete their mission before you take action against them what is their mission they are looking for something we want them to succeed what are they looking for you do not need to know that general i have explained what is required of you i have given you all the information you need to make a decision so decide please i accept i will need information on the targets zhilan reached into the front pocket of her parka and withdrew an sd card she slid it across the table to feng then stood up make sure you are ready when i call jomsom nepal acutely aware that in charles king theyd enraged a lion that had thus far only been annoyed sam and remi had instructed selma to find them an alternate route to mustang everyone involved knew the theurang was somewhere in the himalayas and king now knew that the fargos possessing a significant lead in the race would have to return to nepal sam and remi had no doubt that russell and marjorie king along with their mother zhilan hsu would be on the lookout for them only time would tell what other forces king would bring to bear but they intended to walk very carefully until this odyssey was over a series of marathon flights eventually took them to new delhi india where they drove two hundred fifty miles southeast to the city of lucknow where they picked up a singleengine charter flight another two hundred miles northeast to jomsom theyd left the trekkers hub less than a week earlier and as the planes wheels squealed on the airstrip tarmac both sam and remi felt a sense of deja vu this sensation was only heightened as they headed for the terminal amid throngs of trekkers and guide service reps vying for their business as jack karna had promised they slipped through customs unmolested or questioned waiting for them at the curb outside the terminal was another blast from the past a nepali man standing beside a white toyota land cruiser and holding a sign bearing their name i think youre looking for us sam said extending his hand the man shook both their hands i am ajay mr karna asked me to tell you selmas newest fish is called a apistogramma iniridae have i pronounced that correctly you have remi replied and its name is frodo in their lengthy discussions selma and jack karna had discovered they were both avid fans of the lord of the rings trilogy yes okay ajay asked with a smile okay sam replied lead on not surprisingly ajay was not only a better tour guide than their previous one but he was also a better driver negotiating the kali gandakis innumerable twists turns and hazards with expertise a mere eight hours after leaving jomsom they were standing before jack karnas door in lo monthang he greeted them each with a warm hug hot tea and scones were ready and waiting in the cushioned seating area once they were settled and had warmed themselves sam and remi retrieved the theurang disks and placed them on the coffee table before karna for a full minute he simply stared at them eyes agog and a half smile on his face finally he picked up each disk in turn examining it carefully he seemed only slightly less impressed by the model aside from the symbols its almost identical to the genuine article isnt it your selma she is quite a woman i must say remi gave sam a sideways glance and smile her womans intuition had told her there was a bit of spark growing between selma and jack sam had dismissed the idea now he gave her a nod of recognition shes one of a kind sam said so you think these will work i have no doubt to that end ajay will be taking us to the caves tomorrow morning with any luck by the end of the day we will have found a match from there it will simply be a matter of following the map to shangrila nothing is ever that simple remi said trust us karna shrugged as you say he poured them more tea and passed around the plate of scones now tell me more about selmas love of tea and tropical fish they were up before dawn the next morning for a full english breakfast served by karnas houseboy streaky bacon eggs black pudding grilled tomatoes and mushrooms fried bread sausages and seemingly bottomless mugs of tea when they could take no more sam and remi pushed away their plates is this your regular morning fare remi asked karna of course how do you stay trim sam said lots of hiking not to mention the cold and the altitude you burn calories at a massive rate here if i dont consume at least five thousand a day i start shedding weight perhaps you should start a fitness boot camp remi suggested theres a thought karna said standing up he clapped his hands and rubbed them together right ten minutes until departure ajay will meet us at the gate true to his word karna was ushering them out the door a few minutes later and soon they were in the land cruiser heading southeast toward the foothills two miles out of the city as they topped a crest the landscape began to change dramatically the rolling hills steepened and their outline grew more jagged the soil slowly morphed from grayish to an olive brown and what little scrub brush dotted the terrain grew even more sparse the land cruiser began jostling from side to side as ajay navigated the now boulderstrewn tract soon sam and remis ears began popping from the front seat karna said there are two cases of bottled water in the cargo boot make sure to stay hydrated the higher we go the more fluid youll need sam grabbed two pairs of bottles handed one to remi and two to karna in the front seat then asked karna how far from the tibetan border are we seven miles or so try to remember along with most of the rest of the world we may think of it as the tibetan border but the chinese do not its a distinction they zealously enforce the official name may be the tibet autonomous region but as far as beijing is concerned its all china in fact if you keep a sharp eye out youll begin to see outposts on the ridges we may even encounter a patrol or two a patrol sam repeated as in the chinese army yes both ground units and aircraft routinely wander into mustang and not by accident they know nepal can do nothing but lodge a formal complaint which means nothing to the chinese and what happens if someone strays over their side of the border a lost trekker for example depends on the place between here and the northern tip of myanmar there are almost two thousand miles of border much of it over remote and rugged terrain as for here on rare occasions the chinese not so politely shoo wayward souls back across the border but usually interlopers are arrested i know of three trekkers in the last year who were snatched up in the drivers seat ajay silently held up four fingers karna said i stand corrected four trekkers all but one of them was eventually released have i got that right ajay right define eventually remi said a year or so the one they kept has been missing for six years the chinese are keen on setting examples you see letting an invader go too early would be bad form next thing you know youve got hordes of western agents disguised as trekkers flooding over the border is that how they really see it asked sam some in the government do but i suspect its mostly for show there are swaths along chinas southern border that are impossible to cover from the ground so china is strict on what areas it can control i have it on good authoritykarna gave a comical jerk of his head toward ajaythat trekkers in northern india frequently slip across the border in fact there are tourism companies that specialize in it isnt that right ajay right mr karna not to worry fargos ajay and i have been doing this together for years our gps unit is perfectly calibrated and we know this area intimately we wont be stumbling into the clutches of the chinese army i can assure you another hours drive brought them to a gorge hemmed in by cliffs so deeply eroded they looked like tiered rows of massive anthills ahead was a castlelike structure that appeared to be partially embedded in the cliff the ground floors outer walls were painted the same burnt red color theyd seen in lo monthang while the upper two stories stacked upon jutting horizontal beams were progressively smaller and seemed hewn from the rock itself faded prayer flags strung between two of the conical roofs flapped in the breeze tarl gompa karna announced weve heard that name several times remi said but the definition seems indefinable an accurate way of putting it in one sense gompas are fortifications of a sortoutposts for education and spiritual growth in another sense they are monasteries in yet another military posts much depends on the period of history involved and the people occupying the gompa how many of these are there in nepal alone over a hundred that i know of probably triple that number remain undiscovered if you expand the area to tibet and bhutan there are thousands why are we stopping at this one asked sam mostly out of respect wherever there are sacred caves a council of elders is formed to watch over them the caves here are not yet well known and the elders are very protective of them if we dont pay the proper respect well find ourselves staring down the barrels of about a dozen rifles they climbed out of the car in nepali karna called out toward the gompa and a few moments later an elderly man in khaki pants and a bright blue parka stepped from the darkened doorway his face was nut brown and deeply lined from beneath wiry eyebrows he scrutinized his guests for several seconds before breaking into a wide smile namaste jack the man called namaste pushpa tapaai laai kasto chha karnauer walked forward and the two men embraced and then began talking in low tones karna gestured toward sam and remi and they instinctively came forward ajay stopped them better if you wait here pushpa is a sgonyera doorkeeper mr karna is well known to these people but they are suspicious of outsiders karna and pushpa continued to talk for several minutes before the old man nodded and clapped karna on both arms karna walked back to the land cruiser pushpa has given us permission to proceed he will inform a local guide to meet us at the first caves inform the guide how remi asked i dont see any by word of foot karna replied he pointed to one of the rocky sharks teeth atop the opposite cliff there a figure was standing as they watched pushpa raised his arm and formed a sequence of shapes with his hand the figure signaled back then disappeared behind the cliff karna said by the time we get there all the locals will know to expect us and that we have permission in other words no angry villagers with pitchforks rifles sam corrected karna smiled reassuringly neither shall we go leaving tarl gompa in their rearview mirror they continued heading generally east following the gorge for two miles before emerging on a dry riverbed a quarter mile away across a bridge a collection of gompalike structures sat at the foot of another anthill cliff this one several hundred feet high and stretching to the north and south as far as the eye could see ajay guided the land cruiser over the river bottom to the bridge then across as they neared the village the terrain changed from scree and boulders to a fine rusty brown sand ajay halted the vehicle beside a low stone wall on the villages perimeter they all climbed out into a brisk wind sand pelted their jackets its got a bite to it doesnt it karna said sam and remi in the middle of pulling up their hoods nodded back sam called over the rush were walking from here yes into those karna pointed toward the anthills come on karna led them through a gap in the wall and started down a stonelined path at the end of this path they found a thick hedgerow of scrub brush he followed the hedge to the left then through a natural pergola they emerged in a small cobblestoned square centered around a bubbling fountain around the perimeter planter boxes overflowed with red and purple flowers they divert a bit of the river for irrigation plumbing and fountains karna explained they love fountains its beautiful remi said it took little imagination to see how shangrila legends began here she thought in the middle of some of the bleakest terrain she and sam had ever encountered theyd found a tiny oasis the juxtaposition was pleasantly jarring seated nearby on a wooden bench was a short middleaged man in a plaid sweaterjacket and a baseball cap emblazoned with the chicago bears logo he raised a hand toward them and walked over karna and the man embraced and spoke for a bit before karna turned to introduce sam and remi namaste namaste the man said with smile karna said this is pushpa before they could ask karna added yes its more or less the same as the man at the gompa to us it sounds the exactly the same to them the inflection makes all the difference pushpa will lead us to the caves well take some tea with pushpa and then well get down to business jomsom nepal packs settled on their backs they retraced their footsteps past the land cruiser then followed pushpa along the wall first south then east around the village to the foot of the anthill cliffs i suddenly feel very small remi said over her shoulder to sam very upon their first seeing the cliffs both distance and the fantastical geology had combined to make them seem less than real as though it were a backdrop from a sciencefiction movie now with sam and remi standing in the anthills shadow they were simply aweinspiring at the head of the line pushpa had stopped waiting patiently until sam and remi finished gawking and taking pictures before setting out again ten more minutes of hiking brought them to a fissure in the rock that was barely taller than sam one by one they slipped through the opening and onto a tunnellike path over their heads the smooth rusty brown walls curved inward almost touching leaving only a sliver of distant blue sky above ever eastward the path zigzagged and spiraled until sam and remi had lost track of how far theyd traveled pushpa called a halt with a barked word behind them at the rear of the line ajay said now we climb how remi asked i dont see any handholds and we dont have any gear pushpa and his friends have made a way the sandstone here is very fragile standard pitons and rock screws cause too much damage ahead they could see pushpa and karna talking pushpa disappeared into an alcove on the left side of the cliff and karna picked his way back down the path to where sam and remi were standing pushpa is going up first he said followed by ajay then you remi followed by you sam ill bring up the rear the steps look daunting but theyre quite sturdy i assure you just go slow sam and remi nodded and then karna and ajay changed positions ajay stood at the head of the line neck craned backward for several minutes before he too stepped into the alcove and disappeared from view sam and remi stepped forward and looked up oh boy remi murmured yep sam agreed the steps karna had mentioned were in fact wooden stakes that had been pounded into the limestone to form a series of staggered hand and footholds the ladder rose a hundred feet up a chimneylike slot before curving out of sight behind a hanging wall of rock they watched ajay scramble over the rungs until they could no longer see him remi hesitated for only a moment then turned to sam smiled kissed him on the cheek and offered a cheerful see you at the top with that she mounted the first rung and started climbing when she was halfway up karna said over sams shoulder shes a dynamo that one sam smiled youre preaching to the choir jack much like selma then right right selma is unique once remi had rounded the bend sam started upward immediately he could feel the solidity of the rungs and after a few test movements to compensate for his packs weight he settled into a steady rhythm soon the walls of the chimney closed in around him what little sunlight had filtered its way to the path below dimmed to twilight sam reached the hanging wall and paused to peek around the bend twenty feet away above and to his left the rungs ended at a horizontal wooden plank nailed to a row of stakes at the end of this plank was a second this one angling behind another hanging wall remi was standing at the junction she gave him a wave and thumbsup when sam reached the plank he found it not nearly as narrow as it had looked from below he boosted himself onto the platform found his footing and walked toe to heel down the plank then around the corner four more planks brought him to a rocky shelf and an ovalshaped cave inside he found pushpa ajay and remi seated around a jetboil stove supporting a miniature teakettle the water had just started boiling when karna slipped into the cave entrance he sat down oh good tea wordlessly pushpa dug five red enamelware mugs out of his pack passed them out then poured the tea the group sat huddled together sipping the brew and enjoying the silence outside a gust of wind occasionally whistled past the entrance once everyone was finished pushpa deftly packed away the mugs and then they set off again this time with their headlamps on once again pushpa was in the lead while ajay brought up the rear the tunnel curved to the left then the right then stopped suddenly at a vertical wall straight ahead a chesthigh archway was carved out of the limestone pushpa turned and spoke with karna for a few seconds then karna told sam and remi pushpa understands that you are not buddhists and he understands that our work here may be a bit complicated so he wont ask us to observe all buddhist customs he only asks that when you first enter the main chamber you circle the perimeter once in a clockwise direction once youve done this you can move about as you please understood sam and remi nodded pushpa ducked through the archway and stepped to the left followed by remi sam and ajay they found themselves in a corridor painted on the wall before them were faded redandyellow symbols unfamiliar to sam and remi along with hundreds of lines of text in what they assumed was a dialect of lowa whispering karna told them this is a greeting of sorts essentially a historical introduction to the cave system nothing specific to the theurang or shangrila is all this natural or manmade remi asked gesturing to the walls and ceiling a bit of both actually at the time these caves were constructedabout nine hundred years agothe loba in this area believed that sacred caves were revealed by nature in their embryonic stage once the caves were found the loba could excavate them according to their spiritual will following pushpa the group continued down the corridor walking stooped over until they reached another arched entrance this one a few inches taller than sam over his shoulder karna said with a smile were here at first glance the main chamber seemed to be a perfect dome ten paces in diameter and eight feet high with the ceiling tapering to a rounded point the wall opposite the entrance was dominated by a mural that stretched around the chamber and from the floor to the domed ceiling unlike on the mural in the corridor the symbols text and drawings here were painted in vibrant shades of red and yellow the contrast against the mochacolored walls was startling its magnificent sam said remi nodding stared at the mural the detail jack why is the color so different here pushpa and his people have been restoring it the pigment they use is a longheld secret they wont even share it with me but pushpa assures me its the same recipe that was used nine centuries ago standing at the center of the chamber pushpa was gesturing toward them karna said to sam and remi lets make our circuit no talking head bowed karna led them clockwise around the space stopping again at the archway pushpa nodded to them and smiled then knelt by his pack he pulled out a pair of kerosene lanterns and hung one from a peg in each side wall soon the chamber was filled with an amber glow what can we do to help remi asked ill need the disks and some quiet the rest i must do myself sam dug the lexan case containing the theurang disks from his pack and handed it to karna armed with the disks a spool of string a tape measure a parallel rule an architects compass and a directional compass karna stepped up to the mural pushpa hurried forward carrying a roughhewn wooden step stool which he placed beside karna sam remi and ajay took off their packs and sat down their backs against the entrance wall for almost an hour karna worked without pause silently measuring symbols on the mural and jotting in his notebook occasionally he would step back stare at the wall while muttering to himself and pace back and forth finally he said something to pushpa who had been standing to one side hands clasped before him pushpa and karna knelt down opened the lexan case and spent a few minutes examining the theurang disks fitting them together with the flanged outer ring in various patterns before finding an apparently satisfactory configuration next pushpa and karna placed the disks over certain symbols measured distances with the tape measure and murmured to each other finally karna stepped back hands on hips and gave the mural a final onceover he turned to sam and remi selma tells me you two are fond of good newsbad news scenarios sam and remi smiled at each other sam replied selmas having a little fun at your expense she enjoys those us not so much go ahead anyway jack said remi the good news is we need go no further my hunch was correct this is the cave we needed fantastic said sam and actually its goodgoodbad news the second bit of good news is we now have a description of shangrilaor at least some signs that will tell us if were close now the bad news remi prompted the bad news is the map offers only the path that the sentinel dhakal would have taken with the theurang as i suspected it leads east through the himalayas but in all there are twentyseven points marking the path translation please said sam shangrila could be at any one of twentyseven locations stretching from here all the way to eastern myanmar kathmandu nepal are you sure you wont change your mind jack asked remi behind her on the dirt tarmac was a blueonwhite bell b longranger iii helicopter its engine whining as the rotors spun up for takeoff no my dear im sorry and apologies for abandoning you i have a hatehate affair with all flying contrivances the last time i flew back to britain i was under extreme sedation after leaving the cave complex the day before the group had returned to lo monthang to regroup and brainstorm their next move there was only one they knew follow dhakal the sentinels path east across nepal eliminating the locations karna had gleaned from the mural map the altitude and remoteness of the target areas left them only one transport optiona charter helicopter servicewhich in turn brought them back to kathmandu and into the lions den as it were with luck sam and remi would find what they needed within a few days before king could discover their route and if the kings follow our trail asked sam goodness didnt i tell you ajay here is exindian armyand a gurkha in fact quite the tough bloke hell look after me standing behind karnas shoulder ajay gave them a sharklike smile karna handed them the laminated map hed spent the previous night annotating ive managed to eliminate two points from todays search grid that are improbable both from summits that would have been covered in ice and snow at the time of dhakals journey karnas research into the real shangrila had led him to believe it was in a comparatively temperate location with regular seasons unfortunately the himalayan range was rife with such hidden valleys little slivers of neartropical paradise nestled amid the forbidding peaks and glaciers that leaves six targets to search karna finished ajays given your pilot the coordinates on the tarmac the bells rotors were accelerating karna shook their hands and shouted good luck well meet you back here this evening he and ajay trotted off to ajays land cruiser sam and remi turned and headed for the helicopter their first target lay thirtytwo miles northeast of kathmandu in the hutabrang pass their pilot a former pakistani air force flier named hosni took them directly north for ten minutes pointing out peaks and valleys and letting sam and remi get the lay of the land before veering east toward the coordinates hosnis voice came over their headsets entering the area now ill circle it clockwise and try to get as low as possible the wind shear can be treacherous here in the cabin behind hosni sam and remi each scooted sideways for a better view out the window remi said to sam eyes open for mushrooms aye captain karnas translation of the cave mural had offered a vague but hopefully useful description of shangrilas most prominent feature a mushroomlike rock formation as the mural predated flight the shape would likely only be recognizable from the ground exactly how large the formation was or whether shangrila was supposed to be on it in it or simply nearby the mural didnt specify sam and remi hopedassumed that the planners of the golden mans evacuation had chosen a formation large enough to stand out from its neighbors in anticipation of numerous landings and takeoffs they were paying hosni almost double his usual fee and had booked him for five days with a nonrefundable deposit for five more the bell passed over a forested ridge and hosni nosed over descending into the valley below three hundred feet over the treetops he leveled off and decreased his airspeed in the zone now he called binoculars raised sam and remi began their scan of the valley remi radioed remind me how accurate did jack say the coordinates were half a kilometer about a third of a mile that doesnt help me though adept at it remi was not a fan of math gauging distances especially vexed her about four hundred fifty yards imagine a standard running track got it imagine it sam that sentinel was required to hit each of these coordinates almost deadon a remarkable bit of orienteering sam agreed karna said it though these guys were the equivalent of todays green berets or navy seals they trained for this their whole lives hosni flew on dropping as close to the trees as he dared the valley which the bell traversed from end to end in less than two minutes yielded nothing sam ordered hosni to proceed to the next set of coordinates the morning wore on as the bell continued ever westward the going was slow though many of the coordinates were but a few miles apart the bells ceiling constraints forced hosni to skirt some of the higher peaks flying through alpine cols and passes that lay below sixteen thousand feet shortly after one in the afternoon as they were flying northwest to avoid a peak in the ganesh himal range hosni called we have company helo at our two oclock remi scooted over to sams side and they peered out the window at the aircraft who is it remi asked hosni called back pla air force a z wheres the tibetan border about two miles on the other side of them no worries they always send up eyes to watch helicopters out of kathmandu they are simply flexing their muscles anywhere else and that would be called an invasion sam observed welcome to nepal after a few minutes of paralleling the bell the chinese helicopter peeled away and headed north toward the border they soon lost sight of it in the clouds twice in the afternoon they asked hosni to land near a rock formation that looked promising but neither panned out as four oclock approached sam put a red grease pencil x through the last point on the days map and hosni headed for kathmandu the morning of the second day began with a fortyminute flight to the budhi gandaki valley northwest of kathmandu three of karnas coordinates for the day lay within the budhi gandaki which followed the western edge of the annapurna range sam and remi were treated to three hours of beautiful scenerythick pine forests lush meadows exploding with wildflowers jagged ridgelines churning rivers and tumbling waterfallsbut little else aside from a formation that from above looked mushroomlike enough to warrant a landing but turned out to be merely a topheavy boulder at noon they landed near a trekkers stop in a village called bagarchap and hosni entertained the local children with tours of the bell while sam and remi ate sack lunches soon they were airborne again and heading north through the bintang glacier and toward mount manaslu eightyone hundred meters high hosni called pointing to the mountain sam translated for remi about twentyfour thousand feet and five thousand less than everest hosni added its one thing to see these in pictures or from the ground remi said but from up here i can see why they call this place the rooftop of the world after lingering so remi could take some pictures hosni turned the bell west and descended into another glacierthe pung gyen hosni called itwhich they followed for eight miles before turning north again our friends are back hosni said over the headset right side sam and remi looked the chinese z was indeed back again paralleling their course this time however the helicopter had closed the gap to only a few hundred yards sam and remi could see silhouettes staring back at them through the cabin windows the z shadowed them for a few more miles then veered off and disappeared into a cloud bank next search area coming up in three minutes hosni called sam and remi got situated near the windows as had become routine hosni lifted the bells nose over a ridgeline then banked sharply into the target valley bleeding off altitude as he went he slowed the bell to a hover sam was the first to notice the valleys surreal landscape below while the upper slopes were thick with pine trees the lower reaches looked as if they had been carved by a rectangular cookie cutter leaving behind sheer cliffs plummeting into a lake jutting from the opposite slope and encircling one end was an icecovered plateau a runnel of churning water sliced through the shelf and cascaded to the waters below hosni how deep do you think this is sam asked the valley i mean from the ridgeline to the lake perhaps eight hundred feet the cliffs are half that at least said sam honsi eased the bell forward following the slope as sam and remi scanned the terrain through their binoculars as they drew even with the plateau and hosni came about they saw that the plateau was deceptively deep narrowing for a few hundred yards before ending at a towering wall of ice bracketed by vertical cliffs thats a glacier sam said hosni i didnt see this plateau on any maps does it look familiar no you are right this is relatively new you see the color of the lake the greenish gray yes said remi you see that after glacial retreat this section of the valley is less than two years old i would estimate climate change most definitely the glacier we passed earlierthe pung gyenlost forty feet last year alone pressed up against her window remi suddenly lowered her binoculars sam look at this he slid over to her side and peered out the window directly below them was what looked like a wooden hut half buried in a waisthigh ice shelf what in the world is that sam asked hosni i have no idea how close to the coordinates are we not quite a kilometer remi said sam thats a gondola pardon a wicker gondolafor a hotair balloon are you sure hosni set us down northern nepal hosni crabbed the bell sideways over the plateau until he found a spot he decided was solid enough to bear the helicopters weight then touched down once the rotors had spooled down sam and remi climbed out and donned their jackets caps and gloves hosni called step carefully there will be many crevasses in an area like this they waved their understanding and started across the plateau toward the object here wait hosni called they walked back he climbed out of the cockpit and stooped beside the tail storage compartment he removed what looked like a foldable tent pole and handed it to sam avalanche probe works as well with crevasses best to be safe thanks sam gave the probe a flick and it snaked outward the inner bungee cord snapping the sections into place nifty they set off again this time with sam probing as they walked the ice sheet that partially covered the plateau was rippled like waves frozen in place leftover they assumed by the glaciers slow grinding retreat up the valley the object in question lay near the far edge of the plateau sitting kittycorner to the rest of the plateau after five minutes of careful walking they stood before it im glad i didnt bet you sam said thats a gondola all right upside down that explains why it looked like a hut they dont make them like this anymore what in the world is it doing here no idea remi took a step forward sam halted her with a hand on her shoulder he probed the ice in front of the gondola found it solid then began poking around what should have been its sides theres more sam said they continued sidestepping left paralleling the gondola probing as they went until they reached the end sam frowned and said curiouser and curiouser remi asked how long is it roughly thirty feet thats impossible arent most maybe three feet by three feet more or less he slid the probe over the gondolas upturned bottom as far as he could reach nearly eight feet wide sam handed her the probe then knelt down and crawled forward hands sliding through the snow along the gondolas side sam be care his arm plunged into the snow up to his elbow he froze i cant be entirely sure he said with a grin but i think i found something he laid himself flat i got you remi replied she grabbed his boots sam used both hands to punch a basketballsized hole in the ice then poked his head inside he turned back to remi a crevasse very deep the gondolas half straddling it diagonally he took another peek through the hole then wriggled back away from the crevasse and pushed himself to his knees he said ive found the answer to how it got here how it flew theres rigging still attached to the gondolawooden stays some kind of braided cord i even saw what looked like a fabric of some sort the whole tangled mess is hanging in the crevasse remi sat down beside him and they stared at the gondola for a bit remi said a mystery for another time sam nodded absolutely well mark it and come back they stood up sam cocked his head listen faintly in the distance came the chopping of helicopter rotors they turned around trying to localize the sound standing beside the bell hosni had heard it too he stared up at the sky suddenly to their left an olive green helicopter popped over the ridgeline then dropped into the valley and turned in their direction on the aircrafts door was a fivepointed red star outlined in yellow the helicopter drew even with the plateau and slowed to a hover fifty feet from sam and remi nose cone and rocket pods pointed directly at them dont move sam said chinese army asked remi yes same as the z we spotted yesterday what do they want before sam could answer the helicopter pivoted revealing an open cabin door in it a soldier crouched behind a mounted machine gun sam could sense remis body go tense beside him he slowly grasped her hand in his dont run if they wanted us dead wed already be dead out of the corner of his eye sam saw movement he glanced toward the helicopter and saw hosni opening the side door a moment later he emerged in his hands was a compact machine gun he raised it toward the z hosni no sam shouted hosnis machine gun bucked and the muzzle flashed orange bullets peppered the zs windshield the helicopter banked sharply right then accelerated away skimming over the lakes surface toward the ridgeline where it banked again until its nose was again aimed at the bell hosni run sam shouted then to remi behind the gondola go remi spun into a sprint with sam close on her heels remi the crevasse sam called veer left remi did then pushed off with both legs diving headfirst onto the gondola sam hit it a moment later then pushed himself to his knees and helped remi onto the ice shelf they tumbled down the backside and landed in a sprawling heap from across the plateau they heard the chattering of hosnis machine gun sam stood up and peeked over the ice hosni was standing defiantly at the edge of the plateau firing at the oncoming z hosni get out of there the z stopped in a hover a hundred yards away sam saw a flash from the lefthand rocket pod hosni saw it as well he turned and began sprinting toward sam and remi faster sam shouted with a brilliant flash of light and a plume of smoke a pair of rockets burst from the zs pod in a split second they reached the bell one striking the ground beneath the tail the other slamming into the engine compartment the bell convulsed leapt upward then exploded sam ducked and threw himself over remi they felt the blast ripple through the plateau felt the ice crackle beneath them a wave of shrapnel pelted into the gondola and through the ice shelf a foot above their heads then silence sam said follow me and crawled down the length of the ice shelf to the end of the gondola on his belly he wriggled forward and peered around the corner the plateau was strewn with the shattered remains of the bell jagged chunks of the fuselage still rocking from the concussion sat amid a sheet of burning aviation fuel splintered lengths of rotor blade jutted from the snowbanks the z had retreated across the lake to the ridgeline where it hovered rocket pods still pointed menacingly at the plateau remi said do you see hosni im looking sam spotted him lying beside a ragged piece of the bells windshield the body was charred then sam spotted something else directly ahead of them twenty feet away was hosnis machine gun it looked intact he pulled back and faced remi hes gone never felt a thing oh no i spotted his machine gun i think i can reach it sam no you dont even know if it works wheres the z hovering probably radioing their base for instructions theyve already spotted us theyll be coming in for a closer look you cant hope to hold them off for long my guess is they want us alive otherwise they would be pounding this plateau with missiles why what are they after i have a hunch me too well compare notes later if were alive whats your plan they cant land not with all the debris so theyll have to hover above the plateau and fastrope soldiers down if i can catch them at the right moment maybe sam let his words trail off maybe he added whats your vote fight and perhaps die here or surrender and end up in a chinese prison camp remi smiled gamely you really have to ask half hoping half expecting the z would make a reconnaissance pass before putting men on the ground sam sent remi back along the ice shelf where she buried herself in the snow between a pair of drifts sam crouched beside the gondola and readied himself for what seemed like several minutes but was likely less than one sam listened for the sound of the z approaching when it came he waited until the chopping sound was deafening he risked a peek around the corner of the gondola the z had stopped in a hover just off the edge of the plateau and a few feet above it the helicopter slid sideways like a dragonfly waiting for its prey to appear in the side door sam could see the door gunner bent over the machine gun suddenly the z veered away and dropped out of sight below the plateau seconds later sam saw it streaking back across the lake sam didnt think but reacted scrambling from behind cover and running hunched over to hosnis gun he snatched it up and sprinted back to the gondola made it sam called to remi then began checking the machine gun the wooden stock was partially splintered and the fore stock charred by flames but the working parts seemed in order and the barrel unscathed he ejected the magazine thirteen rounds left remi called what are they doing either leaving or waiting for enough of the aviation fuel to burn off so they can come in for a fast rope the z reached the edge of the lake and swooped upward along the slope to the ridgeline sam watched fingers mentally crossed that the helicopter would keep going it didnt as had become its pattern the z banked over the ridge reversed course and came streaking back across the lake theyre coming back sam announced good luck sam mentally rehearsed his plan much would depend on whether the z presented him an open door as the soldiers prepared for their fastrope descent firing into the aircrafts fuselage was pointless hosnis attack had proven that what sam needed was a chink in the armor the rush of the zs engine drew nearer and the rhythmic chop of the rotors rattled sams eardrums he waited head down and watching the ice a few feet from the gondola wait wait snow began whipping across the ice sam peeked around the corner the z was hovering thirty feet above the plateau come on turn sam muttered just a little bit the z pivoted slightly bringing the door gunner around so he could cover the soldiers descent two thick black ropes uncoiled from the door and hit the ice the first pair of soldiers stepped up to the door sam could just make out the pilots seat diagonally behind them sam took a breath set his teeth he clipped the fire selector to single shot then ducked out in a crouch he brought the machine gun to his shoulder and took aim at the zs open doorway then shifted left placing the sight over the door gunners helmet he fired the gunner crumbled sam switched the fire selector to three round adjusted his aim again and fired a burst into the doorway hit one of the soldiers stumbled backward the other ducked and dropped to his belly sam now had a clear view of the pilots seatbut that would last only a second or two he knew even as he readjusted his aim he could see the pilots arms moving adjusting controls trying to make sense of the chaos around him sam focused on the seat back he took a breath let it out then pulled the trigger a trio of bullets peppered the zs interior sam pulled the trigger again then once more the machine gun let off an empty click the magazine was empty the z pitched sideways nose spiraling down and toward the plateau through the open cabin door the lifeless body of the door gunner slid out followed by a second soldier arms flailing for handholds two more soldiers tumbled through the door one managed to snag the zs landing skid but the other plummeted to the ground now fully out of control the pilotless z hit the plateau crushing the hanging soldier beneath it sam tore his eyes free ducked behind the gondola and sprinted to where remi was lying more shrapnel coming he shouted and dove on top of her two of the zs rotors struck the ice first shearing off and hurling away a quarter second before the fuselage struck pressed flat in the snow sam and remi waited for a fiery explosion but none came they heard a highpitched grinding sound followed by a trio of grenadelike whumps on impulse sam stood up and glanced over the gondola it took a full two seconds for his brain to register what he was seeing the z skidding hurtling toward him the mangled fuselage half sliding half lurching as the remaining rotor blades splintered on the ice and propelled it forward it looked like a crippled bug in the throes of death sam felt a hand clamp onto his with surprising strength remi jerked him back to the ground sam what do you think youre the z slammed into the gondola shoving it backward into sam and remi who began backpedaling feet scrabbling over the ice the gondola stopped moving the grinding thudthudthud of the helicopters skid continued for a few seconds then suddenly died save the stuttering coughs of the engine turbine that too stopped and sam and remi found themselves in perfect silence they got to their feet and peeked over the gondola well thats not something you see every day sam said drily northern nepal it took ten seconds for sam and remi to piece together the scene that lay before them after bouncing off the gondola the crippled z had reversed course and skidded toward the runnel that cut through the plateau where like a pinball caught in a groove it had slid to the edge of the plateau then overor partially over the zs tail a few inches narrower than the runnel itself had become lodged in the trough the helicopters cabin sat suspended over the edge water cascading over the fuselage and through the open cabin door we should see if anyones left alive remi prompted wary of the stillhot engine they picked their way over to the z sam knelt down beside the runnel and crawled on hands and knees to the edge the fuselage was crushed to half its height and the windshield was missing he could see nothing through the doorway so thick was the cascading water anyone in there he shouted hello sam and remi listened but heard nothing twice more sam called out but still there was no response sam stood up and rejoined remi he said lone survivors that sounds both wonderful and terrifying what now first we cant climb out of here and even if we managed to without getting injured were thirty miles from the nearest village between the subzero temperatures at night and no shelter wed have little chance for that matter we need to start thinking about surviving tonight cheery remi said go on we have no idea how long before karna declares us overdue and a search party is mounted and even more important we have to assume the z was in contact with its base after hosni opened fire when they dont make contact again and dont return the base will send another helicopter probably two any guesses on how soon worst case a matter of hours best case tomorrow morning if its the former we may have an advantage nightfalls coming itll make it easier for us to hide i need to get inside that thing what the z remi said sam thats a really bad idea i know but its got supplies we need and if were very lucky the radio may still work remi considered this for a few moments then nodded okay but first lets see what we can scrounge from the bells wreckage this took but a few minutes there was little of value left mostly charred bits and pieces from their packs including a halfshredded section of climbing rope a smattering of items from a firstaid kit and a few tools from the bells tool kit sam and remi picked up anything that could be of use whether recognizable or not hows the rope look sam asked kneeling beside their pile of supplies remi examined the rope itll need some splicing but i think weve got eighteen or twenty feet of usable line here youre thinking a belay for the z sam smiled nodded i may be a bit thick at times but theres no way im crawling onto that death trap without a safety line were going to need something pitonlike i may have just the thing testing the ground as she went remi moved off across the plateau and soon returned in one hand she was holding a shard of helicopter rotor in the other a fistsized rock she handed them to sam and said ill start on the rope sam used the rock to first smooth the edges of the shards upper half then to taper and sharpen the lower half once done he found a particularly thick patch of ice a couple paces from the edge of the plateau just to the right of the z next he began the painstaking process of hammering the makeshift piton into the ice when he finished the shard was buried a foot and a half in the ice and angled backward at fortyfive degrees remi walked over and they used their combined weight to wrench and pull the belay until confident it would hold remi uncoiled the spliced ropeinto which shed tied knots at twofoot intervalsand secured one end to the piton with a bowline knot after shedding his jacket gloves and cap sam used the loose end to fashion a rope seat with the knot tight against his lower back if this thing starts going over the edge get clear sam said dont worry about me ill be fine concentrate on you right do you hear me i hear you he said with a smile he kissed her then walked toward the zs upturned tail assembly after giving the aluminum side a few test shoves he climbed up and began crawling toward the cabin getting close remi called a couple more feet got it as he reached the edge of the plateau he slowed down testing each of his movements before continuing on aside from a few heartskipinducing creaks and groans the z didnt budge foot by foot he crawled forward until he was perched atop the zs belly hows it feel remi called on his hands and knees sam shifted his weight from side to side slowly at first then more vigorously the fuselage let out a shriek of tearing aluminum and shifted to one side i think i found its limits sam called you think so remi shot back keep moving right sam moved sideways until his hip was up against the landing skid he grasped this with both hands and leaned over the side as though looking for something what are you doing called remi im looking for the rotor mast there it is were in luck its jammed into the runnel weve got a bit of an anchor happy day remi said impatiently now get in there and get out sam gave her what he hoped was a reassuring grin after adjusting the rope so it ran straight back to the piton sam grasped the skids with both hands and lowered his legs down along the fuselage the spewing water immediately drenched his lower body sam groaned clenched his teeth against the cold then kicked his legs trying to gauge his position over the door im going in he called to remi sam kicked forward swung his legs backward then repeated the process until hed built up a steady rhythm at the right moment he let go the momentum carried him through the cascade and into the cabin where he slammed into the opposite door and landed in a heap on the floor he went still listening to the z groan around him a shudder coursed through the fuselage everything went still sam looked around trying to orient himself he was sitting in icy water up to his waist part of the flow was seeping out around the closed door the other part flooding into the cockpit and out through the shattered windshield a few feet away the body of a soldier lay lifeless sam eased forward until he could see between the cockpit seats the pilot and copilot were dead whether from his bullets or the impact or both he couldnt tell he could now see that the cockpit had suffered more damage than hed realized in addition to most of the windshield a section of the nose cone and dashboard including the radio was gone probably somewhere at the bottom of the lake by now the helicopter dropped beneath him sams stomach rose into his throat the movement stopped but now the helicopter was resting at an angle through the cockpit he could see the waters of the lake far below running out of time he turned around eyes darting around the cabin something anything he found a partially full green canvas duffel bag he didnt bother examining the contents but instead began snatching up loose items from inside the cabin paying little attention to what they were if they felt useful and would fit in the bag he took them he searched the dead soldier found a lighter but nothing else of use then turned his attention to the pilot and copilot he came away with a semiautomatic pistol and a kneeboard stuffed with paperwork out of the corner of his eye he spotted a halfopen hatch at the rear of the cabin he climbed up to it stuck his hand inside his fingers touched canvas he pulled the object free a lumbar pack he stuffed it into the duffel time to go he muttered then shouted through the door remi can you hear me her reply was muffled but understandable im here is the piton still the helicopter lurched again the nose tipped downward sam was now half standing on the pilots seat back is the piton still firm he shouted again yes hurry sam get out of there on my way sam zipped the duffel closed and shoved the looped handles down over his head so the bag was dangling from his neck he closed his eyes said a silent one two three then dove through the open door whether his shove off from the pilots seat was the cause sam would never know but even as he broke clear of the sheet of water he heard and felt the z going over he resisted the urge to look over his shoulder instead concentrating on the wall of rock rushing toward him he arched his head backward covered his face with both arms the impact was similar to slamming ones chest into a tackling dummy the duffel bag had acted as a bumper he realized he felt his body spinning bumping over the wall several times before he settled into a gentle swing above him remis face appeared over the edge her panicked expression switched to a relieved smile an exit worthy of a hollywood blockbuster an exit born of desperation and fear sam corrected he looked down at the lake the zs fuselage was slipping beneath the surface the rear half was missing sam looked left and saw the tail section still jutting from the runnel where the fuselage had torn free only ragged aluminum remained remi called climb up sam youre going to freeze to death he nodded wearily give me just a minuteor twoand ill be right with you northern nepal exhausted and shaking with adrenaline sam slogged his way up the rope until remi could reach over and help him the rest of the way he rolled onto his back and stared at the sky remi flung her arms around him and tried to hide her tears dont you ever do that again after a deep sigh she asked whats in the duffel a whole bunch of im not sure i was grabbing anything that looked useful a grab bag remi said with a smile she gently lifted the duffels handle over sams head she unzipped it and began rummaging inside thermos she said and brought it out empty sam sat up and donned his jacket cap and glove good ive got a mission for you take your trusty thermos and go scoop up every drop of unburned aviation fuel you can find good thinking sam nodded and grunted fire good remi slowly moved off and began kneeling beside depressions in the ice found some she called and here once she was done they met back at the gondola howd you do sam asked jogging in place his pants were beginning to stiffen with ice remi replied its about threequarters full the melted ice partially diluted it though we need to get you warmed up sam knelt by the pile of debris theyd collected from the bell and began sifting through it i thought i saw here it is sam held up a length of wire at each end was a key ring emergency chain saw he told remi thats an overly optimistic name for it sam examined the gondola walking down its length then back again its half tipped into the crevasse but i think ive found what we need he knelt beside the near corner of the gondola where a series of wicker stays had popped free as though threading a needle sam slipped one end of the saw through the wicker then out the other he grasped both rings and began sawing the first section took five minutes but now sam had an opening in which to work he kept sawing chunks from the end of the gondola until he had a goodsized stack we need flat rocks he told remi these they found in short order they fit the rocks together to form a hearth on top of this went the wicker chunks stacked in a pyramid while remi balled paper from the pilots kneeboard into kindling sam retrieved the lighter from the duffel soon they had a small fire going arm in arm they knelt before the flames the warmth washed over them almost immediately they felt better more hopeful its the simple things in life remi remarked i couldnt agree more tell me your theory about the chinese i dont think the z showing up was a coincidence one shadowed us the first day then again today then one shows up here just minutes after we touch down we know king is smuggling artifacts over the border it follows that hes got a chinese contact who would have that much freedom of movement that much clout the pla and if jacks right king probably guessed the general area in which well be searching with kings reach all he had to do is call his chinese contact then sit back and wait for us to show up the question is what did this z have in mind if hosni hadnt opened fire what would they have done im only speculating but this is the closest weve come to the border its about two miles to the north maybe the opportunity was too good to pass up they take us prisoner slip across the border and were never heard from again remi hugged sams arm more tightly not a happy thought sadly heres another one we need to assume theyre coming backand sooner rather than later i saw the pistol in the duffel bag youre not thinking of trying to no this time it was mostly pure luck next time wed have no chance when reinforcements arrive we need to be gone how you said yourself we cant climb out i misspoke we need to appear to be gone remi said tell me sam outlined his plan and remi nodded smiling i like it the fargo version of the trojan horse trojan gondola even better and with any luck itll keep us from freezing to death tonight using the rope and the makeshift piton as a grappling hook they slid the gondola a few feet from the crevasse a task made easier by the ice the tangled rigging sam had spotted earlier trailed from beneath the gondola down in the crevasse sam and remi looked over the edge but could see nothing beyond ten feet is that bamboo remi said pointing i think so theres another one that curved piece there it would certainly make our job easier if we cut it all free but something down there might be of use to us piton remi suggested cut it free and tie it off sam knelt down and gathered some of the cordage in one hand some kind of animal sinew its in amazing condition crevasses are natures refrigerator remi replied and if all this was covered by that glacier the effect is even more dramatic sam collected some more of the rigging and gave the mess a tug its surprisingly light it would take me hours to get through all this sinew though well pull it along then using the avalanche probe sam measured first the width of the gondola then the width of the crevasse the crevasse is four inches wider he announced my gut tells me itll get wedged but if im wrong we lose all our firewood your gut has never steered us wrong what about that time in the sudan and in australia i was way off that time shush help me with one of them stationed at each end they crouched together and grasped the bottom edge of the gondola on sams signal they heaved trying to straighten their legs it was no good they let go and stepped back lets concentrate our power sam said standing an arms length from each other at the gondolas center point they tried again this time they got the gondola two feet off the ground ill hold it sam said through clenched teeth try a leg press remi rolled onto her back wriggled beneath the gondola then pressed her feet against the edge ready heave the gondola rolled up and over onto its side one more time sam said they repeated the drill and soon the gondola was sitting upright remi peered inside she gasped and backed away what sam asked stowaways they walked up to the gondola lying at the far end of the wicker bottom amid a jumble of rigging and bamboo tubes was a pair of partially mummified skeletons the remainder of the gondola they could now see was divided into eighths by wicker cross struts wide enough to also serve as benches whats your guess remi asked captain and copilot its possible but a gondola this size could hold fifteen people at leastit might take that many to handle all this rigging and the balloons as well balloons as in plural well know more when i see the rest of the rigging but i think this was a fullon dirigible and these were the sole survivors the rest may be sam jerked his head toward the crevasse thats no way to go we can speculate later lets keep going after securing the rigging so it would hang off the end of the gondola and not get wedged against the crevasse wall sam and remi took up stations on either end of the gondola and pushed in unison until the wicker bottom began sliding over the ice as they neared the crevasse they picked up speed then gave the gondola a final shove it slid the last few feet bumped over the edge and disappeared from view sam and remi ran forward always trust your instincts remi said with a smile the gondola sat wedged between the crevasses walls about a foot below the edge sam climbed in and careful to avoid the mummies walked the length of the gondola he proclaimed it solid remi helped him back up every home needs a roof she said they walked the plateau together collecting pieces of the bells aluminum exterior large enough to bridge the crevasse then began layering them over the gondola until only a narrow slot remained youve got a flair for this sam told her i know one last touch camouflage using a bowllike chunk of the bells windshield they collected about five gallons of water from the runnel which they poured over the gondolas aluminum roof followed by several layers of snow they stepped back to admire their handiwork sam said once it freezes itll look like part of the ice sheet one question why the water so the snow would stick to the aluminum if our hunch is correct and were visited by another z tonight we dont want the rotor downwash exposing our shingles sam fargo youre a brilliant man thats the illusion i like to create sam looked up at the sky the suns lower rim was dropping behind a jagged line of peaks to the west time to hunker down and see what the night brings with their supplies either stuffed into the duffel or buried in the snow sam and remi retreated to their shelter in the quickly dwindling twilight they took inventory of the duffels contents whats this remi asked pulling out the lumbar pack sam had snagged just before leaping from the z thats a he stopped frowned then smiled that my dear is an emergency parachute but to you and me its about a hundred fifty square feet of blanket they extracted the chute from the pack and soon they were huddled tightly inside a white fabric cocoon relatively warm and so far safe they chatted quietly watching the light fade into complete darkness they slowly drifted off to sleep some time later sams eyes sprung open the blackness around them was complete wrapped in his arms remi whispered do you hear it yes in the distance came the chopping thud of helicopter rotors what are the chances its a rescue party remi asked virtually none thanks for playing along the sound of the rotors slowly increased until sam and remi were certain the helicopter had dropped into the valley a few moments later a bright spotlight swept over the crevasse blinding white slivers of light arced through the gaps in the roof then the light was gone fading as it skimmed over the plateau twice more it returned and went away then suddenly the helicopters engine changed in pitch coming in to hover sam whispered sam grabbed the pistol from where he had tucked it beneath his leg and switched it to his right hand the downwash came jets of icy air and swirling snow filled the gondola based on the shadows cast by the searchlight the helicopter seemed to be crabbing sideways over the plateau pivoting this way then that way either looking for them andor survivors among their missing comrades sam and remi had left the zs tail jutting from the runnel as a clue to the helicopters fate anyone lucky enough to survive a plunge to the lake would have certainly drowned soon after it was a conclusion that sam and remi prayed this search party would make doggedly their visitors made three more passes over the plateau then as suddenly as it had appeared the spotlight went dark and the rotors faded into the distance northern nepal despite the extreme cold their gondola cave served them well the snowcovered roof not only protecting them from the wind but also trapping a precious fraction of their body heat ensconced in the parachute canopy their parkas caps and gloves they slept deeply if sporadically until the sun peeking through the aluminum shingles woke them though wary of another visit from the chinese sam and remi knew that to survive they would have to find a way out of the valley they climbed out of the gondola and set about making breakfast from the bells wreckage theyd also managed to scrounge nine tea bags and a halftorn bag of dehydrated stroganoff from the z sam had unknowingly picked up a packet of rice crackers and three cans of what looked like baked mung beans they split one of these and shared a cup of tea the water for which they boiled inside the empty can they both agreed it was one of the best meals theyd ever had sam took his last sip of tea then said i was thinking last night and talking in your sleep remi added you want to build something dont you our mummified friends in the gondola got here by hotair balloon why dont we leave the same way remi opened her mouth to speak but sam pushed on no im not talking about resurrecting their balloon im thinking more along the lines of a sam searched for the right term frankenballoon remi was nodding some of their rigging some of ours her eyes brightened the parachute you read my mind if we can shape it and seal it up i think i have a way of filling it all we need is enough to lift us out of this valley and onto one of those meadows we saw to the southfour or five miles at most from there we should be able to walk to a village its still a long shot long shots are our specialty remi heres the truth of it in these temperatures we wont survive for more than five days a rescue party might come before that but ive never been a big fan of might and theres the chinese to consider and them i dont see any other option we gamble on rescue or we get ourselves out of hereor die trying no question we try lets build a dirigible the first order of business was inventory while remi took careful stock of what they had scrounged sam carefully reeled the old rigging up from the crevasse he found only shreds of what had once been the balloonor balloons in this case there were at least three of them sam guessed probably four you see all the curved pieces of wicker the way they come to a point yes i think those might have been enclosures for the balloons this material is silk remi added its very thick imagine it remi a thirtyfootlong gondola suspended from four caged silk balloons wickerandbamboo struts sinew guy lines i wonder how they kept it aloft how did they funnel the heated air into the balloons how would they remi turned to sam clasped his face between her hands and kissed him daydream later okay okay together they began separating the tangled mess setting guylines to one side bambooandwicker struts to the other once done they carefully lifted the mummies from the gondola and began untangling them from the last bit of rigging id love to know their story remi said its obvious theyd been using the upturned gondola as a shelter sam said perhaps the crevasse split open suddenly and only these two managed to hold on then why stay like that sam shrugged maybe they were too weak by that point they used the bamboo and rigging to build a small platform kneeling beside the mummies remi said weak and crippled this ones got a broken femur a compound by the looks of it and this one see the indentation in the hip thats either dislocated or fractured its awful they just laid in there and waited to die it wont be our fate sam replied a fiery balloon crash maybe but not this very funny remi stooped over and picked up one of the bamboo tubes it was as big around as a baseball bat and five feet long sam theres writing on this its scratched into the surface are you sure sam looked over her shoulder he was the first to recognize the language thats italian youre right remi ran her fingertips over the etched words while rotating the bamboo in her opposite hand this isnt though she pointed to a spot near the tip no taller than a half inch a square grid framed four asian symbols this cant be remi murmured dont you recognize them no should i sam theyre the same four characters engraved on the lid of the theurang chest northern nepal sam opened his mouth to speak then clamped it shut remi said i know what youre thinking but im sure sam i remember drinking tea and staring at these characters on jacks laptop screen i believe you i just dont see how sam stopped and furrowed his eyebrows unless when we landed here how far were we from the last set of coordinates hosni said less than a kilometer maybe a half mile from the path dhakal would have taken on his journey what if he died near here or ran into trouble and lost the theurang chest remi was nodding and then our balloonist friends come along centuries later they crashland here and find the box when was the earliest manned balloon flight just guessing late sixteenthearly seventeenth century but ive never heard of a dirigible from that period as advanced as this one this would have been way ahead of its time then at the earliest it crashed here almost three hundred years after dhakal left mustang its plausible sam admitted but hard to swallow then explain these markings i cant you say theyre the theurang curse and i believe you im just having trouble wrapping my brain around it all join the club sam hows your italian a bit rusty but i can give it a try later right now lets concentrate on getting out of here they devoted the morning to checking the guylines setting aside those that looked too frayed or decayed these sam cut away with his swiss army knife they repeated the process with the wickerandbamboo struts all of which remi checked for engravings but found none then turned their attention to the silk the biggest piece they found was only a few inches wide so they decided to braid the usable fabric into cordage should it be needed by lunchtime they had a respectable pile of construction materials for added stability they decided to fasten eight of the dirigibles ballooncage struts to the interior of the dome this job they accomplished in assemblyline fashion sam using his knifes awl poked double holes in the canopy where each strut was to go followed by remi inserting twelveinch lengths of sinew thongs into the holes once done they had three hundred twenty holes and one hundred sixty thongs by late afternoon sam began cinching the thongs closed using a boom hitch hed secured almost a quarter of the thongs when they decided to call it a night they were up with the sun the next day and returned to the dirigibles construction during the five hours of usable afternoon light they turned their attention to sewing closed the mouth of the parachuteballoon with strips of silk knotted around a barrelsized ring sam had fashioned from curved pieces of wicker after savoring a few crackers each they retired to the gondola cave and settled down for what they knew would be a long night how long until were ready remi asked with luck well have our basket ready by late morning tomorrow as they labored sam had been working and reworking the engineering problem in the back of his mind they had slowly been cannibalizing the gondola for firewood which they used not only to cook but to occasionally warm themselves throughout the day and before going to bed at night as it stood they had ten feet of gondola left based on sams calculations the remaining wicker combined with the chemical concoction he had in mind would be enough to get them aloft much less certain was whether they could ascend high enough to clear the ridgeline the one factor sam was not worried about was wind so far what little theyd gotten had come from the north remi voiced yet another concern one that had also been nagging at sam what about our landing im not going to lie that could be our bridge too far theres no way to tell how well well be able to control the descent and well have virtually no steering you have a plan b im guessing i do do you want to hear it remi was silent for a few moments no surprise me sams timetable estimate was close it wasnt until noon that they had the basket and risers completed while basket was an overly optimistic word for their construction they were nevertheless proud of it a twofootwide bamboo platform bound together and secured to the risers by the last of the sinew they sat and ate lunch in silence admiring their creation the craft was roughhewn misshapen and uglyand they loved every inch of it it needs a name remi said sam of course suggested the remi but she dismissed the idea he tried again i had a kite when i was a kid called high flier i like it the afternoon was spent implementing sams scheme for a fuel source except for a threefoot section in which they would huddle that night sam used the wire saw to dismantle the remainder of the gondola cutting away as he stood inside it and handing up chunks to remi they managed to lose only three pieces to the bowels of the crevasse using a stone remi began grinding the wicker and the remaining sinew into a rough pulp the first palmful of which sam dropped into a bowlshaped section of the bells aluminum skin to the pulp he added lichen theyd scraped from every stone and clear patch of granite they could find on the plateau next came dribbles of aviation fuel followed by dashes of gunpowder sam had extracted from the pistols bullets after thirty minutes of trial and error sam presented remi with a crude briquette wrapped inside a swatch of silk do the honors he said and handed remi the lighter are you sure it wont explode no not at all sure remi gave him a withering stare he said it would have to be packed inside something solid at arms length remi touched the lighters flame to the brick with a barely perceptible whoosh it ignited grinning broadly remi leapt up and hugged sam together they sat crouched around the brick and watched it burn the heat was surprisingly intense when the flames finally sputtered out sam checked his watch six minutes not bad now we need as many as we can make but biggersay about the size of a filet mignon did you have to use that analogy sorry the moment we get back to kathmandu well head for the nearest steakhouse buoyed by the success of their ignition test they made rapid progress by bedtime they had nineteen bricks as the sun began to set sam finished the brazier by notching into its base three short legs which he then attached to a doublethick aluminum bowl by crude flanges as a final step he cut a hole into the side of the cone whats that for asked remi ventilation and fuel port once we get the first brick going airflow and the shape of the cone will create a vortex of sorts the heat will gush through the top of the cone and into the balloon thats ingenious thats a stove pardon its an oldfashioned backpacking stove on steroids theyve been around for a century at last my love of obscure knowledge pays off in spades lets retreat to our bunker and try to rest up for the maidenand finalflight of the high flier they slept fitfully for a total of two hours kept awake by exhaustion lack of food and excitement as soon as there was enough light to work by they climbed out of the gondola and ate the last of their food sam dismembered the remainder of the gondola save the last corner which they pried free with the piton and knotted rope once the sawing was done they had a pile of fuel that was as tall as sam having already chosen a spot on the plateau that was virtually free of ice they carefully dragged the balloon to the launchpad onto the platform they stacked ballast rocks in the center they placed the brazier then secured it to the platform with sinew thongs lets get cooking remi said they used wads of paper and lichen as tinder on top of which they placed a tripod of wicker chunks once they had a solid bed of coals they continued to feed wicker into the brazier and slowly flames began licking upward remi placed her hand over the braziers flue she jerked it back hot perfect now we wait this is going to take a while one hour turned into two the balloon filled slowly expanding around them like a miniature circus tent as their fuel supply dwindled beneath the canopy the sunlight seemed ethereal hazy sam realized they were fighting time and thermal physics as the air cooled and seeped through the balloons skin just before the third hour the balloon though still lying perpendicular to the ground lifted and floated free whether reality or perception they werent sure but this seemed to be a watershed moment within forty minutes the balloon was standing upright its exterior growing more taut by the minute its working remi murmured its really working sam nodded said nothing his eyes fixed on the craft finally he said all aboard remi trotted to their supply pile snatched up the engraved length of bamboo slid it down the back of her jacket then jogged back she removed rocks one by one until she had room to kneel then sit the opposite side of the platform was now hovering a few inches off the ground having already stuffed the emergency parachute pack with some essentials and the duffel bag with their bricks and the last armload of wicker sam grabbed both then knelt beside the platform you ready he asked remi didnt blink an eye lets fly northern nepal the flames leapt up in the braziers interior disappearing through the balloons mouth until sam and remi were floating at knee height above the plateau when i say so push with everything youve got sam said he stuffed the last two pieces of wicker into the brazier and watched waited eyes darting from the brazier to the balloon to the ground now in unison they coiled their legs and shoved hard they surged upward ten feet then descended just as rapidly get ready to push again sam called their feet struck the ice push again they shot upward and again they returned to earth albeit more slowly were getting there sam said we need a rhythm remi replied think bouncing ball so they began bouncing over the plateau each time gaining a bit more altitude to their left the edge of the cliff loomed sam remi warned i know dont look just keep bouncing fly or swim lovely they shoved off once more a gust of wind caught the balloon and shoved them down the plateau their feet skipping over the ice remis leg slipped off the edge of the cliff but she kept her cool giving one last united shove with the other leg and then abruptly everything went silent save the wind whistling through the guylines they were airborne and climbing and heading southeast toward the slope sam reached into the duffel and withdrew a pair of bricks he fed them into the brazier they heard a soft whoosh as the brick ignited flames shot from the flue they began rising another remi said sam dropped a third brick into the brazier whoosh the balloon climbed the pine trees were a few hundred yards away and closing fast a gust of wind caught the balloon and spun it sam and remi clutched at the guylines and tightened their legs around the platform after three rotations the platform steadied and went still again looking over remis shoulder sam gauged the distance to the slope how close remi asked about two hundred yards ninety seconds give or take he looked her in the eye its going to be razor thin go for broke absolutely sam stuffed a fourth brick into the brazier whoosh they both looked over the side of the platform the tops of the pine trees seemed impossibly close remi felt something snag at her foot and she tipped sideways sam leaned forward grabbed her arm he added another brick whoosh another whoosh a hundred yards sam called another brick whoosh fifty yards he grabbed a brick from the duffel shook it in his cupped hands like dice and extended it toward remi for luck she blew on it he dropped the brick into the brazier whoosh raise your feet sam shouted they felt and heard the tip of a pine tree clawing the underside of the platform they were jerked sideways were snagged sam called lean in unison they tipped their torsos in the opposite direction hanging over the edge while clutching a guyline sam kicked his leg trying to free them from whatever lay below with a sharp crack the offending branch snapped the platform righted itself sam and remi sat up looking down and around and up were clear remi shouted we made it sam let out the breath hed been holding never doubted it for a second remi gave him the look okay he said maybe for a second or two now clear of the ridge the wind slackening slightly they found themselves heading south at what sam estimated was ten miles per hour they had traveled less than a few hundred yards before their altitude began bleeding off sam dug another brick out of the duffel he dropped it through the feed hole and it ignited they began rising remi asked how many do we have left sam checked ten now might be a good time to tell me your landing plan b on the off chance we dont manage a perfect feathersoft touchdown our next best chance is pine treesfind a tight cluster and try to fly straight in what youve just described is a crash landing without the land essentially exactly okay exactly we hold on tight and hope the boughs act as an arresting net like on aircraft carriers yes remi considered this she pursed her lips and puffed a strand of auburn hair from her forehead i like it i thought you would sam dropped another brick into the brazier whoosh with the late afternoon sun at their backs they glided ever southward occasionally feeding bricks into the brazier while keeping a sharp eye out for a landing spot theyd traveled approximately four miles and had so far seen only scree valleys glaciers and copses of pine trees were losing altitude remi said sam fed the brazier they continued to descend whats happening she asked dissipation i think were losing the sun along with the temperature the balloons bleeding heat faster than we can put it in sam dropped another brick through the hole their descent slowed slightly but there was no denying it they were on an irreversible downward glide path they began gaining speed time to make a choice sam said were not going to make a meadow but weve got a plan b coming up he pointed over remis shoulder ahead and below was a stand of pine trees past that lay another boulderstrewn valley sam said or we can stuff the rest of the bricks into the brazier and hope we find a better spot weve pushed our luck too far im ready for terra firma how do you want to do this sam checked the approaching tree line trying to gauge speed distance and their angle of approach they had three minutes he guessed they were traveling at perhaps fifteen miles per hour and that would likely double by the time they reached the trees while a survivable crash inside a car on this platform their chances were fiftyfifty if only we had an air bag sam muttered how about a shield asked remi and tapped their bamboo platform sam immediately grasped what she was suggesting dicey a lot less dicey than what you were just mulling over in your head i know you sam i know your expressions what do you put our odds at fifty percent this may give us a few more points sams eyes darted to the tree line then back to remis eyes she smiled at him he smiled back youre a hell of a woman this i know we dont need this anymore sam said he sliced the straps holding the brazier and shoved it off the platform amid a plume of sparks it hit the ground tumbled down the valley then crashed into a rock sam scooted across the platform until he was snug against remi she was already grasping the guylines in both hands sam grabbed another with his left hand then leaned backward laid the blade of his swiss army knife against one of the risers and started sawing with a twang it parted the platform dipped slightly sam moved to the second riser how long until we hit he asked i dont know guess a few seconds sam kept sawing pitted and slightly bent from overuse and sams attempts to sharpen it on rocks the knifes blade was dull he clenched his teeth and worked harder the second guyline snapped sam moved to the third running out of time remi called twang the opposite end of the platform was dangling by a single riser now fluttering like a kite in the wind with both hands clutching guylines remi was all but hanging with only one foot perched on the edge of the platform sams left hand was grasping the line beside hers like a talon one more he shouted and started sawing come on come on twang the end of the platform swung free now hanging vertically below them sam was about to drop his knife when he changed his mind he folded the blade closed against his cheek he clamped his right hand on a guyline remi was already lowering herself down the risers so her body was behind the platform sam climbed down toward her he peeked around the edge of the platform and saw a wall of green rushing toward him their world began tumbling though having taken a good portion of the impact the clawing branches immediately spun the platform around they found themselves hurtling through a gauntlet of whipping boughs they tucked their chins and closed their eyes sam unclenched his right hand from the riser and tried to cover remis face with his forearm on instinct she shouted let go then they were falling through the tree their fall softened by branches they jolted to a stop sam opened his mouth to speak but all that came out was a croak he tried again remi here came the faint reply below you lying faceup and diagonally across a pair of boughs sam carefully rolled onto his belly ten feet below remi was lying on the ground in a pile of pine needles her face was scratched as though someone had swiped her with a wire brush her eyes brimmed with tears how bad are you he asked she forced a smile and gave him a weak thumbsup and you intrepid pilot let me lie here for a bit and ill let you know after a time sam began the task of climbing down dont move he told remi just lie there if you insist sam felt as though hed been pummeled by a batwielding gang but all of his major joints and muscles seemed to be working properly if sluggishly using his right hand sam lowered himself from the last branch and dropped in a heap beside remi she cupped his face with a hand and said never a dull moment with you nope sam your neck he reached up and touched the spot remi had indicated his fingers came back bloody after a bit of probing he found a threeinch vertical gash below his ear itll coagulate he told her lets check you out their clothes had likely saved them he quickly realized the parkas thick padding and high collars had protected their torsos and throats and the knit caps had served as a crucial bit of cushion for their skulls not bad all things considered your shield idea saved the day she waved her hand dismissively wheres high flier tangled in the tree do i still have the bamboo sam saw the end of it jutting from her collar yes does my face look as bad as yours remi asked youve never looked more lovely liarbut thank you the sun is setting what now now we get rescued i build you a fire then go find some friendly villagers who will offer us cozy beds and hot food just like that just like that sam pushed himself to his feet and stretched his limbs his entire body hurt a throbbing pain that seemed to be everywhere at once be right back it took him only a few minutes to find the emergency chute pack which had been ripped off his back during the crash it took longer to find the duffel bag however it had fallen when the platforms last riser had given way of the seven or so bricks that had been left he found three he returned to remi and found she had managed to sit upright with her back against the tree soon he had a brick burning in a small dirt circle next to her he placed the two remaining bricks beside her ill be back in a flash he said ill be here he gave her a kiss then headed off sam he turned yes watch out for yetis goldfish point la jolla california i have a translation for you selma said walking into the solarium she walked to where sam and remi were reclined on chaise longues and handed remi the printout thats fantastic remi replied with a wan smile sam asked selma did you read it i did would you mind giving us the readers digest condensed version remis pain meds have left her a bit happy as it had turned out sams search for rescuers in the high himalayas had in fact been a simple affair in retrospect given what theyd gone through to get this far sam considered it poetic justice without realizing it they had crashed less than a mile from a village called samagaun the northernmost settlement in that region of nepal in the dimming twilight sam had shuffled his way down the valley until he was spotted by an australian couple on a trekking vacation they took him to samagaun and in short order a rescue party was organized two villagers the australian couple and sam rode as far up the valley as possible in an ancient datsun truck then got out and walked the rest of the way they found remi where sam had left her in the warm glow of the fire for safetys sake they placed her on a piece of plywood theyd brought along for that very purpose then made their way back to samagaun where they found the village had mobilized on their behalf a room with twin beds and a potbellied stove was arranged and they were fed aloo tareko fried potatoes and kukhura ko ledo chicken with gravy until they could take no more the village doctor came in examined them both and found nothing lifethreatening the next morning they awoke to find a village elder had already sent word of their rescue down the valley via ham radio soon after sam gave the village elder jack karnas contact information a more robust suv arrived to take them south in gorkha they found jack and ajay waiting to take them the rest of the way to kathmandu jack had in fact reported them missing and was wading through the nepalese government bureaucracy trying to organize a search party when word came of their rescue under the watchful eye of ajay sam and remi spent a night in the hospital remis xrays revealed two bruised ribs and a sprained ankle for their bumps and bruises sam and remi got prescription painkillers the scratches on their faces though ugly were superficial and would eventually fade five days after crashlanding in their balloon they were on a plane headed home now selma gave them the edited version well first of all jack has confirmed your hunch mrs fargo the symbols carved into the bamboo were identical to those on the lid of the theurang chest hes as dumbfounded by it as you are whenever youre ready to talk call him as for the rest of the markings you were right again its italian according to the author a man namedselma scanned the printoutfrancesco lana de terzi i know that name sam said since returning home he had immersed himself in the history of dirigibles remi said tell us de terzi is widely considered the father of aeronautics he was a jesuit and professor of physics and mathematics in brescianorthern italy in he published a book called prodomo for its time it was groundbreaking the first solid analysis of the math behind air travel he laid the groundwork for everyone that followed him starting with the montgolfier brothers in oh them remi replied the first successful balloon flight sam explained de terzi was an absolute genius he paved the way for things like the sewing machine a reading device for the blind the first primitive form of braille but no airship selma said his primary concept was something he called a vacuum shipessentially the same as the multiple balloon dirigible we found but in place of fabric spheres you would have copper ones that had been evacuated of air in the mid sixteen hundreds the inventor robert boyle created a pumpa pneumatic engine as he called itthat could completely evacuate the air from a vessel with it he proved that air has weight de terzi theorized that once the ships copper spheres were evacuated the ship would be lighter than the air around it causing it to rise i wont bore you with the physics but the concept has too many hurdles to be workable so the vacuum ship was never built said selma not that we know of in the late nineteenth century a man named arthur de bausset tried to get funding for what he called a vacuumtube airship but nothing came of it as for de terzi according to history he kept working on his theory until he died in where sam smiled in brescia after gallivanting around the himalayas remi added go on selma according to the bamboo de terzi and his chinese crewhe doesnt say how manycrashlanded during a test flight of an airship he was designing for the kangxi emperor the emperor had named the airship the great dragon only de terzi and two others survived the crash he was the only one uninjured the two mummies we found remi said i checked the dates for the kangxi emperor said selma he ruled from to the time line fits said sam now heres the good part de terzi states that while foraging for food he found aselma read the printoutmysterious vessel of a design he had never seen engraved with symbols both similar and dissimilar to those used by my benefactor sam and remi exchanged smiles selma continued in the final part of the engraving de terzi wrote that he had decided to leave his crewmates and head north back toward the airships launch base something he referred to as shekar gompa sam said did you check i did shekar gompa is only ruins now but its located about forty miles northeast of where you found the ship in tibet go on if de terzi made it back to shekar gompa he himself would tell the tale of the journey if he failed his body would never be found the bamboo was to be his testament and the mysterious vessel said sam i left the best for last selma replied de terzi claimed he was going to take the vessel with him as and i quote ransom to free my brother giuseppe held hostage by the kangxi emperor to ensure my return with the great dragon he took it with him sam murmured he took the theurang into tibet remi said i have so many questions i dont know where to start first how much history do we have on de terzi theres very little out there at least not that i could find selma replied according to every source de terzi spent his life in italy he died there and is buried there as sam said he spent his final years working on his vacuum ship both versions of his life cant be true sam said either he never left brescia and the bamboo is a hoax or he spent time in china working for the kangxi emperor and perhaps died there remi added sam saw the mischievous smile on selmas face he said okay out with it theres nothing online about de terzi but there is a professor at university of brescia who teaches a class in late renaissanceera italian inventors according to their online catalog de terzi figures prominently in the curriculum remi said you really enjoy doing that dont you not in the slightest selma replied solemnly just say the word and ill have you in italy by tomorrow afternoon just say the word and well get an internet appointment for tomorrow goldfish point la jolla california the next day late afternoon italian time on ichat sam and remi introduced themselves and explained ambiguously the gist of their interest in francesco lana de terzi to the courses instructor professor carlotta moretti moretti a midthirties brunette with owlish glasses smiled at them from the computer screen so nice to meet you both she said in lightly accented english i am something of a fan you know of ours remi replied si si i read about you in the smithsonian magazine the napoleons lost cellar and the cave in the mountains the uh grand saint bernard sam offered yes that is it please excuse my prying but i must ask are you both well your faces a hiking mishap sam replied were on the mend oh good well i was fascinated and then of course happy when you called surprised too tell me your interest in francesco de terzi and i will try to be of help to you his name came up during a project remi said weve been able to find surprisingly little published about him we were told youre something of an expert moretti wagged her hand expert i do not know i teach about de terzi and have had a curiosity about him since i was a little girl were primarily interested in the latter part of his life say the last ten years first can you confirm that he had a brother oh yes giuseppe lana de terzi and is it true francesco never left brescia oh no that is untrue de terzi traveled often to milan to genoa to other places too how about out of italy overseas perhaps it is possible though i could not say where exactly based on some accounts mostly secondhand accounts of stories de terzi was said to have told he traveled distantly between the years and though no historian i know of will confirm that do these stories talk about where he might have been somewhere in the far east replied moretti asia is one speculation why would he have gone there the professor hesitated you must understand this may all be fantasy there is so little documentation to support any of this we understand sam replied the story goes that de terzi could find no investors for his aircraft plan the vacuum ship yes that he could find no one to give him money not the government not wealthy men here he journeyed east hoping to find support so he might finish his work and did he no not that i am aware of what happened when he returned in sam said it is said he returned to italy a changed man something bad had occurred during his travels and giuseppe did not return home francesco never spoke of that soon after he resettled in brescia left the jesuit order and moved to vienna austria in search of investors again perhaps but in vienna he found only bad luck how so asked remi soon after he moved to vienna he married and then quickly followed a baby boy two years later came the big battlethe siege and then the battle of vienna do you know of it only vaguely the siege lasted for two months the ottoman empire fighting the holy league the holy roman empire the polishlithuanian commonwealth and the venetian republic in early september of the final battle was fought many tens of thousands of people died including francesco de terzis wife and new son thats awful remi said so sad si it is said he was terribly heartbroken first his brother and then his new family all dead shortly afterward de terzi disappeared again where moretti shrugged again a mystery he returned again to brescia in october of and then died a few months later let me ask you what may sound like an odd question remi said please are you or anyone absolutely certain de terzi returned to brecia in that is an odd question i suppose the answer would be no i know of nothing that certifies he was buried hereor that he returned for that matter that part of the story is like the rest based on secondhand information short of an exhumation yes an exhumation only that and a dna sample from his descendants would be proof why do you ask do you have reason to believe no not really were brainstorming sam asked about these stories do you believe any of them part of me wants to believe it is a thrilling adventure yes but as i said the official histories of de terzis life contain none of these accounts a few minutes ago you said there is so little documentation does that mean there is some documentation remi said there are a few letters but written by friends none in de terzis own hand it is what your justice system calls hearsay si aside from those there is only one other source that may be related to the stories i am reluctant to mention it why it is fiction a short story written by de terzis sister a few years after his death though named differently the protagonist is clearly intended to be francesco most thought the sister was trying to make money on his fame by exploiting the rumors can you give us the gist of the story a fanciful tale really moretti gathered her thoughts the hero of the story leaves his home in italy after braving many dangers he is captured by a tyrant in a strange land he is forced to build a flying ship of war the ship crashes in a desolate place and just the hero and two of his comrades survive only to eventually die of their injuries the hero then finds a mysterious treasure which the natives tell him is cursed but he ignores the warning and undertakes an arduous journey back to the tyrants castle once there he finds that his traveling companion who the tyrant had been holding hostage has been executed the hero returns to italy with the treasure only to find more tragedy his family has been killed by the plague the hero is now convinced the curse is real so he sets out to return the treasure to where he found it and is never heard from again sam and remi struggled to keep their faces expressionless sam said you dont happen to have a copy of this story do you yes of course i believe i have it in the original italian as well as a very good english translation as soon as we have finished our conversation i will send you an electronic version goldfish point la jolla california with copies of the great dragon on each of their ipads sam and remi thanked professor moretti for her help sam and remi read the story and emailed copies to selma wendy and pete as remi was sending a copy of the story to jack selma connected with him via ichat you two look absolutely giddy karna said dont keep me in suspense what have you found sam said to remi you tell him remi first recounted their conversation with moretti then gave everyone a summary of the great dragon incredible said selma youve both read the story yes said sam it should be in your email you too jack yes i see it here how closely does the story match the bamboo engraving asked wendy if you replace the clearly fictional bits of the story with de terzis alleged testament you get what reads like a factual account the crash the number of survivors the discovery of a mysterious treasure the trek home its all there and the time line fits remi said between the secondhand accounts of de terzis comings and goings he could easily have been traveling to and from china i am flabbergasted said karna pete who was paging through the story on sams ipad said whats this map on the frontispiece thats the heros journey to return the treasure replied remi jack do you have that looking at it right now it appears de terzi arrives from the west and first stops at what is labeled here as a castle this we can assume is shekar gompa the launch base for the airship sam said and possibly the burial site for giuseppe added remi karna continued from shekar gompa de terzi travels east to the great city based on the position of shekar the city could be lhasa why would he go there asked wendy the crash site is forty miles south of shekar gompa wasnt he trying to return the treasure yes sam replied but in the story when he reaches the castle a local wise man tells him he must return the treasure to its rightful home he is told to seek out another wise man in the great city to the west karna picked up sams line of thought from the great city de terzi continues eastward eventually arrives at i dont know theres only an x here shangrila remi suggested there were a few moments of silence from karna then youre going to have to excuse me apologies ill get back to you the ichat screen went dark karna was back thirty minutes later there are some rough grid lines and other landmarks on this map ill have to crossreference but using the distance from shekar gompa to lhasa as a benchmark the final leg of de terzis journey ended in an area thats know today as the tsangpo gorge your frontrunner for the location of shangrila said sam yes indeed sam remi you may have just solved a riddle six hundred years in the making sam said lets not get ahead of ourselves how long will it take you to nail down the locations on the map ill start right now give me a day arunachal pradesh region northern india jack remi called i didnt really believe youd show up karnas suv rolled to a stop and he climbed out remi gave him a hug sam shook his hand glad youre on board jack as am i standing behind karna ajay nodded and smiled at them karna said you two look better than when i last saw your faces remi hows the foot and the ribs healed enough that i can get around without gritting my teeth ive got ace bandages a good pair of hiking boots and a bottle of ibuprofen outstanding shell outmarch all of us sam said any trouble getting here any tails suspicious people remi answered none of the above since their last conversation with charles king they had neither seen nor heard from him his children or zhilan hsu it was a development they found at once pleasing and unnerving jack how did you conquer your fear of flying said sam i didnt actually karna replied i was utterly terrified from the moment we lifted off from kathmandu to the moment i stepped off the plane in bangladesh my excitement for our expedition temporarily overpowered my fear and voila here i am here was the end of a fivehundredmile overland journey sam and remi had finished just a few hours earlier situated on the banks of the siang river the quiet town of yingkiong population nine hundred was the last outpost of any significant population in northern india from there the next city nyingchi tibet was a hundred miles northeast through some of the worlds most forbidding jungles ten days had passed since their ichat conversation it had taken that long to make all the necessary travel arrangements true to his word karna had contacted them the next day having worked nonstop in hopes of deciphering the map from the great dragon de terzis land navigation skills must have rivaled those of the sentinels karna had explained both the bearings and distances on de terzis map were remarkably accurate missing the realworld measurements by less than a mile and one compass degree once finished with his calculations karna was certain he had triangulated the location of shangrila down to a twomile diameter as he had suspected all along the coordinates were in the heart of the tsangpo river gorge sam and remi had studied the area on google earth but had seen nothing but towering peaks raging rivers and thick forests nothing that looked like a mushroom karna said what say we retire to a bar for a drink and a bit of chalk talk its best you understand the nastiness were in for before we set out in the morning the tavern was a twostory building with a corrugated tin leanto roof and clapboard walls inside the lower level was devoted to a reception area and a restaurant that looked as if it had been stolen from a s hollywood western wooden floors a long jshaped bar and vertical posts supporting exposed ceiling joists their rooms for the night karna told them were on the second floor the tavern was surprisingly crowded they found a trestle table against the wall beneath a flickering neon schlitz sign and ordered four beers they were icecold most of what im going to tell you i got from ajay but since hes not the loquacious type youll have to rely on my memory as i told you these are ajays old stomping grounds so were in good hands by the way ajay whats the status of our transportation all arranged mr karna fantastic correct me if i get offtrack while im talking ajay yes mr karna karna sighed cant get him to call me jack been trying for years he and selma play by the same handbook sam replied right heres the quick and dirty about arunachal pradesh depending on who you ask were in china right now whoa say that again sam said china officially claims most of this region as part of southern tibet of course to the people and the government here arunachal pradesh is an indian state the northern border between arunachal pradesh and china is called the mcmahon line drawn up as part of a treaty between tibet and the united kingdom the chinese never bought into it and india never enforced the border until bottom line china and india both claim it but neither does much about it what does that mean for a military presence asked sam nothing there are some indian troops in the region but the chinese stay north of the mcmahon line its all fairly amicable really thats good for our team remi said yes well what isnt so wonderful is the anlfthe arunachal naga liberation force theyre the latest and greatest terrorist group in the area theyve been keen on kidnapping as of late that said ajay says we probably wont have any trouble with them the army has been cracking down sam said according to the maps our destination is twentyfive miles into china based on the landscape im assuming there arent any border checkpoints youre correct as i mentioned back in mustang the border is fairly open several hundred trekkers jaunt across it every year actually the chinese government doesnt seem to care theres nothing of any strategic importance in the area more good news remi said now tell us the downside you mean aside from the ridiculously rugged terrain yes the downside is that we will be for all intents and purposes invading china if were unlucky enough to get caught well probably end up in prison weve already faced the possibility once sam replied lets do our best to avoid that shall we right okay lets move on to snakes and venomous insects after a quick supper that consisted of tandoori chicken sam and remi retired for the evening they found their rooms in keeping with the hostels motif hollywood western chic sans the chic though the outside temperature was a pleasant sixty degrees the humidity was stifling the rooms creaking ceiling fan slowly churned the air but after sunset the temperature began dropping and soon the room was comfortable they were asleep by eight they awoke the next morning to the sound of ajay knocking softly on their door and whispering their names blearyeyed sam crawled out of bed in the darkness and shuffled to the door ajay said coffee mr fargo no tea this is a pleasant surprise its sam by the way oh no sir what time is it five am uhoh sam murmured and glanced over at remis sleeping form mrs fargo was not exactly a morning person ajay would you mind bringing us two more cups of coffee right away of course in fact i will bring the carafe the group assembled in the tavern thirty minutes later for breakfast once they were done karna said wed best pack our death trap should be here anytime now did you say death trap remi asked you might know it by its common name helicopter sam chuckled after what weve been through we almost prefer your description are you sure you can handle it karna held up a softballsized nerf ball it was riddled with finger holes stress toy ill survive the ride will be short with their gear assembled and packed they soon regrouped at the northern edge of yingkiong near a dirt clearing here he comes ajay said pointing to the south where an olive green helicopter was skimming over the surface of the siang it looks positively ancient karna observed as it drew even with the clearing and slowed to a hover sam spotted a faded indian air force roundel on the side door someone had tried and failed to paint over the orange white and green insignia the group turned away from the rotor downwash and waited until the dust settled ajay what is this thing asked karna a chetak light utility helicopter sir very reliable as a soldier i flew in these many times how old nineteen sixtyeight bloody hell if i had told you mr karna you would not have come oh youre damned right all right all right lets get on with it with jack clawing furiously at his nerf ball the group packed their gear aboard then took their seats ajay checked their fivepoint seat harnesses then slid the door shut and gave the pilot a nod they lifted off the nose tilted forward and surged ahead partially for ease of navigation and partially to increase their chances of rescue should the chetak crash the pilot followed the serpentine course of the siang river the few pockets of habitation that lay north of yingkiong were situated along its banks ajay explained with luck someone would see the chetak go down and report the incident oh thats just fantastic karna shouted over the rush of the engine squeeze your ball jack remi replied ajay do you know this pilot oh yes mrs fargo very well we served together in the army gupta now runs a cargo businessbrings supplies to the far parts of arunachal pradesh the chetak continued north skimming a few hundred feet above the brown waters of the siang and before long they found themselves flying through knifeedged ridges and plummeting valleys all of it covered in jungle so thick sam and remi could see nothing but a solid carpet of green in most places the siang was wide and sluggish but several times as the chetak passed through a gorge the waters were a maelstrom of froth and crashing waves those are class vi waters down there sam called staring out the window thats nothing karna replied where were headed the tsangpo river gorge is known as the everest of rivers there are sections of the tsangpo that defy classification remi said has anyone ever tried traversing those oh yes a number of times mostly extreme kayakers right ajay ajay nodded many lives have been lost bodies never found they dont wash downstream asked sam bodies are usually either trapped forever in hydraulics where they are ground into pulp along the bottom or they are ground into pulp while being dragged down the gorges there is not much left to find after that after they had traveled forty minutes gupta turned in his seat and called coming up on tuting village prepare for landing sam and remi were surprised to find that tuting had a dirt airstrip partially overgrown with jungle they touched down and everyone climbed out to the east higher up the valley they glimpsed a few roofs peeking above the treetops tuting village sam and remi assumed from here we hike karna announced he sam and remi began unloading their gear pardon just one moment ajay said he was standing ten feet away with the pilot gupta has a proposal he wishes you to consider he asked me how far into china we are going and i told him for a fee he will fly us very close to our destination isnt he worried about the chinese asked sam very little he says they maintain no radar in the area and from here to our destination the valleys only deepen and that there is almost no habitation he can fly unseen he believes well thats a damned sight better than a sixday march in and back karna observed how much does he want ajay spoke to gupta in hindi then said two hundred thousand rupeesor roughly four thousand us dollars sam said we dont have that much cash on us gupta assumed this he says he will happily take a credit card they agreed to guptas terms and in short order the pilot was on the helicopters radio transmitting sams visa information to his home base in itanagar this is surreal sam said standing here in the back of beyond while an indian pilot runs our card as i said back in nepal never a dull moment remi replied i know my ankle will appreciate this itinerary change ajay called gupta says you are approved we can lift off whenever you are ready airborne and heading north along the siang again they soon passed over the last indian settlement before the border gengren disappeared behind them in a flash and then gupta announced we are crossing the mcmahon line thats it sam said weve invaded china the crossing had been decidedly anticlimactic but soon the landscape began to morph as gupta had predicted the peaks and ridges traded their rounded appearance for exposed and serrated rock the valley walls steepened and the forests thickened the most startling difference was the siang here on the southern edge of the tsangpo gorge region the rivers surface roiled the waves exploding against boulders and hanging rock walls sending plumes of mist high into the air gupta kept the chetak as close to the river as possible and kept below the ridgeline sam and remi felt as though they were on the wildest flume ride on earth fifteen minutes gupta called sam and remi shared an anticipatory smile theyd come so far gone through so much and now their destination was only minutes away they hoped karnas reaction was intense jaw clenched fingers digging into the nerf ball he stared out the window with his forehead pressed against the glass you okay jack sam asked never better mate almost there approaching the outer edge of the coordinates gupta announced ajay had given their pilot a datum point with a twomile diameter the area into which they were flying was dominated by a cluster of flattopped obelisk peaks each one varying in height from a few hundred feet to a thousand feet to three thousand feet in the gorges below the tsangpo river twined itself around the obelisks a churning white ribbon enclosed by sheer cliffs havent seen any kayakers sam observed or anyone for that matter karna looked up from the map he was studying and replied i would be surprised if you did karna replied youve seen the terrain only the most determinedor insaneventure here i cant decide if thats an insult or a compliment remi whispered to sam if we make it back victorious and alive its a compliment karna called to ajay ask gupta if he can give us a better look at these peaks if my numbers are correct were right on top of the datum point ajay relayed the request gupta slowed the chetak to thirty knots and began orbiting each of the obelisks in turn adjusting his altitude so his passengers could make a closer examination at her window remi had her camera shutter on rapidfire there jack shouted pointing a hundred yards beyond the window lay one of the mediumsized obelisks at approximately a thousand feet high and five hundred yards wide the vertical granite slopes were heavily laced with vines foliage and great swaths of moss do you see it karna said his index finger tracing along the glass the shape start at the bottom and go upward do you see where it begins to widen out and then there about a hundred feet below the plateau it flares out suddenly tell me you see it it took sam and remi several seconds to piece together the image but slowly smiles spread over their faces a giant mushroom remi said tsangpo river gorge china after making several aborted passes because of wind shear gupta managed to ease the chetak sideways over the obelisk until karna spotted a small clearing in the jungle near the edge of the plateau gupta slowed to a hover and then touched down once the rotors had stopped spinning the group climbed out and grabbed their gear does this remind you of anything sam asked remi absolutely the plateau bore a striking resemblance to the paradise valleys they had spotted during their helicopter search of northern nepal beneath their feet was a carpet of moss ranging in color from dark green to chartreuse here and there the landscape was dotted with granite boulders speckled with lichen directly across from them stood a wall of thick jungle unbroken save a few tunnellike paths that disappeared into the growth rough ovals that stared back at sam and remi like unblinking black eyes the air seemed to buzz with the chattering of insects and unseen in the foliage birds squawked in a nearby tree a monkey hung upside down and stared at them for a few seconds before skittering off jack and ajay walked over to where sam and remi were standing karna said thankfully our search area is limited if we split into two groups we should be able to cover a lot of ground agreed sam said one last thing karna said he knelt beside his pack and rummaged inside and came up with a pair of snubnosed revolvers he handed one each to sam and remi ive got one of course and as for ajay from a holster at the rear of his waistband ajay pulled out a beretta semiautomatic pistol then quickly replaced it are we expecting trouble remi asked were in china my dear anything can happen bandits crossborder terrorist groups the pla if the chinese army shows up these popguns are only going to make them mad a bridge well cross if need be besides well likely find what were looking for and be back across the border before nightfall sam said remi and i will head east jack you and ajay head west well meet back here in two hours any objections there were none after checking their portable radios for reception the group split up headlamps on and machetes in hand sam and remi chose one of the paths and started in ten feet inside the jungle the light dimmed to quarter strength sam slashed clear some of the vines growing across their path then they paused to take a look around panning their lights up down and to both sides the yearly rainfall here must be mindboggling sam said a hundred ten inches about nine feet remi replied then smiled i know how you love trivia i looked it up im proud of you a few feet over their heads and on both sides was a tangled mass of vines so thick they could see nothing of the forest itself this doesnt feel right remi said no it doesnt sam jabbed the tip of his machete through the canopy with a clang his arm jolted to a stop thats stone he murmured remi swung her machete to the left and also got a clang the same to the right were in a manmade tunnel sam unclipped the radio from his belt and pressed the talk button jack are you there static jack come in im here sam what is it are you on a trail just started swing your machete off the path okay clang jack came back stone walls fascinating development remember your hunch about shangrila being a temple or monastery well i think youve found it i think youre right amazing what a millennium of unchecked jungle can do isnt it well i dont think this changes our plan do you we search the complex then regroup in two hours okay see you then now aware they were inside a manmade structure sam and remi began examining their surroundings for architectural telltales vines and roots had infiltrated every square foot of the complex in the lead sam tried to swing his machete in short arcs but couldnt avoid striking the stone walls occasionally they reached an alcove and stopped shut off your headlamp sam said dousing his remi did when their eyes had adjusted to the darkness they began to see slivers of dim sunlight through the foliagecovered walls and ceiling windows and skylights remi said this must have been an amazing sight in its day sam and remi started climbing a set of steps and soon reached a landing where the steps doubled back and rose to a second floor here through an archway they found a large open space a patchwork of roots and vines arced above their heads to form a vaulted ceiling spanning the great room as they dubbed it were what looked like six halfrotted logs support beams they decided long ago decayed the remnants held in place by a sheath of vines directly opposite the rampstairs theyd climbed was another set leading upward into darkness headlamps panning sam and remi spread out to explore the space along the far wall sam found a row of stone benches jutting from the wall and in front of these six rectangular slots in the stone floor those are tubs remi said they look like graves she knelt beside one and tapped the inside walls with her machete she got back the familiar clang of steel on stone some more over here sam said crossing to the other side they found a semicircle of stone benches enclosing a round basin wider than sam was tall remi repeated her routine but could not touch the bottom sam found a chunk of stone that had fallen off a nearby bench and dropped it into the basin they heard a muffled thump about ten feet deep sam said he crouched and shone his light down the shaft but could see nothing through the web of vines and roots hello he called there was no echo too much vegetation remi guessed sam found another rock and prepared to drop it what are you doing indulging my curiosity we didnt see any sign of this shaft on the floor below which means it was behind a wall it has to have a purpose go ahead sam leaned over the shaft angled his arm then hurled the stone unseen it thumped against the bottom then again then clattered against a hard surface remi said good call its got to lead somewhere do you want to sams radio crackled to life in between bursts of static faint staccato voices came through the speaker the snippets were hurried and overlapping i think its gupta and ajay remi said sam pressed the talk button ajay can you hear me ajay come in static then jacks voice sam gupta has spotted a is taking off hes leaving remi said they turned and ran down the stairs remi trailing with her slight limp they crossed the den and headed down the tunnel remi called what do you think he spotted only one thing i can think of that would panic him sam replied over his shoulder helicopter i was afraid of that an oval of light appeared ahead sam and remi skidded to a stop before reaching it and crouchwalked the last few steps in the clearing the chetaks rotors were spinning rapidly through the side window they could see gupta furiously punching buttons and checking gauges he grabbed the radio handset and started talking his voice burst through sams radio sorry i will try to return try to hide they may go away gupta then lifted the collective and the chetak lifted straight up at thirty feet it banked nose down and zoomed from view out of the corner of their eyes sam and remi saw karna and ajay step from a tunnel entrance sam waved caught their attention then gestured at them to retreat they slipped back out of sight preceded by only a few seconds of thudding rotors an olive green helicopter rose into view at the far edge of the plateau sam and remi immediately recognized the nose cone and rocket pods a chinese pla harbin z hello old enemy remi muttered she and sam backed up a few more feet the z continued to rise then pivoted revealing another fond memory an open door and a soldier crouched over a mounted machine gun the z slid sideways over the clearing and touched down lets go sam remi said we need to hide just wait a figure appeared in the doorway oh no remi muttered they both recognized the lithe willowy body shape zhilan hsu she stepped down from the doorway dangling from her right hand was a compact submachine gun a moment later two more figures stepped from the doorway to join her russell and marjorie king also armed with compact submachine guns behold the wonder twins sam said zhilan turned said something to them then stepped to the zs side door which opened to reveal a midforties chinese man sam withdrew a pair of binoculars from his pack and zoomed in on the pair i think weve found kings chinese contact sam said hes definitely pla very high ranking either a colonel or general do you see any more soldiers inside no just the door gunner between him zhilan and the twins thats all they need i dont know why they havent shut down the engine yet though how in gods name did they find us no idea too late to worry about it now the pla officer and zhilan shook hands then he closed the door the zs engine rose in pitch and then the helicopter lifted off it pivoted so its tail was facing the plateau then headed off our odds just improved sam said whats zhilan doing sam focused his binoculars on zhilan in time to see her pull a cell phone from her jacket pocket she punched a series of numbers into the keypad and then she and the twins turned and watched the helicopter recede into the distance in a mushroom of orange and red the z exploded chunks of flaming debris plummeted toward earth and then out of sight sam and remi couldnt speak for several seconds finally remi said that ruthless king is tying up loose ends sam said hes probably already shut down his black market fossil operation the dig site his transportation systemand now his contact in the government were the last loose ends remi said can we shoot them from here no chance our snubnoses arent worth a damn beyond twenty feet or so in the clearing zhilan had traded her cell phone for a portable radio she brought it up to her lips over sams radio they heard do you have him i have him ajays voice bring him out sam and remi looked right jack karna stepped from the tunnel entrance followed by ajay the barrel of his gun was pressed against the base of karnas skull the other hand clutched the collar of his jacket prodded by ajay the pair walked halfway to the clearing then stopped they were forty feet to sam and remis right why ajay karna asked i am sorry mr karna truly i am but why karna repeated were friends weve known each other for they came to me in kathmandu its more money than i would make in ten lifetimes i can send my children to university my wife and i can buy a new home i am sorry but she gave me her word none of you will be harmed karna replied she lied to you then louder to zhilan your spawn ive already met a few months ago in lo monthang but i dont think weve been properly introduced zhilan said my name is the dragon lady i know youre too late you realize this is not the place the theurang is not here youre lying ajay what do you say we only started searching maam mr karna and the fargos seem sure this is the location of shangrila zhilan said speaking of the fargos come out both of you your helicopter is gone come out now help me find the golden man and ill signal for our transportation i will land you safely back in yingkiong you have my promise you forget dragon lady sam and remi know you karna said your promise is worthless you are likely correct zhilan replied mr and mrs fargo come out now or i will kill your friend remi whispered sam weve got to help him thats what she wants he replied we cant just let her i know remi karna called dragon lady they cant hear you all this behind me is a templea complex so big it will take months to search right now they probably dont even know youre here they would have heard me on the radio not from inside the reception is nonexistent zhilan considered this ajay is that true about the radios mostly true as to the temple it is vast they may be unaware of your arrival then well have to go find them zhilan said besides karna added if they were watching they would know what i wanted ive spent my entire life searching for the theurang i would rather be dead and have them destroy it than give it to you zhilan turned toward russell who was standing behind her right shoulder and said something in one smooth motion russell lifted the machine gun to his shoulder on an impulse he immediately regretted sam shouted jack duck russells weapon bucked the left side of karnas neck exploded in blood he crumpled to the ground russell fired again a threeround burst that slammed into ajays chest he stumbled backward and fell dead zhilan shouted they are there in that tunnel go after them machine guns raised russell and marjorie began sprinting behind them zhilan began walking toward karnas body sam turned and grabbed remis shoulders go hide what about you right on your heels remi spun around and took off down the tunnel in a limpsprint sam raised his and snapped off a round toward russell and marjorie he had no illusion about hitting them but the gunfire accomplished his goal russell and marjorie split up each diving behind a nearby boulder sam turned and ran after remi he was only halfway down the tunnel when he heard footsteps at the entrance behind him fast bastards sam muttered and kept going ahead remi had reached the end of the tunnel she darted left into the den bullets ricocheted off the wall to his left sam leapt right bounced off the wall half turned saw a pair of headlamp beams bouncing down the tunnel and fired at them he turned again kept running five more strides brought him to the den remi was crouched beside the near wall come on from the clearing they heard a gunshot a pause then a second gunshot sam took her hand and they bounded up the ramp bullets thudded into the steps behind them they reached the landing and started up the next flight remis foot slipped out from under her she slammed chest first to the ground she groaned ribs sam asked yes help me up sam lifted her to her feet and they climbed the rest of the steps and stopped before the arch that led into the great room through clenched teeth remi asked ambush them were outgunned and theyre not going to charge up the steps sit here for a second and catch your breath im going to check the next stairs his left foot had just touched the first step when remi screamed sam he turned to see remi stooped over running through the arch into the great room to the right a pair of figures appeared on the landing below and began charging up the steps mistake sam he muttered he fired two shots but the snubnose was worthless both bullets missed sparking against the stone behind russell and marjorie they ducked and backpedaled out of sight remis voice came through the archway run sam ill be okay no just do it sam eyeballed the distance to and angle of the great rooms archway and instinctively knew hed never make it russell and marjorie would cut him down before he got halfway dammit sam rasped russell and marjorie popped up on the steps the muzzles of their machine guns flashed orange sam turned and charged up the steps crouched in one of the tubs her headlamp doused remi was just realizing her position was indefensible when the shots rang out silence then russells whispered voice shes in there you take her ill take him dead or alive marjorie replied softly dead mother says this is the right place the theurang is here once the fargos are gone well have all the time in the world go remi didnt think but acted she climbed out of the tub and crabwalked to the shaft she took a deep breath let it out then jumped one floor above remi sam had found himself in a maze of small interconnecting rooms and corridors here the roots and vines were much thicker crisscrossing the spaces like monstrous cobwebs slivers of sunlight peeked through casting the labyrinth in a greenish twilight having left his machete back at the tunnel entrance there was nothing for sam to do but duck and weave his way forward and deeper into the maze somewhere behind him he heard the crunch of footsteps he froze three more steps closer now sam turned his head trying to pin down the direction fargo russell shouted all my father wants is the theurang hes decided not to destroy it do you hear me fargo sam remained silent he stepped to the left under a thighsized root and through a doorway he wants the same thing you do russell shouted he wants to see the golden man in a museum where it belongs you and your wife would be codiscoverers imagine the prestige were not in this for the prestige sam said under his breath idiot to his right farther down the corridor a vine snapped followed by a barely perceptible damn sam crouched down switched the to his left hand and looked around the corner twenty feet away a figure was charging toward him sam fired russell stumbled and almost went down but regained his footing and dodged right and through a doorway sam stepped across the hall and crabstepped over a root into the next room he paused flipped open the s cylinder he had one bullet left remi landed hard at the bottom of the pit and tried to shoulderroll to dissipate the impact but slammed into something solid whitehot flames spread across her rib cage she swallowed the scream and forced herself to be still she was in pitchblackness she was belowground she guessed from up the shaft came marjories voice remi come on out i know youre hurt come out and ill help you not going to happen sister remi thought she cupped her hands around the headlamp clicked it on and took a quick scan at her back was a wall directly ahead a wide downwardsloping tunnel archways lined either side of the tunnel remi clicked off her lamp on hands and knees she crawled ahead when shed put what she thought was enough distance between her and marjorie she turned her headlamp back on one hand pressed against her ribs remi climbed to her feet she chose an archway at random and stepped through it to her left was another arch from the tunnel she heard a thump then a grunt she peered around the corner in time to see a headlamp turning toward her remi raised her pistol took aim and fired three quick shots the muzzle of marjories weapon mushroomed orange remi backpedaled turned and darted through the next arch sam knew russell was behind him and across the corridor one bullet sam thought russell had more than that and probably spare magazines as well sam needed to draw him in ten feet or less close enough that he couldnt miss careful to keep the corridor in his minds eye sam crept deeper into the room then stepped left through an archway he turned right stepped up to the next arch and risked a glance into the corridor through the archway across from him sam heard a snap russell pistol raised to waist height sam backstepped away from the door when he drew even with the next arch he turned to step through it russell was standing in the corridor sam raised his gun took aim russell took a step and disappeared sam took two large strides forward and gun leading the way sidestepped into the corridor he found himself standing facetoface with russell sam knew that russell was younger and stronger than him and the king boy was also lightning fast before sam could squeeze the trigger russell swung the butt of his machine gun upward the stock arcing toward sams chin sam jerked backward the butt struck a glancing blow sams eyesight flashed red on instinct he charged forward engulfing russell in a bear hug that pinned his arms to his side they stumbled backward russell planted his back foot and spun his body taking sam along with him sam found his footing again drew his knee back and slammed it forward into russells groin russell grunted sam kneed him again then again russells legs buckled but he managed to stay upright wrapped up they stumbled into the next room bounced off a wall and then lurched into yet another room russell reared his head back tucked his chin sam thought head butt and tried to turn away from it but it was too late the top of russells forehead slammed into sams eyebrow his eyesight flashed red again then blackness began creeping in from the sides sam exhaled hard drew in a deep breath clenched his teeth and held on his vision cleared slightly he drew his own head back but the height difference made a face strike impossible sam chose instead russells collarbone this time russell let out a yelp of pain sam headbutted again then again russells machine gun hit the ground they spun again russell trying to use his superior strength to either dislodge sam or slam him against a wall suddenly sam felt russells balance change he was backpedaling quicker than his feet could keep up sams judo training took hold he would capitalize on russells imbalance sam put everything he had into his legs and charged forward feet scrabbling over the vines and roots he bulldozed russell backward picking up speed they bounced through an arch and then they were back in the corridor sam kept pushing and then they were stumbling russells balance having given out they were enveloped by a curtain of foliage sam heard and felt vines snapping around them over russells shoulder he saw daylight sam released his death grip on russell and snapped his head forward catching him in the sternum russell disappeared through the curtain sam trying to arrest his own momentum pitched through the opening and into space sams vision was filled with sky granite walls a churning river far below he slammed to a stop the impact knocked the wind out of him he sucked in a couple lungfuls of air all he saw was a black steel cylinder gun he thought numbly he was still clutching his pistol he was lying belly first in the crook of a mosscovered tree he looked around and pieced together what he was seeing theyd fallen from a temple window the tree having grown half embedded in the temples exterior wall was rooted in a tiny patch of earth at the edge of the plateau over the edge was a thousandfoot drop into the tsangpo gorge sam heard a groan below him he craned his neck down and spotted russell lying on his back next to the tree his eyes were open and staring directly into sams his face twisted in pain russell sat up his right hand slid down his pant leg and jerked it up his calf strapped to his boot was a holster russell grabbed the butt of the revolver dont russell sam said go to hell sam extended his arm and laid the s front sight over russells chest dont he warned again russell unbuckled the holster and slid out the revolver last chance sam said russells hand began to rise sam shot him in the chest he let out a gasp then fell backward lifeless eyes staring at the sky led by her wildly dancing headlamp remi charged through the archway bullets thunked into the stone around her remi spun blindly fired two shots back the way she had come then turned and kept running she stumbled back into the corridor the pit was up the slope to her left remi turned right and continued on half limping half sprinting ahead her headlamp flicked over a dark circle in the floor it was another shaft in pain and with her injured ankle quickly failing her remi tried to swerve around the shaft but slipped and tumbled through the opening the fall was mercifully short perhaps half the depth of the first pit remi landed hard on her butt this time the pain was too intense to contain she screamed she rolled over looking for her gun it was gone she needed something anything marjorie was coming remis headlamp came to rest next to a wooden object even before her conscious mind had told her what the object was her senses were processing it dark wood thick black lacquer no visible seams she reached out snagged the edge of the box with her fingertips and rolled it toward her in the bright cone of light from her headlamp remi saw four symbols four lowa characters in a grid pattern gotcha marjorie dropped from the opening above and landed like a cat at remis feet marjorie having slung the machine gun across her back for the jump now reached back and grabbed the stock she brought it around toward remi not today remi shouted she grabbed the theurang box with both hands raised it over her head then bolted upright and slammed it into marjories forehead pinned by remis headlamp beam marjories face went slack with blood streaming down her forehead her eyes rolled upward she fell backward and went still stunned remi scooted backward until she was pressed against solid stone she closed her eyes some time later a sound penetrated her halfconscious mind remi remi sam im here she shouted down here thirty seconds later sams face appeared at the top of the shaft are you okay i may need a little checkup but im alive is that what i think it is remi patted the theurang box beside her i just happened upon it pure dumb luck is marjorie dead i dont think so but i hit her pretty hard she may never be the same again an improvement then are you ready to come up sam now armed with russells machine gun had made his way back to the main tunnel unsure of zhilans location he simply grabbed his backpack and found his way to the second pit and remi thirty minutes later they were both back in the great room together they reeled marjories limp body up the shaft sam handed remi the machine gun then scooped up marjorie and folded her across his shoulder keep an eye out for the dragon lady he told remi if you see her shoot first and forget the questions as they neared the tunnel exit remi stopped do you hear that yes someones whistling a smile spread across sams face its rule britannia cautiously sam and remi stepped out of the tunnel sitting twenty feet away his back against a boulder was jack karna he spotted them and stopped whistling he gave them a cheery wave tallyho fargos oh wait that rhymes how clever of me dumbfounded sam and remi walked toward him as they drew nearer they could see tufts of white emergency dressing jutting from a scarf tied around karnas neck he was cradling ajays beretta in his lap a few feet away zhilan hsu lay flat on her back her head propped up by ajays balledup parka wrapped around the midpoint of each of her thighs was a bloody field dressing zhilan was awake she glared at them but said nothing remi said jack i think an explanation is in order quite as it turns out russell is a good shot but not an expert marksman i believe he was trying to shoot through me and get ajay in the process his damned bullet punched through that muscle what its called between the shoulder and the neck trapezius sam offered yes thats it two inches to the right and id be a goner are you in pain remi asked of course a monumental amount say whats that youre carrying lovely remi a little something we found lying around remi set it down beside karna he smiled and gave the lid a pat what about her sam asked ah the dragon lady very simple really she thought i was dead she let her guard down as she approached i grabbed ajays gunthis one hereand shot her in the right leg then again in the left leg for good measure i think it took the wind out of her sails dont you id say so sam turned to zhilan he crouched down and dumped marjorie on the ground beside her zhilan reached out and touched her daughters face sam and remi watched stunned as zhilans eyes brimmed with tears shes alive sam told her and russell no you killed him you killed my son only because he gave me no choice said sam then i will kill you sam fargo you can try but think about this first we could have left marjorie in there to die we didnt jack could have killed you he didnt youre here because of your husband he sent you and your children to do his dirty work and now one of them is dead were getting off this mountain and were taking you with us as soon as we get to a phone were going to call the fbi and tell them everything we know youve got a choice to make do you want to be a witness or a defendant alongside your husband no matter what youre going to jail but depending on how you play your cards marjorie might have a chance remi said how old is she twentytwo shes got a long life ahead of her its largely up to you how she spends it free and out from under her fathers thumb or in prison zhilans hateful stare suddenly gave out her face went slack as though she had just let down a heavy burden she said what would i need to do tell the fbi everything you know about charles kings illegal dealingsevery nasty thing hes ever done or ordered you to do on his behalf remi said a smart lady like you ill bet youre a big believer in insurance you have a very thick file on king stashed away somewhere dont you whats it going to be sam asked zhilan hesitated then nodded good choice jack we seem to have misplaced our radios i have mine right here get on the line and try to raise gupta its time to get out of here epilogue kathmandu nepal weeks later sam and remis rescue from the shangrila temple mountain had unfolded without any dilemma as he had promised gupta had orbited the area listening and waiting for their call he returned and picked them up four hours after they left chinese airspace gupta landed the chetak at itanagar airport since they were the only witnesses to what had occurred on the mountain aside from the deceased z crew no one in the chinese government was aware of the incursion as far as anyone knew gupta and his passengers had simply been on a sightseeing tour after a brief checkup at an itanagar hospital sam and remi were dismissed marjorie was kept overnight for observation like her father she was hardheaded suffering only a mild concussion from remis blow karna refused medical attention until he was across the border in nepal but had his entry and exit bullet wounds cleaned and dressed by gupta after lengthy conversations with rube haywood sam arranged for zhilan hsu and marjorie to be discreetly and securely transported to washington dc where special agents of the fbi were waiting for them during interrogation zhilan hsu held nothing back about charles king according to rube the fbi and the justice department had formed a task force devoted to unraveling kings many illicit operations it was predicted that king would spend the rest of his life behind bars the nepalese government and their scientific community kept the chest under close security while their chief anthropologist ramos shadar and his associates had time to study its contents it was decided the discovery of the golden man and the shangrila temples location should be kept secret until they were ready to be revealed to the world now the time had come cheers remi announced holding up her glass of champagne the rest of the assemblagesam jack karna adala kaalrami sushant dharel and ramos shadarechoed the toast and clinked glasses now its time for the unveiling said shadar smiling im sure youve all been anxious for this moment to the theurang remi said softly they climbed the stairs to the stage in kathmandu universitys marbletiled exhibition hall the official unveiling and media conference would not happen until the following evening but sam remi and the others were being honored with a private viewing whos going to be the first of you to lift the lid and see the golden man asked shadar knowing well what lay inside and already amused at how the others would react who would like the privilege of lifting the lid no question about it sam replied jack deserves to be first mr karna said shadar motioning toward the chest if you please tears brimming in his eyes karna nodded his thanks to the group then walked to a low velvetdraped object slowly with great reverence he grasped the draw cord and pulled the chest of the theurang lay open with the lid lying alongside they all stared in awe except shadar lying inside curled in a fetal position was a nearly complete fossilized skeleton completely gilded in gold under the overhead lights of the stage the sight was aweinspiring everyone went silent for several seconds finally jack karna muttered why is he so small it looks like a little boy said remi softly no more than three years old cant be much over three feet tall guessed sam shadar grinned three feet two inches to be exact the weight we estimated at about fifty pounds its brain was about the size of a soft baseball it must be fake adala kaalrami spoke for the first time shadar shook his head you may not believe it but youre looking at a thirtyyearold human being we can arrive at a reasonably close age by the wear on the teeth and bone
