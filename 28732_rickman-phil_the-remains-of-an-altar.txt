the remains of an altar phil rickman part one the bible record is unmistakable in its references to the old straight track as having partly or wholly gone out of use the ancient high places are in possession of the enemy my people have forgotten me they stumble in their ways from the ancient paths alfred watkins the old straight track on the bald hill more than a day later there was still wreckage around a twisted door panel across the ditch and slivers of tyre like shed snakeskin in the grass it had rained last night and the rev s d spicers cassock was hemmed with wet mud what might have been a piece of someones bloodstiffened sleeve was snagged in brambles coiling like rolls of barbed wire from the hedge the countryside violated wasnt letting go it felt to merrily as if the air was still vibrating other vehicle was an ancient land rover defender spicer said mustve been like driving into a cliff face ground mist was draped like muslin over the hedges and down the bank and the early sun lit the windows of a turreted house in the valley looking back along the road merrily could see no obvious blind spots no overhanging trees boy died in the ambulance spicer nodded at the metallic red door panel crumpled and creased like thrownaway chocolate paper took the fire brigade best part of an hour getting him out the car fortunately he was unconscious the whole time merrily shook her head slowly the way you did when there was nothing to be said no act of violence as sudden and savage massive and unstoppable as a headon car crash she was thinking inevitably of jane and eirion out at night in eirions small car one momentary lapse of attention a snatched caress and he was in his midtwenties lincoln cookman from north worcester the girl no hurry to get her out shed had her window wide open no seat belt head almost taken off on impact sonia maloney from droitwich oh god merrily took a step back how old bout nineteen spicers london accent was as flat as a rubber mat all horribly brutal and unsightly but mercifully quick no suffering except of course for preston devereaux sorry preston local farmer and chairman of the parish council and as it happened the driver of the land rover returning late from a family wedding oh hell really couldve been any of us mrs watkins parish councils been asking for speed cameras since last autumn not that that wouldve made a difference state these kids mustve been in they come over from worcester places like that at the weekends windows open music blasting sixtyfive seventy wrong side of the road poor guys still reliving it hell need a bit of support my job i think and what erm whats mine exactly mr spicer it was a reasonable question but he didnt answer parish priests would often have difficulty explaining why theyd resorted to deliverance spicer had been terse and cagey on the phone yesterday can you come early before eight am in civvies best not make a carnival out of it ok just gone on a monday morning and here she was in discreet civvies jeans and a sweatshirt and heres the rector all kitted out cassock collar pectoral cross merrily felt wrongfooted why would he want that shed never met him before didnt even know his first name never been to this village before out on the eastern rim of the diocese where it rose into the ramparts of worcestershire well the point is spicer said this is the worst but its not exactly the first you mean its an accident black spot sometimes when a stretch of road acquired a reputation for accidents someone would suggest that a bad pattern had been established and youd be asked to bless it one of those increasingly commonplace roadside rituals support for all the roadkill wreaths laid out by bereaved relatives how did all that start anyway it was a job for the local guy unless there were complications how many actual accidents have there been mr spicer he didnt respond he was standing quite still shortish and thickset with sparse greying hair shaved tight to his head and small blank eyes that seemed to be on his face rather than embedded there like a teddy bears eyes merrily thought poor man sophie had said last night on the phone she took the children of course it was as though some part of spicer had withdrawn the way a computer relaxed into its screensaver not many people could do this in the presence of a stranger especially clergy who unless they were in a church tended to treat silence like a vacuum into which doubt and unbelief might enter if it wasnt filled with chatter however inane ok whatever merrily let the silence hang and looked up at the tiered ramparts of the sculpted fortresshill called herefordshire beacon also known as british camp this was the most prominent landmark in the malverns where the celts were said to have held out against the romans the misty sun was hovering over it like a whitecowled lamp the name malvern came from the welsh moel bryn meaning bald hill and bald it still was up on the tops of this startling volcanic ridge while the foothills and the alpinelooking valleys were lush with orchards and the gardens of summer villas wellpreserved remains of elgars england three four now spicer said maybe even five including this one thats inside a couple of months one was a lorry took a chunk out of the church wall and on a stretch of road as open as this i suppose thats drivers reckoned they swerved to avoid a ghost spicer said his tone hadnt altered and his eyes remained limpid a wood pigeons hollow call was funnelled out of the valley that took a while to come out didnt it merrily said come back to the house he turned away well talk about it there uncle alfie after very little sleep jane awoke all sweating and confused on one level she was lit up with excitement on another fired by the wrongness of things injustice greed sacrilege bastards the thinness of the light showed that it was still early but the mondrian walls were already aglow ancient timberframed squares once wattle and daub then plastered and whitewashed and finally overpainted by jane herself in defiant reds and blues and oranges it was more than two years since shed coloured the squares just a kid then disoriented by the move to this antiquated village with a mother who used to be normal and had suddenly turned into a bloody priest just a kid determined to make her mark janes here now jane takes no shit this is janes apartment this is the way jane does things ok in a seventeenthcentury vicarage it wouldnt have been at all ok with the listedbuildings police but it had seemed unlikely that theyd ever come beating on the door with a warrant to investigate the attic looking back mum had been seriously good about it letting jane establish a personal suite up here and splatter the walls with coloured paint they couldnt really afford and never once suggesting that it might look just a bit crap but that was over two years ago and now jane was christ seventeen and this onceimportant gesture these oncedeeplysymbolic walls were looking entirely irredeemably naff not even much like a mondrian in the middle of an alevel art course she could say that with some certainty more like a sodding nursery school decision the mondrian walls would have to go you were in no position to fight senseless public vandalism if you couldnt identify your own small crimes that sorted jane sat up in bed and looked out of the window at the real issue full of the breathless excitement of new discovery and a lowburning rage which shed have to admit was also a serious turnon below her beyond the front hedge lay ledwardine this black and white oakframed village embellished with old gold by the early sun defended against neon and advertising hoardings by the same guys who wouldve freaked if theyd ever been exposed to the mondrian walls while totally missing the big picture the focus of which was just beyond the village a green wooded pyramid rising out of a flimsy loincloth of mist cole hill shed always assumed that it had simply been named after somebody called cole whod tried to farm it a few centuries ago now cole hill it sang with glamour jane sank back into the pillows last nights images coalescing around her the slipping sun and the line across the meadow drifting down from the hill with the blackening steeple of ledwardine church marking the way like the gnomon on the sundial of the village amazing inspirational but like for how long tumbling out of bed she dislodged from the table the paperback old straight track shed been reading until about two am photo on the back of benignlooking bearded old guy glasses on his nose alfred watkins of hereford county councillor magistrate businessman antiquarian photographer inventor allround solid citizen and visionary jane watkins picked up the book you and me uncle this book well it had been around the vicarage as long as jane had and shed thought she must have read it ages ago only realizing a week or so back that all shed done was leaf through it looking at watkinss pioneering photos assuming his ideas were long outdated his findings revised by more enlightened thinking now because of this alevel project shed finally read it cover to cover twice feeling the heat of a blazing inspiration and it was all so close mum was probably right when she said there was no family link and yet it was as if this longdead guy with the same name was communicating with jane along one of his own mysterious straight lines saying help me jane turned her back on the clashing imperatives of the mondrian walls stumbled to the bathroom and ran the shower she needed backup on this one two years ago telling mum would have been a total nono the issue too leftfield and the gulf between them too wide two years ago the sight of mum kneeling to pray would have jane shrivelling up inside with embarrassment and resentment but now she was older and mum was also more balanced a lot less rigid except for the rumble of the old aga and the rhythmic sandpaper sound of ethel washing her paws on the rug in front of it the kitchen was silent jane found a note on the table it said j youve probably forgotten all about this but had to leave early this morning to meet paranoid rector in the malverns thicksliced loaf in bread bin eggs in basket dont forget to leave dried food out for ethel sorry about this flower see you after school love m flower like she was seven but yeah she had forgotten in fact thered been so much on her mind when shed come in last night from cole hill that shed hardly listened to anything mum had said before pleading fatigue and bounding up to the apartment to research research research well into the early hours until shed finally fallen asleep jane left the note on the table went to find the dried catfood for ethel and grab a handful of biscuits from the tin no time for eggs and toast what about school what about not going she didnt remember ever bunking off before but some things were too important for delays and anyway school was winding down now towards the long summer break trying to open the biscuit tin she found she was still gripping the old straight track having brought it down with her like a talisman on the front was a misty photograph of a perfect bronze age burial mound swelling behind a fan of winter trees yesterday evening at sunset shed seen and she must have been around there a dozen times in the past without spotting it what must surely be the remains of a burial mound or tumulus or tump on the edge of the orchard behind church street the magical things you could so easily miss bypass ignore or destroy jane felt this swelling sense of responsibility towards a man who had already been dead for well over half a century when she was born you and me uncle alfie for the views must have been in one of janes pagan books that merrily had read how in primitive communities the local shaman was often a social outcast both feared and derided being a female exorcist in the church of england gave you some idea of what this must have been like deliverance consultant the reverend spicer was shaking his head wearily what exactly does that you know shed watched him moving around pulling down tea caddy mugs milk and sugar from strong beechwood units he knew where everything was after what sophie had told her in the office shed been halfexpecting some kind of desperate chaos in the rectory kitchen unwashed dishes layers of congealed fat on the stove but it was clean and functional if not exactly cosy he spilled a single blob of milk frowned and ran a dishcloth over it i know what exorcist used to mean deliverance is a bit more and consultant that just means i dont get involved personally unless im invited to on the basis that these slightly iffy things are usually best handled by the guy on the ground which would be you mr spicer call me syd he opened a cutlery drawer extracted two spoons you ever done an exorcism minor exorcism mainly requiem eucharist for the unquiet dead variations on that never had to stop a small child abusing herself with a crucifix never been sprayed with green bile although naturally i live in hope you got this all the time a recent survey had shown that more people in britain believed in ghosts than in god whereas parish priests still tended to believe in some kind of god but often had a problem with ghosts even more of a problem with exorcism last refuge of anachronistic misfits in the desperately modern c of e spicer didnt smile behind him on the rayburn the kettle hissed so what qualifies for a minor exorcism usually an unhappy atmosphere that doesnt respond to concentrated prayer would you like me to lend you a book thatd take care of the consultant bit i think i need the personal service he sat down opposite her im just not sure frankly about where you merrily sighed that other familiar barbed hurdle my spiritual director is a bloke called huw owen runs deliverance training courses in the brecon beacons yeah i know the area his small passive eyes said too well curious at the end of the course he gave me the regulation warning told me ordained women were becoming the prime target for every psychotic grinder of the satanic mills who ever sacrificed a chicken therefore a woman exorcist might as well paint a big bullseye between her on her chest maybe you saw it as a bit of a challenge spicer decently didnt look at merrilys chest a chance to carry womens ministry into a dark and forbidden area well no the point im making im not a militant feminist im not a postfeminist im not pioneer material and im not honestly he held up his hands i dont have a problem with women priests nor even women deliverance consultants in principle so the problem is the kettle came whistling to the boil problem is he said taking it seriously as youre bound to do being comparatively new to the job and with the side issue of the womens ministry still having something to prove it occurs to me you might not be up for what could be a pr exercise youve lost me i mean if i as rector of wychehill were to ask you as official diocesan exorcist to perform a public ceremony of shall we say spiritual cleansing whatever you wanna call it simply to make the community feel happier take some pressure off off whom merrily reached down to her shoulder bag cigarettes off me for a start spicer poured boiling water into a deep brown teapot see these people who say they had an accident because they swerved to avoid a spectral figure on the queens highway im having difficulty with it theyre decent people but thats ok merrily brought out the silk cut and the dented zippo really to a stranger the road was the least ghostly aspect of upper wychehill it glided down the valley in a long slow slope with the wooded hills hunched behind it like a giants shoulders as many of its dwellings were invisible it had been hard to make out where the village began and where it ended the reason why many of the homes were invisible was that they were on different levels with rows of houses above and below the road the ones above were set back into the hill and the ones falling away below it all you could see of them as you drove past were hedges walls and gates they seemed to be mainly bungalows with colonial verandas or flagged patios with sundials and statuary barbecues and big views across herefordshire the few grey buildings at road level were weighted by the church this immense neogothic barn probably latevictorian screened by two substantial oak trees either side of the entrance further down built of the same stone with a dramatic view of the beacon was the rectory a big family house with a homemade swing in the front garden from what merrily understood from sophie the spicer kids had been long past the swing stage but it still looked starkly symbolic of loss with its peeling frame and one side of the wooden seat fallen off its chain when they were inside shed asked spicer without thinking if he had help in the house what a cleaner a housekeeper hed laughed do you point taken no private income i get occasional offers hed said weve got several nice ladies in upper wychehill the ladies of wychehill that sound like a book listen first rule for the solo priest dont give anybody room for gossip my wife left just over three months ago since then ive done all my own cleaning cooking gardening painting the lot plus keeping three parishes on the go which makes for a long day hed looked at her his softtoys eyes unmoving but a mercifully short night outside the bay window the stillshadowed long back lawn was tidily mown and trimmed but had no flowers it ended where a bank of fir trees lifted the land into the hills i can give you a list of people to talk to so you can make up your own mind syd spicer crossed to the rayburn you want some toast or i can do full english im fairly capable i can see that teall be fine thanks he brought two white mugs to the table and then sugar and milk point is mrs watkins country areas merrily do you think yeah ok country areas merrily are superstitious just like theyve always been you know this where are you based north herefordshire ledwardine bout an hour from here he nodded only nowadays the superstition comes from a different direction the locals might be less credulous than their grandparents were but your citybred incomers always include the kind of people whore living in the sticks because they want to get back to a primitive belief system theyre the ones who organize the wassailing and stuff at christmas dangle charms off their porches everything except go to church merrily said but if you have an accident black spot theyll be the first to suggest the area might be haunted spicer shook his head sadly ive got three parishes and the others are a healthy mix of locals and new blood in upper wychehill a real local person is somebody whos been here twentyfive years it didnt really exist until the s when the church was built gesture of apology by the owner of one of the quarry firms mutilating the malverns he must have been very sorry yeah big innit especially in the middle of a few farms and not much else as it was then the bloke saw it as a concert hall as well however strictly religious of course same time he had this house built for the minister and a sum of money donated to the church to pay him long exhausted of course but by then more housing had gone up and it was a legit parish so what youre saying its not not a real village no just a mess of mixedup dwellings either side of a road with no pavement so people never walk about and they rarely meet each other some are weekend cottages bloke died in one last year wasnt found for three weeks thats the way it is no village shop no cosy pub just a church that was always too big and people who move here for the views spicer had taken a folded piece of notepaper out of his cassock he opened it out and placed it on the table in front of merrily dear rector i am sorry to bother you and i never thought i would write a letter like this but i am worried sick about my daughter who as you know is a district nurse and has to go out at all hours in her car i am terrified that something will happen to her on that road these stories are hard to credit but something is wrong here i do not get to church as often as i would like since i have become disabled but i beg of you to take whatever measures are necessary to deal with this problem i do not care who or what it is it must be got rid of by whatever means are open to you i feel foolish writing a letter like this but helen is all i have left in this world yours sincerely d h walford poor old donald his wife died three years ago daughter got divorced and moved in with him hes an entirely rational man retired primary school head but this this is how it escalates what was the first reported accident lorry came across the road into the church wall like i said still waiting for the insurance to get sorted did you talk to the driver i was out at the time but the guy told mrs aird who does the flowers in the church she was in there when it happened he said hed seen this white orb coming towards him down the middle of the road so this was at night early morning police suggested the bloke had been driving too long we tidied up the wall thought no more about it until week or so later tim loste the choirmaster hit a telegraph pole not injured fortunately and then there was a woman lives up the hill flattened her sports car on a tourists winnebago and they both saw this light they both saw a figure behind the light he turned to the window the summer sun had finally penetrated his flowerless garden but it still looked as if it was clinging to winter syd spicer too merrily thought as he turned to face her and there might be another one which is a bit weird joyce aird can tell you they wont talk to me about it joyce was waiting for me after the worship yesterday wed had some prayers for the victims of the night before and joyce said she gave me a piece of paper with your phone number on it which shed obtained from the diocese said it was time to seek help to remove the evil from our midst so essentially you had me forced on you merrily said me ive been telling them lets get the council in surveyors examine the road camber lets not get carried away famous last words what about the land rover driver the chairman of the parish council did he see i havent even asked him merrily she sighed would you mind if i had a cigarette spicer put his head on one side you disapprove he shrugged i have one occasionally when i want to you go ahead if you need one doesnt matter merrily dropped the silk cut back into her shoulder bag you said there was something a bit weird oh well that joyce wouldnt talk about it not to me said it was best discussed with a woman i suppose im getting a bit i can imagine she lowered her bag to the floor how do you want me to go about this well thats up to you merrily but the way some of them are reacting im not sure that a simple blessing of the road would be quite enough i suppose id like you to talk to them well obviously id have to no i mean all of them all of them everybody syd spicer said a very public ghost all of them sophie said in the cathedral gatehouse office are you sure you know what youre doing at a public meeting merrily sighed its a very public ghost merrily sophie looked pained has there ever been such a thing as a public ghost merrily thought about this elbows on the desk chin cupped in her palms shed been thinking about it for many of the fifty gridlocked minutes shed spent watching guys in cranes playing passthegirder on the site of another new superstore that hereford didnt need no she said in the real sense i suppose not there you are then sophie said let the rector have his public meeting and then you go along afterwards quietly and do what you think is necessary sophie hill crisp white blouse and pearls very posh discreet as a ballot box the bishops lay secretary who essentially didnt work for people or organizations who worked for the cathedral except on mondays when sophie worked more or less fulltime for deliverance for most parish priests monday was a welldefended day off for merrily only a day off from the parish monday was when she and sophie met in the gatehouse office at the cathedral to deal with the mail and the deliverance database and to monitor outstanding cases i need to remind you that the crown prosecution service have warned that you may still be called to give evidence in the underhowle case when it finally comes to trial and on that issue aftercare the new minister there would welcome some discreet advice on as he puts it disinfecting the former baptist chapel in which case i might need to go over could we stall him until next week if he could just keep it locked meantime keep people out next week also youve agreed to talk to that rather persistent womens institute in the golden valley unfair to postpone again dont look like that you agreed ok problem here was that wis always wanted lurid anecdotes and this was a small county populationwise one of the audience would always be able to fit names into whichever sensitive issue you were discussing the policy was to avoid wis but occasionally one squeezed through the net and sure there was a pile of parish stuff accumulating on the diary including a christening tomorrow and two weddings looming big months for weddings june and july so what youre telling me sophie is that i really dont need wychehill sophie said nothing what if i walk away now and it happens again oh for heavens sake merrily what if it happens again after youve been involved which it sometimes did hence the need for aftercare there are still two people dead and while linking that to something paranormal is deep water id feel safer going along even if it means opening the whole thing up at a public meeting i mean i can understand spicers problem hes got a worried community which he says isntreally a community at all houses are widely separated people dont know one another he wants to make sure that everybody at least has a chance to find out what the score is merrily deliverance is about discretion how many times have you said that you dont like addressing wis about past cases but youre perfectly happy to im not happy to discuss an ongoing problem with a roomful of people probably including the media i dont think the press would cover anything that local do you hope not you dont think sophie said thats hardly satisfactory is it id be inclined to get the rector to absolutely guarantee it whats the format going to be i listen to the evidence and then outline the options oh i see you present them with a series of options and then they vote on it no i listen to what they have to say and then i make a recommendation based on my experience sophie gave merrily a resigned look and opened the desk diary when is it and where wednesday evening at the church they havent got a village hall in wychehill i think it was converted this gets tagged on to the end of the bimonthly parish meeting which is open to the publiclook im not going to go in cold sophie im going to check it all out thoroughly in which case you really dont have much time which is why unless you can think of anything more pressing i think id better go back there now merrily walked over to the window there was something else oh yeah sophie have there been any inquiries to the diocese from wychehill anybody asking for my number no id have been told im very strict about that and they dont give out your number they give this number in the first instance why nothing really merrily looked out of the window over the cathedral green and sunny broad street with its library and museum its extensive hotel its classicalpillared roman catholic church its shops and cafes and at least two wellattested ghost stories that she could think of from behind merrily heard the faint clinking of the chain on sophies glasses as she shook her head in sorrow with just a hint merrily thought of foreboding between the lines on top of the hill there was a clearing and the remains of what might have been a cairn of stones lol had never been all the way up before but jane had said there was something of serious serious importance here and not just to her or even to the whole community of ledwardine this was possibly a national treasure shed dragged him out to the edge of the village and then across the main road and over the fields to the first stile which had a public footpath sign next to it but if there ever had been a footpath it was long overgrown and it had been a steep and slippery climb to the top of cole hill you cant see much now jane said among the gorse clumps on the summit but there was a celtic settlement here once so obviously that makes it ledwardines holy hill right if you say so lol had felt slightly uncomfortable about walking through the woods with his girlfriends daughter her navel exposed below the sawnoff summer top no actually it wasnt so much this as her attitude intense no frivolity jane carrying a sense of purpose like storm clouds around her intimations of war now she was telling him about the name how in the old straight track alfred watkins had identified three other cole hills or similar in herefordshire one definition of the word apparently was juggler or wizard coleprophet thats another ancient term jane said so cole hill serious serious magical associations lol i hadnt realized that and if i hadnt realized it jane stood in the sunlight her hair was pulled back and her eyes seemed to be full of tiny sparks we live in an enchanted landscape laurence and most of us just dont see any of it any more how dispiriting is that below them the village was wrapped in greenery and the mist made smoke rings around the church steeple the view was dizzyingly seductive you felt that if you fell into it it would just absorb you and by the time you reached the ground youd have evaporated lol shook his head his day had already been tilted monday mornings he needed to establish a work pattern for the week sit at the desk by the window write songs his livelihood what he did what he was supposed to do so why had he been almost grateful to see jane crossing the street from the vicarage wearing her skimpy orange top and her sense of purpose jane said she had the day off school to work on a project connected with alevel art a portfolio she was compiling on landscape mysteries something in connection with this that she needed to discuss and merrily had gone off early to meet some angsty priest so like if lol could spare just one hour all around cole hill the paths were overgrown there were broken stiles and barbedwire fences it had taken most of an hour just to get here jane shouldered her canvas bag nobody comes up here now and thats wrong we all need to go to the high places it says that in the bible so even mum had you been to this particular high place before jane she frowned im here now thats what matters its where the ancient energy is drawn down to feed the village spiritually to feed its soul you know alfred watkins actually said that did he about feeding energy into ledwardine not exactly but he would have said it if he hadnt been a magistrate and stuff with civic duties and all that crap you have to read between the lines lol right lol would have to agree that reading alfred watkins entirely altered your awareness of the humps and bumps of the countryside the way watkinss own had been altered when hed stood on top of a hill not far from here and noticed in a flaring of wild revelation how ancient sites from prehistoric stones and mounds to medieval churches seemed to have been arranged in straight lines but watkins had seen them as the earliest british trackways most of the rest was new age conjecture so what do we do now jane watch the church keep watching the steeple the steeple must have been half a mile away at least but from up here you felt you could prick your hand on the tip of the weathercock beyond it to the west you could see distant hay bluff over the mist a dent in the sky at the end of the black mountains jane put on her sunglasses and then we walk towards it lol followed her keeping a few feet behind sure now that something else was bothering her some problem between her and eirion theyd been together a long time maybe too long for teenagers we came up the easy way jane said over her shoulder but we have to follow a different route down to more or less keep to the line the path zigzags a bit but if we keep the steeple in view eirion ok jane fine her voice was a little too light off to uni in september where depends on his alevel results oxford if he does well bristol or cardiff if he fluffs or if he really fluffs one of these joints that used to be an fe college until like last week i see i mean its ridiculous how like everybody has to go somewhere you need a degree to be a hospital porter now you probably need a degree in like hygiene studies to clean lavatories its jane slid on a small scree of pebbles and grabbed a sapling to keep from falling all complete and total bullshit just a stalinist government scam to destroy the individual get everybody into a slot result is youve got people walking round with a string of letters after their name and theyre like you know homer simpson so you er lol thought he was beginning to get the picture if eirion does well you wont see as much of each other will you a grey squirrel scurried up a fir tree ahead of them i just dont see why jane said i mean why why do you have to waste precious years being lectured to by all these hopeless losers so you can wind up with some totally meaningless qualification that everybody else has got why cant you just do stuff original stuff i mean you did you got something original in mind they climbed over a rotting stile on the edge of a decaying copse at the foot of cole hill jane waited for lol she was squeezing her hands together i want to find out things for myself like not formalized curriculum shit that just qualifies you to be like every other she spun away she might have been in tears she moved rapidly through the trees and out to where another stile had been strung with barbed wire when lol reached her she was bent over the wire breathing hard the canvas bag was at her feet she had both hands around a pair of wirecutters jane its supposed to be a public footpath nobody has any right to two ends of barbed wire sprang apart and jane stepped back jane where did you get the wirecutters gomer jane clambered over the stile you coming all his foreboding becoming justified lol climbed over the stile and stumbled after jane through tall grass holding his hands up above the nettles they came to a fivebarred gate set into an overgrown hedge strands of orange binder twine hanging loose from it i pulled that off last night jane opened the gate now look at that what just look lol closed the gate behind him and stood and looked he saw a gently sloping meadow full of hereford cows redbrown and cream classic you didnt see enough herefords in herefordshire these days but that clearly wasnt what jane had meant oh lol said i see like the shadow of a tall pole a path cut directly across the meadow a visible path that could have been contructed or simply made by sheep crossing the field from gate to gate dead straight from the gate theyd just come through to another one at a slight angle in the hedge at the bottom of the field both gates and the path were directly aligned with the smokey sepia steeple of ledwardine church lol walked towards the centre of the field keeping to the path and turned to see that the path was perfectly aligned in the opposite direction with the top of cole hill some of watkinss lines demanded imagination but this one spoke for itself jane stood on the line as if she was standing before an altar although the sun was high and warm lol saw her shiver she wrapped her bare arms around herself before you reach the village theres a mound just inside the orchard behind church street its not marked on the map but it must be an ancient burial site if only by its position in the landscape absolutely on the line like its not very high now but a lot of them arent any more theyve been ploughed in over the centuries and then on the other side of the mound youre dead on course across the market place for the church youve convinced me lol said its a nice one and and lol if you continue the line through the church ive only done this on the map but it works it totally works within a mile on the other side youve got an ancient crossroads and a genuine prehistoric standing stone which is not very big but is actually marked on the map well congratulations lol said youve found a new ley line ley jane snapped alfred watkins called them leys ley lines thats just a term thats been adopted in almost a disparaging way by socalled experts who say they dont exist and ok some of them you can draw the line by circling the sites on the map but when you go there you cant really see it but this textbook lol said i suppose i mean i cant claim any credit except maybe for rediscovering it this side of the hills been more or less hidden away for years probably since the orchards went into decline and oh yeah you know what this fields called colemans meadow geddit the field where the track was laid out by the cole man the shaman the wizard and you can feel it cant you jane stamped a foot come on lol youre an artist a poet do not tell me you cannot feel it well you stand on the track and youre like totally connected with the landscape and with the ancestors who lived here and marked out the sacred paths thousands of years ago when people were more in contact with the elements so like whether or not you believe the leys channelled some form of mystical lifeforce through the land or they were spirit paths where you could walk with the dead or whatever i dont care i dont need to understand the science i just need to know that i can stand here and feel im you know part of something bigger belong its probably the most any of us can ever hope for lol said to belong somewhere they stood quietly for a few seconds you could hear neither the sounds of the village nor the traffic on the main road only birdsong and the grass wrenched from the meadow in the jaws of the herefords the sun was already high caught in its glare jane in her yellow croptop looked young and uncertain i need some information off you lol for this project sort of i need to know who decides what happens around here like with the council and stuff i mean i think i know the basics just want to be sure before i make a move a move oh hell jane looked at her feet jane what this day off school to work on the project look jane said its nearly the end of term the exams are over nobody really cares and this is a major crisis and anyway its connected with the project which is about how artists have dealt with earth mysteries the secret harmonies in the landscape youre not making this very clear jane all right jane unfolded her arms and pointed you want it made clear go and read it what it says on that sign a small placard was affixed to the gate on the opposite side of the field lol wandered over on the other side of the fivebarred gate the path broadened out and he saw that he was in the orchard at the back of his own cottage which fronted on to church street when he looked back janes ley was no longer obvious which presumably was why shed brought him down from the hill lol adjusted his glasses and read what it said on the sign which was headed herefordshire council planning department what it said basically was that an application had been submitted to turn colemans meadow into an estate of twentyfour highquality detached executive homes it invited observations from the public oh lol turned at a click of the latch on the gate to find that jane had followed him only theyll need to kill me first jane said the sunset chair joyce airds drive sloped steeply down from the road in a tunnel of dark trees it was like entering a badger set until you emerged into a vastness of light oh dear mrs aird said your sins always find you out dont they yes bring that chair out dear we can sit together in the window bring your tea the sunlounge overlooked the valley across the long village of colwall and on and on over herefordshire all the way to the black mountains and wales how did you know mrs aird had the kind of west midlands accent which wore anxiety like old and trusted slippers she was about seventyfive softfeatured and with lightly blonded hair oh merrily put down the cane chair with its thick padded seat its just that if anyones inquired about exorcism the arrangement is that the office tells me or our secretary sophie and nobody seems to have well no i never rang the diocese thats just what i told mr spicer hes a good man mr spicer at the bottom of him give him his due but hes a man isnt he and he has had a lot of personal problems lately i thought hes just not going to do anything is he and i was telling a friend we used to be neighbours when i lived in the forest of dean and weve kept in touch and i was telling her on the phone about what had happened and she immediately said i should get the rector to ask for you thats how i got the number her names ingrid sollars oh that was ok nothing wrong with ingrid sollars yes she was involved in a problem we had shes a nice woman a much stronger person than me im afraid i get very frightened about things i dont well none of us understands them do we we cant were not supposed to but ingrid gave me your number and she said youd take it seriously but it would be best to go through the rector for political reasons but i get so frightened now you see mrs aird had a single lonely chair in the window called it her sunset chair never missed a sunset you could just see herefordshire beacon on the far left but nothing of the road although you could hear the traffic above you like a sporadic draught in the attic i used to think it was better this time of year with the holiday cottages starting to fill up and the village more like a real village ive got to know some of the holiday people and theyre quite nice gave me their keys to go in and make sure their cottages were all right switch the heating on in winter made me feel useful and i thought it made them feel more welcome so maybe theyd stay for a bit but ive had to give the keys back i dont like to go into a strange house alone any more well would you merrily must have looked blank because mrs aird leaned forward going into a whisper there was a poor man a bit solitary whod come in the summer for weeks at a time and we never knew whether he was there or not and one day someone noticed all the flies mrs aird gripped the arms of her chair shuddering merrily apprehensively balanced her tea in its willowpattern china cup on her knee doesnt the rector go to see people well he does comes to see me about once a week but then im a regular churchgoer but some people dont like it see it as an intrusion as if hes going to evangelize but of course mr spicers not like that is he and hes got these other parishes to look after and hes on his own too now not been easy for him with his wife and his daughter and everything thats happened mrs aird sat with her arms folded looking expectant you were there when the lorry driver it was like an explosion mrs watkins i have a key to the church and id gone in early to put the flowers out because there was a funeral that day mrs hatch a mercy and bang i went rushing out and the cab of the lorry was almost flattened on the drivers side he had to come out of the other door i brought him in here and i gave him a cup of tea while we were waiting for the police and the breakdown people he had his hands to his eyes just thinking about it and he said ill always remember he said it was like a little sun but it wasnt a sunny day it was later but it was very dull then only about half past seven when the police came they breathalysed him straight away and he was completely clear they said he couldnt have seen a light but he insisted that was why hed swerved and he was a nice man not young one of the policemen said to me afterwards oh i expect he fell asleep at the wheel and dreamed it i said thats not fair you dont know an orb merrily was thinking without much enthusiasm very fashionable with cabletv ghosthunters orbs bit of glare got recorded by the camera and it was an orb a semiformed manifestation what huw owen called a spiritegg though you were never quite sure when huw was being disparaging did the driver think there was anything strange about the light well it was certainly strange but i didnt think thered have been anything ghostly not then but then there was mr loste and the others mrs cobham shes a bit mrs aird put her nose in the air if you ask me and not overfriendly mr loste well some people think he s a bit whats the word mrs aird waved her cardiganed arms about in a random sort of way maniac manic obsessed with his music and his choirs and give him his due hes marvellous hes done wonders but some people think hes not reliable in other ways and his friendship with the american woman who goes to the wells bit peculiar but he saw what he saw and hell tell you as much give him his due im hoping to see him later ill probably need to go back and see the rector first hes not in mrs aird said his cars gone how did she know that from down here had she got a periscope hes got three parishes you know and all his problems merrily drank some tea oh well im afraid i dont really know anything about that dont really like to ask him these things peering over her cup sounds like im prying mrs aird looked up at the ceiling and made a sad wounded noise it was his daughter wrecked everything emily got a son as well but hes too young to cause trouble emily would be what eighteen mrs spicer fiona she was from reading somewhere like that near london she didnt really like the country and when mr spicer left the armyyou know what he was dont you erm no s a s mrs aird mouthing it silently like a breach of the official secrets act really no wonder syd spicer was familiar with the brecon beacons been out about eight years mrs aird said but theres something that doesnt leave them if you ask me mmm probably right and they often didnt leave the area after many years based in hereford learning to become the most efficient killers in or out of uniform they formed connections with the people and the land married local girls surprisingly or maybe not spicer wouldnt have been the first of them to become a priest imagine the stress she mustve been through mrs aird said never sure where in the world he was at any time but knowing it was always going to be somewhere terribly dangerous merrily nodded the sas had probably the worst matrimonial record outside hollywood breakfast with the wife late supper in a cave in afghanistan then retirement still hyper and they couldnt settle down the wives had to be very special to survive all that long periods alone counting the regiment graves in st martins churchyard sometimes mrs aird leaned forward again fiona came to talk to me on her own she said hed always promised her that when he came out of the army theyd go back down south bright lights and no sheep she used to say but then i suppose he found his faith i dont know where a man like that finds it oh sometimes its just lying there in your path like an old coat and before you know what youre doing youve picked it up tried it on and it seems to fit thats nice mrs aird said i suppose how did mrs spicer react to that oh she stuck by him merrily smiled like spicer had come out as a transsexual at least she knew where he was he was a curate in hereford at first and she didnt mind that thinking theyd move south as soon as he won his spurs so to speak theyd bought themselves a little house near his inlaws down in reading and theyd spend holidays there but then he was offered wychehill and the surrounding parishes a bit closer to london but it turned out to be the worst of both worlds and the girl emily she hated every minute she had to spend here off with her friends to nightclubs every chance she got and that of course led to boys and the other thing you know no what thats what mrs aird leaned further forward as if the place was bugged thats what broke up their marriage the stress of dealing with the girl she paused drugs syds daughter its everywhere my dear young people cant seem to face normal life any more can they mr spicers daughter even mr devereauxs elder son when he gave up his job with the hunt went clean off the rails when it was banned and they say he went on drugs luckily he came round but mr spicers daughter ended up in rehab oh so you can imagine what it was like for them when the royal oak changed hands sorry and thats very much part of it if you ask me the evil evil ingrid said you werent the kind to dismiss it like so many of the modern clergy do mrs aird looked out of her walltowall picture window across the valley with its pastures and orchards expect ill have to go soon you wouldnt believe how often the houses change hands up here its like mr walford says hes disabled but a very intelligent man we do crosswords together and he often says this is what i always wanted a place up here and then when you get it you suddenly wake up one day and realize youre too old for it this is not a place to be old mrs watkins though ill miss my sunsets merrily looked around the room everything modern and convenient and sparkling in the sunshine the royal oak she said is that a pub pub mrs aird said its the gateway to hell i dont even want to talk about that if you dont mind ive had all the locks changed and i shut myself away at weekends go to bed with my mobile phone in case they cut the wires and unfortunately its not something you can do anything about is there anything i can do for you while im here no im quite selfsufficient really ive been a widow nearly twenty years and i can cope with most things everybody needs help merrily said mrs aird looked down into her lap for a moment when she looked up she seemed in some way younger her expression more focused if you dont mind me saying so mrs watkins you seem a nice girl but you dont look very much like my idea of a you know yes im sorry merrily looked down at her sweatshirt the rector asked me to i dont think he wanted to draw attention to me being here no i m sorry i shouldnt have said that ingrid says you know what youre doing its just that i dont have many friends in wychehill and this girl thats what worries me most and there might be another one syd spicer had said which is a bit weird joyce aird can tell you they wont talk to me about it shes a single mother mrs watkins shes on her own in that house and shes had the worst of it shes this is why something needs to be done im a single mother too i have a daughter of seventeen you cant be old enough for mrs airds eyes lost their focus oh you lose touch at my age everybody under fifty looks like a child whats her name hannah she lives in wychehill thinks shes possessed mrs aird said its not good is it the dead of ledwardine lol let jane into his terraced cottage in church street in the living room the sunlight jetted through the windowhung crystals janes housewarming present making quivering rainbow balls on the walls and the face of the boswell guitar making the guitar seem to vibrate with possibilities which would vanish like the rainbow balls as soon as he picked it up well go on jane planting herself next to the writing desk ring them i dont know the i have it here copied it from the notice jane consulted her right wrist read out the row of numbers biroed on it she was lefthanded sinistral therefore dangerously unpredictable how was he supposed to handle this encourage her to go ahead with what seemed like a valid protest or bearing in mind merrilys situation in the village do what he could to talk her out of it and the code of course is jane said lol rang the councils planning department jane drumming her fingers on the desk the whole time what he eventually learned from a guy called charles was in no way likely to wind her down he says its up for discussion next week theyll make a decision then the impression i got is that thereve been no objections the site being fairly secluded inside the development line as laid down in the local plan and not visible from the village centre perfect housing site but its on a why didnt you tell him its on a crucial jane yeah yeah the council doesnt believe they exist anywhere else with like a really major figure like alfred watkins thered be a statue in high town and all the key leys like capuchin way would be marked by brass plaques but this bunch of crass selfserving tossers jane the governments demanding new housing all over the country and there is a case for ledwardine needing starter homes and like luxury executive dwellings fit into that category lol sighed theyd called in at the eight till late to quiz big jim prosser on the ownership of colemans meadow jim had identified a farmer called g j murray who lived at lyonshall about seven miles away this murray had inherited colemans meadow from his aunt and had been touting it to development companies ever since which was the way of it people wrote to the hereford times moaning about all the locally born young people being driven out of the county because they couldnt get onto the housing ladder but when they had a chance to develop some field for housing it was usually luxury executive dwellings where the safe money was and like even with starter homes most of them just go to people from outside jane said all the guys in my class who were born around here they just cant wait to get the hell out rent an innercity apartment near some cool shops or emigrate were a nomadic race unfortunately the council cant operate on that basis didnt you just hate playing the responsible adult especially when she was right they really needed more executive homes another two dozen suvs clogging the village anyway its not going to happen is it laurence were going to get it stopped we lol said we either youre for me or against me jane i am one hundred per cent for you its just that were not talking about protecting an ancient monument are we of course we are sort of jane sat down and drew a diagram on lols lyricpad cole hill colemans meadow track tumulus market place ledwardine church ancient crossroads standing stone six seven points if you include the market place its beyond dispute if i had a big enough map i could probably trace it all the way to the neolithic settlements in the black mountains its a living ancient monument still be there in essence though wont it even if they build on it it wont be visible this is a genuine existing old straight track probably an ancient ritual route right by the time they ve finished the way the land slopes you probably wont even be able to see cole hill from the church any more for all these identical luxury homes with their naff conservatories its a crime against the ancient spirit itll sour the energy energy lol said thats not something you can easily see is it its something our remote ancestors were like instinctively aware of jane went into lecturer mode telling him things he already kind of knew how the old stones had been erected on blind springs and the leys had energized and sustained the land and the people who lived on the land how the oldest churches had also been built on ancient pagan sites because even in medieval times the people still remembered and of course the leys were also lines of contact with the ancestors the dead burial mounds circular churchyards growing up on the sites of neolithic stone circles the spirits of the dead were believed to walk the alignments so in the old days a coffin would have to be carried to the church along a particular track to prepare the spirit for the afterlife it was a crucial thing we should get mum to reinstate it its a theory lol said nervous ties in with folklore the world over lol what it means is that the path through the church to the holy hill is the villages link with its ancestors its origins you obliterate the path you sever the link and ledwardine loses its its soul jane sprang up as though the ancient energy was surging underneath the cottage floor who do i complain to who do i lobby the mp downing street where it would go into the shredder marked fruitcakes maybe best to start with the local councillor gavin ashe gavin ashe resigned jane new guy is lyndon pierce lives at the end of virgingate lane which party nonparty hes an independent well thats good isnt it that means he doesnt have to follow any party line on housing right its a start lol said nothing independent also meant you were free to jump into anybodys pocket well he said i suppose you could approach him on a preservationofheritage basis if you show him the picture in the old straight track erm yeah jane said i could because id guess that area hasnt changed at all since watkins was around in the s no probably not she looked uncertain suddenly right so thats lyndon pierce hes a chartered accountant jane lol didnt really want to ask this colemans meadow is shown in the book isnt it look lol you couldnt jane frowned obviously watkins couldnt include every ley in the county you mean no picture well no but that doesnt the most perfect visible ley and he didnt take a picture of it maybe he just didnt use it jane was backing awkwardly towards the door maybe it didnt come out i dont know dont look at me in that sorrowful pitying so basically this is not an alfred watkins ley this is a jane watkins ley lol thought he saw a glitter of tears this was about more than just a ley line and the soul of the village it was also about being nearly eighteen and the realization that you were entering a world where changes were seldom for the better jane did did watkins even mention this line or even ledwardine no jane looked down at her feet its the one thing i cant understand oh its the real thing though lol she looked up defiant again i mean you thought it was you werent just well i suppose it doesnt necessarily mean he didnt find it now youre humouring me dont do that no really he might have discovered it too late to get it into the book you think its possible and i mean im no kind of expert but it does seem like a perfect ley jane looked him in the eyes so you think im doing the right thing a weighty moment for a second or two lol felt the presence in the room of the cottages last owner lucy devenish janes friend and mentor his too dead for over two years now but sometimes when he came in at night he could still believe hed seen in the fractured instant of snapping on the lights the folds of lucys trademark poncho hanging over the newel post at the bottom of the stairs i suppose that depends very much on what youre planning to do he said carefully when jane had gone lol could still feel her agitation in the air bobbing and flickering around like the rays from the crystals he picked up the boswell guitar prof levin had studio time available in the second half of september which left less than three months to develop this horribly difficult secondalbumafterthecomeback the one which had to be appreciably better than the first or your career was in meltdown again lol sat down on the sofa with the boswell and tried again with cloisters a mainly instrumental number which no matter how he moved it around and despite the experiments with nick drake tuning continued to sound ordinary as in flat as in lifeless more or less like every other song hed halffinished in the past several weeks a period in which otherwise hed felt contented balanced normal it was surely too much of a cliche that you had to be emotionally raw broken ragged wretched or lovelorn to write a worthwhile song maybe it just needed a string arrangement he lay back on the sofa with his arms around the guitar an image coming to him of the dead of ledwardine in some halfformed procession from the steeple to the holy hill bisected by a stream of unheeding suvs dead to the world caractacus it was carved into a stone slab by a gate in a hedge enclosing a house and an empty carport a flat blank house built of the same squarish stones as the church it was about a minutes walk down the hill from the rectory but very much on its own merrily had a sudden sense of isolation vulnerability she shook herself caractacus as most schoolkids learned was the ancient british hero defeated by the romans and taken back to rome where he was treated with some respect the final conflict was supposed to have taken place on herefordshire beacon but that was only a legend discredited apparently by historians if caractacus had retired here at least hed have been spared a view of the beacon the house was tucked so tightly into the hill that all you could see behind it was a steep field vanishing rapidly into the forestry to get to the front door merrily had to push away a sapling taller than she was disbelieving she inspected a leaf an oak within a couple of years itd be pushing the glass in in thirty years it would probably have the house down tim loste must surely be planning to transplant it somewhere but where his front garden was the size of a smallish bathroom and there clearly wasnt much space behind the house either on the wall beside the front door was a bell pull merrily could hear the jingling inside the house no other sounds she waited at least two minutes before edging around the oak and walking back to the road pulling her mobile from her shoulder bag couldnt check out a couple of things for me could you sophie tell me the royal oak its a pub not far from wychehill which seems to have undergone some kind of transformation making it unpopular might be something on the net i may even have heard something about this ill look into it anything else syd spicer is it true hes exregiment i dont know the bishop would be able to tell us for certain but hes taken his grandson to a county cricket match in worcester thats rather interesting merrily isnt it ill find out what i can about mr spicers history which given the traditions of the sas is likely to be very little what are you doing now trying to understand whats happening here merrily looked up the hill towards the church concealed by dark deciduous trees spicers right about this place you wouldnt know you were in it shed left the twentyyearold volvo in the parking bay in front of the church she walked up past it seeing nobody following the greybrown churchyard wall into a short steep cutting which accessed a lane running parallel to the main road but on a higher level like a sloping gallery time to seek help to remove the evil from our midst joyce aird had apparently said to syd spicer midst of what all the same she brought her small pectoral cross out of her bag and slipped it on letting it drop down under the tshirt you could never be too careful hannahs cottage was low and pebbledashed and painted a buttermilk colour rustic porch and a clematis and a mountain bike propped up under a front window it was just gone one pm and the sun was hot and high hannah was wearing shorts and a stripy sleeveless top revealing a butterfly tattoo on one shoulder she didnt have sunken eyes or a deathly pallor i feel dead stupid now she was maybe a year or two younger than merrily pale hair in a ponytail no makeup a diamond nosestud im glad youre not you know pointing at her neck too hot for all that merrily had shed the sweatshirt was down to her green gomer parry plant hire tshirt i used to have a black one with a dog collar on it in white but i couldnt find it this morning its ok i know youre the real thing joyce aird rang mmm thought she might nothing wrong with joyce hannah said better than local radio normally so its killing her keeping quiet about this hannah wasnt local either northern accent east lancashire maybe this is nice merrily looked around you live here on your own with my son hes nine this is my parents holiday cottage had it years and years they said we could come down here me and robin after my husband left us last year that was and im still feeling a bit you know impermanent you coming in the cottage was tiny no more than three or four small rooms merrily guessed the living room was furnished like a caravan bedsettee with drawers underneath a table that went flat to the wall a calorgas stove in the fireplace hannah guided her to a compact easy chair with a yellow cushion and put herself on the edge of the bedsettee the single window was wide open to a honeysuckle scent luckily you caught me on the right day ive a parttime job at the tourist office in ledbury three days a week keeps us going do you want tea or coffee or a cold drink could we maybe talk first yeh course im afraid ive not been to church since robin was christened bad that isnt it i might go if it was a bit smaller but its horrible our church i mean isnt it you dont feel anything particularly holy in there thats for sure it seems very pleasant in here though well its very small had to put a lot of furniture in storage but it oh i see what you mean no theres nothing wrong here we used to come year after year and for weekends when i was a kid i love it its gorgeous round here int it no theres nothing like that here well thats good i did feel really free again biking to work down the hill to ledbury bit hard going coming back but it keeps you fit lot of long hills dont think i could do it your leg muscles ache like anything at first but its worth it listen im sorry ive never been in this sort of i was going to look for your website on the computer at work but there was always somebody there i dont want you to feel im wasting your time thats all i dont even know if theres a charge er no bit nervous now hannah said actually merrily said ive never had a case of possession shameful thing for a socalled exorcist to say but there we are so whats it like whats it like hannah grinned you having me on i dont know what to say im not a person that gets scared id love a dog mind but id have to leave him in when i went to work and that wouldnt be fair got the same problem hannah sorry i dont even know your last name bradley thats my married name its a bit better than what i was called before catterall so i thought at least the bugger can leave me that look this is just between us right dont worry i think about it all the time but its still hard finding the words hannah said it was next to me that close im not kidding spacing it out with her hands looking at merrily for signs of disbelief merrily just nodded hannah wet her lips with her tongue mouths gone all dry now can i get a hannah brought a can of diet pepsi for each of them and sat herself down again rolling the cold can between her hands its a long hill and im not that brave yet that i can just let go id be sodall use in the tour de france i tell you she shook her head i dont know why im laughing i was which side was it on towards the middle of the road that side i keep as close as i can to the verge cos some of these drivers are bloody maniacs and it was this was definitely another bike what its like its like when two of you are going along side by side and you turn your head to say something and nothing soon as you turn your head gone first couple of times i was thinking it was me how you do this is the daytime morning afternoon i dont take the bike out at night im not stupid what happens when you dont turn your head thats what i was coming to if you dont look you can see it if you keep your eyes on the road ahead and you dontsounds daft i know in fact thats wrong you cant see it thats not what i meant youre just fully aware of it it absolutely completely exists two of you biking along side by side and you can feel the wind coming at you along the hedge but on the other side youre shielded from it by by this other cyclist really honest to god and how do you feel when thats happening at first just weird uncomfortable so id keep turning and looking just to get rid of it and then oh god i was so busy looking to the side i nearly went into the back of a tractor and trailer thatd just pulled in to the side another second idve been splat great big metal trailer go into that on a bike its broken bones at least mrs watkins merrily thats nice merrily have you got to be psychic for your job not essential sometimes it can be counterproductive what happened after the trailer incident weve come to the bit i dont like i dont think id like any of it what happened i thought about whatd become of robin if i was in an orthopaedic bed for six months so i decided that if i ever again got the feeling there was somebody cycling next to me id have to stop looking to one side did you ever think what it might be hannah shook her head i didnt think too hard youd go daft wouldnt you what i was really afraid of to be quite honest was that it might be a brain tumour or something when youve got a child these things i know so it was almost a relief when it what was the bit you didnt like well like i say if you keep on and you dont look it just becomes more and more real and close i didnt like that it was a day like this maybe not quite so hot but i could smell his sweat and yet it was cold very cold suddenly it was a man then oh yeh i could smell his sweat theres something about a mans sweat int there and his tobacco tobacco breath not like cigarettes i used to smoke till i had robin this was real strong tobacco breath and after a while im just concentrating on pedalling as fast i can see just gripping the handlebars and gritting my teeth no way was i going to stop i was feeling his thoughts just look at my arms merrily ive got goose bumps thinking about it feeling his thoughts not dont get me wrong not what he was thinking exactly it was more the colour of his thoughts the texture the feeling of his thoughts im not putting this very well am i youre putting it brilliantly well actually you mustve been very scared by now i was afterwards when i got to work the first time they thought i must be ill my colleague at the information centre she wanted to send me home in a taxi but i needed to work talk to people get over it i did go home by taxi that night mind had to go back next day on the bus to pick up the bike anything happen then no it never does when youre afraid it might when you say you werent scared till afterwards because youre too much like too much like a part of it to be scared thats what i meant by possessed he was there he was breathing all over me i was wearing shorts this was a week or so ago this was another time i was wearing shorts like these only a bit tighter and he i swear to god i felt his hand on my thigh and i was angry instinctively you know gerroff and he bloody chuckled he chuckled you heard him chuckle i felt him chuckle and thats worse you feel him chuckling inside your head thats what i meant by being possessed how long did it last usually probably no more than a few seconds but a lot can happen in a few seconds when its something thats never happened before and how many times three no four until i realized what was happening and just got off when you got off the bike it was all right i realized then that it only happened when i was on the bike as if i was actually generating it by pedalling and there was nothing wrong with you physically unlike the others though you never actually saw anything never when did it last happen earlier this week same man oh yeh what happened buggerall cos i jumped off quick this time and wheeled the bike along till i got on the main road just to get this right this is the hill where you come out of this lane at the church and then go past the rectory down past there thats right could you just tell me when you were feeling his thoughts what were they like dark usually hannah said angry angry with you no he doesnt know me im sure he doesnt he just gets into my space its like he just needs somebodys space to get into and it doesnt matter who you are so who was he angry at something bigger than me everything god i couldnt say and the time something touched your leg youre thinking it mightve been a leaf or something arent you thats what i thought and im not going to insist it wasnt i just know what it felt like are you married merrily you are allowed to arent you yes you are and i used to be join the club all im trying to say when youre in bed with a bloke right and you wake up and hes still asleep but his hands sliding up your nightie like that shall we have a cup of tea teas better on a hot day sometimes merrily smiled love one hannah stood up and opened the sliding door into a kitchen that must once have been part of the same room blokes eh she looked over her shoulder at merrily hand up your nightie and dead to the world mutated walking out of hannahs gate into the warmth of the afternoon merrily felt mixed emotions circling her like bees primarily a certain wild excitement that was close to the edge of fear you realized how much time you spent coasting the safe surf between the hard sandbank of scepticism and the unfathomable deep blue abyss she stepped down through the cutting with the church on her left and the sun in her eyes and the phone chiming in her bag aware of the layers of wychehill the layers of experience the royal oak sophie said as she reached the volvo some things you might want to know go on i have some information from the internet which i can send to you at home if you arent coming back to hereford however i ran into inspector bliss and took the liberty of mentioning it he said hed be most interested to talk to you about the royal oak discreetly sophie said it was probably worth going back merrily had a christening in ledwardine tomorrow afternoon if she dealt with parish business in the morning she could probably come back here on wednesday and talk to tim loste and preston devereaux before the public meeting feeling tired now up before six am and two trips to wychehill and she hadnt eaten yet still she smoked half a cigarette then turned the car around and drove down past ledbury trumpet stoke edith midsummer in a couple of days the first hard little apples like green nuts on the twisty trees and the hops on the wires a potent landscape of cider and beer she felt lightheaded it was humbling and slightly shocking when amongst all the selfdelusion and the wishful thinking and the mind games you encountered someone as guilelessly direct as hannah bradley sophie said my attempts to log on to the royal oaks actual website were frustrated by the inadequacy of our software apparently the diocese has failed to provide us with something called flash seven anything to save a few quid from what ive been reading about the royal oak elsewhere im quite grateful we dont have it there you are you may understand some of this merrily went round the desk to peer at the screen over sophies shoulder hiphop ragga garage house drumnbass bhangra i n t he m alverns believe it a big old country pub used to be all darts matches and rotary club has mutated my first experience of nightclub websites i confess sophie said you surprise me to save you some time this establishment is just across the boundary into worcestershire and out of the diocese another good reason not to get involved sophie scrolled up to uncover a picture of a bejewelled black man called dj xex instantly dismissing him with a contemptuous flick of the mouse it appears that the royal oak is now owned by a mr khan apparently quite a wellknown entrepreneur in the west midlands sophie glanced at merrily who shook her head never heard of him quite a number of local press reports about local people calling on the appropriate authority to have mr khans licence withdrawn ive printed them out for you but you didnt print the picture of dj xex for the noticeboard this would be less amusing to you merrily sophie said if you had to live with it possibly true all the innocent fun of innercity clubland in the romantic malverns punters swarming in every weekend from the teenage wastelands cars screaming through the village at one am windows open boom boom boom kids stopping to throw up in front gardens relieve themselves in the churchyard have sex on graves allegedly and now a fatal road accident of the kind that people always insisted had been waiting to happen sounds as if the victims of saturdays crash had spent the evening at the royal oak merrily gathered up the online news stories sophie had printed colliding with the chairman of the parish council returning from a wedding sophie winced the stories were mainly from the malvern gazette petitions to hereford and worcester councils letters to mps counterallegations of nimbyism and racism by the leader of a youth project who thought the restyled royal oak was the best thing to happen in the malverns this century what did frannie bliss say we didnt have much time to talk he asked how you were and i explained that you were looking into an alleged occurrence at the eastern end of the diocese and then simply asked if he knew anything about the royal oak or as its now apparently called dont merrily smiled at sophie inn ya face thats quite good really in elgars hills sophies lower body trembled slightly as if the ground beneath her feet had shifted one day merrily i think we may be pushed just slightly too far i wonder merrily tapped her lower lip with a pen if thats why syd spicers a little sceptical i wonder if he thinks that the ghost of a traditional cyclist an image symbolic of gentler times is someones idea for stirring the pot sophie raised an eyebrow it happens just occasionally but then syd doesnt seem to know about hannah bradley you found that convincing its about as convincing as it gets the girl thinks shes been sexually assaulted by i wouldnt put it that strongly and neither does she quite a healthy attitude towards it really thats one of the things that makes it so credible what will you do collate all the reports try and find out if anybodys ever been killed on that road on a bike if i can tie it down to an individual the obvious answer would be a straightforward requiem eucharist in the church with as many of the witnesses as we could get plus the rector of course ah yes sophie picked up a notepad the rector you checked him out ordained eight years ago sophie raised her glasses on their chain to read her shorthand notes installed as rector of wychehill with two other neighbouring parishes in autumn renowned apparently for his strenuous youthwork previously he ran a shop in eign street specializing in outward boundtype pursuits mountaineering geology and before that his career as you say was with the army the file doesnt mention which regiment but then if he served in hereford it hardly needs to no merrily was thinking of spicers distinctly unemotional response to the carnage at wychehill the minimalism of his kitchen his total selfreliance im very capable my experience of the special air service merrily is that they tend to dispense information on a needtoknow basis if at all merrily said remembering a story someone had told her about a hereford dentist with a servingsas patient whod dropped in for a heavyduty rootcanal filling and by way of an exercise had declined the anaesthetic might have been apocryphal probably not firewall mentioning the royal oak to frannie bliss this had been like opening the door of the cid room and rolling a grenade through the gap they were in the cafe in the cathedral cloisters with a gothicframed view of the bishops garden bliss was doing his eagerfox smile raspberry jam from his doughnut oozing between his fingers clever little bastard though merrily his old fellers some kind of professor of islamic studies in wolverhampton also a consultant to the home office he evidently thought she knew more than she actually did the lads been doing his bit too advising the council on community relations in worcester oh and he also runs an ethnic art gallery in malvern where the prince of wales once attended a reception yes merrily said im sure the prince of wales would have enjoyed that but in fact so snugly has raji fitted himself into the system that the little shit was actually one of the speakers at a symposium last year on new directions in community policing having earlier this may surprise you or not had lunch with my esteemed ruler annie howe why would that surprise me frannie just give me the building blocks how does this guy come to be the owner of a country pub in the malverns oh and then following the symposium attended by civic leaders and other useless suits i get meself formally introduced to young mr khan merrily he patronized me oh dear from liverpool then sergeant bliss putting on this poncy public school accent and a twisted smirk thats quite a cultural quantum leap isnt it he called you sergeant bliss leaned back his red hair was receding slightly and something throbbed in his temple full name rajab ali khan twentyseven years old and already the owner of as well as the nice gallery nightclubs in worcester and kidderminster and now yeh the royal oak inn as was in the heart of the glorious malverns i think he even had grantaid hes good at that he put down the remaining half of his jammy doughnut on the side plate it looked like debris from a postmortem and at this point ive gorra say merrily that i believe raji to be a main player in the supply of a substantial percentage of class a drugs entering the border counties merrily stirred her coffee you know that no i said i believe it i believe in god frannie but and i also believe theres a firewall around him for reasons im either not sufficiently elevated to have been told about or because bliss picked up his doughnut ah whats the point the service is in flux again and the best we can do is keep our noses down until its over merrily said nothing he meant the proposed merger of west mercia police with two other regions creating a superforce supposedly more capable of tackling terrorism and major crime but probably in the process also saving the home office milllions of pounds by raising the bar and reducing aggravated burglary to a misdemeanour he held up a hand a raspberry globule like a stigmata in the centre of the palm he was a roman catholic fond of symbolism a warning merrily were becoming hopelessly politicized its no longer about nailing villains to the wall merrily poured more coffee can i take it mr khan is a practising muslim practising bastards got it off to a fine art see these days if theres a muslim who speaks out publicly against terrorism as rajis been known to do im a brit dont i sound like a brit some clowns tend to be less concerned about what else hes into and you think drugs are passing through the royal oak in significant quantities i mean what are we talking about crack speed heroin and acid bliss said acid is back turn off your mind relax and float off a sixthfloor balcony is all this widely known what is widely known but not widely highlighted is that there are suddenly more drugs by far on the streets of these old market towns than we can hope to control coke and cannabis recreational stuff for the middle classes and cheap nasties for the kids i expect jane id know what they all say merrily moorfield a famously liberal headteacher school director eh what he prefers to be called god help us bliss took an angry bite out of his doughnut i mean look at pershore you imagine anything like that happening in pershore remind me lad called chris smith found shot through the head in his van in a car park near the river signs of torture mouth taped cigarette burns other things i wont describe with food around local cid didnt know him no form but subsequently identified as quite a prominent local dealer operating in the area for over a year linked to this raji khan you think we dont know less than half an hour from the oak if you were to twist my arm aaah bliss made a frustrated hissing noise lot of us coming round to thinking it should all be decriminalized everything you can smoke swallow or inject were pouring billions down the pan in manhours and paperwork and were losing the battle and were bored with it and all the ancillary villainy by braindead streettrash supporting a thousandaweek habit some point were gonna back away wash our hands say fuck it bliss put up both hands pushing it all away and i have told you nothing merrily in fact we havent even had this little meeting in the lovely old cloisters that your lot pinched off my lot in fifteenwheneveritwas like that huh youre a mate bliss beamed bleakly and i like to be there for me mates and i hope you feel the same way so what youre saying if i happen to come across anything in wychehill that might be pertinent to the inquiries youre not allowed to make not actively encouraged to make yes that would be helpful you priests so intuitive even the prods bliss tucked the remains of his doughnut into his mouth just one thing if you do happen to learn anything call you at home exactly or on the mobile if urgent he fingered up a bead of jam left on his plate and licked it off so the good people of wychehill are claiming that all the extra traffic and the nasty music has disturbed something a bit bliss waggled his fingers and made spooky woo woo noises sometimes merrily i dont know how you keep this up it was very warm now and the cathedral green was smudged with people in tshirts and summer frocks some of them camped around the recently installed lifesize bronze sculpture of a pensive sir edward elgar gazing up at the tower a teenage girl sitting by the plinth was wearing cans and had an ipod in her lap walking back towards the gatehouse merrily thought it unlikely that the kid was listening to the enigma variations if it had been jane not in a million years to jane unless attitudes had changed elgar was just some pompous imperialist old fart im not keeping up any more thats the trouble merrily stopped in dismay looking back at the cathedral tower under major repair again scaffolding around it like a thousand interlinked zimmer frames and she was not yet forty but shed reached the age when keeping up required consistent effort jane never bothered about staying ahead of the game because jane knew she was the game scary everything was scary like the thought of a centralized police service directed by nervous politics merrily went across to the hereford tourist information centre and picked up what she could on the malverns before climbing the stone steps to the deliverance office where sophie was putting the phone down just came in to say that if theres nobody i need to see i think it might be best to go back to wychehill get this over is that all right did mr bliss clarify things mr bliss muddled things further as mr bliss so loves to do merrily three things i resorted to the telephone from which i learned that the royal oak used to be a favoured meeting place for rambling clubs because of its capacious car park and access to several footpaths the ramblers association needless to say has lodged a complaint with the tourist authorities its what they do i dont think im going to worry too much about the royal oak i also checked with worcester deliverance it appears that mysterious balls of light are not unknown in the malverns usually connected with ufos rather than anything psychic unexplained cyclists with lamps however thats a new one oh well thanks soph and thirdly the reverend spicer rang the public meeting in wychehill planned for wednesday im sorry about this merrily called off no you wouldnt be sorry about that would you brought forward to tomorrow evening what for reasons of discretion according to mr spicer they want to be sure there are no press people there or indeed employees of the local authorities or the tourist associations whove been known to attend such meetings he says its something that should be settled by local people and you of course but ive got a christening in the afternoon the part of the meeting relevant to you wont start until eightthirty no i mean i still have people in wychehill to see sophie sighed sometimes i think you try too hard you either do the job or you dont ill just have to go back tonight merrily sophie rocked back thats ridiculous youve been there twice already youve been up since dawn have you even eaten sort of right sophie stood up i ll take you no its if you fall asleep at the wheel on the way back ill ask lol ok give me a chance to see jane before we go im starting to feel like a parttime parent maybe it was what bliss had suggested about jane and drugs she rang lol and there was no answer idyll chipped when lol called back merrily was already in the car in the bishops palace courtyard she switched off the engine lol was asking if she knew about janes project merrily sank back in her seat twisting the rearview mirror smoothing out what could be a new line under her left eye jane and project curious how sinister those words sounded together she said she was going to explain it all to you this morning lol said if you hadnt had to dash off so early if i hadnt had to dash off so early shed have been at school and she knows it merrily closed her eyes shes never done that before i dont think the exams are over i dont care its a school day do you want to call in if you get home earlyish thing is im only coming home to change ive got a job out near malvern for which i think i need to look like a minister of god oh well she knows ill tell you she just uses me as a filter itll wait no it wont merrily said i can tell it wont bloody jane lol i was wondering if you could come with me sophie wanted to drive thinks i might fall asleep at the wheel actually its a situation that might benefit from a second opinion and im not sure sophies would be the right one im just a humble songwriter sure whatever you undersell yourself a humble songwriter who once did half a psychotherapy course if you come over to the vicarage in say fiftyfive minutes i should be changed and ready to leave small silence through one of the bishpal windows she could see gary the bishops west highland terrier standing on the back of a sofa waiting for the boss to come back from the cricket if i come round in say forty five minutes lol said will you still be undressed no time of course for that jane was home anyway quiet obliging and therefore suspicious sure shed get her own meal no problem you two get off to wherever exhibiting no particular curiosity about what might be going down which meant that something was printed on her own agenda in heavy type but worrying about jane could eat up your life and now for the first time in many years she was a problem shared kind of at least lol well at least they were officially an item at last nothing clandestine any more on the road merrily driving the volvo he told her about jane and colemans meadow the ley line and the luxury executive homes something about all this seemed to bother him but for once merrily couldnt see a major problem kids been involved in far worse things i mean i dont like the idea of an ancient trackway to the top of cole hill being obliterated to accommodate luxury executive homes weve had two new estates in eighteen months small starter homes would be ok lol said we need a few starter homes im just not sure we need any more sedate comfortable middleclass people lets back away from that one for the moment whatever we need there have to be better places to put them ok so jane gets up a petition to the council fair enough shes seventeen next year she gets the vote lol polished the lenses of his brassrimmed glasses on the bottom of his tshirt far be it from me as a failed psychotherapist to try to tell you about your daughter but like do you think maybe it goes deeper bored with a levels not litup by the idea of university because everybody does that you think she doesnt want to leave home maybe shes afraid to afraid that shell come back to find everything destroyed lost a lot over the years her dad lucy mmm janes dad her mothers unfaithful husband dead in a car crash but jane had still been little then when the formidable lucy devenish the kids first real friend in ledwardine had been knocked off her moped and killed on the outskirts of the village that was worse an idyll badly chipped jane townraised had bonded with the countryside very quickly thanks to lucy and her rural folklore and her ok possible paganism and it was in lucys old shop ledwardine lore that jane had been the first of them to encounter a damaged musician trying to reassemble his life after a criminally unjust court conviction a family breakdown a bad time in a psychiatric hospital so many daughters could barely tolerate their mothers boyfriends but jane had virtually engineered this relationship lol putting down a deposit on lucys cottage in church street just across from the vicarage that was the final piece in janes mosaic and lucy devenish was still a presence for all three of them lucys primary raison detre had been the defence of old ledwardine against misguided incomers and the slashing scythe of crass development uhoh merrily glanced at lol trying to look like a respectable companion for a vicar in a dark jacket over a dark tshirt with no motif jane and lol were in their own way also an item jane knew how to work him so the imminent destruction of colemans meadow and the ley line you think she sees that as something that wouldve sent lucy ballistic whats she going to do do you think she wanted to know who to complain to councillor pierce what else could i say shed only find out somewhere else well i instinctively dont like lyndon pierce much but at this moment you could almost feel sorry for him right its going to be an experience for him certainly merrily drove into ledbury with its oakframed market hall its clock and its sunny old bricks last town before the malvern hills the eastern ramparts of herefordshire reflecting the black mountains of wales in the west between these purpleshadowed walls the county was a twilit peripheral place normally she liked that the outoftimeness of it bloody jane the malverns were so familiar an elevenmile ripple on the horizon that it was easy to miss how strange they were they were sudden hills a surprise happening in an otherwise eventless landscape driving in from a different side tonight merrily watched the scenery acquiring scaleddown alpine dimensions sunlit serrated ridge inky valley eleven rollercoaster miles with a long history of recreation ever since theyd been reserved as a hunting ground by the conquering normans never more famous however than in victorian days when the healing waters of onetime holy wells had briefly been more soughtafter than champagne and great malvern had become a fashionable resort the guidebook shed bought in hereford and checked out over tea explained how these hills had been given special protection for one reason or another throughout recorded history but it hadnt stopped the quarrying apparently george bernard shaw remarked that so much stone was being taken away that the malvern hills were in danger of becoming the malvern flats but theyve stopped it now lol said not that long ago merrily slowed approaching a greenbearded cliff face but at least quarryings good for concealed car parks a segment like a slice of layered cake had been cut out of the hillside and someone had built a shambling stone house on raised ground at the apex a house which at some stage had grown into a country pub lol inspected it with no discernible awe this is the gateway to hell maybe there had once been a tiered garden in front now it was this huge parking area with walls of natural rock partly curtained with conifers merrily pulled onto its edge under the discoloured swinging sign on a pole in the entrance an archaiclooking painting of a squat tree and royal oak in faded gothic lettering below another sign plain white pointing at the pub inn ya face nine or ten vehicles on the car park but no people around she wound her window down no sound other than birdsong no visible litter no smell of moral cesspit if the gateway to hell was jammed with people burning nobody would be tempted into sin lol said that a new song not yet ok lets go and talk to people about a ghost on a bike the volvo jangled on the long incline it was half a steepish mile further on towards the top of the hill coming in from the southwest you could see how the community had been constructed on the ravages of quarrying houses and bungalows forming alongside new forestry on their separate levels more than half hidden it was like the shadow of a village but tonight it was sprinkled with gold dust both their windows were down as they drove in and on the cusp of evening the warm air around wychehill was glistening with the moist and luminous soundtrack of medieval heaven nearness a ribbon of road under hunched conifered shoulders like spicer had said no evidence of community or enclosure no shop no pub no kids on bikes no dogwalkers only on the top of herefordshire beacon maybe two miles away could you see figures moving like flies on a cowpat at just after seven pm merrily pulled into a long bay in front of the church behind five other cars the church was set well back from the road but the distance was reduced by its size at the end of an aislelike path from the bay its porch door was closed its squat tower had no window slits it stared sightlessly towards the road and couldnt see the lushness of the valley which opened up below it on the other side and yet this unpromising sullen hulk postvictoriangothic built of stillunmellowed stone blocks was exalted merrily shut her car door as softly as she could its got to be a record a cd i dont think so lol said he stood in the church entrance by the black sign with gold lettering st dunstans above it a heavy lantern on a wroughtiron bracket one of its glass panels shattered the voices male and female poured down like a slow fountain its gregorian chant lol said i dont know i mean thats something like that maybe its certainly latin but thats i know things arent as hard and fast these days but this is an anglican church lol shrugged you want to go in better deal with what we came for merrily unfolded the orderofservice for a funeral on which syd spicer had written the names and addresses beginning with tim loste caractacus cottage down the road past the rectory hes got to be conducting it hasnt he hell of a choir for a village this size lol said a village where according to the rector people dont even talk to each other much so like they just sing why didnt spicer tell me loste wouldnt be available tonight i dont suppose he knew you were coming how far away are the others chairman of the parish council has a farm about half a mile away i was going to save him till last as he apparently hasnt yet claimed to have seen anything the others a mrs cobham converted barn two minutes walk according to spicer call that ten for the likes of us he was in the sas mmm is it common for an exsas man to go into the church church welcomes hard men good for the image bit of balance they walked through the cutting past hannah bradleys cottage no sign of hannah although there was nobody about merrily felt conspicuous and zipped up her thin black fleece over her dog collar now the road was curving away around a hill defined by ascending houses and bungalows several of them hidden behind conifer walls how about for him lol said not a bit tame we have people in the c of e make the taliban look like a tennis club merrily stopped looked up the hill do you think that s it the barnconversion was set back from the lane its bay filled with plateglass panels mirrors of gold in the earlyevening light expensive the new gravel driveway had been given a curving route to make it seem longer maples planted in careful stockades either side of it a white mercedes sat at the top outside the oak front door this is the woman whose car apparently went out of control and hit a camper van but again there was nobody in merrily felt that even before lol let the knocker fall twice against its steel plate the clunks echoing inside the barn like footsteps in an empty ballroom she stepped back not my night obviously maybe its the wrong house so which other one couldnt we miss lol knocked again maybe theyre in the choir a whole village of brilliant classically trained singers merrily moved back towards the lane which beyond the barn became a dirt track its like someone we cant see is laughing at us maybe syd spicer maybe the rector of wychehill was laughing at them laughing silently lying in some ditch covered with branches his face streaked with dark mud like in the old days he should be here as backup the protocol was that the local priest came with you the first time didnt just throw the addresses at you and leave you to get on with it merrily went to the edge of the lane and looked down into a bucolic kaleidoscope swirls of woodland and ciderapple orchards and maybe vineyards around sheep fields which glowed like emerald and amber stained glass as the sun began its scenic dive into the black mountains forty miles away by the time theyd walked back towards the church the chant had stopped maybe the whole community turns out to listen lol walked into the entrance along the gravel path bordered with yew trees turning to look back at merrily youre allowed i dont know that i am to be quite pardon me a blur of movement merrily turned slowly a woman had appeared out of the trees by the entrance she wore a pale sleeveless dress so long that it completely covered her feet and it seemed somehow as if shed risen from the ground youre looking for someone well we is there a concert on lol had wandered back the woman smiled at him choir practice is all she had a loose wide mouth and big deepsunk eyes that seemed swirlingly aglow youre in the choir i dont sing although i have an interest i was taking some air during the break i live in a cottage back there wyche cottage like the wyche in wychehill which means salt only the realestate guy in ledbury when he told me the name on the phone i thought it was witch and im like woooh she shook her tumble of brown curls disappointing really lol said how so that it just means salt yeah i guess i changed it anyway starlight cottage now look she came forward stumbling over the dusty hem of her dress coming up very close to lol and peering at him contact lenses merrily thought pardon me the woman said to lol i dont want to appear but i think i know who you are he took a pace back occasionally he was recognized usually by someone whod bought a hazey jane album nearly twenty years ago and was mildly pleased that he hadnt killed himself like nick drake he never relished it ok the woman gazed hard at lol listen i may have this totally wrong but see im not so stupid i was expecting an old guy in a big hat with like a black bag and its no business of mine really but you should know that some people in this place are just a little crazy how so lol said not so simple like youre talking about something you know sacred she looked down and brushed a leaf from her dress im sorry this is not my place but theres something here that must never be parted you know what im saying like you can walk out on the hills at twilight and you can sense his nearness its a strange and awesome thing yes lol said i can imagine it would be so like you know i mean no disrespect here but the whole idea of exorcizing this wonderful magical thing from the malvern hills of all places thats gotta be a bone of contention right this was the third time theyd stood outside a front door getting no response but merrily had heard the radio playing inside the house and she kept her finger on the bell it was still more than a minute before the door opened and spicer stood there unsmiling in jeans and a black clerical shirt a word syd he stared at her without expression then looked at lol the sleeves of his shirt were rolled up as if hed been dealing with one of those household tasks he performed privately to prove he had no need of outside help why didnt you tell me shed pulled down the zip of her fleece to reveal the collar show him she was kitted out this time spicer said whos your friend i realize local loyalty is a good thing merrily said and crucial for a parish priest i accept that but theres also the question of loyalty between people who share a a calling so you give me half a story set me up to appear in front of the entire parish it wont be the entire parish it wont even be half the parish whos your friend he asked again this is lol robinson hes standing in as witness backup second opinion all the roles normally filled by the particular parish priest whos requested assistance if the parish priest can be bothered im sorry merrily i just assumed youd prefer to check things out on your own no you didnt you just didnt want for some reason to reveal the alleged identity of the alleged presence look spicer said the people out there who wanted an exorcist called in i thought it was down to them to explain exactly why i just went through the motions i told you i had reservations but i didnt think it was right to spell them out to you before youd had a chance to check out the situation for yourself maybe you wanted me to come back this evening to hear the music just to underline it a little i didnt know youd be coming back at all before the meeting thats why i set it up for gods sake merrily she turned away in frustration the evening sun threw an unearthly light on herefordshire beacon so that it looked like a cake aflame on a hotplate i mean elgar she swung back to face him that elgar another sphere of existence oh shit surely not this one please dont let it be this one the late sun was bleeding into a false horizon of cloud an old tractor coughing and retching across a field somewhere jane standing in virgingate lane radiating dismay shed looked up councillor pierce in the phone book the address was given as avalon which had been kind of promising anyone whod named his house after the legendary land of apples in the west where king arthur had been laid to rest must have some kind of a soul yeah well there obviously had been apple trees here in the days when ledwardine was almost entirely surrounded by productive orchards in fact you could see a few of their sad stumps in the shaven piece of former field through which a tarmac drive cut like a motorway intersection all the way to the triple garage half a dozen cars were parked along the drive which was actually wider than virgingate lane itself where all the cottages were old and bent and comfortably sunk into the verges the extensive dwelling at the top of the tarmac drive was built of naked glistening bricks the colour of a barbies bum it had a conservatory a sunlounge three fake gaslamps jane could hear music and faint laughter from the house great the plan had been to maybe encounter councillor pierce in his garden casually ask him about the colemans meadow project and then perhaps educate him a little on the subject of leys and natural harmonies he couldnt turn her away could he he was a politician shed be able to vote for him next time or not it was clear from all the cars however that councillor pierce was hosting a dinner party or something bollocks stupid idea anyway jane felt deeply selfconscious now standing there in her white hoodie like some shameless stalker unlikely that shed gone unobserved from inside as if in confirmation of this security spotlamps came blasting on below the broad pink patio which surrounded the house like a display plinth jane saw the hulk of a plundered ciderpress with a slate plaque attached to the stone wheel the plaque said inevitably avalon maybe it was irony sod it anyway she turned away from the horror maybe shed just write a letter of protest to the planning department with a copy to the hereford times who wouldnt print it sod them all excuse me a man behind her excuse me you looking for anyone in particular jane turned two guys in middleaged leisureware polo shirts chinos golfing shoes kind of kit were strolling down the drive towards the nearest car a gold lexus one of the guys beeped open the car doors and balanced a beer can on the roof jane was starting to shake her head walk away when one of the pinkening clouds over avalon reminded her somehow of the birdofprey profile of lucy devenish she sighed youre not councillor pierce the guy with the car keys grinned opening one of the rear doors how far would it get me if i said i was excuse my friend hes an oaf the second guy said did you want to see lyndon erm well you know not if hes like you know busy both of them laughed the guy with the keys pulled a black leather briefcase from the lexus you think lyndon will be too busy to see this lovely young thing jeff lyndon is a man always mindful of his civic duties the other guy said follow us if you like no really jane said its not urgent or anything i can no no you can at least come and have a drink youll be quite safe my colleagues in social services they laughed the cloud formation that had looked for a moment like lucy devenish had broken up it wasnt exactly a pool party or a barbecue that is there was a pool and a barbecue behind the house but neither was in use however one of those extraterrestriallooking patio heaters was working and seven people four men three women were spread over a couple of hardwood tables with drinks papers on the table seemed to be architects plans so what would you expect of a new community centre jane lyndon pierce said he handed her a glass of white wine he didnt seem to recognize her which was probably a good thing hed asked her name and shed just said jane and left it at that new community centre so like whats wrong with the old community centre thats precisely whats wrong with it lyndon grinned its old lyndon was quite a lot less old than shed imagined maybe thirty gelled black hair and a plump mouth tracksuit bottoms and a hawaiian shirt open over a red tshirt not too gross yet but he probably would be in a couple of years chance of a national lottery grant you see jane one of the chino guys said well be holding a public meeting to let the people of ledwardine have their say were drawing up a list of options for them what if the people of ledwardine dont want a new community centre jane said lyndon pierce looked at her like he didnt understand the question beyond the swimming pool the view was across a couple of darkening fields towards ledwardine square lights were coming on in the black swan the church steeple fading back into the evening sky like another sphere of existence im sorry lyndon said cross purposes i think we were just all having an informal chat about the new community centre look but you wanted to talk about colemans meadow jane said oh right actually jeffs in planning he might be able to help you on that one jeff said doubtfully well im afraid theyll probably be fairly pricey if youre jane could tell he was trying to work out if she was old enough to be getting married or setting up home with someone it was almost flattering she took a sip of wine thinking hard shed just stumbled unprepared into what seemed to be an outofhours gathering of top council people when would she get another chance like this probably never ok i think youve got this wrong trying to keep her voice steady i wouldnt live in colemans meadow if the alternative was like a cardboard box in jim prossers shop doorway eyebrows went up a thin woman of about mums age gave jane a hard look because like colemans meadow is a very important ancient site which should be protected jane said id have thought somebody mightve noticed that nobody was smiling much now im sorry jane jeff said this particular development would be what we would call acceptable infill were very pleased that sites become available so i dont think any of us quite understands what youre getting at there right jane swallowed more wine i can draw you a proper plan if you want but basically colemans meadow is the key point on an ancient alignment from the top of cole hill through a burial mound and ledwardine church and then on to like a couple of other sites colemans meadow is really important because the field gates are perfectly sited on the alignment and because the old straight track actually exists there like you can see it and she was going to say feel it decided to leave that aspect alone at this stage lyndon pierce blinked jeff and another guy looked at each other so so what im saying if you have new houses totally unnecessary new houses built on colemans meadow it would completely obliterate the most perfect like one of the clearest examples of of a ley line an older guy wearing a cream sports jacket halfglasses and a half smile ley jane said the older guy nodded i wondered if that was what you were talking about he looked relieved so lyndon pierce lowered the wine bottle to the flags at his feet you know what shes on about cliff im sure you mustve heard of ley lines lyndon ive heard of them yeah periodically someone revives the idea that prehistoric stones and burial sites were arranged for some mystical purpose in straight lines along which old churches were also built if you ask the county archaeologist hell tell you its a lot of nonsense but like many ideas discredited by the archaeological establishment its become a cult belief among well usually old hippies or new age cranks so its like flying saucers and that sort of stuff lyndon pierce asked exactly the older guy said so nothing to no no the older guy shook his head smiling faintly not at all jane thought of alfred watkins reserved bearded magisterial a pillar of the hereford community but with an open questing mind everything shed been taught suggested that society in the early part of the twentieth century had been nowhere near as liberal and adventurous as todays yeah well no wonder there was no statue of alfred watkins in high town with bastards like this running the county how can you she couldnt get her breath for a moment how can you talk like that how can you like just rubbish something that throws a whole new light on the countryside that makes it all light up especially in herefordshire where alfred watkins was like the first person in the world to to ah watkins yes cliff smiled at her cool with this now charming old chap by all accounts typically english eccentric very entertaining totally misguided thats a typical establishment viewpoint oh dear cliff said im terribly sorry but i rather suppose thats what we are so thank you for coming jane lyndon pierce said but im afraid a fantasy conjured up by some old dead eccentric guy is really not going to cut much ice today i was elected as im sure your parents will tell you on an expansionist ticket nowadays rural communities grow or die and i want to see ledwardine getting more shops restaurants leisure facilities and far more housing we could have a thriving little town here but its not a t jane stared at pierce who seemed to be bloating before her eyes into something obscene jane it was the woman whod given her the hard look short curly hair dark suit possibly seen her somewhere before but not here jane is this just a personal issue for you the woman said well im also doing a project for school on the interpretation of landscape mysteries ah how old are you seventeen somebody started to laugh and which school do you go to the woman asked moorfield high robert morrell the woman murmured to cliff jane does mr morrell know youre here look sorry whats it got to do with him quite a lot i should have thought as hes the head of moorfield high well he doesnt live here does he jane felt herself going red like i care about this place i dont want to see it ruined i dont want to see the ancient pattern all smashed for the sake of a bunch of crap bourgeois piles of pink brick like like this i mean sod your new community centre you should be having a public meeting about the annihilation of colemans meadow dont you think i really dont think we should be arguing about a plan thats not yet come before the council the woman said certainly not with a schoolgirl but if nobody says anything itll just get quietly pushed through wont it by people who dont give a i should be very careful what you say if i were you the woman said coldly particularly to the vicechair of the education committee cliff said a rock landed in janes gut this was of course the woman whod been sitting next to morrell on stage at the prizegiving ceremony jane looked down at her wineglass it was empty well i can see im not going to get anywhere with you guys i think i need to get home to she backed away to the nearest corner of the house called avalon and then looked at each of them in turn work out how best to shaft you jane said and turned and ran through the summerscented dusk past the crooked sunken black and white cottages of virgingate lane a dim and bleary light spicer led merrily and lol into his spartan kitchen offered them seats at his table but no tea the sun had dropped into a bank of cloud and the conifers at the end of the garden were turning black spicer switched off the radio i suppose its like people seeing shakespeares ghost in stratfordonavon he joined them at the table but didnt put a light on or wordsworth in grasmere merrily said brontes in howarth yes i do get the picture recalling once looking up a number under e in the hereford phone book and noticing elgar carpets and interiors elgar coaches the elgar coffee shop elgar fine art like that for about half a page in all these establishments youd be shelling out twentypound notes with an engraved portrait on the back of a man with neat grey hair a generous moustache faraway eyes see in comparison spicer said wordsworth and shakespeare are remote figures elgars been dead barely seventy years its like he still lives around here with everything hes come to represent go to the elgar museum at broadheath they say you can see his betting slips he had his back to the window bay blocking more light from the room which had three doors all shut one thing was sure youd never see syd spicers betting slips merrily wondered if visitors were confined to the strippeddown kitchen so they wouldnt clock his books or his cd collection or pictures of his kids i shouldve realized the soundtrack of the malverns the obvious spirit of the place maybe more obvious than you know spicer said joseph longworth the quarry boss who built the church as well as being a bornagain christian or however they put it in those days was an elgar fanatic the church was built that size to accommodate an orchestra and choir able to perform the great mans works elgars said to have attended the dedication its all coming out isnt it if longworth couldve called it st edwards he would have but elgar was a catholic wasnt he yeah he was spicer said and he wrote extensively for the catholic mass as you presumably heard but of course his music was played in anglican cathedrals and cathedral sound was what longworth was paying for sounds like he was getting it not for long they held a few concerts here but longworth died and then elgar died and nothing much happened until tim loste arrived who thinks elgars god so this is becoming elgar city again after many years im sorry maybe i should ve told you and should i have heard of tim loste in a wider context nah used to be a music teacher at malvern college now hes a private tutor got an amateur choir drawn from miles around at least it started amateur theyre making a bit of money now from my point of view the parish gets its cut and if most of the musics heavily catholic well fills the church yeah situation now is weve a whole bunch of people in wychehill and down the valley whove moved here solely because this is elgar country listen to some of them you start picking up this maudlin kind of patriotism land of hope and glory dont you hate that song apparently elgar hated it too lol said but then he didnt write the words merrily glanced at him she didnt know he knew any more about elgar than she did which frankly was not much lets deal with the bottom line syd whos saying the supposed presence is elgar out loud nobody its one of those situations where an idea develops can i tell you why im not happy about it please well let me tell you about tim good conductor great teacher they say but would like to be a great composer and isnt some part of him is deeply frustrated hes prone to depression so this particular night he goes off the road hits a telegraph pole nobody else involved no injury no need for police which was just as well because tim was pissed oh happened just across from the church i heard the crash i go over help him out of the wreckage this is about halfnine at night month or so ago getting dark bring him back here administer the black coffee hes shaking all over i was going down to ledbury he says to buy a light bulb for my desk lamp trying to write bulb blew going down to ledbury for a light bulb that tells you the state he was in idve given him a bloody bulb for gods sake is he often drunk and incapable now and then couple of us had to go down the oak one night get him away from the bouncers hed broken a window i didnt tell you about the oak did i i know about it naturally tim really hates the royal oak a disruptive force sent to destroy his lifes work lost it completely one night when the wind changed and all this rap music it kind of rises up and bounces off the hill anyway thats by the by this crash was on a week night and the oak was quiet tim reckoned hed just pulled out of his drive when he saw what he described as a dim and bleary light when it got closer he could see it was a bicycle lamp he said but he was drunk very anyway the lights some distance away at first and then he said it was like he mustve blacked out for about half a second which doesnt surprise me and the next thing the cyclist is coming straight at him he says he can make out what seems to be a highbuttoned jacket and a hat and a big dark slice across the face moustache thats the inference and the eyes are white according to tim like the eyes in a photo negative tim swerves goes into the pole spicer fell silent in the fading light he was very still hadnt moved since sitting down didnt seem to need to rearrange himself like most people to find a comfortable position but how did he know it was elgar lol said mr robinson hes got pictures of elgar all over his walls elgar music seeping through the brickwork tim sees elgar everybloodywhere hes i like the guy most people like him but nobodys gonna deny hes well off his trolley planted an oak tree in his front garden have you seen the size of his front garden and what did you do merrily said sat him where youre sitting now told him to stay there rang a mate runs a bodywork garage the other side of colwall got him to bring his truck and get tims car away before the police got word if hed lost his licence i think hed have gone into a depression he might not have come out of easily i said go home get some sleep tim and dont even think of telling anybody what you just told me as if spicer snorted he did tell people merrily said he told winnie sparke that was enough the american lady winnie is tims protector nurtures his sensitive talents knows about his problems find out about you very quickly americans because they just ask you have an alcohol problem tim i have herbs for that so it was winnie sparke who spread it around couldntve timed it better theres a retired geezer leonard holliday been here about two years leonards chairman and secretary of wrag the wychehill residents action group committed to getting rid of inn ya face and restoring the royal oak to the gentle hostelry where elgar himself its said that elgar used to drop in for a pint of cider when he was staying at his summer cottage over at birchwood so anyway there was a meeting of hollidays action group to appoint a deputation to lobby the council somebody says what a pity we dont have a celebrity living here like some of the villages have holliday says pity we dont have someone like sir edward here any more and winnie says youre sure we dont oh dear merrily closed her eyes suddenly quite deflated it all made sense a gift for a protest group the idea of englands greatest serious composer rising up from the grave against raji khan and his filthy jungle music when was this syd the meeting was about ten days ago winnie sparke says it just slipped out but it couldntve worked better if shed timed it sir edward elgar riding into battle on mr phoebus who elgar called his bike mr phoebus name of a roman sun god what happened then i think to be honest holliday was dithering a bit on the one hand it would get in all the papers attract massive publicity to their cause on the other apologies merrily but who really believes ghost stories it could easily be the wrong kind of publicity but then there was another accident mrs cobham stella stella and paul famous for their very loud rows stellas little bmw roaring down the middle of the road after some fracas practically spitting flames cyclist coming down the middle of the road stella swerves family of german tourists in a mobile home looking for their campsite bam anybody hurt bit of whiplash for stella and shock says shed never believed in anything like that until i dont think youll get any change out of her doesnt like talking about it any more doesnt want to get a reputation as you know a bit of a winnie sparke actually winnies much more intelligent you dont have many illusions about your flock do you syd im supposed to i thought it was our job to lead them to god merrily there is no flock this is not a village its a bunch of disconnected houses jammed into rock crevices so what about you merrily said what would you like to happen id like people to be sensible id like donald walford to stop worrying about his daughter joyce aird to get her polo out of the garage again instead of having all her groceries delivered sounds insane doesnt it not in an isolated community i suppose a lot now depends on whether the driver of the land rover is claiming to have seen anything immediately prior to a crash that makes the other three look trivial yeah spicer nodded slowly it does doesnt it has he said anything yet not to me not yet but hes chairman of the parish council which means hell be chairing tomorrows meeting you got the message about that its why i came back tonight do you think i should go and see mr devereaux now whatever hes decided you wont change his mind i dont want to change his mind merrily spicer stood up with respect if youve spoken to joyce i think youve done enough shes the one wants an exorcism of some kind what weve done by getting you in is brought it all to a head wychehills split three ways the ones who dont believe any of it the ones who want whatever it is exorcised because theyre afraid of what will happen next and the elgar fans merrily thought about the american woman winnie sparke theres something there that must never be parted you know what im saying like you can walk out on the hills at twilight and you can sense his nearness its a strange and awesome thing sensing his nearness like hannah bradley who quite reasonably didnt want it put around that shed been been touched up from the other side of the grave by englands most distinguished composer consider the implications of this situation try not to panic only me why dont i ever listen merrily was driving too fast down the hill towards ledbury as if the malverns were ramming the volvo from behind jesus she might be a touch loopy this winnie sparke but she cut to the essence of it am i going to be the mad priest who stands at the roadside and publicly prays for the soul of a musical genius a national icon a man with his face on twentypound notes to be at peace and stop causing fatal bloody road accidents am i going to be the person who for heavens sake exorcizes elgar just slow down please lol thought she looked tiny and vulnerable at the wheel of a car that was too big for her and grated out its age on every bend shed refused to let him drive he held on to the sides of his seat therell be a way out spicer doesnt want that no laurence merrily said what he doesnt want is to have to do it himself and she was probably right one thing you learned being close to a vicar was that other vicars could be scheming bastards whatever happens hes going to want to keep it discreet theyre very publicityshy the exsas and that s likely to be the main reason hes switched the meeting from wednesday night to tomorrow he doesnt want tv crews from america a single light up ahead was dim and bleary merrily braked if it gets out lol said you dont really think big figure elgar worldwide they passed the vintage motorscooter it was on the correct side of the road merrily drove slowly in silence for a while a lorry overtook the volvo lol caught her glance weve never discussed this lol but i got the feeling in there that you knew rather more about elgar than i did depends how much you know well buggerall really thats what makes this so much worse jane stumbled panting into the cobbled market square with its hanging aroma of applewood smoke from the fire the black swan kept lit for the tourists on all but the warmest summer nights she looked around nobody about no lights in the vicarage no lights in lols cottage which used to be lucys maybe he and mum had locked the dog collar in the glove compartment and stopped to do it on the back seat in a layby jane grinned god what was she turning into whatever at least those guys from the council hadnt found out her full name all she had to do was keep clear of lyndon pierce for a while and she could ride this out which of course would be the cowards way out it was about pm the deep red veins of evening yielding to the cooling blue of early night jane moved between the lumpen xs of the black swans clientele and slipped under the eaves of the oakpillared market hall thinking about the winter after lucy died when shed seriously embraced some kind of goddessworship lying about her age to join this womens esoteric group the pod in hereford wondering now why shed more or less abandoned paganism which on nights like this seemed a kind of healthy spiritual response to nature and the environment a better relationship developing between her and mum probably had something to do with it mum becoming more liberal as she became more secure in her own job and then there was eirion meeting eirion falling in love probably which was looking like a dead end jane moved out of the shadow of the market hall and across the cobbled square walking towards the church until the top of cole hill came into view smoky and seductive in the dusk the hill of the shamans eirion she badly wanted to see him but it was pointless within three months hed be at university emma rees at school not a particular mate but you had to feel sorry for her had been engaged to some bloke and hed gone to college in gloucester that close and within about a month it was dear emma a bloody text message jane didnt do texting any more texting was for kids and adults with emotional dyslexia she took out her mobile switched it on and watched it lighting up brought up the abergavenny number from the phone book this would be a small test right jane drew in a long ragged breath and pressed the little greenphone sign listening to it ringing decided no and was about to hit the little redphone button when jane watkins eirion said in her ear i know the name from somewhere hang on yes didnt we used to go out together at one time eirions phone had of course flashed up the callers number so good to hear his stupid welsh voice actually not good at all listen she said im sorry i havent rung its been its like thought i was being phased out i did eirion exaggerating the accent in view of my imminent departure to some distant seat of learning strange how we become paranoid isnt it thats ridiculous wouldve slashed my wrists in the bath eirion said except ive only got an electric razor you could always have plugged it in dropped it in the bath and electrocuted yourself lateral thinking irene jane smiling in spite of it all look what would it cost to set up a website shit eirion said any thoughts of you still wanting me for my body it was never about your body fatso thank you anyway how soon could you organize it jane said feeling that sense of what have i got to lose urgency thinking of the council pygmies trashing the reputation of the great alfred watkins lot of nonsense new age cranks jane watkins standing on the market square in ancient ledwardine feeling the lines of energy the ancestral spirit glowing and pulsing all around her rippling through her in the numinous dusk it was when simon st john was laying down the cello parts for alien lol said and i said id like something pastoral but moody so simon starts playing this lovely sorrowful tune and there it was hills real hills texture dull day low cloud and some diffuse underlying emotion elgars cello concerto wow merrily said no particular reason for lol not to know about elgar his own dead muse nick drake had after all been inspired by the likes of delius and ravel but elgar had always seemed so establishment hadnt he been made master of the kings musick hadnt he composed all these marches and patriotic anthems hadnt he written pomp and circumstance whose very title misunderstood lol said most of his life people were getting him wrong even his appearance looked like an army officer or a country squire misleading you mean you like elgar son of a piano tuner with a shop in worcester selftaught lived for nine years in hereford where he employed his daughters white rabbit as a consultant because his wife wouldnt let him have a dog kept trying to invent things had a home laboratory seems to have blown it up once whats not to like merrily drove a little faster you slept with someone albeit rarely for a whole night and you thought you knew everything about him and even when he was famous lol said he was often mentally emotionally and spiritually totally messed up she glanced at him sitting there with his hands on his knees watching the dark burnished landscape how much common ground was there in the creative landscapes of classical composers and guys who cobbled together albeit sometimes brilliantly fourminute songs on their guitars he smoke thinking about hannah and the strong tobacco lifelong lol said what about women did he like women a lot his wife was nine years older and a lot higher up the social scale than him her dad was a general or something she helped him and encouraged him it seems to have been a good marriage but some people suggest he had affairs with younger women its more likely to have been just crushes whered you learn all this couple of biographies its just youve just never mentioned him youve never once mentioned elgar well you dont do you lol said hes just too too there part of the tourist trail every few miles another sign saying elgar route nobody notices any more hes official hes a thousand people waving union jacks at the last night of the proms which is why its so interesting how ambivalent he was about all that lol looked out of the side window towards a round hop kiln spiking the sunset like the tower of a disneyland castle in fact he was a romantic a dreamer and the landscape was everything this landscape when he was dying he he broke off pretending to correct a twist in his seat belt merrily slipping him a glance lol sorry when he was dying what bit of whimsy thats all maybe not a good time merrily sighed ok lol said hes lying there he knows this is it coming up to the big moment he famously orchestrated in the dream of gerontius thats the one about the guy whos dying and what happens afterwards im sorry i ought to know i feel so heavenly choirs conversations with angels stodgy theology heavyduty dark night of the soul right anyway inches from death elgar i suspect is trying hard not to think about the implications of all that and gerontius goes on for ever while the cello concerto comes in at less than half an hour your kind of music look im sorry i didnt tell you i was checking out elgar no youve every right just carry on so theres a friend at the bedside and elgar beckons him over and feebly whistles the main theme from the cello concerto lol began to whistle softly this rolling tune that rose and fell and rose and then fell steeply and the road swooped down among long fields and hop yards under a sheetmetal sky warmed by bars of electric crimson this isnt going to be a joke is it merrily said no but it has a punchline elgar says to the guy if ever youre walking on the malvern hills and hear that dont be frightened its only me thats it thats it only me huh for what its worth lol said he didnt mention the bike animation just when you very much needed to talk to your daughter mum eirions coming through early will pick me up we needed to talk e will give me lift to school see u tonite love j seventhirty merrily had come stumbling downstairs in her towelling robe and the note was on the kitchen table suspiciously close to where shed left her own message yesterday for jane eirion and jane needed to talk we need to talk do you want to talk about this what an ominous cliche talk had become thanks to tv soaps it meant cracks it meant falling apart not that merrily hadnt been conscious of a reduced intensity in the janeeirion department not so long ago one of them would phone every night maybe in the morning too on the landline from home jane having gone off mobiles because they fried your brain and texting was for little kids that was something else of late jane had become kind of luddite about certain aspects of modern life a year before leaving school feeling threatened by change and destruction was lol right about that and the biggest change was the one affecting her relationship with eirion a year ahead of her and about to become a student big gap between a university student and a schoolkid the gap between a child and an adult nearly a year ago eirion had been sitting at this very kitchen table on a summer morning like this humbly confessing to merrily that he and her daughter had had sex the night before both of them virgins it had been almost touching merrily put the kettle on made some toast hard not to like eirion but liking your daughters boyfriend was a sure sign everybody said that it wouldnt last in an ideal world jane would have met eirion in a few years time when shed been around a little but society wasnt programmed to construct happy endings relationships were assembled like furniture kits and everybody knew how long they lasted the sun was swelling in the weepy mist over cole hill evaporating the dew on the meadow the mystical ley recharging but jane was stepping off it moving safely out of shot oh come on jane eirion lowering the digital camera a nikon naturally hed shot the view from the top of cole hill and the low mound on the way to the church the hummock that jane was convinced was an unexcavated bronze age round barrow and then theyd walked another halfmile and crossed a couple of fields to find the prehistoric standing stone halfhidden by a hedge and only three feet high but that was as good as you got in this part of the county fair play hed taken pictures of them all and he hadnt moaned until now no jane flung an arm across her face for the last time this is not about me its about yeah yeah the balance and harmony of the village and the perpetuation of the legacy of the greatest man ever to come out of hereford but i have to tell you jane speaking as a person only a few short years away from a glittering career in the media that a shot of you with your firm young breasts straining that flimsy summerweight school blouse will be worth at least a thousand extra hits you disgust me lewis jane stepped behind a beech tree beside the bottom gate a mature beech tree full of fresh light green life one of several that would soon be slaughtered in the course of an efficient chainsaw massacre to accommodate twentyfour luxury executive homes eirion tramped towards the tree along the ley stocky dependable irene his cathedralschool jacket undone the strap of his camera bag sliding down his arm jane listen im serious a view means nothing basically just a field with a church steeple in the background it needs a figure to suggest the line of sight im not kidding we have to persuade the various earthmysteries organizations to run this on their sites eirion had reasoned that if it was speed she was after a website was probably not the answer at this stage what they needed a whole lot cheaper was an initial explanatory document which could be emailed to interested parties and influential online journals made sense on that basis if he shot the pictures this morning he could have it laid out by late tonight email her a copy for approval and by this time tomorrow theyd be up and running the full horror of colemans meadow disclosed to the world before the weekend scores of people possibly hundreds of people lodging complaints with hereford council hundreds of new age cranks and old hippies telling them exactly where they could put their acceptable infill eirion stood watching her keeping his distance what jane said you clenched your fists you looked positively homicidal what have i said now irene its not jane shook herself oh hell to fit in this shoot he mustve been up at five driving over from abergavenny about ninety minutes earlier than usual face it how many other guys would do that for you she felt totally messed up again her emotions all over the place hormones in flood for a moment she felt she just wanted to take him into a corner of the stilldewy meadow and what would it be like making love on a ley what kind of extra buzz would that produce what it would produce would be a golden memory jane are you all right i mean youre not ill sure i mean im fine jane clasped her hands together driving back the tears it was no use she had a battle to fight against slimy lyndon pierce and the chino guys and lofty patronizing cliff and the thin woman from education the mindless philistine establishment she sniffed and stepped out from behind the tree and walked back on to the ley her head lowered how do you want me to stand youre perfect the way you are eirion smiled his glowingly honest unstaged eirion smile just dont look at me sophie displaying emotion was a rare phenomenon when it happened it tended to be minimal slender smiles never a belly laugh disapproval rather than merrily that is quite disgusting it dishonours him sophie was looking out of the gatehouse window towards the cathedral green there might even have been tears in her eyes it dishonours all of us it was like youd vandalized a grave spraypainted the headstone trampled the flowers he lived in this city for nine years at the height of his fame even after hed left hed come back for the three choirs festival when it was held here as it is this year sophie swung round her soft white hair close to disarrangement do you really want to besmirch that merrily me im sorry but this is giving credibility to something very sordid she meant the road accidents merrily hadnt even mentioned hannah bradley just as well really involving the church in a campaign which might be laudable in itself but is extremely questionable in its execution is i realize its not your fault but you can stop it going any further i didnt expect you to be quite so protective im a former cathedral chorister im proud of my countys link with elgar his homes at birchwood and then here in the city his many connections and friendships at the cathedral i know embarrassed by her ignorance merrily had picked up a slim guide to elgars herefordshire skimming through it before sophie came in it was a start so what are you going to do about it sophie said may one ask well with your help as an elgar enthusiast and a cathedral chorister for how many years fourteen i want to look at it sensibly because whatever your misgivings about the idea of elgars ghost my instinct is that there is something sophie scowled please ive a christening this afternoon and then im supposed to go to this parish meeting or not sophie went to sit at her own desk waved a limp hand go on i need to know enough to be able to discount crap but i have to be prepared for the possibility of it not being crap which would leave two options an imprint or what huw owen would describe as an insomniac a restless spirit in this case an angry spirit disturbed much as you are over the invasion of the malverns by the hoodies and bling element which is a potentially sensitive issue because of well racism always the weapon used against us as if appalling behaviour and criminal acts should be protected for socalled cultural reasons lol reckons that with elgar it wasnt so much political patriotism as a pure love of the countryside the landscape itself that in fact he even developed a bit of a distaste for land of hope and glory that true i suppose he had misgivings about the jingoism in the words he was a lifelong conservative however merrily never forget that although unless im wrong merrily remembering something else from elgar a hereford guide a good friend of lifelong socialist george bernard shaw no youre not wrong sophie said maybe through her teeth what point are you making just trying to form an opinion on whether in theory the raging essence of edward elgar might be summoned like king arthur from his cave by a blast of triphop over his sacred hills if somethings happening then something must have set it off you dont believe that for one minute open mind sophie its what this jobs about and whats the alternative the alternative if were accepting the possibility of a paranormal element is an imprint spicer says elgar used to bike through wychehill maybe stopping for a pint of cider at the royal oak possibly when he was exploring the location of his cantata caractacus in the s its main setting is herefordshire beacon its about the last stand of the celts against the romans a legend now discredited the final defeat of caractacus was probably not as once suggested on the beacon which wouldnt have bothered elgar too much he simply loved the drama of it and was fascinated im afraid by druid ritual bloodsacrifices and prophecies in the oak groves i should listen to it yes you should but youll find it essentially a patriotic work dedicated to queen victoria ending with what i expect you would call an imperialist rant the british might have been defeated this time but would rise again with an empire greater than romes i expect it was of its time and presumably again he didnt write the words elgar told his publisher that hed suggested the librettist should dabble in patriotism but didnt expect the man to get naked and wallow in it merrily smiled actually sophie said thinking about this his cycling phase might have begun later although it certainly started at birchwood possibly while he was completing his masterpiece the dream of gerontius thats not set in the malverns though is it merrily your ignorance of great music astonishes me its set in the afterlife erm ok but we can assume elgar was familiar with wychehill travelling that road on his bike or on foot drawing from the landscape and also projecting his imagination into it fitting the criteria for an imprint a recurring image in a particular location a recording on an atmospheric loop sophies face was expressionless merrily wondered sometimes if she believed any of this even for someone as unwaveringly high church as sophie christianity could still be a discipline rather than a journey of discovery he undoubtedly did draw from the landscape and always saw his music through nature even as a boy sitting by the river he said he wanted to write down what the reeds were saying much later he was to say that the air was full of music and you just took as much as you required interesting merrily made a note his principal biographer jerrold northropmoore an american says the cello concerto projected to him in america an image of a landscape hed never seen and when he finally came over to worcestershire it all seemed strangely familiar he also suggests that elgars pattern of composition reflects the physical rhythm of the malvern hills and lol said that when he was dying either he was being gently humorous in his final hours or he truly believed his spirit belonged in the hills does that fit your criteria for an imprint maybe more than that merrily said but lets settle for an imprint for the moment and is that necessarily bad an animation that simply replays itself the phone rang and then stopped as sophie reached out a hand she sat back and rearranged her glasses on their chain linking elgar with roaddeath however is abusive to the point of indecency people are worried and to allay their fears you call upon god to banish the spirit of a genius the phone rang again and sophie hooked it up gatehouse she covered the mouthpiece might it not be appropriate to bring this whole issue to the attention of the bishop not yet lets see what happens tonight so where did you go with this perhaps you started by strolling across the cathedral green to confront the compact tidy gent in bronze leaning on his bike of course he was mr phoebus if this was mr phoebus didnt have a lamp but then his wheels didnt have any spokes either it was merrily thought essentially a modest unobtrusive piece lifesize dapper elgar the bloke she sat on the grass in the sunshine with an egg mayonnaise sandwich contemplating him from a distance while finishing off elgar a hereford guide finally she wandered across could you keeping a respectful distance could you possibly help me sir edward look this wasnt stupid sometimes call it intuition call it divine inspiration call it but elgar had higher things on his mind overdressed for the weather he was gazing at the cathedral tower with its unsightly scaffolding the cathedral where hed spent so many hours even in later years recording some of his music there look i accept that i dont know enough about your work im sorry i hope to deal with that no reaction no impressions no guidance elgar was miles away and music was merrilys blind spot in church anyway all the trite victorian hymns shed been trying to edge out of services for the past two years everything the sculpture had to say to her was written on its plinth a quote which someone maybe even a committee had thought essential to an understanding of the man and his work but it was interesting this is what i get every day t he trees are singing my music or am i singing theirs merrily walked around elgar looking over his shoulder following his gaze youre asking me isolated in the scullery the answering machine was bleeping petulantly when merrily got in brides mother requesting a second rehearsal for one of next weeks weddings how much time did these people think you had then a reminder that she was expected to chair the ledwardine summer fair planning meeting next monday and finally a hollow pause a throatclearing and this mild but slightly pompous southern scottish accent mrs watkins my name is leonard holliday and this concerns your visit to wychehill pointless calling me back i shall be all over the place i simply wanted to say as the chairman of the wychehill residents action group that ive inspected your hereford deliverance website and frankly i think your presence at the parish meeting would not be helpful sounded as if he was reading a prepared statement im afraid theres been quite an hysterical reaction to some regrettable incidents some people are seeking to sensationalize a serious issue in a way which would only make our campaign look fatuous therefore on behalf of my committee and weve made our feelings clear also to the rector id like to request that you do not attend this meeting im sure you can see the sense of this thank you merrily sat down at the desk watching the machine reset itself some insect rammed the window and bounced away right she called syd spicer if thered been some change of heart in wychehill he ought to have told her about it before now no answer not even an answering machine what kind of rectory didnt have an answering machine with less than an hour to spare before shed need to leave for the christening she rang directory enquiries and obtained numbers for preston devereaux and joyce aird devereaux first no this is louis a deep drawl but a young mans drawl hes out im afraid whos that with the rather sexy voice thank you my names merrily watkins im calling about the exorcist cool youre mr devereauxs son i take it im going to be fascinated to see what you do you may be disappointed i really dont think so mrs watkins my little brother found your picture on the net i think hes taken it to his bedroom merrily sighed when will your dad be in not for hours he has meetings all day but hell be back for yours you can count on that ill look forward to it good to know there was still respect for the church she hung up and dialled joyce airds number engaged merrily was close to being late for the christening when frannie bliss phoned as i hadnt heard from you merrily i assumed youd stumbled upon something in wychehill which your conscience was telling you it was inadvisable to share with the filth for once i dont actually think i know anything useful not to you anyway witnesses never know what they know until its squeezed out of them by a master interrogator how long would it take to fetch one im a bit pushed right now i hope god finds you less offensive merrily all right ill tell you something our experts examining the remains of the mazda car belonging to the late mr lincoln cookman killed in wychehill in the early hours of saturday had occasion to remove the spare tyre and found a neat little package containing forty assorted rocks and no he wasnt a geologist oh dear quite youre assuming hed just picked up the package at the royal oak if you only knew how hard id tried to come up with a better explanation and are the police planning to do anything about this raid the oak i think that would be an embarrassingly fruitless exercise dont you something like this you only get one chance and im waiting for firm intelligence i gather theres a meeting on in wychehill at which the problem of the royal oak is likely to be raised yes its tomorrow isnt it its tonight merrily how did you find out im a detective we were planning to look in on an unofficial basis but im told that would now be rather obvious look ive got to leave for a christening in a couple of minutes and then i was hoping to have a serious discussion with my only child when she gets in from school what are you looking for well certainly something more than general rowdyism and weeing over walls like if illegal drugs were coming into wychehill itself must be a few likely teenagers there if we were to receive a serious complaint from a parent or two something i can dangle in front of howe im looking for a lever merrily im a vicar frannie and a mate bliss said i hope after the christening of laurel catherine mathilda and a brief appearance at the christening tea in the village hall merrily walked up to the market square under an overcast purpling sky and decided to wait for the school bus she looked up towards cole hill but you couldnt see it from here although you could from the church wished she had time to investigate this ley line for herself leys well they were something she still wasnt sure about they could never be proved actually to exist but they had a kind of poetic truth they lit up the countryside and if jane had found a way of lighting up the countryside without drugs best not to get too heavy about her taking a day off school as long as she didnt make a habit of it merrily looked down into church street at lols house wished she could light up the countryside for him under the shadow of middle age he was understandably uncertain about his future set for stardom at eighteen and then robbed by bitter circumstance of what should have been the glory years too old now to be the new nick drake his comeback album was selling reasonably well hed done gigs supporting moira cairns and the two old hazey jane albums had been remastered but it still wasnt quite a career now he was writing material for the second solo album it wasnt going well although he didnt say much she could feel his fear sometimes she turned as the school bus drew up on the edge of the square and some kids got off and jane didnt merrilys heart froze stupid this didnt automatically mean shed skipped school again sometimes eirion picked her up however she went straight home and called janes phone from her own mobile janes was switched off she left a message call now put the mobile on the sermon pad and then sat down and rang joyce aird in wychehill ive caused a lot of trouble havent i merrily was cautious in what way mrs aird i had a visit her voice sounded unsteady i was told this could bring us the wrong sort of attention and ive done the community a great disservice ive lived here more than twenty years mrs watkins asking for me to come and look into that s the disservice i only did what i thought was best this is mr holliday is it its what weve become im afraid its all about how it looks doesnt matter what the truth is any more matters to me you dont live here mrs watkins its not a nice place to live any more nobodys friendly is that since these ghost stories i feel im becoming a prisoner in my own home locked doors and drawn curtains and and the lights on all night thats what its come to i cant be in the dark and i love my bungalow i love the view i did love it now it feels so isolated i was going to give it till next year but ive been thinking id better put the house on the market in the summer do you have anywhere to go back to solihull i expect i shouldve moved back when my husband died its never the same on your own though i do love my sunsets im really sorry joyce but i dont think you should jump to anyway dont you worry if they dont want you theres nothing you can do about it is there im sorry im a bit confused here ive had a message on the answering machine from mr holliday who obviously doesnt want me but im not sure its his decision to make he said the rector was going to tell you tell me not to come to the meeting that they dont want you i see merrily said would this have anything to do with the late sir edward elgar we havent to use that name mrs watkins thats what ive been told what remains of reason inside the huge parish church of st dunstan was as plain and functional as syd spicers kitchen its gothic windows were puritanical plain glass diamondleaded and the light on this overcast midsummers eve was cruelly neutral showing merrily how dispiriting it must be for spicer on sunday mornings his meagre congregation scattered two to a pew and less than a quarter of the pews filled like a village cricket match at lords but as wychehill didnt have a community hall the church accommodated the parish meetings so maybe its ambience would confer stability calm wisdom dignity or not they found drugs in that car you know leonard holliday shed recognized the voice at once was on his feet across the aisle crimped gunmetal hair neat beard did you know holliday must have police contacts maybe masonic no i didnt know preston devereaux said wearily i have a business to run i dont have much time for gossip ecstasy tablets chairman they say one can buy them like sweeties at the royal oak ok maybe his contacts werent that good and you know why the district council as the licensing authority will not act against that place holliday jabbing a forefinger at nobody in particular you know why they wont shut it down and i can disclose this with some authority having worked in local government for forty years and damned glad to be out of it mr holliday the reason they will not act chairman is that as with so many tourist areas the level of government grantaid is now to a large extent dependent on the council and the tourism bodies being able to prove that they are attracting a sufficient number of black and asian visitors this is a fact and these music nights at the oak are seen as especially attractive to that particular all right preston devereaux banging his gavel as most of you seem to be members of the wychehill residents action group i dont think we need to complicate matters by going further into this issue tonight he was at a table set up at the foot of the chancel steps the chair next to him empty the chancel was large and unscreened its choir stalls in a semicircular formation like a concert hall more like a concert hall in fact than a place of worship and as stark as a welsh chapel it was just after nine pm the atmosphere thickening merrily wore a dark skirt and one of janes hoodies zipped up to cover the dog collar shed slipped into a shadowy and empty back pew just after eightthirty thirty or forty people sitting in front of her including was that joyce aird the normal parish meeting seemed to have started at seven three people had left in the past halfhour syd spicer didnt seem to be here she wasnt sure what this meant but it probably wasnt a good sign preston devereaux leaned back looking through halflidded eyes out into the uncrowded nave i think we need to keep cool heads as we come to the final item although to be quite honest i dont want to come to it at all in fact i feel embarrassed to be chairing a discussion of this nature having no wish to watch this community casting off what remains of its reason devereaux was lean and weathered and keeneyed with longish hair the colour of malvern stone sideburns ridged like treebark his accent was local educated grounded he wore a brown leather jacket over a shirt and tie however because i find myself tragically implicated in this situation i feel obliged to give it a public hearing essentially we have a roadsafety issue caused i believe by an increase in traffic through the village due to increased tourism and other developments somebody laughed it had a bitter edge however the chairman said there has been quite a sharp increase in the number of road accidents lately which has given rise to rumours which i shall describe conservatively as outlandish whos going to start us off on this helen a woman stood up in one of the front pews helen truscott i use this road probably more than any of you and i dont believe in ghosts someone clapped helen truscott turned to face the assembly midfifties brisk attractive youd trust her judgement im a district nurse by profession and im also the carer for my disabled dad and he worries when im out particularly at night and id like to clear this matter up so that he can stop worrying this would be the daughter of d h walford who had written to the rector thank you helen we take your point anybody else mrs aird well joyce aird stood up alone in a pew halfway down the nave i think when there are a number of accidents one after the other were all bound to feel a little nervous and we cant help wondering if theres something going on that we dont understand especially those of us who live alone and perhaps have too much time to think im a churchgoer so i when i get upset i turn to god but i suppose im in the minority these days so i ill she sat down merrily noticed that the two vases of fresh lilies she must have put out on the chairmans table were on the flagged floor beside it thank you mrs aird devereaux said as were all churchgoers tonight im sure god will be sympathetic but i think this issue lies rather with the creations of man the problem heres always been that because of the positioning of the dwellings in wychehill mostly out of sight of the road motorists do not realize theres a community here scattered though it may be of more than two hundred people and so they tend to speed mr holliday holliday was back on his feet making it clear that the wychehill residents action group now extending to at least four other communities in the area would be dissociating itself from any course of action designed to legitimize superstition and indeed chairman the very idea of suggesting that the ghost of sir ed clack the end of his sentence was chipped off by the gavel the cyclist sir if you please therell be no ridiculous conjecture in my meeting the idea that the story of the cyclist holliday smirked would generate wider publicity for our campaign now seems he coughed it seems clear to me that this would succeed only in leaving us open to ridicule but you thought about it didnt you leonard devereaux said it did occur to me yes im rather ashamed to say and ive now rejected it very wise of you sir devereaux smiled now i think we have a proposal a man stood up id like to propose that in the wake of the weekends fatality we renew our call to the county council and the police for the installation of speed cameras right proposal by mr sedgefield of the wellhouse seconded another guy said without getting up perhaps theyll capture this bloody ghost on film then wed all be able to see it laughter preston devereaux gavelled for silence letting his smile fade i dont really see theres much more we can do than that but before i close the meeting regarding the very regrettable incident involving myself at the weekend several people have asked me two questions which with the meetings permission id like to answer publicly tonight question one no im glad to say i was not hurt for which i have to thank the famously robust physique of the british land rover i very much wish mind that id been in my ordinary car mightve been able to get out of the way in time and the whole thing mightve been less serious but fate decided otherwise therefore id like to propose that the whole community join me in expressing our condolences to the families of the two young people because whatever some of us may think about the royal oak subdued murmurs were lifted by the churchs crisp acoustics into a substantial expression of assent good preston devereaux said now question two simple answer no of course i bloody didnt laughter devereaux halfrose thank you ladies and gentlemen now unless anyone has something to add id like to formally close this meet im sorry was that a hand at the back yes if i could just shed probably regret this later merrily thought but you could only stand so much of this kind of crap she stood up pulling down her zip the admonishing angel in her head looked a lot like sophie oh wow look over there jane was standing on the massive halfcollapsed capstone this huge jutting wedge she was gazing to the southwest the evening light thickly around her like the pith of some vast luminous orange and she felt that if she jumped off now shed go on flying in a dead straight line to the crooked mountain on the horizon arthurs stone was the most impressive prehistoric monument in herefordshire it crouched like a dinosaur skeleton on merbach hill above the golden valley which melted like grilled cheese into wales arthurs stone was not one stone but many the remains of a dolmen or cromlech a bronze age burial chamber which had once been covered with earth alfred watkins had found several leys passing through here connecting it with country churches and unexcavated burial mounds and the remains of a medieval castle on an ancient hilltop site at snodhill and if you stood where jane was standing on top of the monument you could see in misty profile its the skirrid isnt it eirion said like he could fail to recognize the holy mountain of gwent which he could see every day from his bedroom window just like jane could see cole hill the volcanic mountain cleft in two according to legend at the moment when christ died on the cross lying in eirions bed in the heat of the afternoon jane had found herself visualizing the elemental force that split the mountain just as oh god was that some kind of sacrilege the day replayed itself in her memory one of those wild hazy days when you werent aware of how magical it had been until it was nearly over shed persuaded eirion not to go to school school hardly mattered at his stage of the game a levels over future in the lap of the gods theyd gone back to his dads place at abergavenny and compiled the colemans meadow document on his computer with the photos and quotes from the old straight track eirion had rewritten janes rant draining off some of the vitriol and she had to admit it now seemed more rational and convincing and then with his dad and his stepmother safely away at the same conference in north wales theyd gone to bed afterwards shed tried to ring mum at the vicarage to imply subtly without actually lying that eirion was picking her up from school but mum wasnt there and the mobile was switched off most of the time and then shed remembered that mum was going to be at a meeting over on the other side of the county for most of the evening which left her and eirion whole hours to go in search of the old straight track eirion in his postcoital whatever mood had been cool about it so theyd started off by looking for alfred watkins himself first and foremost a herefordshire man it had said in his obituary in the hereford times in as native to the county as the hop and the apple jane had found that in the watkins biography by ron shoesmith which had taken them in search of vineyard croft the house near the river wye on the edge of the city where alfred had lived for about thirty years with his wife marion but they couldnt find it they found a vineyard road but it seemed all suburbs around there now it was much easier to locate the house the watkinses had moved to just off the cathedral green it actually had a plaque on it identifying its importance probably the nearest thing to a monument to alfred in the entire county there ought to be an official watkins memorial ley eirion had said where you can stand and have the whole line pointed out for you so that even councillors could see what it was about theyd only be able to follow it if it was marked out in new branches of asda and b amp q we really understand each other dont we jane thought and in a few weeks hell be gone she felt very close to tears and climbed down from the stone before she was tempted to throw herself into the horizon in the normal way of things you were consulted by worried individuals whose worldview had been jogged out of focus frightened people mugged by skewed circumstance since yours was the only hand reaching out they switched off their scepticism and clasped it always individuals never a community a society a committee in any random group scepticism ruled im confused mr chairman merrily said cant have that preston devereaux peered into the growing gloom i pride myself on clarity may we have your name madam im erm merrily watkins are you indeed im a consultant to the diocese of hereford on matters paranormal and she saw joyce aird had turned looking both grateful and worried the rector asked me to come tonight he mustve forgotten to mention it to me devereaux said and as that particular item has now been dealt with it hasnt really been dealt with though has it its just been pushed under the table lot of heads turning some muttering no going back now mrs watson watkins and im not a big conspiracy theorist but ive encountered enough coverups in the past couple of years to recognize madam the gavel came down with a crack that must have dented the table let no one accuse me of that im not accusing i think youd better forsake the shelter of your back pew and attempt to justify it reverend preston devereaux pulled out the chair next to his calling out to the back of the church can we have some decent light on the proceedings unload it merrily stood up in the brittle glassy light she felt weak with fury moved into the aisle reaching into her bag to switch off her mobile would have felt better about this if jane had called in the end shed gone round to lols asked if hed mind staying behind and trying to find her ok she was seventeen for heavens sake nearly an adult and yet oh god get me through this she stepped behind the table next to the chairman looking out at twenty or thirty people widely spaced winnie sparke standing out in a crocheted white woollen shawl lights came on as if to dispense with the possibility of anything beyond normal occurring here they were theatretype spotlights directed at the chancel presumably for use during the choral concerts the lights put the congregation into shadow and hurt your eyes when you looked up merrily looked down the main qualification for this job is ive discovered a high embarrassment threshold nobody even smiled i was told by the rector who doesnt seem to be here tonight that at least four people had had experience of an inexplicable light sometimes accompanied by a figure in the road outside each sighting preceding an accident of some kind she paused were they out there now tim loste stella cobham or had they been persuaded by whoever had gagged joyce aird to stay away she thought about all the hours shed spent dragging lol out to wychehill fruitlessly knocking on doors needlessly infuriating the uniquely invaluable sophie the message spelled out tonight by mr holliday is that its all superstitious rubbish and he was thoughtful enough to put all that on my answering machine earlier today when he phoned to advise me not to bother coming a few murmurs at last she could see holliday stifffaced in a lefthand pew second row now what im gathering from whats been said is that mr holliday had earlier considered that the alleged phenomenon might have been useful as a publicity gimmick to focus attention on his campaign against whats happening at the royal oak get the protest into the national papers maybe on tv merrily paused again looking over to where shed last seen holliday giving him a warm smile the pompous duplicitous git you can see the tv reports now cant you long shot of the hills at sunset overlaid with some suitably serene pastoral music written by the cyclist preston devereauxs chair creaked mrs watkins i think and then it goes dark merrily said and we see the royal oak throbbing with purple strobe lights and a blast of drumnbass all over the forecourt and then mr holliday steps into shot with a grim face and a petition to the council mrs watkins all right im sorry putting up her hands turning to preston devereaux mr chairman i take it that you were tacitly informing us a few minutes ago that in the moments before that horrific crash you did not see a strange light or a strange cyclist but where are the people who insist that they did is mr loste here tonight for instance because idve thought if this meeting was to make a decision it ought to hear all the evidence mr loste she peered into the lights silence well thanks mr chairman thats all i wanted to say really just didnt want anyone to think that having been invited id failed to show up thank you merrily shouldered her bag amid a rush of whispers preston devereaux said nothing she slid around the table and walked away out of the spotlight pool down into the shadows of the lefthand aisle aware of hushed discussions opening up on both sides like a small motor coming to life and then the scuffling sound of someone standing up wait a tall woman black top spiky red hair standing sideways in the pew space merrily stopped and leaned against a pewend i saw it the woman said this fully formed man on a bike high up on his bike this great black she stared around the church pulpit of a bike right there in front of me and i wasnt drunk whatever people are saying i hadnt been drinking when they gave me a breath test it was totally negative but im telling you i saw him he was there absolutely and totally bloody there youre merrily felt a small worm of excitement uncurling in her spine youre mrs cobham right correct i swerved and he vanished and i went into this bloody camper van about half a second later how did you feel at that moment feel mixture of shock and just sheer primitive terror i thought i was actually going to die die of shock you know all i remember after that was being out of the car and just standing at the side of the road shivering they wouldnt come near me the people in the camper they wouldnt leave their vehicle i mustve looked was there any change in the atmosphere when you saw the cyclist the temperature merrily saw that the focus of the room had altered people drifting to the ends of pews on either side two semicircles forming and preston devereaux on his own by the chancel sitting upright his long sideburns like the chinstrap of a helmet stella cobham gripped the pew in front of her i felt cold whether that was just the shock couldnt seem to keep a limb still until daylight couldnt sleep couldnt think of anything else kept seeing him again and again in my head i can see him now mrs watkins preston devereaux was on his feet this is neither the time nor the place merrily just kept on talking to stella cobham a dampeddown silence around them the windows in the nave filled with a dull purple halflight that didnt go anywhere could he see you do you think i dont think he could see anything his eyes were somewhere in the distance it was the eyes i remember most it was the eyes that theres a photo of him on the back of one of these books we bought its called elgar child of dreams and its one of those double exposures with his face superimposed on the hills and his eyes are looking away into some sort of infinity you know and there are these pinpoints of light in his eyes wheres wheres tim loste gone a man said or he didnt come well can somebody get him back because hell be able to tell you leave him alone helen truscott had appeared in the aisle next to merrily hes not well oh god the fount of all medical bloody knowledge im trying to give him a chance to unload it and you think hell be happy to have his beloved elgar exorcized there ive said the forbidden name too you dont understand about tim do you i understand what i saw mrs truscott you dont understand what state that mans in you leave him alone look i was told people would say i was sick or mental or drunk like loste and i ive forgotten your name merrily well merry whatever theyre saying she swung her head angrily from side to side like a gun turret im telling you there is something wrong here the cyclist jesus in the swollen silence merrily looked around and saw individuals all these people together but essentially still pews apart maybe they knew one another by sight by name by reputation but they were no more than a cluster of islands with separate climates separate cultures isolation midsummer eve and a chill in the air in a toobig church excuse me preston devereaux was brushing past i suspect this meeting is now over would the last lunatic out of the building please turn off the lights yeah you go mr devereaux stella cobham snarling at his back you piss off you keep nice and quiet about whatever you saw you play it down you werent for playing everything down when the foxhunting thing was on were you devereaux stopped thats over its over and we lost you move on which was what he did he walked out at the same time merrily saw leonard holliday and three or four other people moving down the second aisle towards the main door and more faces were swimming towards her if this she took a breath inspiration coming if this is really an issue id just like to point out that the possibility of me or anyone attempting to exorcize sir edward elgar that is very much not an option and even if there was a connection with elgar you can take it from me helen truscott said that the connection was entirely in one unbalanced mind she glanced over her shoulder and the devious heads of a few opportunists who i hope have now seen the error of their ways what i was going to say mrs truscott is if there really is evidence of some pervading negative spiritual presence here then a small roadside blessing is probably neither sufficient nor appropriate i was going to say that another way of dealing with it would be to hold a full requiem eucharist here in the church perhaps extending out to the roadside whats that stella cobham said a requiem is basically a funeral service its not something we do lightly but its sometimes a way of drawing a line under something you want to hold a service for the cyclist as some of you are a bit unsure about that id be more inclined to suggest a service for the two people who died here last weekend lincoln and sonia but i wouldnt do it unless i was persuaded that there was a good reason and id need to consult the relatives the mobile began to chime in merrilys shoulder bag she didnt even remember switching it back on she saw joyce aird staring at her mouth halfopen you want to hold a full requiem a communion service for those drug dealers think i need to take this call if you dont mind merrily backed off look thats just a proposal ok if you want to have a bit of a discussion about this ive got some cards in my bag with my phone number and my email if anyone wants to talk about anything privately or tell me anything excuse me ill be back she hurried to the door pulling out the phone slumping on a bench in the porch with her bag on her knees jane where are you merrily bliss im at wychehill church why whats happened you dont know bliss said she went cold thinking as always jane stop messing about frannie she could hear the sounds of a car engine the intermission of bliss thinking dont go away he said might pick you up on the way if thats all right with you the way to where weve gorran incident whats that mean look if you want to stick around ill pick you up on me way be about half an hour yeh do that would you stick around the line was cut bloody copspeak why did they never spell it out what was she supposed to do now she stood in the church doorway the sky outside the colour of the flash around a blackened eye it must be nearly half past ten behind her the church door swung to and someone coughed lightly there was a whiff of jasmine on the air youre cute winnie sparke said i thought the exorcist was the guy with you and you didnt put me right her face was white and blurred her hair curling into the shadows in the porch whats wrong with this place merrily said you noticed that huh sorry i think i was talking to myself well ill tell you anyway too much quarrying way back is whats wrong way back for us that is but like yesterday in the memory of rocks millions of years old the hills are still hurting you think this is not a place to settle believe me bad place to be when the rocks are in pain and you can take it from me lady these rocks hurt like hell accidents happens he was winding the new limegreen line into his brushcutter head without even looking at it finishing up with the two ends of line exactly the same length and pointing in different directions the way the manufacturers and god had intended incredible jane had tried this once with just an ordinary garden strimmer and about fifteen metres of the stuff had come spinning off the reel like one of those joke snakes out of a tin gomer parry had probably left school at about fourteen and he could reload a brush cutter in three minutes sink a septic tank devise a stormproof fielddrainage system and he also knew where the bodies were buried in ledwardine knew better than anybody since lucy devenish bent jane said youre serious not as i could prove it gomer snipped off the nylon line with his penknife but id probly give you money on it he clicked the rubberized top back on to the head and whereas jane wouldve been beating it against the church wall and still one corner would be hanging off it just stayed in place she became aware that she was squeezing her hands together impatient which was really childish and this was not a childish matter it had to be got right might just turn out to be the most important thing she would ever do with mum still not back when eirion had dropped her off at home jane had walked down to gomers bungalow ostensibly to return the wirecutters shed borrowed but really to sound him out about lyndon pierce gomer hadnt been at home but then coming back across the square in the gloom of a nowsunless sunset shed heard the whine of the brush cutter in the churchyard gomer propped the cutter against the lychgate while he took out his ciggy tin and opened it up and inspected the contents through the specks of shredded grass on the thick lenses of his glasses gotter be a bit careful janey walls got years even church walls jane looked around the churchyard and out through the lychgate to the village square nobody in sight except james bulldavies getting into his clappedout land rover please gomer gomer made her wait until hed rolled his ciggy he was wearing his green overalls and his doc martens and a new work cap that looked pretty much like the old one and probably the one before that ole churchyards gonner need doin twice a week soon gomer gomer did his gash of a grin the little ciggy clamped between his teeth ent no rocket science janey councillors all this on the election leaflets about directin their skills for the good o the community load of ole wallop and they knows it and they knows you knows it gomer sniffed the air well all right mabbe bout thirty per cent of em is straightish or at least when they first gets elected dont last see thats the trouble all them good intentions goes down the toilet soon as they gets a chance of a slap o free tarmac for their path or their ole ma needs plannin permission for a big extension to the house what hers gonner leave em when her snuffs it so all im sayin is if you has to have dealings with your local councillor best ways to start off assumin hes bent saves time but like lyndon pierce specifically lyndon pierce he ent the sort of feller gets hisself elected juss sos he can call hisself councillor pierce well yeah i realize councillors are always taking bribes from builders and people like that so the chances are pierce is getting a bung to make sure the colemans meadow scheme janey gomer started coughing snatching his ciggy out of his mouth im only saying that to you gomer im not going to shout it all over the village am i you dont even whisper it girl less you got the proof gomer took off his glasses blotted his watering eyes on his sleeve jane bit a thumbnail dismayed reticence was not his style gomer did not do restraint she stood there chewing her nail since minnie died gomer had become almost family which was cool because he was good to have around like a grandad only better well past normal retirement age now but hed never given up work kept his planthire business going with the help of danny thomas dug graves for mum with his minijcb free of charge treated the churchyard like his own garden and the great thing about gomer was that he was untamed untamed by age in a way that made you think there might actually be something quite interesting about being old if you knew the secret he went over to one of the ancient cavedin tombs where there was a big gap in the side and it was obvious that the body was long gone he sat down on it and smoked for a while jane watching him and the tomb fading into the dusk when i first went into colemans meadow she said i felt i felt the last person to go there and actually see it for what it was was lucy devenish gomers ciggy was like an ember in the shadows jane said i could almost see her could almost see her now in fact the batwing swirl of the poncho the hooked nose of an old red indian the sharp gleam of a glancing eye like a falcons lucy hovers over this village like a guardian of the old ways jane said thats the way i see it all right gomer stood up brushing ash from his overalls first knowed him when he was a meanminded little kid sorry pierce one day middle of january lucy caught him shooting at the blue tits with his airrifle when they come down to the nut feeder alf hayden used to hang by the ole gate into the orchard bastard how old was he then mabbe fourteen i wasnt living yere then but we was dealing with a drainage problem side of the orchard for rod powell and im in the ole digger when i years lucys voice shoutin at somebody to hand over that gun now kind of thing so i goes trundlin over in the digger and theres lyndon pierce pointin the bloody thing at lucy he was threatening to shoot lucy jane started to tingle it was wow like shed been guided to this kids is daft gomer said dont think fore they acts course when he sees the digger he hides the gun behind his back but i leaves the engine running see jumps down the other side grabs it off him as i recall it wound up under one of the caterpillars of the jcb accidents happens janey i am so proud of you gomer boy tells his dad ive stole the gun off him dad rings me threatens me ill get no more work in this village ever again how could he do that cause he was on the council two councillors representin ledwardine in them days see garrod powell and percy pierce then they had a big reorganization and it was reduced to one and percy lets rod have it uncontested like real noble of him har amazin all the arrangements as went through after that to the benefit of percy had a dealership in farm machinery see and some interestin contracts comes his way through the council as wouldnt have looked quite right if hed still been on the council also you know what agricultural occupancys about janey thats where theres a house that nobody can live in unless they can prove theyre making a living from the land more or less point bein a dwellin with an agricultural restriction you cant ask much money for him so there was this bit of a jerrybuilt s bungalow bottom of virgingate lane feller name of ronnie carpenter owned it with fifteen acres and he needed the money and he couldnt find nobody wanted to buy this ole place on account of fifteen acres dont give you much of a livin no more so ronnie tries to get the restriction lifted sos he could flog it to somebody with the money to replace it with a proper house ronnie keeps applyin keeps gettin turned down and then suddenly it goes through good ole rod powell eh what nobody knows is ronnie carpenters arranged to sell the bungalow and the land provisionallike to percy pierce for his son lyndon whod just qualified as a chartered accountant youre saying they only got to build that piece of pseudobeverly hills crap because of a dirty deal between rod powell and percy pierce gomer dropped his last millimetre of ciggy onto the tomb crushed it out and reminded jane how people had always quietly helped each other in the country and rod powell was dead now and percy pierce had retired to westonsupermare and now his boy had his seat on the council was lyndon pierce really going to abandon a family tradition of being bent so is it possible pierce is tied up with this guy murray who owns the meadow jane asked not that it would matter no need for corruption when you had council planning guys who thought appalling desecration was acceptable infill not many folk he ent in bed with truth be told gomer said accountant by profession specializin in smoothin things out between farmers and landowners and the ole taxman local accountant whos also on the council popular boy janey popular boy a boy who used to shoot blue tits off a nut dispenser jane looked up at the church steeple a sepia silhouette against a clump of cloud like dirty washing was this the herefordshire of alfred watkins who led genteel parties of gentlemen in panama hats and ladies with sunshades to explore ancient alignments of stones and mounds and moats and steeples was this the herefordshire of the mystical poet thomas traherne who was clothed with the heavens and crowned with the stars she hugged herself wishing she could be back in eirions bed and then wondering if she ever would be again makes you sick she said ar it do gomer said evenin lol boy owre you jane turned to see lol in one of his alien sweatshirts leaning against the lychgate and shaking his head you know how i hate to interfere jane lol said in his mild tentative way but is it possible youre avoiding your mum lol shes been busy shes out all the time a situation you might just be you know exploiting not true at all what im doing is im actually trying to protect her ok she has a position in this village obviously and like how often have i done anything ok anything locally that could cause her embarrassment ok dont answer that but listen this is what lucy would want jane looked at lol and then at gomer hoping they would both understand this not that it mattered she could almost see lucy devenish rising above the lychgate the darkening sky woven into the shadowed folds of her poncho playing purgatory winnie sparke looked past merrily out through the porch door into the waxy evening her white shawl was hanging loose like a priests stole you really shook things up in there lady wasnt me i think something was just waiting to blow you cant just sit on something like this winnie sparke walked out into the night merrily following her i dont suppose you know where mr loste is he isnt here id gathered that but i would like to talk to him maybe i could fix that its possible leave it with me with you tim is kinda fragile like a lot of people with huge talent he needs someone to hold him together oops mind you dont oh my god whats it had risen up like a column of smoke in the dusk its eye sockets black its mouth hanging open and the wings halfextended behind its arms its shoulders were black against a slash of red in the sky like the bar of a burning cross hands reaching up palms outwards as if they were awaiting nails kinda weird huh winnie sparke said they say kids from the royal oak come in here and make out on the graves but hey not on this one the angel was standing on a tomb the size of a doubleoven aga the lettering on the side big enough to read even in the ebbing light joseph longworth all holy angels pray for him choirs of the righteous pray for him guy who built the church winnie sparke said found god and elgar not necessarily in that order im trying to place the quote youre excused its roman catholic newman the dream of gerontius i was listening to it on the way here while shed been trying to engage elgar in conversation an exasperated sophie had gone out and bought her three cds next to the spare and moody cello concerto the fifty minutes of gerontius that shed heard seemed both complex and a little dreary heavy on the deathbed angst scary stuff winnie sparke said all those layers of celestial bureaucracy ok you know how after the soul comes round on the other side he gets a pep talk from his guardian angel and then these demons start messing with him then he gets just one tantalizing glimpse of god im not sure i got that far ok well between the demons and god he gets handed over to this guy winnie sparke reached up and tapped the arm of the grotesque figure on the tomb the angel of the agony i dont know anything about him merrily looked up into the wretched marble face grateful on the whole that there was nothing like this in ledwardine churchyard his job is to plead with jesus to spare the soul of gerontius winnie sparke said its a judgement thing but you know what i think im like the hell with this guy i think we can deal with purgatory right here in wychehill on earth i meant but wychehill yeah sure wychehills as good or maybe as bad a place as any for throwing off your demons maybe we can discuss this sometime she flicked her shawl over a shoulder youre gonna come back now you won through merrily shrugged she lit a cigarette under the church lantern one of its glass panes spidercracked as if by a thrown stone or an air gun pellet if bliss was picking her up she didnt want to go back in there and get pulled into a discussion besides if a requiem was going to be held syd spicer would need to make the arrangements there was a mauve lastlight glaze on the road a faintly rank smell she kicked what appeared to be a shrivelled condom into the side of the wall obtained from a vending machine at inn ya face smoker eh she jumped preston devereaux was leaning on the wall under one of the oak trees he too had a cigarette congratulations mrs watkins im sorry i was just a bit you were bloody furious a woman scorned im sorry youve had a pretty bad week too had better how are you feeling now me devereaux leaned back against the wall scratched his jaw well since you ask last night i got drunk today i sold the offending land rover for peanuts couldnt stand to see it any more im ok something happens you live with it move on you dont pick at it like a townie how do you mean sorry if im causing offence again i assumed you were local name like watkins local origins ive moved around well me too but we came back didnt we god help us i hoped id be able to talk to you before the meeting merrily said but i think you answered my questions back there anyway you were really going to ask me that if id seen the ghost of sir edward elgar on his bike before the crash good god merrily shrugged my job well if you get to know me better youll know its not in my nature to make excuses or throw the blame at anyone living or dead i was tired had a long drive wanted to get home perhaps if i hadnt been so tired idve reacted quicker and thered be two fewer funerals in worcester who knows if youd been less tired you might have been going faster and the result would have been the same only youd probably have been seriously injured i really dont know devereaux shook his head slowly but what i wont do mrs watkins is associate myself with the clowns who say this roads haunted so if thats your idea of a coverup im sorry clowns i dont know whats happening to places like this at one time we absorbed things we the community communities closed ranks healed themselves scabs formed that eventually dropped off kind of people you got here now the townies they just got to keep picking and picking at it what about the royal oak the royal oak he snorted problem at the moment but it wont last they never do these places we just got to sit it out make a fuss you just give them more notoriety and they love that look im more sorry than i can say about what happened to those two kids i was a wild boy too drove too fast inhaled my share of blow not for me to take a moralistic stance but this allencompassing fear of the royal oak live with it is what i say nobody can seem to live with anything any more well yeah everybody expects a perfect life but its been suggested that a lot of class a drugs pass through the royal oak i dont know if thats right but thats what they say devereaux stared at her do they who merrily didnt know how to reply never entirely happy about being blisss snout even if it was a twoway street aye well theyre probably right mrs watkins and thats not good but itll pass be surprised if that place hasnt changed hands again by this time next year raji khans a businessman when it goes off the boil hell get rid you know him stayed with me when he was looking over the oak stayed in one of my lovely holiday lets clever man young mr khan knows how to surf the economic tides you mean mr holliday was right about tourism grants to bring ethnic groups into the sticks its the way this government operates devereaux took a long pull on his cigarette holding it between forefinger and thumb but you know what makes me laugh merrily you dont mind if i call you that not at all what makes me laugh my dear is the way middleclass white folks move here from the harmless peaceful suburbs saying how glad they are to get away from the big bad city with all the drugs and the crime truth is that was an imagined situation fuelled by crimewatch and the daily mail theyd never actually seen any of it he laughed at length the cigarette cupped in his hand and now heres the socalled ghost of edward elgar poor dysfunctional bugger he was and half of them think hes a traffic hazard and half of them think hes on their side against raji khan what can you do with people like that hello a young man in a rugby shirt was edging round the church gate he stood in front of devereaux and did a theatrical salute theyll be out in approximately five minutes sir good lad devereaux turned to merrily my younger boy hugo took the precaution of stationing him in the vestry out of sight whats the verdict son hugo shrugged no problems really well that stella got a bit hysterical but they talked her down i think theyre going for what mrs watkins suggested which is what id left by then well im not really hugo was about nineteen lean like his dad gelled dark hair and an earring he looked at merrily mr devereaux she said are you saying you had a spy in the vestry all the time dads the worst kind of control freak hugo said local intelligence is very important devereaux said you live in a village merrily you know what its like they werent going to say much with me there were they too official he smiled no i exaggerate hugo was at the back already doing the lights he put out his cigarette in a fizzing of sparks against the church wall tell me what youre proposing he said well its a requiem service in the church a holy communion for the dead so that would be a service for the two people who died in the accident why them because theyre dead its a big thing death but funerals today are often cursory and dont bring dont always bring down the curtain dont bring peace or even the promise of peace for the living and how would this service achieve that mr devereaux we could sit down and i could give you the theology in depth and take up the rest of your night lets just say that it does youre very confident im not confident at all that is its not self confidence its she raised her gaze to the darkening sky preston devereaux laughed well who am i to argue with that all right then go ahead its your show now this is just a straightforward service i take it inasmuch as any service is straightforward what i mean is you wouldnt be conducting what the press could call an exorcism youre right i wouldnt because none of us wants silly publicity and if you can deal with it for us in a discreet and dignified fashion wed be most grateful to you discuss it with the rector i should i think youll find he agrees really nice to talk merrily goodnight to you preston devereaux clapped a hand on his sons back and they walked away to a dark x parked in front of merrilys volvo she watched them go feeling faintly sick a bat sailed in front of the church lamp like a blown leaf deal with it for us coming out of the church shed felt halfway in control again now she was a puppet with strings so tangled you couldnt tell who was pulling them merrily heard the voices of the villagers emerging from the church and walked rapidly away along the roadside towards the vicarage a car pulled alongside you all right merrily blisss face at the car window shed actually forgotten all about bliss and his incident she pulled back in midstride is this going to improve my night frannie quite honestly bliss said id say probably not power of place merrily jerked her head away oh god the dc who was called henry pulled back his lamp you couldve waited over by the truck bliss said i did warn you and maybe she would have hung back but a call a few minutes ago from lol to say that hed found jane had fortified her made her feel obliged to go across to join bliss and what lay in its abattoir splatter across the jutting shelf of stone bliss had driven up to the car park opposite the malvern hills hotel at the foot of the beacon where theyd got into henrys police x a roundabout route along dirt tracks had taken them to the other side of the hill henry parking in some woodland before leading them by lamplight like a shepherd along an uphill mud footpath it had brought them to a widemouthed cave in a wall of rocks like a black gable under a roof two uniformed policemen were in the opening smoking cigarettes incident room bliss had said and laughed merrily swallowed being sick wouldnt help the forensics frannie uh you think theres a chance he did this to himself the home office pathologist dr mcewen looked at bliss probably to check that it was ok to speak in front of the woman in the dog collar bliss nodded id say the chances that your man did this to himself are fairly remote mcewen was a softvoiced irishman in a red and blue baseball cap with a suicide if we assume this is something the individual has never attempted before hes usually unsure of the best place to go in so youll normally find two or three test cuts above and below the main wound now if you see here this time merrily didnt look turning away towards the few lights of somewhere in worcestershire laid out like a broken necklace under the ochrestreaked charcoal sky but there is more than one cut blisss fluorescent orange hiking jacket creaking as he bent down sure but theyre not what anybody would call test cuts mcewen said this one here looks like knifeskid but this one arguably a secondary slash is far too deep see what its done to the trachea and the muscle there theres also a wound on the back of the head which might look give me a few minutes more all right are these wounds consistent with that knife back of the head though that looks more like your blunt instrument i havent seen the knife you got it there bagged up bliss said kitchen knife eightinch blade found in the grass not far from his right hand assume he didnt do it to himself and id guess youre looking for more than one person francis probably more than two if it happened here which is how it looks by the bloodspatter then a muscular young feller like this hed take some holding down wouldnt he maybe somebody else holding his head back by the hair over the top of the stone to expose his throat for the knife henry what did you say about this stone known locally as the sacrificial stone boss thats all i can tell you there you go merrily cant say fairer than that bliss took her arm and led her away back up towards the cave and this is midsummers eve right talk me through this through what ritual sacrifice just to get me started that s why you wanted me to come up with you no doubt well find a proper expert tomorrow if we need one but as youre here fair to say your personal experience extends to aspects of pagan worship merrily glanced back at the stone a steep wedge in the hillside the dead man with his black bib of gore arching back over it like hed been been using it for working out about to perform some dynamic form of situp frannie she dug both hands hard into her jacket pockets turned away to where the path wound around to the earthen ramparts of the iron age fort it doesnt happen does it what doesnt ritual sacrifice yes it does bliss said you think of that poor kiddie found in the thames a few years back yes but that wasnt one of ours tut tut this is multicultural britain merrily suggesting that the only valid form of ritual sacrifice in this country should be conducted by white men in white robes with sickles is tantamount to oh i see because this guys black a black man found with his throat cut at a famous ancient british monument thats slightly cross cultural isnt it i dont think its anything like that but we need to eliminate it tell me about midsummers eve most traditional forms of paganism would focus on the solstice sunrise which is still a few hours away but its stupid anyway modern pagans just dont do this kind of thing never say that girl theres always some bastard wholl do anything but i take your point also i mean how longs he been dead few hours max found by some kids teenagers so he was probably killed before dark still be a few walkers about theyre going to stage a sacrificial ritual with the constant risk of an audience a burst of light made merrily turn in time to catch the second contained flash from a crimescene camera bringing the horror luridly alive the obscene hole in the victims throat like parted lips with a protruding tongue she thought of hostages in iraq dying on video heard the keening of the knife in the air saw the blade shining redgolden in the sunset a slash a spurting a chokedoff scream she shivered youre doing well bliss said this is what i wanted to hear huh look if you need a cig go ahead just dont drop the stub im ok you dont look it im sorry merrily i didnt think i do tend to use people me really ive never noticed that side of you bliss grinned headlights washed across the sloping trees below them the turf under merrilys feet felt as springy as an exercise mat with the smoky hills snaking away before her it was like standing on some kind of natural escalator power of place its an execution isnt it possibly bliss said of sorts and youre thinking the victims connected with the royal oak a good detective is open to all possibilities only she hesitated a guy in the parish meeting just now was insisting that the licensing authority had been tolerating what was happening at the royal oak because you got better tourism grants if you could show the government you were encouraging black and asian visitors must send the council a picture this could be worth thousands so i was wondering a racist execution i dont know you know what i think merrily i think if this lad had been found with the same injuries behind one of the garages on the plascarreg estate we wouldnt be asking ourselves any of these questions power of place merrily said it was another ninety minutes or so before they went back to the british camp car park bliss had offered to get henry to take merrily back to her car at wychehill but shed hung on watching the police tape going up lights bobbing around the hillside bliss had wandered off to consult with his team and merrily had phoned lol asking him to get a message to jane dont wait up henry says people come up here for the midsummer sunrise bliss said as they climbed down from the in which case theyll be disappointed tomorr he looked at his watch dear me it is tomorrow anyway i dont want any bugger on that hill until weve been over it in daylight how long are you staying ill drive you to your car and then ill come back for an hour or two see if i can make enough progress to stake a claim on the case soon as howe gets in tomorrow shell be working out how to remove me from the investigation being so close to the worcester border doesnt help bliss unlocked his car dont want to be too tired to put up a decent resistance he drove past the side of the malvern hills hotel and into the road that led back to wychehill however he said if i did want to keep going until sunrise and probably the sunrise after that the answer would be in the knapsack that one of the lads has found among the rocks up by the giants cave as its known a knapsack full of in very saleable quantities well know for certain in the morning if it belonged to our friend he was a dealer not for me to defame the dead without forensic evidence but yeh he was dealing on herefordshire beacon oh heavens a purveyor of narcotic substances on a national monument merrily imagine for a moment if youre a malvern professional person throwing a dinner party how much more civilized it would be to stock up on the after eights on a balmy summer evening with allround views luckily im a vicar who cant afford to throw dinner parties bloody hell frannie but what puzzles me is who would brutally unthroat a drug dealer and then not even nick his flamin stash bliss cruised down the hill past the darkened royal oak in its treelined quarry im norra great believer in coincidence merrily look what can i tell you ive been to a public meeting where the community had to decide what it wanted me to do about the ghost of of a cyclist if anything in that connects with an appallingly nasty murder of a drug dealer on the lower slopes of herefordshire beacon it isnt obvious to me but then it is late but youll be coming back i take it i suppose and i might not be so keep me informed and you keep me informed in the northeastern sky she could see amber strips probably a false dawn midsummer morning in elgars england not only did they not take his drugs bliss said they didnt even nick his mobile work that out part two both in prehistory and in the medieval period the malverns were in effect a ritual landscape against which various religious rites were played out mark bowden with contributions by david field and helen winton the malvern hills an ancient landscape freelancing jane at breakfast said i havent been trying to avoid you did i say you had lol said you had which means the same thing actually merrily said i was feeling bad that i hadnt been as they say here for you maybe you could take me to see this colemans meadow when you get home from school after some sweaty befuddled dreams that she couldnt remember but knew were unpleasant merrily just wanted to do something normal she sat and looked at jane across the refectory table wished they could stay here like this all day jane said whats wrong difficult night merrily put an extra spoonful of sugar in her tea after the meeting frannie bliss took me to look at a murder scene scousers really know how to show a woman a good time like why exactly because the dead man was found with his throat cut on something called the sacrificial stone at herefordshire beacon and bliss wanted to eliminate the possibility of it being a ritual midsummer slaughter by pagans wow for a vicar you really merrily watched her daughter translating every facial twitch jane trying not to be impressed while remembering she had guilty secrets and couldnt afford to be too abrasive over pagans doing ritual murder that is so insulting as bliss pointed out there are pagans and pagans anyway it was bloody horrible and i didnt get back until nearly two am so if youve been trying to avoid me ive not been aware of it who was the vic kid watched too many american crime shows on channel five when i left he was still unidentified jane do you know anything about a dance venue called inn ya face best thing about that place jane spread a slab of honey obscenely on a crumpet is its name how do you know ive been obviously when you never mentioned that we didnt stop long i mean its a good place to go because theres masses of parking space supervised by these hardlooking guys so you dont get your car nicked and its free we thought we might go again some time if there was anybody particularly cool appearing but we somehow never have you and eirion dr samedi was supposed to be on you remember jeff from kidderminster oddly i was only thinking about dr samedi last night hes still in business yeah but we got the wrong night there was this really poxy band on thought they were the new chemical brothers really bad not bad as in wicked bad as in crap talking of chemicals whoever told you im doing drugs is i meant the royal oak inn ya face could you if you wanted to get much there mum how naive are you you can get it anywhere there are like tenyearold dealers outside playgroups i mean all that meetmeonthecornerwhenthelightsaregoingon stuff thats costume drama thats an exaggeration right not much of one prices have never been lower in hereford so im told look mum erm janes eyes flickered you heard from anyone about me like who i dont know morrell the head merrily drank some hot tea what was this why morrell jane does he know about your serial truancy serial mum that is absolute sh how many times jane picked up a piece of crumpet put it down again stared at it and sighed two youre sure i swear look if id asked for time off the premises to work on my project idve got it i just didnt want to tell them exactly what the project involved because all right because i went round to councillor pierces place to ask him about this housing plan and there were all these county council guys there and one was a woman from the education authority why dont i like the sound of this i mean i wasnt you know rude to them or anything just tried to get my point over about colemans meadow being essentially an important ancient monument and they said that was all crap and alfred watkins was a misguided old man they called it acceptable infill and lyndon pierce said he wanted to build ledwardine up into a thriving little town with like restaurants and massage parlours he said that well he said restaurants and a new village hall leisure centre thats already going ahead apparently thats rubbish id have heard been consulted even no really theyre getting a lottery grant seems very unlikely to me i was at a christening tea in the village hall yesterday its going to be redecorated next month it sounded like a seriously done deal to me jane said ill check it out what did you say to them nothing not really when this woman started banging on about morrell i just got out of there jane stood up brushing cat hairs from her skirt you do look knackered mum i am knackered lets not get sidetracked merrily inspected jane in her school uniform hoping it wasnt only familiarity that made her daughter look innocent rather than sultry and faintly menacing like some of the other girls you saw waiting for the school bus jane going on her own to see pierce that was kind of admirable but whether pierce would regard it as mature and socially aware was a different matter you havent done anything else i should know about have you call it intuition he used to shoot blue tits off nut dispensers jane said what lyndon pierce when he was a kid lucy devenish tried to stop him and he pointed his airgun at her and then gomer gomer told you this gomer took the gun off him and flattened it under his jcb i bet the bastard didnt put that in his election leaflets jane dont worry im not going to try and blackmail him or anything jane shouldered her airline bag im probably not even going to say anything about his old man percy pierce doing a dirty deal with the disgusting rod powell to get this like agricultural restriction lifted what so he could build lyndons revolting las vegasstyle villa im not going to hang that on him yet good merrily said im delighted youre probably not going to attempt to blackmail the local councillor because it is as you know a serious crime building on colemans meadow is also a crime jane said well better get off i suppose the phone started ringing merrily rose there is something i dont know isnt there well obviously there must be lots of things mum jane said but i cant imagine anything that would cause you a particular problem when did you ever as soon as merrily heard spicers voice on the phone flat and neutral as underlay it came to her how much she didnt want to go back there you had a good night then he said i had a bloody awful night but how would you know the time for civility was long gone it was clear that wychehill whatever wychehill was needed help the element of nervous dysfunction quiveringly obvious and as lol had said when shed rung to tell him about last night it was surely time that spicer did something about it rather than some outsider of course that could just have been lol not wanting her to go back either im glad you went spicer said you were told to call me off werent you yeah but i couldnt reach you could i of course you could sure who told you to call me off preston why hes just a funny bloke proprietorial his family goes back i mean really goes back norman times im not saying he doesnt like outsiders exactly the guys running upmarket holiday accommodation on his farm but he likes to be in control and people in wychehill like him to be in control theyre all outsiders and they like to buy into the history even holliday so holliday was firing devereauxs bullets holliday wouldve run with elgars ghost all the way to the news of the world even if he doesnt believe a word of it maybe because he doesnt believe a word i can understand devereaux not wanting that i wouldnt want it but you werent there last night no point it was a stitchup but like i say im glad you went it worked out a requiem will be spoton everybody happy why do i feel i ve been stitched up trust me its the best thing devereaux respects you now that counts what about stella cobham oh he isnt gonna forget that is he she came close to making a fool of him and whats your feeling now about what were dealing with dont matter what my feelings are what are yours its impressive but if theres going to be a requiem maybe you should do it no startled by the force of spicers response merrily said nothing its not my thing all right i can get you the names and addresses of the dead kids parents been in touch with the priest handling the joint funeral in cookmans parish i can make the arrangements all you have to do is show up this coming sunday evening why not thank you merrily a long expulsion of breath he was smoking i hear you were up on the hill last night she was getting used to how long it took him to get around to crucial issues all it was a cid man i know was in charge up there he thought i might be able to help he was wrong whyd he think that merrily because it looked as if there was a ritual element to it nah spicer said its urban business innit how do you mean he was a bouncer at the oak i didnt know that syd yeah are there still serious drugs coming out of there in quantity that what your pal thinks not my place but i did hear something about preston devereauxs boy not hugo the other one louis hes about twentythree now what did you hear that hed gone off the rails after the hunt ban yeah thats true youngestever master of the east malvern hunt lived for it totally ban came in he had a breakdown of sorts like his life had been cut off at the roots but his father moved on as he likes to say yeah he sold the horses all the other hunts with the tacit approval of the gutless wankers in the cabinet are doing pretend drag hunts where foxes just accidentally get killed prestons too proud so when he says you move on he means you move on disguising your rage and loathing dont give them the satisfaction and does that also explain his attitude to the royal oak youre doing very well merrily spicer said it usually takes outsiders years to acquire that level of local understanding i live in a village hes right bliss said roman wicklow a hardboy he wouldnt talk on the phone so it was back to that same table in the cathedral cloisters outside it was an alltootypical midsummer morning small white sun crowded by sour clouds not very warm his form includes abh malicious wounding and possession of class a bromsgroves his old playground so theyll be looking there they not you mr onenightstand me no doughnut this time bliss was drinking black coffee left to meself id be roasting raji on a slow spit but when youre off the case youre off the case annie howes taken over since first light legitimately its a worcester thing now from all angles but youre still interested in an academic way i bet i managed to bliss sipped his coffee winced added sugar before they broke the news we had another word with two of the little scallies who found the remains thirteenyearolds sharing a sixpack of fosters so a little mild pressure was permissible finally admitted this wasnt the first time theyd seen roman up the beacon birdwatching mr khan was terribly shocked assuring me hed have fired roman at once if hed so much as suspected and you know strange thing i think he was shocked mr wicklow dealing on the beacon handful of rocks and a few piffling grams you think he really didnt know that kind of trade would be far too trivial for raji not to mention dangerously close to home yeh i believe him when he says hed have had wicklows balls if hed found out wicklow was freelancing probably made the arrangements in the pubs in great malvern then met the clients in the fresh air with those wonderful farreaching views of anybody approaching and a nice cave to shelter in therefore khans not involved oh i never said that bliss looked down into his coffee lowered his voice if hed found out that one of his people was operating on the side and figured it was time an example was made of someone foolish enough to abuse his position well that just might explain why the goody bag was left at the scene he had wicklow killed bliss smiled try and prove it merrily leaned back a stray blade of wan sunlight tinted an edge of the bishops lawn another world so ritual murders definitely ruled out it was never really ruled in also doc mcewens knocked down his own theory that it wouldve taken several people wound on the back of the head now suggests that wicklow was clobbered first and then dragged to the stone before his throat was cut assuming an element of surprise one person could have done that and it wouldnt have taken long i suppose by comparison no time at all bliss looked at her his eyes slitted still funny it should happen when youre around though youre considering the possibility that i did it can you think of a better way of little francis becoming annie howes favourite detective in the whole world instead of off the flaming case merrily hadnt yet been to the office slightly worried about facing sophie whose reasoning on the issue of wychehill and syd spicer had been as it had turned out flawless sophie wasnt in however probably over at the palace dealing with the bishops mail the computer was switched off but four messages were on the answering machine one of them nonroutine and left less than four minutes ago mrs watkins this is winchester sparke winchester sophie came in with a cardboard file under her arm sat down opposite merrily and began to unpack it assembling a small pile of letters on the desk i need to speak with you winnie sparkes voice was harsh and frayed please call me back i the cops have taken tim came pounding on his door took him away lord of dread merrily rang bliss on his mobile hold on a mo she heard the sound of feet on stairs and then an outside acoustic city traffic yeh ive just heard it was a surprise to me too you know anything about this feller hes a composer a music teacher whats the basis for it i dont know merrily its not my case cant you find out if i make a nuisance of meself hate to use a hackneyed old phrase but whats in it for me and i dont want a mention in your prayers youre a protestant he sniffed all right heres my inspired guess an outrage crime is an outrage crime what im thinking it is way i m looking at it is weve got two local dealers taken out within a fortnight both in rural areas i told you about the guy in pershore but didnt you say he was shot in his car modus operandi doesnt exactly tally does it modus schmodus pershores still only half an hours drive from wychehill but is annie howe looking at it from that perspective oh no too smalltime and messy annie wants an outrage crime by which i mean where some normally lawabiding person or persons is pushed well beyond the limits of socially acceptable behaviour by the perceived collapse of everything he or she holds dear thats vigilantism frannie thats death wish ive never met tim loste and i dont know that much about him but a musician and choirmaster however troubled doesnt really strike me as the most obvious serial killer of drug dealers doesnt matter annie wants loste because hes white and middleclass ill see what i can find out and get back to you merrily held the phone to her ear long after the click watching sophie sorting the bishops correspondence recalling her reaction to the royal oak becoming inn ya face one day i think we may be pushed too far you were off sick on monday robert morrell said sick was a dirty word to morrell he worked out three nights a week in the school gym did the london marathon and his skin was lightly tanned all year round you had to be suspicious of a head teacher with a sunlamp jane nodded it was a migraine i get them sometimes in summer and it persisted through yesterday well i was going to come in yesterday and i went out to wait for the bus and it it just came on again you been to the doctor jane well no i know what it is its a migraine ive had it before its like its horrible first of all you see these big black spots in front of your eyes and then it comes and goes i imagine yes it does thats what it does comes and goes and this conveniently capricious migraine was presumably in remission on monday night when you paid a surprise visit to councillor pierce at his home oh god any vague hope that jane had had that this was not why morrell had sent for her hit the deck like a bag of flour it was going to take a lot of sweeping up i erm the migraine seemed to be easing off by the evening so i went for a walk in the cool air to clear my head and i just happened to be passing that way and you know got chatting to these people not knowing who they were at first only the thing is im using aspects of local history for my art project and i was thinking that now i was feeling better i could at least do some work on the erm project and so im sorry rob this probably sounds yes it does jane i didnt i mean janes resolve collapsed she really didnt like this new policy of morrells where when you reached the sixth form you were permitted to call him rob like you were all mates so that when you did something wrong it was like youd let down your mate which was totally ridiculous because there was no way jane would ever get close to having a mate like morrell with his tracksuits his sunlamp his neatly shaven head his minimalist office his tony blair smile he did it now that ghastly smile and then he leaned back in his executive chair and spoke with the kind of horrible lazy fluency that must have persuaded the thick bastards on the education authority that he was smooth enough to do this job jane tell me which particular part of your project involves haranguing elected members and officers of the herefordshire council for performing their democratic duty in opening the way for the kind of muchneeded rural housing that may enable you and your fellow students to remain in this area when you leave the education system rather than becoming economic migrants by the time jane had worked this out it was too late for any kind of smart response morrells smile vanished like that of the tiger deciding it was time to stop playing with his prey and get down to the meal perhaps i need to make it clear to you ms watkins that as a sixthformer you are an ambassador for this school in the greater community do you understand what i mean jane just nodded couldnt even manage a respectable display of dumb insolence all right on this occasion to save further embarrassment and to protect our exemplary record on truancy i informed councillor mrs bird the vicechairman of education and one of our governors as id have thought you would remember that on this occasion youd been given time off to work on your project thank you jane said feebly and ill thank you morrells palm slammed down on his desktop not to drag the name of this school into disrepute in future with your lies and your childish fantasies do you understand what im saying far from covering up for you next time jane nodded good morrell said lightly off you go bending his shaven head over some report he highlighted a line of type with a yellow marker pen in the doorway ashamed of her craven attitude jane turned round its not lowcost housing you know its luxury executive geddout jane morrell murmured youre beginning to bore me jane just like fell out into the corridor knowing her face would be red and scrunched up feeling the heat of tears and weight of the establishment it was like stalinist the council intent on crushing all opposition putting the word out to the chief of police to warn her off she stumbled into the toilet to wash her face and then went into one of the cubicles and fumbled out her mobile to leave a message on eirions phone see if he could pick her up after school needing someone to howl to soon as she switched on the voicemail signal buzzed and she clapped both hands around the phone because morrell was strict on the use of mobiles during classtime confiscation had been known for as long as a week and in this case would be guaranteed and then the secret police would have all her private contacts you have one message to access your messages press one probably be eirion saying he was going to be tied up tonight jane pressed one hello ms watkins this strange cheerful mans voice my name is jerry isles and i work for the guardian newspaper id like to discuss your campaign on behalf of the um ledwardine ley could you please call me back jane stood there with her back to the cubicle door staring into the toilet the mobile feeling like a stick of dynamite with a fizzing fuse when she and eirion had done the document for the net shed put her mobile in as the contact number mainly because she didnt want anybody ringing the vicarage expecting maybe a couple of concerned leyhunters who might be prepared to send letters of protest to the council the guardian jeez and what do you know about this man loste sophie asked nothing merrily spread her hands hearsay ive never met him ive never even seen him shed just called winnie sparke the call had lasted around half a minute sparke insisting that she didnt like to speak on the phone and could they meet this afternoon somewhere other than wychehill great malvern would be appropriate she knew a place they could be private youre going sophie said what can i do this man has been taken in for questioning about a peculiarly savage and revolting murder and you propose to meet his girlfriend somewhere private im not sure shes his girlfriend do you even know anything about her there are only twentyfour short hours in a day sophie merrily slumped back in her chair leaning it against the wall and im already working most of them im sorry i ll see what i can find out im sure youve a stack of letters to do for the bishop shush sophie said as the phone rang gatehouse yes she is sighing one moment inspector merrily sat up groping for the phone mr loste merrily bliss coming at her like a fast train hissing from a tunnel if you wanna know in absolute painofdeath confidence why theyve brought him in listen up because i dont have much time you got shorthand sophies is better then put me back to sophie and this really doesnt go any further than the two of you understand or ill be in more shite than you could ever imagine sure what im giving you is a text message received by raji khan last night transmitted from wicklows mobile read and destroy then call me back and tell me what you think texted by wicklow texted almost certainly after wicklows death by wicklows killer or an accomplice and passed on to howe by khan in his capacity as an upright citizen youll find it fairly unbelievable gimme sophie merrily handed over the phone and played nervously with her zippo watching sophie reaching for a notepad and pen beginning to write sign oh thine im sorry continue arcane pitman loops and whorls and dots everything suddenly moving unintelligibly fast yes yes sophies eyebrows raised my god yes so it is no i wont do that thank you inspector she hung up tore off the top page of her notebook and sat down to transcribe i recognized it at once recognized what let me finish sophie reversed the shorthand notebook pushed it across the desk to merrily shed handprinted the transcription i was instructed not to put it into the computer lord of dread and lord of power this is thine the fateful hour when beneath the sacred oak thrice the sacred charm is spoke thrice the sacrificial knife reddens with a victims life thrice the mystic dance is led round the altar where they bled what is it merrily looked up black sabbath its sophie frowned elgar im afraid his librettist anyway its an extract from the cantata we discussed the dream of it cant be gerontius is an oratorio sophie said with no sarcasm of a kind the cantata is caractacus oh the one set on herefordshire beacon british camp bloody hell literally the passage relates to where caractacus facing his final confrontation with the romans is directed by various prophecies from what you might call druids of the old school the libretto particularly on paper it lacks a certain subtlety of expression elgar wasnt famous then it was written by a neighbour a mr acworth a retired civil servant as i recall and this bollocks was texted to khan the sacrificial knife reddens with a victims life merrily stood up and turned to the window broad street traffic tshirts summer frocks inn ya face the phone went again and sophie took it her reading glasses dropping down on their chain she wasnt on long ill tell her she said if i see her thank you when she looked up at merrily her face was creasing with an unexpected almost motherly concern you cant react to everything just tell me detective chief inspector howes office she would like to meet you in wychehill later this afternoon howe wants to see me the sergeant said she very much hopes it will be convenient which means if i dont show therell be a police car outside the vicarage at some ungodly hour im sorry merrily what the hell was this about merrily sat down laid her palms on the desk took two long breaths and called bliss back no idea bliss said but whatever the bitch wants you keep me well out of it what do you reckon about the text if it wasnt so bad itd be creepy how many people would recognize the words of an elgar cantata in the malverns sophie murmured about four thousand not a great many rival dealers bliss said thats for sure we must be looking at one of the principal reasons for them picking up mr loste maybe hes just advising them as an exper no sorry im overtired it was texted to raji khan personally to the royal oak landline would that work you can text a landline and the message gets read out over the phone loste has an oak merrily said sorry i just thought loste has an oak planted in his front garden thats uncommon it is when your gardens barely big enough for a dwarf appletree a lot of oaks here thats all i was thinking sacrificial oak royal oak and the oak was the sacred tree of the druids even i know that what does it tell us i dont know maybe annie howe does you know bliss said if it turns out annies pulled the right man within just a few hours id really hate that when merrily got back from the healthfood shop with some hardlooking bean and chickpea pasties sophie was printing out a document didnt take long to find her it was from amazon most popular results for dr c winchester sparke homing trade paperback march a healers diary with declan flynn hardback october lifedefining a selfhelp tutor paperback june legacy of the golden dawn paperback reissued a writer merrily said it makes sense i wondered what an american woman was doing living in the malverns on her own kept meaning to ask people but it never a writer can live anywhere all her books appear to fall under the general heading of mind body and spirit sophie said with faint distaste so im not sure how seriously we can take the doctor new age she comes over as very almost archetypally new age be careful sophie said village idiot winnie sparke cupped her hands drank from the holy spring and then looked up at merrily holy water rippling down her face hands pushing her wet curls back over both ears for a moment she looked stricken and feral like some captured wood nymph you have to help me hell die in there im not kidding inside the nineteenthcentury gabled building which enclosed the holy well the oncesacred healing water ran from a thin plastic pipe into a stone sink on the floor a red cross was marked out in tiles on the wall above the pipe someone had scrawled in black the goddess for ever neopagan graffiti up in the wooded hills on the outskirts of town it all seemed a little sad a new age fringe thing no longer part of mainstream malvern you have contacts in the police i know you do winnie sparke said you have to get it over to them that tim didnt do this thing like wychehill on a grand scale great malvern clung to the sides of hills its houses and shops and public buildings like the seats in a long stadium with the vast severn plain as its arena the difference being that the real action had been up here where a village had grown into a fashionable resort town founded on a victorian faith in the curative powers of spring water now all that was long over and great malvern was just a busy town with heavy scenery steep streets an historic priory church built of exotically coloured stones a good theatre and most of the wells and springs hidden away nowadays if you wanted to drink the pure healing water you were advised by the health police to boil it first c winchester sparke had said in disgust like nobody understands any more nobody gets it about the energy of springs the waters gushing and gurgling all through these rocks like a blood supply and nobodys revelling in it any more its become repressed stifled like the longforgotten wychehill well there was a well at wychehill merrily said according to legend hell more than that according to history there was this holy well at wychehill that was supposed to have stopped flowing and nobody knows where it is my theory is that it was blocked during the damn quarrying explains a lot about wychehill winnie sparke had said they had to meet here because wychehill had too many furtive prying eyes including annie howes this afternoon merrily thought so it wasnt a bad idea they were lone pilgrims at the holy well shed found winnie sitting on its steps wearing a white summer dress and a cardigan decorated with ancient egyptian figures making camp hand gestures why would they think he killed this man dr sparke merrily stood in the doorway arch looking down at the trees softening the vast green vista of the plain obviously she couldnt tell winnie sparke about the text please dont call me dr sparke people over here an american called dr something they think you purchased it off the web for like thirty dollars winnie smiled wanly through the waterglaze theres a public bridleway across there with a park bench merrily said do you mind if we sit on the bench i didnt get to bed until first light ok well sit on the bench whatever its just im feeling like i need to move make things take off this is a very stressful time in full daylight winnie looked older a woman well into middle age but with good skin and good hair they walked down from the holy well across a small parking area and on to the bridleway which sloped scenically away into the trees they sat on the bench im sorry i dont really know you and tim loste friends and fellow searchers tim came to wychehill for a purpose he had an inheritance which allowed him to throw up his teaching job and pursue his calling merrily waited the sun hidden for most of the day was now warm on her face elgar people keep calling it an obsession i hate that word it implies a sickness rather than a penetrating inspirational creative focus is it so bad to be driven depends what youre driven towards i suppose towards what drove elgar what made him into the greatest composer these islands ever had and does tim loste know what that was oh sure i believe weve gotten close to that the results will be tims own piece for orchestra and choir with a divine theme involving elgar himself as a character a major work about the stress and agony leading up to the realization of a great and beautiful mystery and your part is i get to write the words the libretto winnie looked away at the view and what is the mystery its a mystery winnie said hell if we were in wychehill i wouldnt even be telling you this much but believe me its an awesome thing you dont like wychehill i like my cottage i like my views i love the malverns no i dont like wychehill the way it is right now i bought in a hurry after my divorce and at some stage im gonna move on im being frank with you see in wychehill they regard tim not as a precious fragile talent but as some kind of village idiot a liability you ask people there like that asshole holliday if they think he killed the guy on the hill theyll go sure why not look at the history i heard he smashed a window at the royal oak oh wow a window yeah winnie sighed sure he did that and got himself caught and beat up on by the muscle there who told you about that syd a worrying idea settled on merrily like cold air around her shoulders who exactly who was it beat him up do you know the muscle they have these doormen who oh winnies head began to nod like a dog ornament on a cars rearwindow shelf ok right now i see where youre coming from you think this guy roland roman ok look maybe it was him maybe it wasnt i wouldnt know only the cops could think that was significant truth of it is tim wouldnt even remember who it was beat up on him the night it happened two three months ago he was up on the beacon trying to puzzle something out in his work and the wind was in the wrong direction blew it up the hill this techno hiphop shit barbaric he called it like an invasion he couldnt shut it out it was filling up his head and he went a little crazy hed been drinking im working on that winnie sparke looked down im trying to clean it out of him with meditation what happened next merrily said he coulda just walked away he can walk seven eight miles up there on a clear night ive known him do that but he stormed off down to the royal oak took a rock out the wall and he hurled it through a window and then he like he just stood there on the parking lot screaming like a mad person like if it was me idve put the damn rock through the glass run like hell he just stood there screaming like he wanted them to come out for him i guess he has a certain masochistic streak and they obliged my god did they oblige he was badly hurt those guys dont pull punches and they hit where it doesnt show it was lucky helen the roving nurse was passing in her car and she went to fetch syd and they pulled him out took him home didnt leave the house for five days i wanted to have a doctor check him over but he said he refused i guess the main damage was emotional spiritual he became depressed couldnt work for maybe two weeks but hey nobody could think hed take such an extreme winnies dark eyes were shining hot and bruised under the heavy curls i checked you out on the church of england deliverance website also some news stories a lot happened to you very quickly guess that was to do with being a woman in this job not too many women exorcists not many no merrily anticipated the way this might be going maybe ill write a book about it in about thirty years winnie smiled ruefully in the shadows of her hair wicklow merrily groped for a way of putting this without mentioning the text message roman wicklows body was found on whats called the sacrificial stone nobody seems to be sure whether it ever was that but its obviously in a place immortalized in elgars caractacus as the site of druidic blood rituals it wouldnt be too hard for the police to see connections i mean the music tim loste puts on with his choir in the church obviously elgar but they did caractacus once winnie sparke looked down at her hands still wet in her lap ok tim is director of an amateur choir made up of men and women from all over the three counties they did caractacus with incomplete instrumentation and in spite of all of that it was pretty awesome tim wanted to stage it openair on the beacon tap into that original energy but the expense ruled it out and the logistics getting an orchestra up there and if it rained and worse than that what if there was some rave thing on at the oak at the same time some nights the amplified sound carries miles drowns the valley i imagine it mustve become the bane of his life that pub winnie sparke gave merrily a hard look like she was beginning to wonder if she wasnt talking to the wrong person im just trying to look at it from the polices point of view merrily said that an artistic guy like tim loste could overpower some professional thug and then take out his throat i dont know anything about him i dont know how big he is or how old hes a creative person who hates violence is all they stopped talking while two women on horses clopped past and he wasnt at the meeting at the church last night merrily said i wouldve expected him to be there uhhuh winnie shook her curls i wouldnt let him near the church last night i came on his behalf see when he heard about that meeting he was scared you were gonna try to work some kind of exorcism to dispel the spirit of elgar me too i was just so mad at syd for bringing in an exorcist i wanted you to realize the hugeness of this thing you were being asked to do like if youd jumped the wrong way in the church i was ready to take it to the media hey heres the church of england gonna drive the spirit of elgar out of his beloved hills nobody would dare consider anything like that thered be a national outcry yeah you say that now but if you saw tim the state he was in believe me you mightve been ready to look at something drastic he needed he needed to calm down some so you told him to stay away i was scared hed start yelling say something stupid where did you find him in the end the place i left him the one place i could be sure and im not gonna tell you ok you dont need to know that the police might need to if you can prove he couldnt have been anywhere near the beacon when i cant prove it i wasnt with him ok winnie looked away i cant talk to cops their minds run on narrow rails she stood up im sorry i need to walk merrily followed her along the bridleway thinking that the malverns werent exactly wild any more few areas of this long bumpy spine were unreachable by wellused footpaths the gentle heart of england winnie sparke said miles of fertile tranquil lowland and then suddenly you have these volcanic rocks like a long altar rising from the plain of the severn and you see that is precisely what it was a place of spiritual significance since the stone age to the early christians a dark place you mean a stronghold of pagan worship still rich in stories of curses and the devil so i guess what you had was a wilderness place for early christian hermits to test their faith a retreat for hermits and seers and prophets riddled with springs lifeforce and i guess what you have now merrily battered hackedat and underesteemed is the remains of an altar an altar to elgar sure for some people hell for a lot of people but where was elgars altar im not sure what you mean he pulled music from out the air he used to say that and he listened to the trees he had a thing going with trees winnie said this is true ill explain all this to you one day but not right now i she took merrilys arm youre a spiritual person syd too but syd was a soldier and he doesnt talk about it hes a priest he has to talk about it he doesnt talk about himself you dont know how hes reacting sure hes helped tim but that doesnt mean he understands and youre a writer its a living winnie said just about listen i thank you for hearing me out we can be friends right i hope so i dont have too many friends in wychehill its like i said about the rocks wychehills built on a place hacked out from the rocks a great open wound prone to infection part of what tims doing at the church with the music its about that healing the rocks as a priest you should maybe think about that meantime you remember what i said about tim and you tell whoever that wherever theyre holding him they should look out for him you know what im saying day and night merrily had just a few minutes to get back to wychehill to meet annie howe for whatever reason only about three miles so no problem she drove past the british camp car park at the foot of the beacon where two marked police cars were on display also outside the hotel across the road a bill for the worcester evening news which read hunt on for malvern ritual killer maybe the holding of tim loste was not yet official but he looked far more guilty to merrily now than he had before shed spoken to winnie sparke weight of the ancestors on the computer in the scullery jane tapped in the url that eirion had dictated she found with an unexpected sense of shock and dismay the picture of herself looking what hed described as pissedoff but sexy behind her cole hill was serene and enigmatic in its morning gauze of bright mist oh god why had she let him talk her into this probably all that stuff about the firm young breasts inside the school blouse underneath she was just a whore yeah got it she said into the mobile what site is this ema eirion said earth mysteries affiliates its a campaigning outfit kind of a mystical greenpeace didnt waste any time did they but then its probably the best story theyve had all year under the picture it said jane watkins fighting for alfreds ley below that the handdrawn map that she and eirion had scanned showing all the points on the cole hill line but its only been up a few hours how could the guardian have got on to it so soon they wouldnt have whats obviously happened is that one of the guys who runs the ema site saw there was a potential news story here and scored himself a tipoff fee i mean i couldve tried that but the papers are never as interested if it comes from the people involved just looks like youre desperate for publicity eirion was at home in abergavenny hed left school early you could apparently do that on the smallest excuse when your final days as a schoolkid were ebbing away im not sure i am now jane said not sure youre what desperate for publicity feeling a little intimidated to be honest she told him about morrell jane you cant have it both ways you started this when are you going to call him back the guardian guy dont know whether i am i mean the national press like i thought it was ok pissing off the council but that bitch can really damage me and mum probably i doubt it eirion said shes only a councillor isnt she a servant of democracy she doesnt think shes a servant vicechair of education she thinks thats serious power its obvious she went straight to morrell and told him that one of his students was making trouble for her mates its the way they work hes their employee but she couldnt really threaten him least i dont think she could irene morrell is like insanely ambitious and hes quite young moorfields just a stepping stone hes not going to offend a powerful councillor for the sake of one student who he hates and would really like to get rid of anyway you dont know that youve never seen him all right what should i do there was a silence come on there shouldnt be a silence eirions dad was a bbc governor in wales and he had a cousin who was news editor on the western mail in cardiff eirion was like totally steeped in the media i dont know eirion said thanks let me think about it ill call you back soon soon im sorry jane its ok she sat staring at the screen feeling terminally forlorn jane watkins fighting for alfreds ley as lol had pointed out there was no proof that it was alfreds ley alfred might not even have known about it or worse he might have discounted it there could be some element here that totally disqualified colemans meadow just because it looked right could be shed stitched herself up jane couldnt face looking at that smug pout any more and switched off the computer just sat there waiting dolefully stroking ethel who was sitting in the intray best thing would be to leave it for a day or two give the dust time to settle on the other hand the planning committee would be meeting next week to make a decision on colemans meadow sure she could leave it she could walk away and spend the rest of her life regretting it despising her own cowardice or she could take some more time off school in open defiance of her head teacher and follow it through because forget earthenergy forget spirit paths at the very least whether alfred watkins had known about it or not this was a rare alignment of ancient sacred sites which had somehow survived for maybe four thousand years four thousand years of mystical tradition against one more year of schooling for somebody who wasnt sure whether she even wanted to go to university at the end of it jane felt the weight of the ancestors on her shoulders this was probably one of those situations where mum would go to the church and pray for guidance jane thinking that if she did that after all shed said over the years it would at least give god the best laugh hed had since he hit the egyptians with a plague of locusts the scullery phone rang look irene jane said ive been thinking jane im really sorry oh mum im also sorry for not being eirion listen flower you can probably guess whats coming you have to go back to malvern dont call me flower right im sorry im there now and i have someone else to meet will you be ok sure ive already fed ethel ill get something for me later is everything all right everythings fine i wont be late i promise i wont be late this time honestly take as long as you like jane said she hung up and felt tearful felt like a stupid ineffectual kid who got caught up in fads and crazes and thought she was so smart and spiritually developed but faced with a crunch situation didnt basically have the nerve to follow through buggerall tim lostes house the heart of the enigma a flat grey victorian or edwardian town house that just happened to have been built in the country a tiny front garden held in by iron railings an oak tree that shouldnt be here merrily stepped into the house called caractacus with some trepidation and an uncomfortable sense of deja vu well not quite because she knew where this feeling was coming from remembering when bliss had invited her to the home of a suspected serial murderer obsessed with the cromwell street killings all black sheets and pinup pictures of dead celebrities stay with me annie howe said and dont touch anything weve been over it forensically but what nothing merrily said in the dim narrow camphorsmelling hallway shed come face to face with a dead celebrity he was lifesize in bowler hat and hacking jacket standing there behind his black yardbrush moustache and the high handlebars of mr phoebus as if he was about to wheel the bicycle out of the shadows towards the front door yes rather startling at first isnt it howe said the black and white photograph massively blownup had been fixed to a wooden frame and propped up against the end wall of the passage so that it filled almost the full width and when you came in by the front door you were looking directly into the grainy eyes of all the pictures of elgar why this one merrily had the feeling that the huge stately mr phoebus important to elgar was also very important to tim loste a bike that meant business could take elgar anywhere a symbol of the mobility of the spirit it still didnt have a lamp what are you thinking annie howe said just wondering what im doing here howe said my understanding is that youve been here two or three times in the past few days ive never been here before in the village then before and possibly even during the murder of roman wicklow so i thought id like to hear about the purpose of your visits dont you know well frankly the version of it that one of my officers was told seemed too ridiculous even for me huh merrily had come directly to lostes cottage because this was where the police car was parked along with a silver bmw presumably howes there had been a uniformed constable at the gate and howe in a midgrey cotton suit had been in the front garden examining the oak sapling her fine light hair was clipped close to her skull her makeup minimal jane had once said she looked like a nazi dentist unfair sort of howe opened a panelled door to the right stepping back living room if you take a careful look around perhaps you could tell me if theres anything there that strikes as much of a chord for you as the elgar blowup evidently did an atmosphere like a faded sepia photograph and more old photographs hanging from a wooden picture rail all around the mustardcoloured walls some of them were portraits of elgar some landscapes merrily recognized stonehenge and glastonbury tor but the rest were less easy unknown hill scenery might be malverns might not also churches none of them obvious no hereford or worcester cathedral no malvern priory over the tiled fireplace was a large framed photo of an obvious oak tree a huge and ancient one bulging black against the light it was the only one in colour but all the colour was in the sky on the mantelpiece below it was a scattering of acorns and a bottle of whisky half empty howe looked at merrily when beneath the sacred oak obvious where howe was coming from but what could merrily add to it nothing she was mystified well he clearly has a fascination with oak trees annie but i expect your wellhoned deductive skills had told you that already on the way in shed spotted a line of what shed thought were potted plants until shed noticed the leaves somehow she felt this was winnie sparkes doing filling the place filling tims life with oak trees why druidry caractacus what was this about maybe he can get some kind of weird buzz by smoking acorns or something merrily said and then regretted it howe was in there so what exactly have you heard about mr loste and illegal drugs nothing i was being merrily sighed facetious something about you brings out the child in me she looked around there was a long writing desk with a musical score on it and an empty whisky bottle in the footwell a bookcase a cd cabinet two leather easy chairs but no television or radio i mean what do you want me to say he has a thing about oaks how that ties in with the royal oak i have no idea is that one of the reasons youve nicked him howe said do you know of a connection between oaks and elgar no do you howe took down a book with pages marked by luminous postit stickers it was a biography of elgar whose name as far as merrily could see occurred on the spine of virtually every volume in the bookcase howe opened it out on the writing desk a paragraph was marked by a pencil line in july about two months after the elgars had moved to brinkwells they were visited by their friend algernon blackwood writer of ghost stories elgar took blackwood to see a copse of according to alice elgar sinister trees which were said although blackwood may have invented this to have once been spanish monks punished for practising black magic elgar found them fascinating merrily looked up doesnt say they were oak trees wheres brinkwells sussex sussex elgar lived there for a while before returning to worcestershire so what does that tell us anything at all evidently not howe shut the book but it was the only marked page in any of the books that wasnt selfexplanatory i dont get it what are you looking for exactly part of your curious job as i understand it ms watkins is to monitor the activities of religious cults wouldnt put it that strongly are there practising druids in the area that youre aware of there are druids everywhere its a popular form of paganism no strict rules no dogma dress optional and the veneration of oak trees thats traditional and still valid sure but if you want me to look around here and tell you that tim loste is an obvious druid id say it was far from obvious and even unlikely unless youve found robes and pentacles and stuff in his wardrobe howe said nothing merrily was reminded of those infamous satanic childabuse investigations of the s and s when mccarthyite social workers would seize as damning evidence any fragment of conceivably occult paraphernalia like a broomstick in the broom cupboard or a video of rosemarys baby also modern druids dont practise human sacrifice they tend towards vegetarianism not historically however evidently still trying to stitch something onto that texted quote from the choral work after which this house was named have you asked him where this sudden interest in oaks comes from well of course you have but what did he say he said nothing he froze up on me why do you think im here asking you i dunno merrily shook her head youve got buggerall really havent you annie youre holding this guy on a few tenuous threads lets go outside howe said dci annie howe always a problem here howe was an ironclad atheist therefore suspicious of the clergy and now clearly appalled that modern womanhood should also have descended at this stage of human evolution to medieval dressingup games as for deliverance there had been one surreal happening in the heat of midday in a hop yard in the frome valley when the reinforced walls of howes scepticism might have been badly breached if shed allowed it if her reaction had not been flat denial the whole incident apparently edited from her conscious memory merrily followed her into the overgrown pocket garden with its centrepiece oak sapling thinking there was no real reason for howe to have brought her here it was as though she had to seize on any opportunity to look merrily in the face and repeat wordlessly nothing has ever happened to dent my belief that you are wasting your intelligence on fairy tales they walked to the rear of the house under the galvanized metal car port still no car in it presumably loste hadnt got it back yet after his crash a small square yard ended at an iron gate opening to a welltrodden mud path leading directly on to the hill the hill far closer here than in the rectory garden this is how loste gets to the herefordshire beacon or indeed into the whole network of malvern footpaths howe said he spends whole days walking up there and im told whole nights sometimes i think if i had to live in this house i might do that too merrily said never locks his back door seems to feel a certain ownership howe opened the gate and went through his hills uhhuh merrily shook her head elgars elgars dead howe said in a manner of speaking the music lives on i suppose loste sometimes takes the music with him he has an mp player containing id guess everything elgar ever wrote some of it repeated with different orchestras soloists et cetera and that could be a bit mindblowing you think merrily stepped onto the path up on the beacon head full of caractacus druids chanting about human sacrifice something explodes in his brain and he goes for the nearest drug dealer with a knife he just happens to have on him you know caractacus ms watkins sophie knows it sophie in the office howe deliberated for a moment we have and this is confidential another link to loste relating directly to the concept of druidic sacrifice as described in caractacus what kind of link howe didnt reply i suppose a lot of people around here are likely to know all the gory bits merrily said not all of these people are as vocal in their opposition to the royal oak as timothy loste or as demonstrative as in throwing a stone through a window an act of wilful damage as a result of which several people suffered minor injuries he would if wed known about it at the time have faced charges if he hadnt been severely beaten up by the injured parties making them less inclined to press charges one of the men forced to restrain him howe said was roman wicklow you know that for certain now weve spoken to both of the other doormen whove signed statements to that effect also providing us with a full and graphic description of lostes behaviour that night and some of the threats issued by him during the struggle oh so you see we dont quite have buggerall no merrily looked away up the steep path into the hills soon barricaded by hard blue sky it didnt look that good for tim loste did it no longer seemed like a case of howes people going for the easy option first to save laboriously unravelling strands of rivalry in the west midland drug community she wondered how she was going to bring up the suggestion that the police should keep a serious eye on loste for as long as he was in their care because of the risk of suicide or selfharming what about blood on his clothes forensic evidence dna we should have some results tomorrow morning howe said i think it likely that theyll enable us to move on to the next stage she stepped onto a small tump by a gorse bush looked down to the road where another police car was pulling in looked down at merrily right ive been as open as i possibly can with you ms watkins ive put my cards on the table id now like you to reciprocate id like you to tell me off the record for the present exactly why you were called to wychehill and what you know about the night timothy loste crashed his car into a telegraph pole i wasnt there i dont care if you were there or not im looking for background information not a witness statement gossip if you like im trying to get a picture of his mental condition and my information is that hes so obsessed with the late edward elgar that hes seeing the mans ghost around every corner id say thats an exaggeration and as far as that particular ghost story goes hes not the only one at least thats the basis on which i was asked to look into it yes howe said we do know about the other one also you and i we wouldnt necessarily agree on what claiming to have seen a ghost says about someones state of mind i can think of very little that wed agree on howe said and apart from anything were talking about an artist a professional dreamer which in his line of work is not necessarily a pejorative term elgar was a dreamer loste is supposed to be writing a musical work about elgar you know what im getting bloody sick of this annie howe came down from the mound her scrubbed face actually colouring as if all socalled artists were wispy little treehuggers have you ever seen timothy loste ive tried annie god knows ive tried then ill describe him for you loste is forty years old and despite his alcohol problem extremely fit has been known to walk virtually the length of the malverns and back within a day by a different route knows those hills like the back of his hand every rock and cave and crevice yes but that hardly at the royal oak that night as i may have implied it took three experienced doormen to subdue him as hes also about half a head taller than wicklow was and built ms watkins like the side of a house oh and the rock he put through that window was at a rough estimate the size of a small television set and maybe twice as heavy oh now tell me again that were talking about a harmless inoffensive little dreamer with a natural abhorrence of violence a buzzard passed silently overhead a uniformed policeman appeared in the garden theyve been trying to get you maam howe lifted her head thanks robert im coming now if she was going to be head of cid for the proposed new midlands megaforce before turning forty she didnt have any time to waste watching howe talking tersely into her mobile listening and nodding functioning merrily felt useless irrelevant chasing shadows chasing lights sometimes it seemed that deliverance amounted to little more than this people nudging one another whos that what does she do oh youre kidding her role nebulous her focus blurred why was she here who in the end would be healed what was clear however was that nobody else would try too hard to make sense of loste his obsession with elgar his oaktree fetish oaks sacred oaks the royal oak too many oaks did any of this link into the history or even the folklore of the area it wasnt as if there was some ancient resident whose memory she could tap into nobody had lived here longer than a quarter of a century well except for one person not someone she particularly wanted to approach but merrily slipped away knowing that annie howe having failed to get anything useful out of her would have forgotten by now that shed even been here curse came down the name on the gate was old wychehill farm suggesting that perhaps this was what remained of the original hamlet while the present village was just fragments of a repair job for a quarryravaged hill in fact old wychehill farm was big enough to have been a hamlet in itself sunk into its own valley halfcircled by mature broadleaf trees with the swizzlestick profiles of pines and monkey puzzles poking out of the mix the farmhouse at the end of nearly half a mile of private drive turned out to be the turreted house in the valley which merrily had noticed that first morning the turret crowning a victorian gothic wing added to a much older dwelling with timbers like agebrowned bones she parked in the farmyard courtyard really no animals in view no freerange chickens the threestorey house was enclosed by outbuildings of the same greybrown stone some of the more distant buildings had curtains at their diamondpaned windows my lovely holiday lets a black pickup truck eased in behind her a stylish truck with chrome siderails and silver flashes on its flanks two men getting out squinting into the sun one of them strolling across help you looking for mr devereaux which one preston devereaux the man stood looking her up and down pinching his unshaven chin shame about that apart from golden highlights and a sharper jawline he looked a lot like preston devereaux same narrow features same loose unhurried gait as hed wandered over except this guy was over thirty years younger and the other one was the younger son hugo louis this is mrs watkins hugo said merrily the face of louis devereaux former huntsman alleged former substanceabuser split into this voracious and undeniably attractive grin and we re stuck with spicer the injustice of it louis turned to his brother you better go and find the old man no hurry want to come with me merrily is it safe im a country gentleman louis said from a long long line of country gentlemen of course it isnt safe he strode past her across the yard turning the handle on a plain door it didnt open it was jammed at the bottom he gave it a kick whole place is seizing up his accent was posher than his fathers probably been away to public school she looked up at him as he held open the door i really wont keep him long he might want to keep you though louis said i would end of the passage look he bent down put an arm around her shoulders pointing the beacon room following her into the passage there was an old manure smell as if this entrance had been used for the changing of generations of farm boots it was a rear hallway low earthcoloured windowless the only light funnelled down the well of some narrow back stairs to her left until she pushed open the door at the end into lavish sunshine from a long window framing a wowgasp view of the great tiered weddingcake of herefordshire beacon the beacon room obviously built into the victorian wing to accommodate this view the hill was a couple of miles away as if it had been aligned for maximum impact quite impressive isnt it louis said as crime scenes go lit up like a housing estate last night cops swarming all over it exciting yeah i guess it was i suppose when its somebody you dont know well ive probably seen him if hes the one i think he is at the oak you go there now and then not as often as i used to quite good for you know girls i can imagine and of course for pissing off len holliday and the wychehill residents action group louis said one tries to sympathize but that guy dont suppose youre really aware of the royal oak down here or the road dont suppose we are particularly louis said she looked around the room lofty woodpanelled definitely a mans room even a young mans room minimal furniture apart from stereo speakers the size of small wardrobes racks of cds and vinyl and potentially interesting framed photographs over the baronial fireplace was a period poster behind glass advertising pink floyd and the crazy world of arthur brown at the roundhouse in london the names were wreathed in coloured smoke from a pipe smoked by a reclining naked man like some stoned s version of michelangelos adam i was a wild boy too drove too fast inhaled my share of blow on the panelled wall over a writing desk with a worn leather top there was a framed black and white photo of a bunch of young longhaired men one of whom was eric clapton the lean grinning guy on the end was also unmistakable he looked like louis devereaux with longer hair and lush sideburns blimey merrily said is that dad was very well connected once upon a time images of a misspent youth mrs watkins merrily jumped preston devereaux was standing in the doorway an older duller figure than she remembered from the other night a working man wearing a farmers green nylon overalls and a nylon cap didnt know him well he said but you dont throw away a picture like that do you were you in a band never had the talent managed a couple when i was up at oxford in the late s which meant carrying the amps back then and inventing light shows i was good at that oh gawd memory lane time louis said im out of here he bowed to merrily made an exaggerated exit twentyfour next week devereaux said going on ten if ten means prepubertal im not sure id agree what were you doing at oxford physics so what happened i mean what happened devereaux walked over to the beacon window that happened history roots no escape you think there is but there ent anyway he stood in front of merrily hands behind his back no escape for me either mr devereaux what you said the other night about dealing with something in a discreet and dignified fashion have you merrily shook her head become too complicated when youve had a man murdered and when the local man under suspicion of having killed him local man preston devereaux almost left the ground there are no local men up there mrs watkins why i was forced to come back im sorry no i m sorry continue i was just going to say that the man suspected of murder is also the man i most needed to talk to about the cyclist you can say elgar in here merrily thank you anyway it means i havent been able to get to loste and in the meantime other questions have opened up like he was the first to identify the image in the road as elgar hes obsessed with elgar he apparently hates what the royal oak has become so i understand yes if his hatred of the royal oak has now led to a murder i dont well i dont know how relevant that makes my idea of a requiem for two roadaccident victims and i do appreciate that one woman agonizing over the technicalities of a church service must seem entirely trivial to you so what do you want me to do youre as youve just implied youre the only person whose experience of this area goes back longer than about twenty years id just like to get your opinion on a few things memory lane im afraid memory lane with all its potholes and its road kill preston devereaux went back and shut the door above it were three wooden shields one bearing a coat of arms and a motto in latin each of the others on either side displayed a foxs head neither of them motheaten the way foxes heads usually were in these displays mementoes perhaps of louiss carefree youth devereaux strode back to the beacon window pulling off his cap must be the most spectacular view in the malverns merrily said hated it merrily with a vengeance a forsaken stronghold symbol of defeat turned my back on it and everything that the malvernsd come to stand for all the starchy gentility of it and then my father died when was that back end of you learn that a farm thats been in your family since the conquest thats a family curse you cant lose and periodically the curse strikes giving you a little reminder that it is a curse like in the s when you had new patterns in farm subsidy new regulations the ec getting so a farmer didnt feel he owned his own land my old man could see that was only the beginning which partly explains why he strung himself up in the tower oh merrilys gaze went instinctively to the ceiling i didnt know im sorry which effectively did for my glittering future as a career scientist doing research at the time bit of teaching having a good time had a smart city woman and a kid and when i came home to bury the old man everything in me was screaming dont look dont look dont look at the state of the place just get it on the damned market and then i found out as i say that there was not a single local family left in wychehill and the curse came down your mother was still alive moved my ma down to ledbury she wouldnt live here after that told her id take a couple of years off to pull it all together before resuming the glittering career then we had hugo more roots what happened to the boys mother left a long time ago wilful london girl didnt get on with the country bit like syd spicers missus we werent married so no complications in those days she went abroad i got the boys and we turned it around by god we did in spite of the shinyarsed civil servants and the scum from brussels diversification i remember that as a buzz word put around by the min of ag the pragmatic farmers way out of the agricultural crisis thatchers message and fair play it worked for some of us you felt a bit sick about it but it worked my case luxury selfcatering holidays not that they selfcater they all eat out but it works and it provides employment locally all nicely oldfashioned and folks come back year after year all the sad townies and we charge em more every time and they still come preston devereaux slumped into a wingbacked chair next to the big dead fireplace smokeblackened and flaked with log ash he waved merrily to a faded chaise longue all the antique furniture from the house we put in the units what do we need with antiques me and the boys install a queen anne writing desk in your stone holiday chalet thats worth an extra two hundred a week on the bill you see the buildings out there very classy turned over all the old stone barns and stables and chicken houses to holiday units added a few new ones in the same style put the farm whats left of it into new galvanized sheds painted dark green and nicely screened off and the farm life whats left of that goes on around the townies give them an illusion of what its like let them into what country pursuits were allowed to practise now shooting parties and the like hunting before it was banned joining what they think of as the old squirearchy for a fortnight so the boys are part of that plenty for them to do dont want to move away like you did they wont leave all changed since my day look it was eitheror back then now you can take what you want from the city and come back next day and growing up in the country hardens you we can deal with the towns better than the townies can deal with us only i heard that louis merrily looked up at the foxes heads above the door the way their mouths were always forced open around their pointed canines to make them look like savage beasts gloriously killed heard louis what his voice spiking had some kind of breakdown after hunting was banned who told you that cant be sure selective memory you got there mrs watkins preston devereaux relaxed again aye he loved his hunting we ran the countryside alliance campaign in this area fight the ban posters everywhere boy lost his rag at a demo belted a copper guarding some blairite toady weekend in custody thats the state were in fight for our traditions were branded criminals this governments scum antienglish dont get me started we lost you move on you ask me a question i cant remember merrily was confused by all the contradictions here trying to understand a man who having been determined to escape his roots came back to be driven by a bornagain fervour fuelled by bitterness oak trees she said tim loste has a lot of oak trees which for a man with a tiny garden does he elgar and oak trees is there some connection i might not have heard about no idea the only oak i knows the royal oak which is a pretty common name for a pub relating surely to the tree where charles ii hid from his enemies no local legends about oaks not that i know of can i get you a drink some coffee thanks but ill have to be off in a few minutes i shouldnt have come anyway without ringing drop in anytime weve nothing to hide is there any kind of mystery legend rumour connecting elgar with wychehill only the church longworth and his socalled visionary experience what was that they say its what he has on his tomb the angel gruesome bloody thing ennit not my idea of an angel story i was told as a child is that it appeared to the mad old bugger up on the hill in a blaze of light and drove him in a state of blind fear to religion and to elgar same thing elgars become a religion now im not a fan merrily as you may have gathered if he hadnt encouraged longworth to build that bloody church theredve been no upper wychehill for the townies to colonize and what did elgar ever do for the malverns anyway massive tourism devereaux snorted weve always had that we got the scenery dont need the bloody incidental music bugger always claimed he got his inspiration here but he cleared off soon enough when he was famous and when he came back as an old man he came back as an incomer thats what gets to me i dont understand if he hed changed starts out as a country boy im not disputing that even went foxhunting according to some accounts but then soon as he makes it big hes off big house in hereford then london mixing with the nobs and the artyfarty veggies george bernard shaw and the like and when he finally returns as this distinguished old man hes turned into one of them having places laid at the table for his bloody dogs likely he thought the hillsd give him his inspiration back but it never happened did it closed door this time given up his soul to mix with the great and the good and excuse my terminology lost his balls never wrote another thing that was worthwhile no wonder hes an unhappy bloody spirit you believe that that hes unhappy or that hes devereaux leaned his head into a wing of his chair and looked at merrily sideways through a bloodshot eye that dead elgar still bikes the hills im not sure ha sorry im not usually so no i suppose i am i suspect theres something happening in the atmosphere im just not sure its anything to do with elgar well preston devereaux smiled if you ever decide it is and you want to exorcize the old bastard you can go ahead far as im concerned by all means wipe whatevers left of him off the hills for good and all just keep quiet about it stoolie thursday began badly and got worse just as merrily was about to corner jane on the colemans meadow issue winnie sparke was on the phone merrily you talked to the cops well i have but only ive heard nothing last night i barely slept see the one time tim called me iwantedtofixhim a lawyer he kept saying there was no need he said it was crazy they could think he did it he said theyd know that soon enough well winnie merrily sat down at the desk in the scullery erm i think there might be a need for a lawyer now i have to know i have to call his parents in francewhat did you just say just that i think he may well need a lawyer ive been trying to confirm the situation since last night but im not getting anywhere shed phoned bliss whod come back to her late last night to say that worcester were still holding loste and studying lab reports and that was all he could find out at this hour without inviting awkward questions so like how long can they hold a guy without a charge no look winnie what im trying to say is merrily waved to jane hovering in the scullery doorway with her airline bag meaning hang on jane raised a hand smiled a worryingly wan kind of smile and was gone bugger what im trying to say is i dont know that there hasnt been a charge in the light of new forensic evidence ithis is confidential ok i talked at some length to the officer heading the inquiry and frankly after what she told me even i d have pulled tim in for questioning even if it was only to have a look around inside his house he comes across as a very strange person winnie and hes clammed up on them and that makes it look worse and strange equals psychotic right no but did you say you went into his house with the police i was asked to take a look at some things what things photographs books why because theyre trying to get a handle on him find out exactly where hes coming from they had no goddamn right you had no right i tried to explain a couple of points as best i could i dont think i was very successful there was just too much i didnt know for instance his background i mean how long have you actually known him background background could not be more respectable parents are both professional classical musicians he was a music teacher at private schools ending up at malvern college played rugby for a local team how respectable do you want this project of his merrily said the oratorio or whatever ok he was working on that when you met him or was that your idea whats that matter we didnt go into this yesterday but when he saw what he when he saw the figure he identified as elgar on his bike im just thinking of the big picture in the hallway very much a presence in the house youll agree hes a presence in tims life and obviously a presence on some level in wychehill what are you saying its just that this seems to be the image of elgar that tims carrying around with him and it corresponds with the with the apparition that people tim included appear to have been seeing whats that have to do with getting him out of gaol and youre a writer specializing in books on mysticism psychic studies healing the occult you said you were helping him with meditation exercises to deal with his drinking and maybe to reach elgars level of creative inspiration a man whose previous output i understand has been fairly ordinary so hes living with elgars music images of elgar in a place steeped in elgar hes immersing himself on a very intense level you dont even wanna get him out do you all you want is to cover your own ass with the cops for whatever reason this has nothing to do with the cops merrily felt a headache coming on but if you want to deal with that first oak trees acorns little oaks in pots the sapling thats going to be bigger than his house a symbol of what a symbol from the natural world that he could use for meditation he was drinking too much i was trying to use meditation to give him a focus and also to make him more receptive why are you asking me this stuff because the police are linking oaks to druidism and druidism to blood sacrifice and you know oh jesus god winnies voice was suddenly perforated with panic this is shit this is so wrong is it what i mean why is it wrong elgar wrote caractacus about herefordshire beacon full of druidism and magic and prophecy and peoples throats being cut on sacrificial stones there was a gap before winnies voice came back the fissures hardening up what are you merrily some kinda fucking stoolie for the cops like i need to waste my time with a police snitch i dont think so lady i think i told you far too much already and all you did was you gave it to the cops thats not so from now on you can get off of my case ok look im just trying to im gonna have a good lawyer i cant truly afford go see tim right now and i dont wanna hear from you again so like when we get him outta there you just stay the hell away from the both of us winnie if you could just let me goddamn fucking stoolie bitch the phone went down hard at the start of midmorning break the sixthform common room was like a call centre a whole bunch of them switching on their mobiles to like maintain the temperature of their love lives when jane switched on hers just to be sociable not expecting anything from eirion this morning it went directly into its tune and not recognising the number it was like jane watkins erm hi jane this is jerry isles from the guardian i tried to leave a message on your voicemail yesterday maybe you didnt get it oh did you never mind jane i have to say it all sounds hugely fascinating i used to be quite into leys a few years ago we used to stay with friends in cornwall where youre practically tripping over megalithic sites so ive read watkins obviously and this really brought it all back are you running the campaign on your own well you know me and a few friends but but it was your idea yes only im not sure you seem to be wearing school uniform on the picture how old are you do you mind seighteen good and your parents know about it my mother knows i dont have a father any more she erm my mums cool with it well i took the liberty of checking your map with the ordnance survey and the line certainly seems to work who did the pictures my boyfriend theyre good pix on the whole however i think wed like to do some of our own we have a regular freelance photographer in your area and the picture editor would like to send her along if thats all right with you how about are you free this afternoon through the plateglass window beyond the tabletennis table jane could see morrell in his shirt sleeves jogging across the quad towards the car park look she said i mean this is really good of you but im not sure i want to go through with it now oh that mean youre no longer convinced oh no its true its all true even though when i went to see the local councillor there were all these council officials there and they were all like oh its all nonsense and alfred watkins was a misguided old man and the councillor was suggesting i was trying to mess up his plans for turning ledwardine into some kind of town which would be really crap and i was warned that i should be careful what i said i mean im not worried about me that much but my mums the vicar there you know the line went quiet if theyd lost it jane decided she wasnt going to call him back at least not until tonight when shed had time to think of a way he could maybe do the story but keep her out of it the vicar jerry isles said no i didnt know that oh hell why in this socalled secular age were newspapers so fond of vicars jerry said tell me again jane what these people from the council said to you i dont think i told you the first time did i about the councillor wanting to turn your village into a small town thats what ive got youre writing this down morrell jogged back and went into the main building his car keys swinging from a finger jane began to sweat merrily sat in the scullery watching the play of morning light on the vicarage lawn the clusters of yellow wild flowers in the churchyard drystone wall that bordered it a whole ecosystem that wall what are you some kinda stoolie for the cops going back over it she could pinpoint the exact moment when winnie sparkes attitude had altered it was when merrily had revealed that shed been inside lostes house winnie had been afraid of what merrily not the police might have seen in the house and been able to interpret for howe which meant there was something she should have spotted in there and hadnt she called syd spicer not expecting him to be in but he picked up on the second ring youve offended sparke merrily easily done she told you shes walking round wailing and gnashing her teeth a woman who likes to be in control and she can hardly control poor tim at the moment can she you think he did it syd i wouldnt have thought so but time will tell i like an interventionist priest yeah well i dont scale walls with pockets full of smoke bombs any more it was the first reference that hed made to his past but this probably wasnt the time to follow it up loste and winnie syd whats that actually about this musical work this search for elgars source of inspiration i mean is there anything you havent told me that might relate to that lots i imagine i wouldnt know what was relevant equally i cant betray a parishioners trust i can point you in a certain direction which ive done but i cant pass on what ive been told in confidence can i would you maybe you would maybe you did because im a police informer when winnie sparke takes offence she doesnt hold back why is loste collecting oak trees i dont know ok joseph longworths vision that sounds like a modernday version of one of those old legends often connected to the foundation of churches a vision indicating where to build there are some documents relating to that its in the parish records letters winnie has copies could i have copies no reason why not i suppose could you send them email anything spicer sighed merrily persevered do you have any idea what winnie sparke might have meant when she talked about a great and beautiful secret no he said merrily called the home of the dead girl sonia maloney in droitwich no answer the cookman number syd spicer had passed on turned out to be a spare line which meant he hadnt even tried it she came to the third on the list who stella cobham said merrily watkins the deliverance woman oh yeah look merrily i was just on my way out perhaps i could call you back wont keep you a minute mrs cobham i just wanted before i make any specific arrangements to find out if next sunday would be suitable for you im sorry what for we were discussing the idea of a requiem eucharist for lincoln cookman and sonia maloney oh yeah it seemed to answer everybodys you know yeah well look i dont think well be coming but mrs cobham it was your things have changed change of plan change of future brittle laugh were putting the barn on the market im just off to the agents in ledbury now actually just like that it was a wrong move nothings been right since we came here were probably going to america paul knows this guy in naples florida anyway all im trying to say is it really doesnt concern us any more look ive got to go all right click merrily threw the phone book at the wall in their proper place it had been merrilys plan to go into her own church before lunch when it was quietest find a cool place in the chancel and lay all this out the whole wychehill mess to ask the question is it time to leave this alone walk away an indepth exchange with the management on this issue was long long overdue so what was she doing in lols bed oh hell she gazed into his unshaven face this is a bit like adultery in what way exactly lol rolled off her he looked almost hurt no i she trapped one of his legs between hers i just meant cheating on the church the parish sorry all i need is to offend you and thats virtually nobody left still speaking to me he smiled maybe he hadnt looked hurt a moment ago maybe shed conjured that out of her own hurt lols bedroom had a threequarter bed in it that was all it was a very small room with no space for a wardrobe he said he needed to sleep here because it had a view across church street to the vicarage they could see each others lights at bedtime which was nice but shed sometimes wondered if he wasnt just a little timid about using the bigger bedroom where lucy devenish had slept whatever this room was bare without being stark a sanctuary a space out of time one day perhaps she might even get to spend a whole night here then at the same time she said i get the feeling that im neglecting you some feelings you should listen to lol said this could be god telling you that youre neglecting me dangerous to blaspheme in front of a vicar her fingers paddling over his thigh especially when naked he gripped her hand they laughed and when they stopped laughing she told him everything about winnie sparke and tim loste and their beautiful secret and her own dismal morning im tired i cant get a handle on it any more peoples attitudes change overnight they want me to do something then they dont they want to talk to me and then winnie sparke particularly it was as if shed picked a fight just to wind up the conversation because i was asking the wrong questions like mentioning the blowup photo of elgar let me get this right whos seen elgar other than loste stella cobham who no longer wants to have anything to do with it because theyve suddenly decided to move well nobody just decides overnight to emigrate mustve been very much on the cards when she came to the meeting in the church and poured it all out thus burning her boats with preston devereaux who according to spicer nobody likes to offend because hes old wychehill lol sat up against the pillow retrieved his little brassrimmed glasses from the floorboards and put them on but for a couple of things he said id be suggesting that elgar might be a psychological projection by tim loste well me too although if we step over the threshold sometimes if the personality behind it is strong enough a psychological projection may be perceptible to a third party musicians can be obsessive no kidding um lol hesitated what anything i can do about this i dont like to interrupt your work lol laughed what it comes down to merrily said is the only person i havent spoken to cant get at and may never get at loste who now seems to be the key to both mysteries that is the elgar thing and the killing on the beacon whether he did that or not and the circumstantial evidence is impressive but the key to tim loste is winnie sparke who isnt talking i dont think she ever planned to say much and yet she wanted to check me out why i still dont really know these people or what theyre doing there must be other ways in lol said for instance a lot of singers in a choir you know any i dont not yet but musicians can be obsessive leave this with me thank you lol and thanks for keeping an eye on jane which i im not getting anything right am i im a lousy mother a lousy girlfriend an inept exorcist and an incompetent parish priest but at least you dont suffer from low selfesteem lol said they went downstairs and shared half a loaf a pot of hummus and a box of cress and merrily resolved to spend the rest of the day in penance dusting and polishing the church furniture finding sick parishioners to visit before a last assault tomorrow on wychehill or more specifically on winnie sparke and i want to look at colemans meadow tonight why does jane think lyndon pierce has some secret scheme to expand the village probably because he has dont worry gomers looking into it thats reassuring merrily sat on the sofa and smoked half a cigarette or maybe not pierce used to shoot blue tits apparently nothing he could do for jane to acquit himself after that what if sparkes right and loste didnt kill that guy then annie howe will find out for herself shes not an incompetent detective she just doesnt like you and your minds gone like a tv remote control switching from one channel to another too many channels nowadays merrily said thats the problem the grave was marked by a low wedge of sandstone and overhung by an apple tree from the old orchard over the wall it was arguably the smallest least ostentatious memorial in the churchyard jane could have found it blindfolded lucy devenish the lettering tiny and no dates lucys will had requested no dates and somehow mum had been able to comply probably against all the regulations and if this wasnt a sign that lucy had believed herself to be an eternal presence in ledwardine no date for her arrival no date for her passing this always made jane shiver but with a kind of delight underneath the name were the lines lucy had chosen from thomas traherne his dates were given herefordshires greatest most mysterious poet no more shall clouds eclipse my treasures nor viler shades obscure my highest pleasures all things in their proper place my soul doth best embrace all things in their proper place that spelled it out really didnt it jane placed her hands on the top of the stone for a moment it always even in winter felt warm she stood up and looked back towards the church lucys grave was at the very end of the churchyard right beside the path which led through a small wooden gate to the orchard which had once virtually surrounded the village ledwardine the village in the orchard some guidebooks still called it that and this was the coffin track no doubt about it way back corpses would have been carried in ceremonially through the orchard there was a long flat backless bench probably the successor to generations of wooden benches on which the bearers had rested the coffins the lychgate at the front of the church had been a comparatively modern addition jane looked towards the steeple and imagined what lucy might have seen might be seeing now the churchyard like a circular clearing in the orchard perhaps thered once been a circle of stones around where the steeple now soared jane remembered the day lucy had cut an apple in half and showed her the fivepointed star the pentagram at the heart of every apple an indestructible symbol of the paganism at the heart of ledwardine in those days the days when shed painted the mondrian walls jane had seen paganism as the real religion christianity as a pointless distraction from the middle east mum as misguided it didnt seem as simple now the church steeple was a powerful symbol and far more effective than a stone circle at indicating from long distances the alignment with cole hill now jane felt and arrangements like this underlined it that paganism and christianity had often walked together on the same straight path she was sure that this was what alfred watkins had instinctively felt when archaeologists were slagging him off for including medieval churches in the otherwise neolithic ley system have i done the right thing she still didnt know jane walked through the churchyard past the south door and out through the lychgate into the market place perhaps an old cross or an outlying marker stone might have stood here across into the alley through the broken gate and into the derelict orchard behind church street past the hump of the burial mound if that was what it was and so to colemans meadow the meadow of the earthshaman to cole hill the sacred hill the mother hill she felt choked up with emotion now remembering the night shed got drunk on cider with poor colette and had started hallucinating in the orchard ciders the blood of the orchard lucy had said later and jane could still hear her sharp headmistressy voice its in your blood now i felt at once that it had to be one or both of you you and merrily this had to be the right path jane began to drift and as on the night of colette and the cider could hardly feel the grass beneath her feet when she stepped onto the ley it was as if she was floating on sunlit aircurrents and she saw lucy waiting for her as she began to walk towards the steeple and the holy hill beyond hi lucy said are you jane jane stood there blinking the woman wore not a poncho but a kind of denim smock with lots of pockets and there was a square metal case at her feet sally ferriman for the guardian oh jane said hi you ready jane jane looked at sally ferriman then up at cole hill discovering that she had one of her own hands pressing down on top of her head as if she was trying to stop some part of it floating away yes jane said i think so merrily reached the church door and then turned back she wasnt ready she went back to the vicarage and sat in front of the list of people whom she needed to tell about the idea for a requiem on sunday crosses against mrs cookman and stella cobham she tried the number for sonia maloneys parents still no answer one more name on the list shed agonized about this one had wondered whether to consult syd spicer or even bliss about it first she rang blisss mobile switched off but he rang back within a minute from outside the building theyve still got loste and they may make an application to hold on to him but theres been no charge they may still be waiting for forensics however it doesnt look good from his point of view they now have a witness whos identified loste as someone seen conducting what may have been a transaction on the side of the beacon with a black man in a woolly hat loste bought drugs from wicklow thats what it looks like usual rules of course merrily not a word to anyone so bliss said what do you have for me erm another question jesus merrily i cant believe how onesided this relationships become i know im sorry this probably isnt something you can answer anyway fair enough ill see you around then its probably a traffic matter in that case all the abuse ive thrown at traffic over the years no chance its my wychehill road accidents i just this is stupid just want to be sure they actually happened as they were described to me or indeed happened at all loste had a crash that wasnt reported to the police so i cant do anything about that but there was a lorry driver supposed to have gone into the church wall name no idea date cant give you an exact never mind it was just a thought merrily even a brilliant investigator like myself the only one where i do have a name although i gather there was no charge in the end so it may not be instantly accessible either stella cobham and it was early this month could you possibly get anything from that she heard the sound of grinding traffic and the gasp of air brakes frannie the doughnuts are on you merrily bliss said probably for the rest of your life and shed forgotten to ask him about the final name on the requiem list but then why should she ask him or spicer spicer had unequivocally opted out of the requiem and she wasnt a goddamn stoolie for the cops not officially anyway merrily switched on the computer to check the emails and while it was booting up stared at the phone should she sod it what was there to lose she went into yellow pages for the number and then rang the royal oak at wychehill and asked to speak to mr rajab ali khan some guy said he wasnt there mostly he worked out of his offices in worcester and kidderminster and what did she want and could he take a message merrily said yes he probably could no hurry she merely wanted to invite mr khan to a church service the emails came up piece of spam offering her guaranteed penis enlargement and wow one from wychehill rectory dear merrily in confidence you might find something here couldnt scan it too faded so ive copied it for speed its in the parish records a letter dating back to apparently forwarded to longworth who seems to have preserved it as some kind of corroboration of his choice of site for wychehill church i dont know who its from or who hes talking about in fact for all i know it could be a forgery but winnie was certainly impressed so im guessing one of thems elgar also note that winnie changed the name of her house to starlight cottage spicer hadnt even signed the email but then what had she expected love syd merrily scrolled up the letter it was something that hed taken the trouble to send it my dear sirius how are you we seem hardly to have spoken since the utterly devastating loss of poor electra and so i was delighted to receive your letter and further delighted to confirm that your hereford friend is absolutely right as regards the significance of the wyche hill site my researches tell me this would be a most propitious place to build a church or temple as we once discussed there is a tradition of worship in the malvern hills long predating christianity yet absorbed by the early church and also as recorded in the triads of wales a most inspiring longlost tradition of sacred musicmaking it is my belief and wonderful to think it could be so that there may be no area of southern britain more conducive to the creation and performance of music of the most exalted power than this your own work is surely ample testament to its extraordinary influence please tell me if i can be of any further assistance to any of you and i look forward to experiencing the church if ever it is built but we must get together before that with every good wish starlight ps some of my old as electra would say out of the world associates are inclined to think your friends interpretations of his remarkable discovery tend toward the prosaic but i suppose his provincial background is a bit of a constraint that night jane went out with eirion and merrily went over to lols they set off to walk to colemans meadow and she showed him the email if one of thems elgar its probably going to be sirius it was a warm night the northern sky still a shimmering electric blue lol said that the weather forecast had suggested tomorrow would be the hottest day of the year so far so electra would be alice whod died some years earlier music of the most exalted power merrily said what does that say to you i think it says even with a boswell guitar dont get any ideas colemans meadow was empty lol said thered been hereford cattle last time he was here but now only a few rabbits bobbed around on the eastern fringe by the thorn hedge the path through the middle of the meadow was strikingly evident even among the shadows even when it disappeared through the gate and into the undergrowth you could feel it burrowing like a live cable to light up the summit of cole hill which at nearly ten pm was ambered by an almost unearthly sunset afterglow what do you think lol said worth saving part three from chanting comes the word enchantment and it was largely by chanting that the druids kept up the spell of enchantment which they spread across each of the celtic kingdoms john michell new light on the ancient mystery of glastonbury on the line no point in worrying it probably wouldnt be in todays paper anyway after jane had asssured him that no other media had been in touch jerry isles had said they might well hold it over for a day later mediasavvy eirion had explained that it was a soft story therefore expendable every time shed awoken in the night jane had been hoping increasingly that theyd just dump it after all it wasnt much of a story in the great scheme of things was it and what in the end was it likely to achieve apart from dropping her in some deep shit with morrell still she was up before mum and outside the eight till late not long after it opened this horrible queasy feeling at the bottom of her stomach despite the shops name big jim prosser opened around seven with all these morning papers outside on the rack sun s mirror s independent s no guardian s however this morning maybe not many people took it in ledwardine or theyd all gone for delivery the air was already warm in line with the forecast on eirions car radio last night that this would be the first really hot day of the summer ledwardine looked impossibly beautiful quiet and shaded and guarded by the church with its glistening spire and the enigmatic pyramid of cole hill everything serene and ancient and vulnerable jane felt as though she was carrying the weight of all that latemedieval timberframing on her shoulders and was about to duck away when big jim appeared in the shop doorway lovely morning jane looking for anything in particular is it no i daily telegraph times erm it was just a guardian but if theyve all gone it doesnt matter just a guardian eh jim prosser had his hands behind his back looking kind of smug oh they ve gone all right every single one last one got snapped up five minutes before you come in fact i just had to turn one feller away oh jane edged towards the door right never mind then this didnt necessarily mean anything lyndon pierce it was jim said happily the words coming down like the blade of a guillotine i think hes driven over to weobley to try and get one there didnt look a happy man somehow cant imagine why oh god jane went hot and cold they used it didnt they used what dont make me suffer even more jim what did it say well seeing its you jane jim brought a paper out from behind his back ill let you have a quick glance at my own copy if you like you take the guardian i do today jim said he led her inside and spread the paper on the counter folded at an inside news page and oh god there it was in guardian terms a big spread although oh god no most of the space was taken up by the fullcolour picture the photographer had been standing on the stile at the bottom of cole hill focusing down on jane and now you could see why shed done it from that angle janes face was in closeup unsmiling moody with the path racing away over her shoulder all the way to the church steeple theyd done something to it with a computer shading the edges so that the ley looked almost as if it was glowing underneath a second picture showed a section of ordnance survey map with the ley points encircled just like alfred watkins used to do it altogether not a story you could easily miss village future on the line schoolgirl warns jeremy isles a schoolgirl is fighting county planners to defend the legacy of the man whose discovery of ley lines has been causing nationwide controversy for more than eighty years planning officials in herefordshire were ready to accept an application for new housing in the historic village of ledwardine in the north of the county when the vicars daughter jane watkins accused them of destroying the sacred heritage of the community ms watkins says a proposed estate of luxury homes would obliterate what she insists is a prehistoric straight track or ley linking several sacred sites including her mothers church and the summit of what she claims is the villages holy hill ley hunters all over britain are now set to join the protest the theory of ley lines was floated in by alfred watkins no relation a hereford brewer and pioneer photographer in his book the old straight track which is still in print and something of a bible for new agers and earth mysteries enthusiasts the latest theories suggest that watkinss leys are lines of earthenergy or possibly spirit paths along which the souls of the dead were believed to be able to travel however hereford councillors and officials charged with implementing new government demands for more rural housing are taking a hard line on the issue at the end of the story a council spokesman was quoted as saying its a storm in a teacup we have consulted our county archaeologist who assures us that ley lines are simply a quaint myth we applaud jane watkinss interest in local traditions but consider this would be a very silly reason to forsake our commitment to allow quality new housing to be built on suitable sites however they also had a quote from j m powys described as an author specializing in landscape phenomena who said although the concept of leys has been widely dismissed almost since watkins first came up with it he was definitely on to something and his ideas have been powerfully influential theres a lot about the ancient landscape we really dont understand and id be interested in taking a look at this alignment which looks like one that watkins missed even though it was virtually on his own doorstep earlier in the piece jane had been quoted as describing council officials as philistine morons jim prosser said you actually said that did you jane oh god jim jane covered up her face i thought we were just having like a preliminary chat he was really sympathetic you know i thought hed come out with the photographer to interview me properly i didnt realize that was it he was doing it over the phone jim stood there slowly shaking his head and smiling the smile of a man who couldnt quite believe this he held out the paper you wanner take this copy show your mother before somebody else does christ no i mean its ok shes going out early jane felt clammy under her school shirt look what do you think jim what have i done is this like going to cause trouble hard to say really twentyfour houses thats another twentyfour bunches of papers and magazines for me on the other hand disturbing the spirits of the dead you dont believe a word do you you think its all total bollocks well you know us primitive superstitious rural types jane do you think anybody here is going to agree with me tough question jim said go on take the paper you might need one thanks jane went out and stood by the oak pillars of the medieval market hall the brilliant sun was suspended over cole hill as though it was either declaring its support or making some kind of ironic gesture jane screwed up her eyes and looked up pleading it had been like a dream taking herself off to the end of the playing field yesterday lunchtime and sitting down and trying to see it from all sides mums position in the village no conflict there she was supposed to be responsible for the collective soul of the community and morrell always on about liberal causes and free speech and amnesty international and stuff like that once the decision had been made it had been like being on a speededup escalator a call to the photographer and then to eirion on his mobile and hed blagged some time off and been waiting parked down the lane just out of sight when shed slipped away from the school soon after one pm eirion finally dropping her off at the church so that she could walk the ley from there on her own just to be sure and she had been sure yesterday the high today the cold turkey jane was getting a mental image now of morrell with the guardian on his desk it was his favourite paper normally folding it neatly and then instructing his secretary to have all copies removed from the school library and the sixthform common room before any of the students arrived then maybe a smarmy selfdefensive call to the woman on the education authority before sitting back to devise a suitable form of retribution bloody unfair really another couple of weeks and the term wouldve been over and shed have been immune until september a few villagers were wandering over to the shop jane slipped behind a pillar of the market hall and didnt move she felt disoriented and distanced from from her usual self like shed taken beginning with that first small lie about her age to jerry isles a decision to become a separate person detached also from the school and the sixth form a slightly premature adult in other words and it felt lonely the sun was hot on her head and her arms she felt as if she wanted to walk away and fade into the spirit path the way she almost had yesterday or was that was she just going a little crazy through stress and anxiety across at the vicarage she could see mum reversing the volvo onto the side of the road looked like she was in a hurry well good but she wouldnt leave before shed seen her daughter jane raised a hand and wandered over hiding the guardian in the hedge best not to burden her with this or the migraine oh yeah there was definitely a migraine coming on today a polka for the loonies there were no curtains at lols bedroom window when hed awoken not long after dawn the sky was slashed with red bringing up ugly thoughts of the dead man on the stone in the malverns something lol had not seen but merrily had and lol was lying there under the reddening duvet thinking about all the times hed sat fingering the frets of the graceful boswell guitar conjuring ephemera while merrily waded in spiritual sewage increasingly he worried about her she was living much of the time on cigarettes instead of proper meals and sooner or later all this chasing around after madness the kind of madness shed never be able to validate would start to take its toll not many nights lately had passed without him waking in the dark or the early dawn cold with this formless fear of losing merrily and walking back in the late evening from colemans meadow to the market square splitting up to go to their separate beds thered been a disturbingly elegiac quality to that recalling this hed felt a moment of anxiety that was close to panic and turning it into determination got up into the streaming red dawn and made some tea and a list of what he needed to find out finding himself thinking about winnie sparke the way shed moved in on him pardon me but i think i know who you are the tumbling hair the semiseethrough dress ready to come on to him that night but now she wasnt talking not to merrily protecting the enigmatic tim loste so what was there to protect at around eightthirty lol sat at his writing desk in the window overlooking church street and rang prof levin at the knights frome studio five weeks prof said in five weeks i have a window for approximately ten days if we cant break its back in ten days were not trying sorry your second solo album well its coming lol could hear prof pouring coffee from his cafetiere im just not there yet shit prof said you havent even started have you you useless bastard no ive started i start every day except today today im not starting because tim loste lol said what do you know about tim loste the answer came back sailing past on a breath like thered been no need for thought avoid prof said i see lol inched his chair further into the desk picked up a pencil gathered in his lyrics pad why exactly prof said laurence were all mad in our way arent we me you loste elgar sorry did i mention elgar you mentioned loste which means that sooner or later wed get around to elgar and madness elgar grew up with it used to hang around the local lunatic asylum at worcester yes but thats because he was director of music there yeah thirty quid a year and five shillings every time he wrote a polka for the loonies to dance to but even then hes thinking there but for the grace of god youre saying elgar was mentally ill but also fortunately touched with genius imagine what its like if youre mental and only touched with mediocrity loste terrific conductor arranger facilitator pure creativy nah you know him personally mmmf prof swallowing toohot coffee laurence mate everybody knows him if youre a halfwayproficient serious musician or a singer the chances are hes been in touch at one time or another offering you the chance to make your name no money in it of course just the honour and the glory of working with the young master this is in his manic phases in the clinical sense whether its been diagnosed i wouldnt know but in his depressive phases its best to stay out of his way and also in his manic phases obviously thats why i say just avoid tell you about me and him shall i it seemed that loste having heard about this new recording studio at knights frome had called prof introducing himself as a onetime soloist with the english symphony orchestra asking whether it was possible that prof could put together a mobile unit to record his choir in wychehill church complicated job laurence if youve never recorded a choir before having to mike up this huge church on your own so whats wrong with the studio im asking him oh no loste insists it has to be the church not a church this church but he had the money i should argue you went to wychehill charming crowd on the whole the women worshipped loste this bumbling overgrown schoolboy imprecise incoherent you mean drunk well high certainly or just like i said manic and yet in the end unexpectedly i was impressed hes a bloody good conductor he channels inspiration shouldntve been any good at all bunch of amateurs in a country church but the atmosphere in there was something else this was elgar ah well thats the point you see for loste it all comes through elgar elgar was always moaning that nobody understood him loste understands him totally and the combination of elgar and loste somehow brings something extraordinary out of amateurs i remember the angelus particularly shiversupthespine stuff or so it seemed to me whose skills have for too long been squandered on threechord wonders such as your good self four now congratulations loste meanwhile his ambition is to do the full gerontius with a choir and orchestra on the strength of what we recorded already it wouldnt be an embarrassment except hell need to get somebody else to twiddle the knobs on it because gerontius scares me too big too complicated also an attempted orchestration of the afterlife with angels and demons am i going there with loste i think not laurence definitely not with timothy loste lol said prof was there a woman with loste when you did the recording a writer called winnie sparke cheesecloth and glittery bits that would probably be her yes all right prof said you remember yoko ono in the film they made of the session for let it be sitting there watchful more than a bit like that only less of the inscrutable not a promising relationship was my feeling she looks at him sees toyboy he looks at her mummy you know anything about her not much shes a writer does these mystic meg kind of books whats your angle shes told merrily that she and loste are on the edge of the solution to a great and beautiful mystery merrily prof said this is a merrily situation oh for fucks sake a great and beautiful mystery avoid avoid avoid well its not too hard to avoid him at the moment lol said hes in custody the cops are questioning him about a murder on herefordshire beacon loste this is the man found in the old fort his throat cut from ear to ear youre serious the guy worked at this hiphop palace at the royal oak outside wychehill which loste apparently believes is an evil presence sapping his creativity i heard that only he doesnt have any creativity hes an interpreter a facilitator thats as far as it goes bloody hell lol i mean bloody hell someone was knocking on lols back door do you see him as someone who could kill lol asked loste prof swallowed some coffee big bloke conducting he snaps batons but he with a knife blood spurting everywhere lol heard the back door opening and shutting the door of the living room opened and jane stood there in her school uniform she wasnt smiling she was unusually pale when lol pointed her to the sofa she sat down with her hands clasped between her legs biting her lip prof can i ring you back listen prof said if you really want to know more about lostes games i can put you in touch with one of the people in his choir in fact theres one guy might be more than happy to talk to you in particular ill call him get him to ring you ok lol saw that jane had been crying great and beautiful mystery prof said ill tell you one thing about that like elgar loste is obsessed with himself and his ideas people he can take or leave most of the time music is all nothing outside music to loste could be both great and beautiful tell merrily that right lol said thanks but yeah if there was some threat to his music i suppose when you think about it he could kill prof said a result anyway there was a new sign and it said starlight cottage of course winnie sparke had told them how shed changed the name from wyche cottage almost the first thing shed said that evening with the choir laying its serene spell over wychehill this was what lol had remembered the cottage was built of rubble stone and was not much bigger than hannah bradleys place lower down the lane its back garden was formed around plates of rock and ended abruptly in a kind of cliff edge with an iron fence merrily looked down and saw the road yours etc starlight winnie according to spicer had certainly been impressed by the letter supposedly sent to elgar and passed on to longworth which posed some interesting questions but even at am with most of the cottage still pooled in shadow the bloody woman wasnt around to deflect them frustrating after an early night and only one remembered dream which had been a dream of cole hill seen from colemans meadow the only detail that merrily could recall was the sense of pain and the disembodied breezeblown voice of winnie sparke saying that the hill was hurting odd the way that view once seen nested in your mind merrily peered through one of the small windows but all she could make out was a dim wall of books shed left her car in the lane right outside she gave the wind chimes above the front door a final flick and went back to it and the copy of the weekly malvern gazette which lay on the passenger seat ritual murder local man held tim loste hadnt been named which was normal if there were no charges yet however this was a weekly paper printed yesterday so if loste had been charged late last night it wouldnt have made the edition the frontpage story said the brutal killing on the beacon had shattered a community already reeling from last weekends double fatal road accident see page three on page three the rigid features of leonard holliday were in closeup against the blur of the road under the headline this carnage will go on the story said that wrag the wychehill residents action group was calling for the immediate closure of the royal oak pub as a music venue latenight traffic had increased dramatically on roads not much wider than bridleways and inner city nightlife had left residents living in fear mrs joyce aird a widow living alone said its terrifying im a prisoner in my own home from friday night to sunday morning the owner of the royal oak promoter and gallery owner rajab ali khan had said i have no intention of preempting the inquest verdict on these two unfortunate people but i am anxious to cooperate fully if mr holliday can provide me with any evidence at all of damage to the property or person of any of his neighbours it sounded like a quote that raji had run past his solicitor folding the paper merrily looked up to see a hare sitting at the top of winnies narrow downsloping driveway its blacktipped ears seeming to quiver for a moment before it bounded away into the hedge at the top of the lane the cobhams tartedup barn shone from its elevated site with an alien glamour like some pyrenean villa it would look spectacularly seductive in the estate agents window where wealthy tourists would project upon it their doomed bucolic fantasies meanwhile stella when merrily had stopped in ledbury to buy the gazette shed checked her mobile and frannie bliss had called from home to say he had some information from traffic about stella shed called him back at once what he had to tell her had made the air in the car seem stale might as well get this over then leaving the volvo outside starlight cottage merrily walked up to the barn ignoring the front door this time going round the back there was a low gate on a latch and she lifted it and went through to where a paved area had been laid there was a wooden table and a pink and yellow striped sunshade and a woman sitting there with a mug of pungentsmelling coffee and her back to merrily who coughed lightly morning mrs cobham stella spun out of her chair her red hair flaring up like a bonfire the aggression emphasized by the kimono she wore with yellow dragons on black and a hot slap of coffee now down the front yes sorry to startle you you stella subsided pulling off her sunglasses and mopping at her kimono with a tissue didnt recognize you in ordinary clothes what do you want weve never encouraged people to just turn up well after the way you led me on and then did a neat uturn on the phone that really doesnt bother me too much how dare and is this really a good time to be selling a house in wychehill merrily placed the malvern gazette on the table makes no difference stella barely glanced at it none of the potential purchasers ever come from this area look pauls only gone into ledbury and hell be back soon and the things im guessing you want to talk about if they get raised again its going to spoil his day big time and right now our marriage let me tell you is hanging on that she held a thumb and forefinger about a millimetre apart so this moves a new start is it merrily said darling this stella slumped back into her canvasbacked chair this was supposed to be the new start he retired she did the quote marks in the air shouldve realized what a horribly ominous word that is for a man strongly suggestive of impending impotence what these days when everybody seems to be retiring at fifty with paul it means something to prove we originally bought this place as just a holiday home he was in wood stoves british end of a firm in new england so a lot of transatlantic travel he wanted to move out there but i wanted to do this up as a permanent home disastrous idea flung together in isolation for ever with a man you realize you really never properly knew because hed spent so much time away rows lots like on the night you crashed stella looked up at merrily squinting at the sun fumbling her dark glasses back on what are you after i rather thought youd had your moneys worth the other night just the truth this time why you lied to the police and everybody else fuck off well actually its fairly obvious why you lied id just like to confirm it and maybe ask a few supplementary questions it wont go any further and youre leaving anyway you are actually leaving or was that also no stella peered into her coffee it looked like the coffee you made after a long and sleepless night its hours counted out on fingers of alcohol she sniffed and stood up i lie all the time actually pauls not in ledbury hes in london and he wont be back until tomorrow but yes we are leaving you want some of this or would you like to give me an excuse to open a bottle of wine stella was away in the house for some time merrily gazed at the wounded rocks behind the trees and smoked a cigarette and checked the vicarage answering machine on her mobile there were five messages at barely ten am oh god first message hello mrs watkins you might remember me its amanda patel from bbc midlands today not about you this time youll be glad to know but weve seen the story about your daughter in the guardian and wed like to follow it up for tonights programme ive been on to the school but shes apparently not shown up so i wonder if not shown up at school guardian so if you could call me asap ill probably be on my way to ledwardine so ill leave my mobile number merrily switched off the phone and put out her cigarette trying to clear her head as stella cobham came out wearing a green silk robe she was carrying an opened bottle of chardonnay the level already conspicuously down and two glasses whats your driving licence look like merry i cant remember stella peered at her you all right yes well mines got enough points on it that im just barely on the road can you imagine what it would be like living here if you didnt have a car i concentrate yes i can understand why you didnt need a conviction for careless driving i wasnt drunk i was just in a blind rage stella pulled her robe closer to her throat with one hand and reached out with the other for her wineglass picking it up and then immediately putting it down again as if this was some kind of testament to her sobriety on the night then afterwards i was standing there in the road with these whingeing bloody german tourists totting up the damage and it was obviously my fault and im thinking oh shit oh shit what am i going to do when it came to me id heard about the mad loste claiming tove seen elgar and i thought whats to lose and then there was no going back stuck to the story in every detail bliss had said wouldnt budge said there was this other bloke whod seen it and shed bring him into court report went to the cps and they dont get many like this at least not where its an intelligent eloquent opinionated woman whos going to be redhot in the box and get it all over the papers so the cps made what was considered at the time to be a cautious and sensible decision no charge and i suppose merrily said that you repeated the story in the church the other night because i was sick of the snide comments and i suppose i felt a bit sorry for you and i wanted to wipe the complacent smile off devereauxs face because in a way if it hadnt been for him devereaux the reason i was so mad going like a bat out of hell swerved too late i paul had started going for long walks to keep in condition i figured it was long walks down the hill and back up again and in through a different gate sorry i thought he was shagging someone that weird bitch with her cheap seethrough frocks and her kittenish fawning and her oh dont you look so cool today paul winnie yeah i accused him of having a fling with sparke i know he fancied her and she was so blatantly available you watch her any given situation shell home in on the nearest man which is interesting for a woman who goes on about goddesses all the time merrily recalled winnie on the hill that first night going straight to lol like are you the exorcist and were they having a fling he wouldve done no question i mean that was the point and i was convinced she i mean she was so knocked sideways when she got dumped by devereaux so preston devereaux sorry i forgot youre not it was fairly widely known in wychehill nothing wrong with that both single i remember thinking it was quite nice actually she seemed genuinely besotted with the guy mr countryman wellies cap land rover gun over his shoulder most of those types theyre a bit thick no conversation but devereauxs educated been around and rich rich enough to rescue a poor woman washed up and i mean washed up in a foreign country but it didnt work out she came round here one night she was gutted shocked and insulted i was stupid enough to commiserate stayed half the night couldnt get rid of her most of the people here dont want to know you but shes all over you when it suits so devereaux dumped her winnie wanted too much hes been single for a long time and thats how he likes it i mean she isnt normally clingy far as i can see too arrogant had too many attractive men but she was with him mr darcy senior the american dream and she clearly needs a lot of money she was married to some guy brought her over to london and then pissed off but does a man like devereaux i mean in the end does he want crystal balls and tarot cards when was this few weeks ago i mean some people think shes got a thing going with tim loste but its clear to me its not that kind of thing he thinks its for conducting his choir she just dominates him and after devereaux shes devoting all her time no wonder he finally went insane mind you that was a bloody shock wasnt it stella nodded at the gazette and took off her sunglasses her eyes were crimsonrimmed almost the colour of her spiky hair it looked like shed been doing some crying drink and drugs this place is sick loste really was doing drugs not heroin more like lsd or something magic mushrooms you see him coming down from the hill sometimes hes all over the place although that could be the drink once i came across him lying in the heather mumbling stuff you stop questioning it after a while i cant wait to leave now not that im saying that to paul he thinks hes dragging me away from my dream situation theres no honesty between us any more maybe itll be different in america i dont know stella shook her head in disgust i think sparkes doing the rector now what now that hes on his own thats rumour is it who knows stella flipped a hand shes been seen going into the rectory more than once people notice these things which people holliday for one he doesnt like the rector or anyone much well stella looked across at the hill nearvertical here because of the quarrying sorry to spoil your day i suppose people in your job it must make you feel quite worthwhile when you think youve found a real one especially if its somebody distinguished elgar youve got to laugh havent you its a result anyway merrily said tightly she stood up and stella cobham swung round to face her who told you about that somebody obviously did i have a friend at the cps what harm would another lie do in a place like this dont do sorry awful jane said barbaric she said there were three double rows of barbed wire more than chest high and with new stakes and like a plastic screen over part of it so you couldnt even see through like some highsecurity like guantanamo bay or something like guantanamo bays just appeared in colemans meadow lol said you didnt no well idve had to go back to gomers for the wirecutters and anyway it was very thick wire heavyduty a proper fence like i say impossible plus there were these two blokes there putting up a big sign im guessing it doesnt say welcome to the colemans meadow ley line it says private land keep out trespassers will be prosecuted and the word will is underlined in red like somebodys splattered it on in a rage can they just fence it off like that if its a public footpath is it a public footpath though i dont know jane didnt look at him i shouldve checked it out and i didnt its not marked as any kind of footpath on the os map this is all so totally my fault isnt it you get carried away with the romance and the excitement and you dont check the basic nuts and bolts didnt even check whether it was a rightofway and i ignored the fact that it wasnt in the old straight track im naive and immature im an idiot lol jane punched her knee and winced and started to cry the guardian was crumpled up on the hearthrug lol thought it was actually a bit magnificent jane wouldnt look at it ever wish you hadnt started something the warmest day of the summer so far and she looked starved lol eyed her curious hed never before heard her wishing shed never started something when i first saw the fence i was shocked and then i was furious and then i saw when youre right up to it the worst thing is you cant even see cole hill i felt just sick i just walked away and sat down in a quiet part of the orchard and howled jane lol sat next to her on the sofa this was the time to put a comforting arm around her but he never had they were close but she wasnt his daughter and there was an old barbedwire fence in his head that had never quite rusted away and probably never would and you know what jane said when i stopped howling i realized i was sitting right on the ley and there was nothing nothing to feel no ancient energy no shades of lucy because theyd blocked the line you think oh lol jane squeezed his hand theres absolutely no need to be kind i just wanted just wanted there to be some magic left whats wrong with that its naive people like me who listen to nick drake singing i was born to love magic and go all shivery see what i shouldve done what a mature person wouldve done i shouldve just objected to the housing got some backing for that kept quiet about the ley but no im too smart for that i go doorstepping a bunch of council guys at pierces in effect tipping the bastards off now they know what its all about and theyve turned it into some disgusting nomansland so nobody will ever see the magic again do you know who they are jane shrugged this guy murray the owner lol look if she glanced towards the door if anyone comes you havent seen me only when i got back from the meadow just now jim prossers like oh radio hereford and worcester are looking for you and some newspaper people and theyve all been ringing the vicarage and getting no answer so now i cant even go home in case anyone i mean i cant talk to them now im supposed to be at school and i havent any evidence theyd just walk all over me im just totally dead lol lol stood up and went to the window saw two men and a woman walking up church street people he didnt know and it was too early in the day for tourists he stepped back and saw his own shadowy reflection in the dark side of the pane and knew that it wasnt jane whod been stupid she was a schoolgirl below voting age in no real position to object to a private housing plan or attempt to influence a local authority to veto it he on the other hand had just stood and watched perhaps only really concerned that jane shouldnt do anything to embarrass merrily as parish priest youre right best if you dont talk to anybody at this stage best if you stay here while we work out how to handle this we if you have no objections lol turned his back on the street interesting how fast this fence has gone up they didnt even wait for it to appear in the paper the cattle had already gone last night i noticed that jim said they belong to the guy who bought the powell farm rents the grazing from murray so if the cattle were removed yesterday before the story appeared that suggests that it was set up as soon as they heard the media were on to the story ok ill go and check it out you stay here dont answer the door and be careful who you answer the phone to you dont have to i do have to listen while im gone could you my laptops under the desk could you put wychehill church into google see what you can find what for think of it as brownie points with your mum you might need them jane smiled bit watery but it was there he told her about prof levin and the recording of the choir that had to be made at wychehill youre looking for connections with music choirs singing i dont know any link with elgar in particular would be good use your intuition dont you think thats caused enough damage jane folded up the guardian put it behind a cushion out of sight i cant bear it why couldnt i have just smiled the photographer was going no no dont smile but i didnt have to play along did i now i totally look like some evil slapper an asbo waiting to be issued lol mmm im sorry for getting you involved pull yourself together jane lol said you dont do sorry the men whod put up the fencing had gone but it looked as jane had said like a notsoopen prison lol was furious the way governments national and local were operating now even the council had its cabinet where iffy issues could be sorted in secret any hint of opposition doors closed locks turned walls went up and barbed wire ok there was no proof that anyone from the council was involved in this but it was likely at least that the landowner had the support of the establishment and theyd fenced off something they didnt believe existed theyd blockaded an idea standing on the edge of the old orchard lol began to sense some of janes feelings about alfred watkins who stood for independence of thought well into his sixties a respected local figure when the old straight track was published and the archaeological establishment had immediately turned on him a barrier had gone up and it was still up independence of thought always a crime in the eyes of the establishment lol was starting to feel suffocated as if the air had been turned into shrinkwrap when gomer parry came ambling out of the orchard an inch of rollup gummed to his lips lol boy gomer extracted his ciggy blew out a grey balloon of smoke lol wondered if a disused orchard was now classed as a public place where although it might be entirely legal to light a massively carcinogenic bonfire nobody was allowed to smoke gomer nodded at the wire janie seen this yet what do you think gomer said what i think is lucy devenish was still alive shed drag lyndon pierce yere by the scruff make the bugger tear it down with his bare hands lol thought what a pity it was that this kind of organic natural justice was purely the preserve of old ladies you think pierce had something to do with this gomers shoulders twitched under his summer tweed jacket you know this guy murray who owns the land by sight never worked for him big farm and does his own drainage does his own drainage lowest of the low in the planthire world knowed his auntie though maggie pole her as left him the meadow nice lady always very fond o that meadow i dont think i knew her left before you was here boy went to an old folks home over towards hay hardwicke the glades lol smiled i used to know somebody there how do you mean fond of the meadow used t be a bench near the gate and herd go and sit there sometimes on a nice day peaceful place nobody disturbed her that was all i remembered but after jane come over the other night i went to see an ole boy name of harold wescott know him lol shook his head gomer pinched the ciggy from between his lips with his thumb and forefinger gotter be over ninety now has harold but still got his own house cant tell you what he had off the mealsonwheels yesterday but you wanner know about anything happened in ledwardine fifty year ago hes your man anyway harold he knowed maggie pole pretty well and he remembers her was real careful who her let the meadow out to for grass wouldnt have no overgrazin no ploughin up said it was a piece o history did she dont get too excited boy wasnt nothin to do with ley lines far as harold knows fact he didnt know nothin about ley lines not many of the old folks does that was harchaeology not for the likes of we so why was the meadow a piece of history dunno harold reckoned it was maggies mother used to go on about it maggies dad ole cyril pole he was a bit of a rough bugger but her ma was a lady real cultured read books had her own windup gramophone point is harold wescott says maggie told him her ma always said colemans meadow wasnt to be touched and it youre saying it was left to maggie pole on that basis sure tbe but things get forgot ennit no kids see maggie never married so thats why it all went to the nephew and the niece niece got the money this murray had the ground did anybody else know the meadow wasnt to be touched could be important dont you think gomer put the last inch of ciggy into his mouth took a puff hard to say boy been all overgrown round there see for a good while since the orchard started goin to rot hell aye im sure some folks knowed over the years but mabbe they thought it best kept quiet about like all these things ill keep askin around wheres janie now my place should be at school really but shes hiding from the papers and the tv not so sure any more that shes got it right you know what are people saying in the village hippie thing gomer said thats what theyre sayin boy sorry figured in this area the antique term hippie applied to any incomer of relatively unconventional appearance who couldnt afford a luxury executive home what about the housing scheme the loss of the field the view of cole hill dont affect many folks see theyll do buggerall less it affects them personal you listens to em spoutin off in the shop what are they saying about jane leave it lol these is just folks as dont know the girl not like what we does no come on what are they saying gomer squeezed his ciggy out theyre just ignorant people with too much time gomer ah sayin its no wonder hers goin off the rails when her when her ma ent around half the time and no wonder janies livin in a bit of a fantasy world when the vicar spends her time chasin things as dont exist instead of looking after the parish ar more or less sorry boy but you assed three choirs walking down the lane towards the church merrily tried lols number again still engaged tried his mobile and janes both switched off left a message that just said in a voice which she hoped did not sound overhysterical the guardian shed asked stella cobham if they happened to take the guardian they didnt she replayed the message from amanda patel of bbc midlands today watching mrs aird leaving the church with a shopping bag crossing the road and becoming gradually shorter as if she was sinking into the green verge on the other side wychehill people disappearing into their homes like rabbits into burrows there were now six more messages on the machine about jane bbc hereford and worcester central news daily mail hereford times hereford journal and a clipped and icy robert morrell school director moorfield mrs watkins perhaps you can call me asap no wonder the bloody kid was out early merrily walked into the churchyard where for heavens sake was she going to get a guardian in wychehill she was recognizing the onset of a cold sweat when a seventh message was delivered by a voice like suede and sounding close enough to lick her ear mrs watkins khan quite a long pause as if mr khan was used to people dashing to disable their answering machines and pick up once they knew it was him and then he said call me back would you a patina of impatience im in my kidderminster office she plucked half a pencil and a cigarette packet from her shoulder bag and sat down on the steps of the longworth tomb to write down the number no hurry to call him back it was probably going to be a courtesy call apologizing for bothering him any requiem now was likely to be a cosmetic exercise she ought to call morrell at least hed be able to tell her what was in the guardian on the other hand if she revealed to morrell that she didnt know what was that going to look like leaning her head into the stillcool shadow of the stovelike tomb merrily found herself staring up into the grotesque inverted rictus of the angel of the agony purgatory i think we can deal with purgatory right here winnie sparke had said how true that was its as good as over directing this thought at the angel of the agony i expect you know all about being burdened with crap shed knocked on hannah bradleys door no answer probably one of her days at the tourist office in ledbury the mountain bike wasnt around if stella had lied and loste was delusional how likely was it that hannah had told her the truth but shed been so convincing it had been like a breath of pure air who could you trust merrily stared at the writing on the tomb all holy angels pray for him choirs of the righteous pray for him so the quarry owner joseph longworth had seen an invented angel in a blaze of light and built a huge and costly church wondering if tim lostes choir was praying for him she heard not prayer but laughter and peering around the tomb saw two people walking into the church drive one of them was winnie sparke in her long pale flimsy dress winnie was laughing her good and abundant hair thrown back merrily slid down behind the tomb the man with sparke was a very big man overweight but with the height almost to carry it wideshouldered wearing a flannely sort of shirt outside his trousers his dark hair was long and brushed back and he had a moustache not lord lucan not freddie mercury but a wide black muscular kind of moustache like the one on the face on the back of a twentypound note jane had washed her face her eyes were bright but a little wild i cant find the printer havent got one lol shut the front door and for some paranoid reason barred it although church street was deserted there would be eyes at windows this was ledwardine lol youve got a laptop but no printer just an oversight ill get one sometime jeez jane stood up did you see anybody gomer the fence guysve gone now gomers not sure whats happening there either but he does know a lot of people hes still on our side though jane this is gomer parry anybody rung bloke called dan friend of prof levins i said youd call him back then i had to go online you ought to get broadband dont use it enough what did you find i was going to print it out when you got back but under the circs id better give you the basics lol sat down on the sofa jane had the laptop on the desk with a curtain halfdrawn wychehill church dedicated to st dunstan whos one of the patron saints of music he was bishop of glastonbury in the eleventh century and he played the harp or something but the church was only dedicated in the s built in the victorian gothic style by joseph longworth quarry owner after his conversion which get this was said to have followed a visionary experience on the hill what kind of visionary experience havent been able to find out this was a boring ecclesiastical website mainly dates and architectural features all it says is that longworth was stricken with remorse at the damage his quarrying had done to what he now realized was holy ground and so he went to little malvern priory and prayed for forgiveness and was subsequently directed to this spot by god thats all it says about that but something mustve directed him because when he got there he found the remains of what was described as a singlecell rectangular building which was thought to be a monks cell or a hermits sanctuary next to the road there wasnt a road there in those days just a quarry track and that was a few hundred yards away so the road mustve been put in later probably after longworth was dead so he built his church on top of the foundations of the singlecell rectangular building you could get away with that kind of thing in those days it says he built a church big enough to take a full choir and orchestra interesting and then he built the rectory and houses for the church warden and the choirmaster and then other people built houses there as the malverns had become fairly soughtafter with the spa and everything so longworth is actually credited with establishing what is now considered to be wychehill lol is all this anything to do with that guy getting his throat cut on the beacon anythings possible lol said its a holistic world you want me to keep searching no give it a rest ill ring this bloke thanks jane took my mind off things a bit jane closed the laptop feel like a fugitive well deal with it its not your problem i suppose id like to think it was lol said sorry jane smiled a strained kind of smile id be honoured to be your problem especially if you can restrain mum dan turned out to be the choir guy and he lived up near the frome valley which was presumably how he came to know prof levin he also knew lol robinson i was at your concert at the courtyard amazing shit hot i mean it man a comeback in the truest sense well thank you thats very kind best tenor in these parts me dan said but id give it all away for a croak if i could write songs like you seriously id rather be in a band robert plant or something bigvoice stuff but if youve got the finest tenor in much cowarne youre expected to use it cross to bear man on the plus side you get to work with some unexpectedly wild people tim loste yeah dans voice came down like hed been unplugged prof told me its crazy man you look at tim loste you think yeah wouldnt like to meet him on a dark night in a back alley you talk to tim loste no way with a knife utterly out of the question problem is the police talk to him different wavelengths you know can you tell me a bit about his wavelength oh man i could bend your ear for hours about lostie only im still in the choir in a loose way so none of this came from me right count on it well its a big choir the loste boys and girls drawn from maybe a fiftymile radius and you dont have to totally love elgar but it helps me i like him better than i used to when youre born in this area you get the guy shoved down your throat from an early age you live in elgar country its an honour yeah thanks so you sang at wychehill church st timothys as we call it acoustics are amazing the quarry tycoon who had it built longthorne you know that story longworth thats the man venerated elgar saw himself as like gerontius from the oratorio an ordinary man whod sinned a bit and now hes facing the final judgement and hes shitting himself so the guy builds a bloody church stairway to heaven or what a very big church designed for sacred music i think he wanted to buy into the three choirs right that would be the three choirs festival gloucestershire worcestershire and herefordshire oldest fest of its kind in the country dates back to about but its a cathedral thing mainly so i dont suppose wychehill was much involved the road wouldntve been much more than a quarry track in those days but it obsesses tim i dont get too close to be honest you get roped into stuff and for every one that works theres a lot of timewasters hes inclined to exploit people fair enough he is a bit inspirational and the women fancy him not that they can get too close with the witch of endor around winnie spooky why do you say that just is she gets the ideas there was one where we were divided into groups of twelve and tim fixed up for us to use three different churches wychehill little malvern priory and st barts at redmarley dabitot we had to go to these separate churches and sing a set programme at the same time i copped for little malvern the parish church now it is and we had mobile phones connected with tim and winnie at wychehill and hed give the word and wed all start singing simultaneously singing what gregorian chant to start off the warmup then elgars kyrie eleison these solid c of e establishments reverting to their catholic roots strange at first but quite moving the other thing i remember is how weird it felt but i dont dwell on these things weird how i dunno unexpectedly exciting really we did it by candlelight that was winnies idea too dunno whether you know the priory church but its quite small and narrow and it was you know quite a thrilling experience i was a bit cynical about the whole idea at first taking the piss as you do but id do it again tomorrow i mean it id travel a long way to do it dan sounded like hed surprised himself saying that lol waited he was fascinated he sometimes thought about playing in a church not in some dumb happyclappy band but he didnt know he just wanted sometimes to put himself into a situation where his music might find a different level it was the things that were happening in my head dan said and my whole body really a vibration going through you like wiring and its like different parts of you are lighting up in sequence cant explain it i mean all right the chant usually gives you a bit of a lift but this time the interconnectedness thing it wasnt just three churches coming together it was like being inside a big orb of sound like wed broken through to another place i mean it more than that really i bugger me i sound like id taken something dont i why those particular churches well tim never explained he never does hes an inarticulate bugger at the best of times you think if he could talk in notes and chords instead of words he would you know they say he was a useless teacher but we worked it out kind of comes down to the three churches being in the three counties wychehill in herefordshire little malvern priory in worcestershire and redmarley dabitot in gloucestershire so what hed done hed assembled his own three counties choir the three counties united in sacred chant weird and he never tells you whats behind all this not talked about lol were all a bit funny about that kind of thing ent we one woman this is just one woman mind and i dont know her very well but she was white as a sheet when we come out said that when we were doing the mass she seen like a figure up at the altar tall hat well a bishops mitre and hes standing there with his arms raised like like a bishop i suppose she was pretty shocked but it mightve been just the state we were all in this happened when you were singing music from the mass elgars music well yeah but i later found out there was a famous photo taken in there where youre supposed to be able to see the ghostly shape of a bishop with his crozier so she mayve come back down with that in her head youre a bit high with the singing and you find youre focused on the same spot that youve seen in the picture and its all candlelit when she told us she wasnt frightened exactly it was more white with awe and i remember thinking yeah we woke him up and hes celebrating the mass and suddenly the idea of celebrating the mass made sense to me for the first time well lol said thanks you should write a song about him dan said the dream stashing away the notebook and the phone and shouldering her bag merrily walked directly over but winnie was already blocking the porch her hands out long nails and her eyes almost black in the full sunlight no way they let him go im asking you merrily with civility to back off that was him wasnt it merrily said whaddaya think its elgars freaking ghost tim loste had vanished into the church and the oak doors were shut at the porch entrance winnie sparke didnt move her arms were slim but unexpectedly muscular tanned and taut and this is just as close as you get today lady hes in a delicate state you need to show some respect you were laughing im laughing he isnt im happy hes out i need to talk to him some other time jeez he was accused of killing a guy with a knife they had him in some interrogation cell threw the whole damn package at him hour after hour different cops good copbad cop all that shit how they make you confess to what you didnt do come at you and come at you till you dont know whether its night or freaking day bad experience winnie but i didnt get him arrested my business heres road accidents and thats as good as over im just drawing lines under things well you go draw your lines someplace else why dont you want me to talk to him thats how you choose to see it you go right ahead you put it all on me unbelievable was this really the same woman who a couple of nights ago in this very spot had been all letsgettogether and explaining how the rocks were in pain telling merrily how cute she was and her kittenish fawning and her oh dont you look so cool today paul all right merrily said how about i just talk to you later winnie sparkes eyes were like smoked glass i have to take care of tim in the church the organ started up low and growling chords winnie smiled giving himself a fix hell be ok on his own for a while then look ill call you sometime ok its a public place the church i often go into other churches to pray i think i feel the need no winnies hands were out clawed again you really going to scratch my eyes out winnie ive been messed about for days and my daughters got some problems and i need to go home im asking for a few minutes of your time or if youre determined to have an unseemly cat fight to prevent me entering a church merrily unslung her bag dropped it at her feet then lets do it the sun burned down and the church shimmered ok winnie sparkes hands fell her shoulders slumping but give me three minutes to go talk to him i expect theres a back door right you have my word winnie said merrily sighed save me some time frannie merrily said into the phone just tell me why hes out bliss left the line open while he went downstairs to the car park yeh its true i know its true ive just seen him when did they let him go your friend sparke collected him from worcester about an hour ago the dna evidence was to say the least inconclusive but mainly other developments have altered the focus of the case in a way more meaningful for me as an observer can you tell me with the usual proviso the murder i told you about in pershore the drug dealer tortured and shot in his car christopher smith we may have his killer in custody in a manner of speaking although he wont be signing a confession what happened two mates of smiths encouraged by a modest reward and considerably emboldened no doubt by news of roman wicklows death have now come forward to say that they saw mr smith leaving a nightclub in worcester on the night of the killing in the company of mr wicklow mr wicklow being as weve learned a man who inspired considerable fear in his community wicklow murdered smith it begins to look like it do you know why apparently we do not at this stage but its usually a simple territorial dispute so if they were both dealers and wicklow was working for khan who was smith working for dunno it was parttime with smith he had a day job in an abattoir maybe he was also working for khan these situations get complicated maybe smith had been unreliable and wicklow was assigned to take him out we dont know merrily thats the honest answer but loste is off the hook course he isnt they just had to let him go for the moment no dna pointers and the cps advised that there was insufficient evidence to support a murder charge so they could have him in again hes a big lad merrily and clearly three sheets in the wind but surely the idea of a former music teacher killing a man whos now emerging as a cold and practised assassin look bliss said i agree with you like i said i think its drugrelated and even though theres evidence of loste trading with wicklow on the beacon if it was me id be looking to talk to the friends of mr smith the ones we dont know about yet and raji naturally but its not me its annie howe and howes still keen on mr loste on the points scale one nice educated uppermiddleclass killer is worth at least five street urchins surprisingly winnie sparke came out of the church alone but it was a start merrily guided her to longworths tomb under the angel of the agony winnie seemed uneasy about this glancing up a couple of times before perching on the edge of a step the angels halfspread wings were shielding them against the sun but in a predatory way the hell with him merrily sat down and leaned a shoulder into the lower folds of his marble robe sometimes this job can be quite damaging to your faith winnie i dont care for faith faith is intellectually lazy ok skip the theological debate its your show until i ask you something you dont want to answer winnie shrugged the organ started up again something that merrily half recognized not elgar too clipped like fine topiary bach bottom line here winnie said bottom line is the ghost of edward elgar its the only reason im here and ive wasted enough time on it and im fed up with being circuitous did tim make it up or did he in some way conjure it up is he disturbed sick or just a drunk you want me to place a tick against one of the above or if a fourth possibility got missed out along the way and what if i was to tell you winnie looked down into her lap that i didnt know i thought youd at least have an opinion all the esoteric subjects i assume youve studied in order to write books it helps to study is that still what you do its an income not a good one better in the states life is more expensive here and mind body spirit books dont sell so many are you doing a book on this maybe is that why youre playing it close to the chest winnie didnt answer merrily said i dont write books sometimes i have to make reports but theyre internal say for the bishop or as a safeguard against comebacks or background notes for my successor in the job this may be the book i get remembered for winnie said not just another new age paperback no i came over ten years ago on account of an english guy who was who proved to be not mr right not even mr halfway right couple years ago i realized that if i was to stay and i kind of like it here i needed a project that would turn over some bigger money i conceived the idea of a book that would explore the spiritual roots of musical creativity through elgar and the malverns i have a degree in ancient history and anthropology although i knew i was gonna need some help with the music you had a new angle on this i visited here found longworths church and also this cottage that was proving hard to shift off the agents books on account it was too small and the quarrying had left no place to extend and it was dangerous for kids and stuff like that i could afford to buy if i sold my apartment in london which was what i did and then at a conference on elgar at the abbey hotel in malvern i met tim someone who could help you with the music more than that a whole lot more tim grew up in sussex near elgars home there brinkwells hed always felt there was something between him and elgar that was going someplace creatively creatively yes which basically was how he wound up in malvern in most other areas around this time i should tell you his life was a mess hed split with his girlfriend he was starting to drink too much and he was pretty close to getting fired from his job at the college when was this this would be just over a year ago so you and tim began to work together to get this out of the way i need to tell you that theres no physical relationship situation was there was someone else in my life at the time preston devereaux stop winnies expression didnt alter dont go there on no account ok tims parents live in france and he was closest to his grandmother when she died he inherited a substantial sum of money by this time id researched the situation here pertaining to this gentleman winnie gently tapped the tomb i drew tims attention to a house thatd come on the market in wychehill caractacus it seemed too perfect its an ugly house but its in the right place and i i shouldve explained that tims primary problem was an inability to reach the heights as a composer hed always written music his knowledge and his technique were never in doubt he taught with flair and sympathy his original work was of a standard there was a barrier between him and what i call the sublime the fact that he could never get beyond that caused him intense emotional pain but he bought the house he didnt want to know about the house he didnt want to see me i gave up on him a week later he swallowed a bottle of pills with most of a bottle of whisky walked out in the street and collapsed i didnt know about this id been down in london tying up the ends of my divorce and seeing friends i didnt know how close he came to death i didnt know anything about it until he showed up at my door couple of weeks later and said hed had a dream while they were fighting to save him in the hospital like the dream of gerontius you listened to all of that yet twice in my uneducated way gerontius dies hes an old man not a young man like tim but no matter gerontius either dies or hes in a deep coma whatever he sheds the body load and loses the weight of his pain and he meets with his guardian angel a woman in my version its always a woman so tim arrives at my door a moment i relive quite frequently and he tells me that he now understands that i am his guardian angel and how does he know that from his dream he says he awoke in hospital knowing it and now he goes along with me he buys the house and we meet with the rector and tim starts to play the organ in church there was an old guy who fumbled his way around the keys he was happy to let it go and then quite quickly the choir was formed people love to sing they love to have the music drawn through them like silk the choir comes out of the three counties building its reputation refining its membership its a fine choir growing toward the sublime so tim has died and come through to a new level his old life has dropped away hes in a new place with a new yeah maybe this was what you meant when you said you believed that purgatory could be dealt with in this life tim is physically purged with a stomach pump and then gradually i became aware of a pattern a grand design of cosmic proportions and i can see from your eyes merrily that youre sorry we got here no i he hasnt exactly stopped drinking has he winnie sparke stood up her face and neck shone with sweat go deal with your kid huh youre episcopalian and this is catholic theology you have an inbuilt antipathy thats not fair women priests thats a political thing im not being i mean theres no spiritual basis to it right like she was the very first person to say that is it part of your image to come over as mercurial winnie the heat was getting to merrilys patience or are we simply approaching another area that you feel it would not be advantageous to get into youre not ready you need to go away and consider this i dont believe youre ready spiritually emotionally or intellectually to feel the heat of the sublime whereas you are you have to excuse me winnie said i have things to do spiritual malnutrition a tractor and trailer were rattling past down the lane from the track which led into the hills merrily climbed into her boiling car in front of starlight cottage and slammed the door the mobile clamped tight to her ear sorry couldnt hear for the traffic i just said shes here lol said she closed her eyes and tipped her head back the direct sun making a pulsing orange light show on her eyelids thank god for something and the piece in the guardian lol said ill read it out to you when hed finished she asked him if hed mind reading it again he read it again slowly while merrily was opening all the car windows it could be worse couldnt it she lied about her age to make her an adult lol said and obviously her terminology philistine morons for heavens sake but the worst thing she should have told you thats the worst thing yes it all happened so quickly and you werent around but she should have told you and she knows that im a lousy mother merrily leaned out of the window for more air ill come home ill be home in an hour no lol said dont dont ow merrily pulled her bare forearm away from the volvos scorching bodywork sorry dont come home i mean not yet theres a tv crew around and theyll doorstep you and you wont know what to say youre right i suppose merrily ran fingers through her hair her head felt full of swirling fragments its just better to wait until late afternoon when theyve all filed their pieces and without jane they wont be able to do much most of them might even drop it its not a huge story after all and its friday and how are things over there well since you ask its starting to seriously piss me off it was good to unload it all on someone entirely nonjudgemental she told him everything from stella cobham to winnie sparke who was all over the place first shes doing the new age paganism bit springs and water goddesses and then its high catholic theology and getting lofty about women priests it gets very hard to listen politely to this crap i talked to an interesting guy lol told her about prof levin and a chorister called dan who working with loste thought hed broken through to a higher place that must have been nice for him what a dismal life of spiritual malnutrition we lead in the anglican church but at least you never become bitter and cynical sparke merrily wiped sweat off her forehead with the back of her hand winnie sparke virtually accused me of not being equipped to grasp the profundity of it not equipped to feel the heat of the sublime the bitch lol said time to talk to syd spicer and i mean talk youll look after jane merrily you sound like and i also need to ring morrell morrell what was it about morrell you tried to like these people as a priest you tried to like virtually everybody but before you say anything else mr morrell its my fault entirely i kept her off school i decided it wasnt fair to inflict this situation on you and as it was near the end of term but surely morrell said you must realize the normal procedure would have been to consult me first i might well have agreed well yes but there wasnt really time i mean there it was in the paper and i had an appointment you didnt know it was going to be in the paper well not this particular day but you evidently knew mrs watkins that she was embarking on this madness madness whats so mad about under the pretext of an alevel project and didnt think to inform me according to jane you already knew one thing i most certainly did not know was that shed taken this unscientific nonsense to the media but i had warned her that repeatedly playing truant in order to pursue some misguided campaign against the local authority was going to get her into seriously hot he must have heard merrily catch her breath did i surprise you there mrs watkins well i could it be that you didnt know about janes recurrent migraine migraine she shut her eyes against the sun even with all the windows down it was getting unbearable in here migraine i gather your curious job keeps you away from home quite a lot these days morrells voice was plumped out with satisfaction but you must know this is not something i can be seen to overlook yes i value my reputation as a liberal even radical school director but if i allow students to come and go to pursue their whims im undermining my own authority so i have to tell you that what im looking for now is jane watkins outside my room on monday morning with a full explanation an abject apology and a readiness to accept whatever retribution i consider necessary i see and if that isnt forthcoming i also have to tell you i dont expect to see her at all youre talking about suspension oh im talking about a bigger word than that mrs watkins and also in line with the usual procedure im talking to the governors about it im sorry youll have to excuse me i have another call waiting no merrily said if you hang up on me now im jesus what she was sweating hed have the governors in his pocket dead noise he might have gone you could never tell with a mobile or he might just want her to think hed gone if you hang up on me mr morrell or take any extreme action against my daughter until ive had a chance to sort this out heavens sake youve got kids dealing drugs assaulting teachers heres one all shes doing is making a stand against something in her own village not even in the school that she feels is wrong ok something that you as an atheist and an archsceptic probably wouldnt understand and yes shes never exactly tactful and she gets up peoples noses but if you go to the governors with this some of whom are bound to be on the bloody council im going straight to the national press and ill make it my business to ensure that everybody knows what a pompous smug selfseeking hypocritical prick youve become merrily cut the line dropped the mobile on the passenger seat she was shaking her sweat was turning cold she fastened her seat belt fumbling with it started the car and drove down to the church parking bay stared for a moment through the windscreen past the church entrance to the gables of the rectory its windows smokyblack against the sun not many people left to antagonize spicer wasnt answering the bell and she couldnt hear it ringing inside the rectory merrily banged on the front door stepped back scanned all the windows for movement nothing she went round the side of the house like her own rectory too damned big and hammered on the back door then walked away onto the lawn that rose into the forestry a screen concealing quarrying scars and who knew what else so many screens in wychehill but the afternoon sun was high and hot and relentless and drove her back into the shade of the open back porch where she stood beating one last time on the back door leaning on the leverhandle in frustration and the door opened it swung back with no creak and she was looking into a utility room with a belfast sink a pair of wellingtons standing underneath it a balding barbour on a peg merrily said syd no reply syd are you in she was experiencing an unseemly urge to search the house find the secret photos in the drawers uncover syd spicers hidden history the door at the end might not be locked but she was reluctant to approach it afraid to maybe for reasons that she was reluctant to examine she backed away closed the porch door and went down the drive to the roadside back in the car she rang rajab ali khans office in kidderminster returning his call to her answering machine if thats mrs watkins a woman said mr khan said to tell you hell be at the royal oak for the rest of the day he says if you can spare the time hed like to see you local democracy jane had found redmarley dabitot church on the os map ringing it in pencil this is interesting look one second lol peered around the curtain midafternoon and the tourists were out on church street the camerahung carousel with its tapeloop of soundbite conversations only today some of the visitors would be media and they knew from the guardian what jane watkins looked like go on he polished his glasses on his tshirt put them back on to examine the map folded on the desk redmarley on the other side of the m motorway just over the gloucestershire border was almost due south of the malvern range i know im obsessed with leys at the moment jane said but its almost like there is one going up from redmarley interlinking the three counties the full length of the malverns see jane had drawn in the line it wasnt connecting ancient sites as much as hilltops lol counted five midsummer hill hangmans hill pinnacle hill perseverance hill north hill and look at this shed also marked the two major iron age hill forts herefordshire beacon and worcestershire beacon but the line didnt go through the middle of either it skirted the first to the right and the second to the left thats not a problem its how it seems to work jane said alfred watkins noticed that leys almost always cut along the edge of a hill fort rather than through the middle if you look on the map its the same with cole hill although when youre actually on the line it looks as if youre looking directly towards the summit what does that mean lol said cutting to the sides simple iron age people lived in the middle of those hill forts there were huts and things you dont want powerful spiritual energy in your actual home do you youd go slowly insane with the intensity of it so you live to the side of the ley churches built on sites of ritual worship are something else obviously being places you actually go to for a spiritual buzz uhhuh so redmarley church is right on the line now the other church where they had a choir going little malvern priory thats not on the great northsouth ley it is on a ley though another one thats cutting left to right across the northsouth line now heres wychehill where the two lines cross cool huh you may be on to something here lol said i just wish i knew what were looking at a whole range of holy hills that would make this a massively important area geopsychically she looked up at lol and sighed softly you know i love this it reinforces your sense of i dunno like you just put your pencil on the map and its like the choir guy said youre suddenly at the centre of something immense almost like youre making a personal connection with jane shook her head rapidly bollocks maybe all great ideas start off as bollocks lol said its the way oh hell whos this jane snatched a quick glance around the curtain and then moved away from the window her head down someone was knocking on the front door go upstairs lol said mr robinson is it sorry to bother you but i understood you might know where the vicar is he was wearing a suit and a winecoloured tie which first thing lol noticed matched his plump lips swaying a little rattling small change and keys in his pockets it seemed so not his generation rattling your keys he couldnt be more than thirty sorry lol said im not really sure where she is her work takes her all over the diocese daughter with her do you know wouldnt imagine so its um mr pierce isnt it lyndon pierce thats right gelled hair glinting in the sunlight like the roof of a black cab sure we mustve met sometime or other been trying to get around to see all the newcomers to the village one by one ive been here a few years now actually lol said you probably didnt notice me is there anything i can do any message i can pass on thats very possible mr robinson yes lyndon pierces local accent seemed to have acquired a transatlantic roll he glanced meaningfully over his shoulder at a japanese dad photographing his family on the edge of the square you want to come in lol said thank you pierce rubbed his hands wont keep you a minute mr robinson but there are some things that i think mrs watkins should know about if you happen to be in contact with her letting him into the living room lol felt unexpectedly nervous the guy represented aspects of life hed avoided never needed to consult a local councillor never earned enough to need an accountant pierce was standing on the hearthrug taking in the orange ceiling that jane had recommended the crystals that jane had positioned in the window the boswell guitar no doubt thinking neohippie lot of peoplere looking for mrs watkins today mr robinson and jane of course girl seems to have started something shell likely live to regret her mother too mabbe he must have figured from the contents of the room that the chances of ever getting the occupants vote were remote enough for him to skip the niceties unfortunate but people do tend to blame the parents for the behaviour of the child dont they mr robinson youd call jane a child the door to the hall and the stairs was not quite closed please dont let her be behind it likely not to her face lyndon pierce laughed look all right mr robinson ill come directly to the point we got quite a serious problem yere i was phoned up a few hours ago by gerry murray owner of colemans meadow not a happy man as you can imagine i went to check out the situation for myself and then i gave him my suggestion which was to get the police in lol blinked to arrest jane im sure a lot of folk would think that wasnt a bad idea actually laurence using laurence now in the powertrip way of young policemen when they pulled you over for speeding im sorry lyndon lol said i dont get out much somethings happening in colemans meadow pierce sniffed all look the same to me green activists animal liberationists ragbag of scruffs from god knows where they say its a demonstration we might consider it threatening behaviour you mean theres a protest lol was fighting a smile about the ley line youre telling me you didnt know very very stupid people laurence bout a dozen of em posters placards trying to protect something we all know dont exist lol saw pierce taking in the os maps on the desk with the ancient sites ringed and the pencil lines connecting them he began to fold them up as pierce smirked yes i can see you didnt know a thing about it it was in the guardian and who put it there laurence ill admit im having difficulty with this see why you and that girl and those cranky sods out there wanner put the mockers on a muchneeded development in an otherwise useless derelict area but isnt there a statutory notice posted at the site for the actual purpose of inviting objections aimed at local counciltax payers with a legitimate viewpoint not sad buggers with nose rings who come from miles away cause they feel lost if they ent got a protest to go to and not adolescents getting above themselves and trying to cause trouble in fact pierce looked down at his shoes and then back at lol i think i should tell you that people are beginning to feel its time that girls mother did something to curb her behaviour before before the community does a curfew court order banning her from going within half a mile of cole hill dont get silly now lol raised both eyebrows all because she feels strongly about preserving the village heritage laurence thats balls one of our experts says it ent even in that fellers book she made it up it dont exist it never existed its a bloody joke its flyingsaucer stuff me im simply trying to be reasonable here see both sides of it when shes a bit more mature shell likely realize that like all these villages ledwardine has to grow or die grow into what all im saying if people consider were now within commuting distance of london then we got to run with that home counties overrun with asylum seekers decent hardworking folk gotter move somewhere if they wanner sell up and bring their money here whore we to grow into an extension of london suburbia three hours is now commuting distance or quicker with a fast car jesus lol said you people lyndon went back on his heels you really make me laugh youre living in the bloody past im an accountant boy were the first to see the signs i see the farmers profits going on the slide year after year its patently clear that agriculture cant sustain the county any longer and the county cant sustain agriculture if cheap imports are killing farms and the government dont want em growing food n more there ent nothing we can do about that farmer wants to survive he sells what ground he can for quality housing at the best price he can get our jobs to support the farmers thats a very twisted kind of logic lyndon and ill give you some more city people weekend folk are used to more sophisticated facilities than weve been able to provide and if they wants em on the doorstep we gotter give them that in ledwardine itself more shops proper supermarkets and at the same time jim prosser know about that jim prosserll be retired soon and we can catch up on what the rural areasve been missing all these years you dont think local people should have sophisticated facilities laurence decent leisure centre has anybody asked them laurence lyndon pierce blew air slowly down his nostrils thats why you elect councillors its called local democracy he beamed case proven anyway if you do hear from mrs watkins put her in the picture would you if she wants to speak with me about this matter ill be available are these lol heard the stairs creak are these protesters still there not for long new legislations made it easier to deal with timewasting scum likely well have it sorted before teatime without any arrests what with water cannon rubber bullets people like you worry me pierce said vicar be back home tonight will she far as i know only folks keep saying to me as how she spends so much time out of the parish these days we might as well not have a vicar at all who would that be specifically lyndon pretty hard seems to me for a parish vicar to win back support once it starts to slip laurence specially if her daughters setting a bad example to other kids skipping school making trouble ill leave you to think about the implications of that pierce placed a hand on the livingroom doorknob then turned back to lol with a minimal smile oh and if certain people who ent local dont like the way we do things around yere seems to me they might think about moving on knowing they can always get a good price for their period cott the door opened pushing lyndon pierce back into the room jane was standing there face as white as her school shirt gazing at pierce with all the warmth of a november twilight you mean if people dont like things being run by bent councillors pierces smile was history lol watched with a horrified kind of fascination as the man tongued his full lips as though he was trying to tease it back or maybe jane said maybe if they dont like bastards who used to shoot blue tits off the nutcontainers with their airguns you pierces forefinger came up had better watch your mouth lyndon lol said softly shes just a child pierce spun round at him as for you vicar know youve had her daughter upstairs cause it looks like shes gonner find out ennit but dont you worry laurence it wont be from me not directly boy not directly lol had to grab jane and hold on to her to stop her going for pierce or maybe it was the other way round whichever them holding one another like this he knew as soon as pierce stepped briskly outside and all the heads began to turn that it wasnt going to look good from the crowded street temple of sound in the copy of the malvern gazette open on raji khans ebony desk there was a hole where the face of leonard holliday used to be mr khan stabbed it again with his gold cross pen why are they doing this to me mrs watkins can you tell me that he was wearing a cricket shirt and cream slacks and white shoes his black hair hung beyond his shoulders cavalier style in his left ear he wore what might have been an emerald merrily sat on the other side of the desk in a dark wood chair which was meaningfully lower than his probably just that this is not what they expect to find she said carefully in a place like this have you tried inviting the wychehill residents action group up here to discuss it mr khans office upstairs at the royal oak was like something out of sherlock holmes drapery and brass standard lamps deep maroon walls and a grey picturerail didnt really work in summer but with a coal fire on a december day it would be awfully cosy a middleaged asian woman who dressed like sophie had shown merrily up no doormen apparent on the premises no dj xex you know i once did invite them mr khan said they wouldnt meet me i am it would appear the very spawn of satan and i left the holy water in the car mr khan beamed at first shed been thinking how surreal all this was how unlike anyones idea of a drug barons lair but it was in effect like a traditional drug barons lair and mr khan was behaving curiously like the kind of urbane educated executive criminal you saw in old films while she didnt feel uncomfortable here it might have made sense to tell bliss she was coming now mr khan was leaning back in his leather swivel chair hands behind his head tell me again you are planning to hold a requiem a requiem repeating it in the manner of wildes lady bracknell disarming young fogey that he was an expensive education hadnt quite ironed wolverhampton out of his accent requiem eucharist mr khan a holy communion for the dead i wasnt sure whether your own faith might present some oh not a problem at all mrs watkins in my capacity as a patron of the arts and popular culture ive attended no small number of christian funerals my initial problem however is the fact that i simply didnt know these poor people as individuals many hundreds thousands now frequent inn ya face and travel many miles to do so did you know the late mr cookman no i didnt and yet youre proposing to conduct a service in his memory and that of his girlfriend not exactly that or rather not entirely that it also relates to the circumstances of their deaths and the effects all of that has had on the community all of that there have been a number of other accidents very minor in comparison but theres a general atmosphere of discomfort discomfort id like this to be a service of closure of healing which in my experience can be quite allembracing which is why i thought it would be appropriate for you to be there and why is it being conducted by you rather than by mr spicer because aware of painting herself into a corner because i specialize in this kind of healing youre a spiritual healer a faith healer that would not be a description id welcome and what would be mr khan waited his prominent chin uptilted im the deliverance consultant for hereford diocese merrily said i suppose i should explain what that you think i dont know it certainly suggests that your earlier reference to holy water was not entirely in jest it was entirely in jest but i can understand your misgivings we hear so much nowadays about socalled deliverance mr khan frowned children and babies being exorcized to the point of abuse and beyond because they are believed to be harbouring evil spirits not us if were ever invited to exorcize a young child the social and psychiatric reports come first and the situation in wychehill fortunately is nothing to do with kids were looking at the relatively high incidence of problems on the road and other problems which have been linked to experiences of a possibly paranormal nature i cant wait to hear this mrs watkins people say theyve become aware of a figure on a bicycle in the road before an accident thats it basically coming out with this kind of stuff cold was merrily often thought the hardest part of the job sometimes you could almost feel the derision on your skin how extraordinary mrs watkins and did the civilized mr devereaux witness this apparition we havent yet discussed it in any depth but it seemed to me that a requiem eucharist for two people whod recently died on the road would be a calming influence as well as bringing together the local community in a spiritual way i think im right in saying that islamic theology accepts that social and atmospheric disturbances can be caused by various discarnate presences oh very much so very much so mr khan stood up and moved to the window so this has absolutely nothing to do with the murder of my employee mr wicklow not directly merrily said but im sure hell be very much in our minds he smiled what diplomacy it seems he was a violent man mr khan yes apparently he was but still a man and still in the end a victim who is mourned look mr khan beckoned her and she walked over to the window down in the courtyard a man was adjusting the driving seat of a bright orange sports car with an england sticker in the rear window two women looking on the older one clutching a tissue his family theyve been here most of the day to attend the opening of the inquest and collect his personal possessions his car his clothing his jewellery his mothers taken it very badly he was her only son merrily said nothing wondering about the mothers of dead junkies whose habits had been fed by roman perhaps i was naive mr khan said in watching my head doorman walk out onto the hills with his knapsack and his binoculars and being gratified by his seeming appreciation of the natural world its been a sobering experience for all of us he turned away from the window and you dont really believe me do you mrs watkins you dont believe i knew nothing about romans enterprise perhaps you even think im involved in it myself hadnt been expecting that well she went back slowly to her chair i dont think youre naive not all your regulars like to keep going all night unassisted its a chemical culture if you were widely known for taking a hard line against drugs this wouldnt be considered a very cool venue would it khan gave merrily a sharp look which she thought was close to conveying respect ill tell you one thing he sat down again and prodded the newspaper on his desk opened at this carnage will go on this is a quite ludicrous exaggeration a couple of weeks ago i made a point of parking my own car in wychehill early on a sunday morning to see for myself the alleged havoc we were wreaking no one in the course of an hour and a half seemed to stop there and there was no noise and although we sell alcohol like any other country pub im aware of no drink or drugrelated convictions so far this year that are connected with inn ya face and the traffic police do target us theyd be foolish not to merrily chanced her arm but not the drug squad why are you he spread his arms mrs watkins why are you pursuing this the police arent the media are still calling romans death some sort of ritual murder the police have been inclined to view it as an extreme reaction to something considered culturally alien to the area while you is this a holy war do you know dci howe well khans eyes narrowed for just an instant and then he smiled shes a fine officer her record on community relations is impeccable clearly going right to the top merrily said and wondered what their relationship was annie howe and raji khan hed surely be an informer to die for i do hope so he said the police service needs more people like annie and i hope youll be able to attend the service she stood up erm if you dont mind me asking how did you get into this business this murky business he laughed a yelp of delight this world of gangland rivalry and territorial wars mrs watkins you have such a a darkly romanticized view of the nightclub scene i tend to watch a lot of trash tv to unwind from the pressures of the job raji khan came around the desk i shall tell you why rather than how despite coming down from cambridge with a moderately acceptable second i got into this business i came into it mrs watkins because i absolutely love it i love it to death the music the atmosphere the milieu have loved it since escaping from my dormitory at fourteen with a friend to attend my very first rave on a hillside in wiltshire electrifying pure ecstatic naked vibration you leave everything behind your mind your body your im sorry was that your generation acid house drumnbass or did you miss out do you know what im talking about or are you persuaded like mr holliday and his cohorts that we are demonic well i i am a sufi raji khan said music is a sacred form to me i tell people that inn ya face has been transformed from a common drinking den into a temple of sound yes two wires connecting in merrilys head with an almost audible fizz have i said something mrs watkins mmm i think you have have you got something on tonight of course its friday we have an old friend of mine the good dr samedi from kidderminster jeff khan looked startled he was hired for a party in our village a couple of years ago with his voodoo hiphop show he still doing that not so famous then of course my my raji khan said he escorted her to the car park roman wicklows family had gone two white vans were arriving well khan said im not sure whether i shall be able to attend your requiem but i do hope that you can help to stop the carnage netherworld all jane wanted was to leave go running back to the vicarage bar the doors and spend the night slapping tin after tin of white paint on the mondrian walls but lol said that leaving now would only make it worse like they actually did have something to hide so she just kept walking round and round the little front parlour like a caged tiger hamster more like ending up facedown on the sofa beating the cushions in blind despair at a world where the scum always came out on top and at the bottom of it all like a cold stone in her gut was the knowledge that this was all so totally her fault this halfarsed venture had been cursed from the start and the curse was spreading and of all the people she never in her life wanted to harm of all the people who didnt deserve it lol was always tethered to his past that was the problem hed stretch it just so far and then something would send it snapping back old rope twisting itself into a new noose after the disgusting pierce had gone lol had sat at the desk assuring her that this was really not a problem and the kind of people whod believe someone like lyndon were the kind who were not worth worrying about but he must be worried terribly worried about the damage pierce could do with a word here and a word there scattered like rat poison over all the places he went in his capacity as a democratically elected member of the herefordshire council democratically elected lol said because nobody could be bothered to stand against him lols personal history however would always stand against him shed been called tracy cooke jane had known all about this for a couple of years now anyway her name was tracy and shed been aged about fifteen at the time lol would have been only eighteen or so himself when he was set up by the bass player in his band whod wanted tracys mate and had got them all lol included hopelessly drunk and then had decided he was having both girls and had crept into lols hotel room and virtually raped tracy while lol was sleeping it off slipping away and leaving lol who knew nothing about it hadnt even had sex with the girl to face the police investigation that would crush his career turn his loopy bornagain christian parents against him and tip him down the chute into what hed called in a song the medicated netherworld of psychiatric socalled care taken years to drag himself out of the system and while he wasnt exactly on that register he must still have a record for a distant sex offence an offence that never was but which explained everything about lol all the caution the timidity the fear of facing an audience which hed seemed finally to be leaving behind did lyndon pierce know about this or was it just a lucky stab villages were such evil places at least she wasnt underage just the bloody vicars bloody daughter so even if anyone believed it the worst they could say oh god god god harsh colours collided behind janes eyelids a small universe exploding when she eventually opened her eyes she saw that lol was looking surprisingly calm a danger sign surely sitting there at the desk in his black tshirt with the alien motif his little round glasses on his nose fine slivers of grey in his hair and the phone at his ear and he was going yes thank you look i wonder if its possible to speak to mrs pole jane scrambled to her feet lol lol was saying margaret pole yes oh oh no i didnt know im so im really very sorry jane didnt know what was happening she wanted to snatch the phone out of his hand and start shaking him no he said just a friend of the family i came to visit her once a few years ago ive um been abroad its just that im not far from hardwicke and i was thinking i had some flowers and chocolates and well never mind sorry youve been lols face tightening in concentration jane felt almost panicked now why was he trying to reach a woman who was evidently dead what if something had gone wrong in his head or hers unless lol said look she had a friend there i remember we got on very well miss white athena white i expect shes dead too by now lol listened when he put the phone down he was looking kind of excited shes still there jane when i said i expect shes dead too the woman said no im afraid not what are you talking about miss white athena white is still a resident at the glades residential home at hardwicke so maybe you never met her i dont suppose merrily would have gone out of her way to introduce you not then anyway jane will you do something for me ill do bloody anything lol if youll just tell me whats happening if i give gomer a call will you go down to his place and stay there until merrily gets back why because under the circumstances i dont want you on your own and if were seen driving out of here together and we will be seen where are you going this is not funny lol weve got to warn mum about pierce im just following up something that gomer told me wont take long im going to try and find out about colemans meadow does that matter any more jane said bleakly lol pulled his old denim jacket from the back of the chair oh yes he said merrily drove away from the royal oak still undecided about raji khan it could be that bliss for once was entirely wrong and that khan was no more than what he seemed arrogant and pompous in a way that was almost engaging because you could detect behind it something young and almost naive mr khan was delighted with himself and a system in which an enterprising englishman from an asian family could capitalize on his cultural roots to an unprecedented degree on the way out hed shown her how the royal oak had morphed discreetly into inn ya face it was not a listed building and so it had been possible to remove internal walls creating a series of archways and turning two groundfloor bars and a restaurant area into something cavernous blackpainted wooden shutters had been installed at the windows although it was at ground level with the shutters across it would be like a cellar yes it did now resemble a temple and the stonebased stage built out from a big fireplace was its altar and it had a feeling of permanence that belied preston devereauxs insistence that raji khan wouldnt be here long would khan risk destroying all this by involving himself in the wholesale distribution of illegal drugs or did he have relationships inside west mercia police permitting a certain freedom of movement whatever you thought about annie howe as a human being it was hard to imagine her operating on that level not exactly a deliverance issue anyway but this was driving past wychehill church merrily braked hard drove across the road into the church lane cutting and turned the volvo around swinging back into the parking bay in front of the lantern by the time she was running through the gates hed gone into the church if it was him in the porch getting her breath back into rhythm she hesitated the way shed done at the rectory dealing with eccentrics fruitcakes imaginative and inspired people whatever they were it was important to keep reminding yourself that it was not about what you believed could happen so much as what they believed could happen and it was about accepting that when someone believed strongly enough something could happen there was a lot she didnt know but she was getting closer she pushed at the double doors into the body of the church the doors resisted her locked hed locked himself in merrily rapped on the bevelled glass syd she could hear his footsteps on the flags then they stopped and she sensed him staring at the doors from the other side the one word shed spoken insufficient for him to identify her its merrily are you going to let me in he must have kept her waiting for a good halfminute before she heard the key turning and then his footsteps going away again when she pushed open the doors and entered the vast parish church syd was standing in front of the chancel with its capacious semicircular choir stalls he was wearing his cassock and she thought what a particularly constraining garment it must be for a onetime man of action he looked around with his arms out at the empty pews the oakframed pulpit the organ pipes like giant shellcases can you do anything about this there was nothing to see but merrily could smell the incense protect the memory there used to be a setting sun on the sign lol recalled but it had been replaced now with less scary white lettering on a skyblue background the glades residential home a onetime victorian gentlemans residence at the end of a drive close to the border with wales wide views of the radnorshire hills big long sunsets lol sat in the old white astra in the car park knowing he was here at least partly because after shutting the door on lyndon pierce hed needed to be somewhere else and fast him rather than jane hed watched her walking with gomer down the street to gomers bungalow in her school uniform girls in uniform always suggestive of sexual impropriety ironic really he wasnt at all fond of uniforms especially nurses uniforms kissing a woman in a dog collar had taken an act of will the first time when he left the car a mantle of heavy windless heat settled around him a woman came towards him out of the stern gabled porch a big woman in a light blue overall late fifties bobbed blonde hair brenda cardelow she said mr robinson the situation at the glades had changed the proprietors lol remembered the thorpes had left over a year ago mrs cardelow had told him on the phone burnout shed laughed youre a lucky man mr robinson she appears to remember you shes usually inclined to deny all knowledge of visitors one of the privileges of age lol said but mrs cardelow looked unconvinced i tried to persuade her to come down to the residents lounge but she insists on seeing you in her room so i hope youre prepared for that ive never been in her room but ive heard a lot about it im sure you must have mrs cardelow said the old woman wore a black woollen cardigan and a black wool skirt a fluffy scarf also black was around her neck her eyes were hard and bright like cut diamonds nestling in the window seat among the cushions and the books and the egyptian tapestries and the wallhung turkish rugs and more books and more cushions she was like a tiny possibly malevolent storybook spider robinson crooking a finger with a purplevarnished finely pointed nail same sherbetcentred voice the air in here was tinged with incense miss white lol said of course i remember him miss white flung a brief barbed glance at mrs cardelow nervous wouldbe paramour of an unusually attractive little clergyperson quite a curiosity at the time amongst all those horsefaced lezzies in bondage clobber how goes it robinson been inside the cassock yet anthea mrs cardelow turned to lol theyve all read that damned poem that goes on about when im an old woman i shall dress in purple they think that shedding their inhibitions will keep senility at bay but in my experience it only hastens the onset youll be demented long before me cardelow miss white said in her babykitten voice yes mrs cardelow said sadly im afraid she could be right minds on the blink already keeps calling me anthea thats what it says on your pension book then its a misprint go away governor lock us in the cell if you must but kindly leave us alone mrs cardelow raised a martyrs eyebrow at lol on her way out lol settled himself on a piano stool with no piano still demoralizing the screws then athena passes the time where are the chocolates she said youd brought me chocolates sorry left them in the car black magic still appropriate miss white giggled lol remembered how merrily had reacted when shed first encountered her called in within weeks of being appointed deliverance consultant to look into claims by elderly residents that the glades was being haunted by a handsome man of a certain era treading on eggshells in the big shoes of canon dobbs herefords last diocesan exorcist on a later occasion knowing that merrily needed help but was afraid of what athena white might represent lol had gone on his own to tap into her knowledge of forbidden things finding he got on rather well with this onetime highly placed civil servant whod decided to devote her retirement to the study of the complex esoteric disciplines popularized by madame blavatsky rudolf steiner and dion fortune maybe a stretch on psychiatric wards had helped so she said have you been inside the cassock never really been turned on by women in uniform dont be evasive miss white used to say shed forgone the highmaintenance rosesroundthedoor cottage to set up what she called her eyrie in an old peoples home because it gave her more inner space lol had no idea how old she was but like an elderly radio all her valves still appeared to be glowing ok out of uniform its much easier he said and miss white clapped her tiny hands splendid and you neednt explain why the clergyperson isnt with you i always felt she regarded me as a potential patroller of the lefthand path with whom it would not be at all appropriate to be publicly associated im the gobetween lol said you lied to cardelow told her some frightful porkie about first meeting me when you came to visit poor pole that was because i wanted to talk to you about maggie pole lol said she died i know in her sleep and in the middle of a quandary she thought i was a spiritualist you know a medium some of the inmates do frightfully insulting to be lumped in with the pygmies but i tend not to disabuse them they wouldnt understand the distinction mrs pole asked you to help her as a spiritualist athena white didnt respond for a while exploring him with her eyes robinson are you still working with that dreadful shrink in hereford dick lydon socalled psychotherapist no i gave all that up it didnt seem to be actually curing people good miss white said psychoanalysis was the great folly of the twentieth century leads nowhere except up its own bottom in what way did maggie pole ask you to help her robinson i know the womans dead but there are certain proprieties to be observed why do you want to know all right lol said when i first came to see you you remember we talked about moon the archaeologist and hereford cathedral and its connection along the ley line with dinedor hill ley lines miss white placed a purpletipped finger on her chin watkins your friends called watkins isnt she sos her daughter jane i dont think youve ever met jane but she jane feels very strongly about things and she doesnt give up and shes only seventeen and still at school and shes thrown herself into something which is backfiring on her and im feeling guilty because i didnt get involved and shes vulnerable and im not well not in that way oh i think you are robinson you didnt want to interfere in case it should harm your relationship with her mother which you appear to value above life itself you ought to be dont you dare tell me i ought to be a psychologist how does this connect with margaret pole janes found what she thinks is a forgotten ley line which somebody wants to build across in ledwardine its called colemans meadow were told that margaret poles mother left it to her having apparently said she didnt want it touched i wondered what had made maggie pole change her mind when i heard shed been at the glades i thought if anyone might know something about this it would be you miss white withdrew into her cushioned grotto like some little english guru ah it came out like a tiny puff of white smoke a ley line could that have been what it was about this makes sense she wanted me to contact her mother you mean on the in the land where the dead sit in an eternal garden among eternal fountains discussing trivia and eating fairy cakes wanted me to contact her mother to ask if she was doing the right thing a man kept coming to visit her all too frequently in her last year well you see this all the time you dont have to be here very long to recognize a vulture in a suit he was some relation nephew i listened to pole talking to the inmates sometimes sit in the lounge pretending to be asleep shed ramble on about how worried she was that he was going to have to give up his farm the last farm in a farming family for umpteen generations falling prices imports the usual problems i was thinking what does he want from her maybe a piece of land that he knew he could sell for a lot of money for housing which shed promised not to sell yes on which basis i think he wanted her to give him the land as a way of saving his farm trying to persuade her it was futile to preserve it as i dont know some sort of memorial do you know what kind of memorial lol shook his head rather intriguing pole used to talk of her mother as some frightfully elevated creature with aesthetic sensibilities far beyond those of her slug of a husband perhaps shed met a lover in that meadow that would be nice wouldnt it pole never told me but she came to you eventually a dilemma said she was sure the last thing her mother would have wanted was for her grandson or whatever he was to lose everything keeping her awake at nights well you know how old people dwell on these things so yes in the end after much heartsearching she came to me and what did you do oh we had a seance great fun most of the old dears were absolutely terrified they do so love to be terrified and then cardelow appeared in the middle of the proceedings like some great dollop of rancid ectoplasm and broke it up and did you of course i didnt never been drawn to necromancy well not in that way the seance was a sham my attitude was to take the path of least resistance if poles mother was such an elevated soul shed hardly be worried about the loss of one field obvious way to go was for pole to keep her promise not to sell it in her lifetime and simply agree to leave it to the sod i said an angel in grecian attire appeared to me in a dream and passed on that little snippet so um the fate of colemans meadow is probably your fault i suppose it is yes but you know robinson miss white smiled sweetly we really arent meant to have much of an effect and i suppose well never find out what mrs pole knew about the significance of that field what does the girl think is significant jane she thinks it more or less holds the secret soul of the village it connects the church and a few other sites with cole hill which jane thinks is the villages holy hill like dinedor is to hereford shes at a an intense age a perceptive age miss white said although they often need assistance in decoding their perceptions what are yours oh i just think a particular councillor has a stake in it hmm miss white kicked off her slippers she wore a black bow around one ankle there is a niece you know elizabeth kington kingsley who got the money and the memories in two suitcases she came to collect them i made a point of beckoning her over i said protect the memory as if i knew what i was talking about she knew who i was or thought she knew what i was she said if you get any more messages oh dear and left me her address i have it somewhere yes that might not once had athena white stopped looking at lol or through him eyes like miniature fairy lights if he hadnt been feeling so empty inside it might have been disconcerting what else she said come on robinson you must make the most of me before im called away to spend whole aeons in atonement what ails you cant get it up something like that lol said all the time in the worlds gomers kitchen was this cheerful but fading memorial to minnie full of bright shiny literal objects like biscuit tins with biscuits printed on the side in crumbly brown letters the letters on the bread bin were badly worn time after time when jane looked up she read bread as dead even gomer seemed jittery unsteady around six he agreed to go and monitor the situation at colemans meadow and jane switched on her mobile to check the answering service couldnt put it off any longer supposed if it was all too heavy to handle followup calls from jerry isles threats from mum she could always pretend shed left the phone at home didnt remember the last time shed felt this low this useless where the hell are you eirion was demanding on voicemail were getting masses of emails referred from the ema site have you any idea at all whats going down here she called him back she told him she knew exactly what was going down told him about pierce how shed played it all wrong couldnt restrain herself ended up shafting lol the meadow eirion said whats happening at the meadow fenced off jane told him about the ragged protest and how terrible she felt that she hadnt been there supporting them but she didnt dare show her stupid notorious face and at least it sounded like it was all over for tonight over eirion said i dont think so they got the police in im dead in the water irene i havent been to school again im stuffed disgusted at how she must sound how waily im probably going to have to leave as from like now get a job or something grow up you know hed been talking shed only halfheard the deathroad society of antwerp conservers of coffin tracks in the low countries particularly pissed off their chairman ronald verheyen all right jane sat down im sorry what are you on about eirion laid it out for her if alfred watkins wasnt much honoured in his home town it looked like there were thousands of people all over the world to whom he was some kind of minor deity and earthmysteries geeks and landscape anoraks from the us canada australia germany wherever were now blasting herefordshire council with electronic hatemail far as eirion could make out just about every department in the authority planning health chief executives trading standards theyd all been getting it its somehow got tied into the whole international green politics thing these guys are picking up email addresses wherever they can find them apparently individual councillors have even been targeted at home how do you know all this because the ema have had an approach from the councils lawyers jesus jane if the council hated you before irene jane swallowed youre joking arent you she felt hot and swollen all over like shed invaded a wasps nest and been multistung gomers phone started ringing just as he came in and he hooked it from the wall by the fridge gomer parry plant hire yere the ema guy says if it gets too hot hell have to pull the story eirion was saying i mean they havent got any lawyers or any money not to speak of but its too late anyway now its been picked up by the general media you watching midlands today i dont want to know well i cant see it either in wales but i gather i dont care oh shit irene this explains pierce what do i do just keep your head down i suppose id come over and try and take your mind off it but its gwennans birthday and dads got this surprise party where we all have to pretend nobody speaks english hers on the mobile right now boy gomer said into the phone i get her to call you back jane said ill call you back irene clicked him off and went over to secondarysmoke gomers ciggy all right gomer said will do boy handed the phone to jane lol look what pierce said before i didnt doesnt matter lol said im over that it doesnt get to me any more can you write something down the very fact that he knew instantly what she was talking about showed he was far from over it jane made scribbling motions to gomer and he brought her a pen and a receipt book with gomer parry plant hire billheads lol said that if she and gomer wanted to get out of the village for a while there was a woman they could check out it might be something or nothing lol said she needed to be polite thanks where are you im still at the glades im bad news today lol nothing works out for me cant you do it no im i think im getting into something else lol said his voice sounding disconnected like he was with someone or his mind was already working on the something else sholto lol folded up his mobile i think that was his name frightfully goodlooking essence of ronald colman athena was gazing wistfully into a corner of the room so few of us remember ronald colman any more even here i bet they all remember sholto though lol said we needed him robinson as i think i told your paramour at the time who among the living could we attract any more the alleged haunting of the glades as described by merrily had involved a languid shadow on the landing blown bulbs hadnt there been a smell of cigarette smoke the flicking of a lighter the point being lol said that sholto had no history at the glades he was just a face from an old photo album someone whose image youd somehow contrived to appropriate and insinuate into peoples consciousness what fun he was though but he was a a product of persuasion if you say so oh come on athena well its all so devalued now she looked cross the techniques of projection used to be frightfully effective but since that annoying young man on the television derren somebodyorother brown derren brown yes little twerp makes a point of insisting that its all psychology and suggestion because it makes him look cleverer and the whole business less metaphysical and out of his control deserves a good spanking can i describe something to you why not athena stretched like a small cat purple claws extended i have all the time in the worlds still unsure where he was going with this lol told her about tim loste and sir edward elgar and wychehill im afraid its a very very different situation athena said shed made some fragrant earl grey tea they drank it out of small china cups the teapot had a tarot symbol on it the hanged man dangling from a tree by one foot you see this place is ideal for it athena said old women living for much of the time inside their own heads inside their distant memories hothouse of hopeless fantasies frightfully easy to insinuate an image and how exactly would you beyond that athena lifted both palms im revealing no tradecraft except to say that it soon begins to generate its own energy now the village youre describing seems far from a hothouse if the dwellings are well separated and the residents have little in common and dont mix socially hopeless it was only an idea lol said i was just being a little helpmate athena squealed robinson you infuriate me she is a lowly parish priest in the church of england halfbaked miserably unfocused spiritually stagnant and led by a dithering welshman who thinks that looking like an old testament prophet is half the battle now sit down i havent finished athena white stood up plumped out her cushions and curled up again in the window seat youve intrigued me now mentioned elgar now there s a man with problems repressed frustrated trapped for much of his life inside petty conventions and constraints a spirit yearning for a freedom which he was foolish enough to think was only granted to children do you know the wand of youth piece he wrote when young himself about children and fairyland only read about it he kept trying to revive it at various times as if he could rediscover the oneness with nature that he believed he had possessed as a child now if you were to ask me if edward elgar could be summoned back to his beloved hills i would say that it was quite conceivable that much of him never left in other words athenas head came forward like a tortoises from its shell she seemed quite excited a man who indeed might haunt not what lol had wanted to hear he watched athena placing both her hands on top of her head as if to prevent significant thoughts from fluttering away like butterflies elgars biographers you see tend to be terribly highbrow music buffs with too much academic credibility to lose his esoteric side is usually glossed over youve read the biographies robinson i spend at least seven hours a day reading ive also known several people some of them in this very mausoleum who met him when young not always the most delightful of experiences im afraid he could be a rather negative presence someone said manicdepressive there you go again with your silly psychiatric generalizations stop it sorry what did you mean by his esoteric side lol was feeling confused everybody seemed to have a piece of elgar and all of them with jagged edges he was a kind man an inconsiderate and selfobsessed man he was arrogant he was insecure he was a nononsense selfmade practical man and he was a mental case he was a patriot and he was an artist resentful of the taint of patriotism he was a staunch catholic and yet he was like so many prominent figures of his time drawn to the otherwordly athena said fond of ghost stories is what the books usually say but it was clearly more than that his intermittent catholicism was never enough to satisfy his curiosity what do you know about the hermetic order of the golden dawn top peoples magical club lol said aleister crowley w b yeats they all began there certainly yeats was prominent in it and elgar worked with yeats but his favourite was algernon blackwood did the music for blackwoods play the starlight express and the music contained elements of the wand of youth about children and the otherworld bit of a disaster but they had fun blackwood was a likeable cove met him once at my uncles house my uncle thomas was a latterday member of the gd left me all his secret papers which was what started me off i suppose athena smiled at the memory lol drank what remained of his earl grey but elgar wasnt a member of the golden dawn was he i think he might well have joined if it hadnt been for his wife and her topdrawer conservative family alice to whom he owed so much fortunately however alice liked blackwood and blackwood liked alice she wrote in her diary of the out of the world conversations elgar had with blackwood blackwood athena pursed her lips i may have read one of his stories once lol said when i was a kid the haunted and the haunters very scary no that was bulwerlytton ah there you see elgar liked his stories too was said to have based one of his piano pieces on a novel of bulwerlyttons oh robinson how intriguing what is happening here i dont know im trying to think athena pressing fingertips to her temples yes now blackwood wrote a strange novel about music the human chord its about a group of people singers brought together by a retired clergyman to intone the constituent notes in an archaic mystical chord that will allow them to sound the secret names of god and thus draw down immense power from the heavens its a mad romantic book but as with all blackwoods fiction was drawn from his personal experience in this case with the golden dawn now athena rose and went to one of the floortoceiling cupboards when she opened it up lol saw that its sagging shelves were bulging with books athena knew what she was looking for however and brought it back to her window seat were looking at plato and of course pythagoras and probably some forgotten ancient egyptian before that were looking at a time when music was not a branch of the arts but a medium of construction the construction of the universe itself pythagoras saw an exquisite mathematical harmony in the universe and the harmony was held together by music music was formed upon strict laws music was the law can you comprehend any of this im trying lol wondered what time it was if jane and gomer had gone to find margaret poles niece if merrily keep going athena he said oh i could go on all night and all through tomorrow but i think what you need to know is that the planets were said to vibrate and respond to one another in a musical sequence the music of the spheres youve heard the term lol nodded but i always imagined that as a poetic metaphor it is a metaphor like all these images for an internal process as above so below a connection between our inner selves and god forged through the power of music this was studied in some depth by the golden dawn and blackwood used some of what hed learned there in the human chord blackwood being a writer first and foremost rather than a true seeker after cosmic consciousness a romantic if you like like elgar absolutely like elgar and for blackwood not to have seized the opportunity to discuss what hed learned about the origins of music with the most famous composer in the land is well so unlikely as to be not worth consideration lol said the play musical whatever that elgar and blackwood worked on you said it was called the starlight express the house where winnie sparke tim lostes mentor lives at wychehill is called starlight cottage athena white squeaked in delight starlight as it happens was elgars nickname for blackwood they used nicknames as a kind of code theres a letter lol said in the wychehill parish records from someone signing himself starlight suggesting wychehill as a highly suitable place for a church because no area of southern britain was more conducive to the to the creation and performance of the most spiritually exalted music does that make any sounds like something blackwood would write and if he signed himself starlight he could only have been addressing elgar the letters to sirius the dog star athenas eyes glittered yes elgar was frightfully fond of dogs that would make absolute sense oh robinson i wonder i wonder athena began leafing through the book shed brought from the cupboard a fairly slim hardback with a plain green cover called city of revelation i think where this brings us she said softly is to the whiteleafed oak the one per cent syd spicer looked like a priest feeling unwelcome in his own church and uncomfortable or was she imagining this in his own cassock so hes out right spicer looked pale few people in the current weather looked pale regiment men always getting dispatched to sunkissed hellholes never did only their wives that was the standing joke in hereford foolproof way of recognizing an sas man suntanned bloke pale wife he was released this morning without charge merrily said but i gather they havent lost interest in him who could but for some reason he looked relieved merrily sniffed the air he burns incense in here not when im here he doesnt but yeah who else or winnie he sat down in one of the choir stalls looking down the aisle with distaste its got to end what has i dont like this church much have i indicated that a few times sometimes theres a peculiar energy in here you can feel it on your skin abrasive like on a cold morning when youve cut yourself shaving and sometimes you can still smell the incense when loste hasnt been in for days merrily looked around with the afternoon sunlight in free fall through the diamondpaned windows it was like being inside a great stone lantern somethings needed doing for a while but i couldnt do it spicer said couldnt do what what you do maybe thats another reason i called you last weekend maybe i couldnt admit it to myself but something needs sorting here she sat down next to him you trying to make me feel worthwhile or something syd he was still gazing down the nave his eyes like currants she could feel him becoming quiet the screensaver routine she looked at him saying nothing trying to be as still as he was but she couldnt manage it its a technique he said thats all makes me look heavy on nodding terms with minor seraphim im just a fuckedup old soldier merrily and coming into the church was a mistake i cant hack it what spicer pulled a box of matches out of his cassock followed by a packet of cigarettes he flipped it open offered it to merrily she blinked were erm in church dont go spiritually correct on me merrily you think he cares its smoking not sex youre right but i dont think i will right now all the same fair enough he lit up the striking match a sacrilegious gasp he stretched out his legs in the direction of the central aisle watching the smoke float up and dissipate at pulpit level at the core of the special air service theres a harsh kind of mysticism kind you wont find in any other area of the armed forces connected with survival i used to think survival was ninety per cent training and preparation nine per cent luck and one per cent one per cent something you could call on when you were at breaking point i can imagine the closer you get to merrily shut up she didnt know how could she possibly know im not gonna tell you when and where this happened to me syd said but theres always one time when it all drops away all your training and your discipline and your insides turn to water at first youre just afraid of dying not death dying the way its gonna happen the fear of of fear itself i suppose of giving in to fear of dying in it dying as someone who you can only despise and when youre suddenly confronted with that sorry person with the sight and the smell of your own terror thats a big gaping moment merrily she nodded she kept quiet they didnt know one another not at all all they had in common was the one per cent so i started to pray spicer said prayed the way those poor buggers probably prayed when they jumped off the twin towers out of the flames merrily nodded and something happened not a flashoflightning kind of thing just a bloke behaving in a way he wouldnt normally behave in the circumstances and me finding a sudden unexpected strength i wont go further into it except i thought afterwards i can respect this a source of strength infinitely greater than your trainings ever gonna give you and in the regiment trainings all to a level of aptitude and precision that you believe makes you equal to anyone any one but in that moment the one per cent had become a hundred per cent and i suppose it still is yes what ill admit to being good at syd spicer said is helping the dying having been there very close twice i can find them strength i know theres gonna be help for them and i can take the weight off just enough for them to feel it the way you help your mates in a shit situation so the dying theyre the only people i tell exactly what happened at my times times and places nothing concealed its me passing on something precious and they value it and i think they take it with them syd merrily said how on earth can you say you cant hack it because i could do that without being a priest the phone was ringing when lol got home he caught the call just before the machine lifted it lol dan sorry from much cowarne sorry out of breath me too i expect by the end of the night look when you talked to mr levin did you know something was about to happen like what just had a call from tim im glad to say they let him out did you know id heard but i dont know much more than that reason he was calling im one of the three coordinators of the choirs i told you about the three choirs who did the three churches simultaneously you did ok well theres a pool of about sixty of us right three coordinators who can each pull twelve compatible choristers together at short notice twelve out of twentys usually a safe bet tim called me about half an hour ago theyre trying to arrange redmarley and little malvern priory to join in with wychehill again another simultaneous chant when tonight like we did before only longer it has to last somehow from nine tonight until three am luckily its saturday tomorrow why thats what im ringing for lol i wondered if you knew he wont tell you he never tells you he rambles he gets incoherent you stop asking because you think maybe he doesnt know the answer anyway but it dont matter you know youre gonner get something out of it bit of a coincidence though ennit i dont know honestly you going to be able to organize it in time wont be too much of a problem dan said after last time nobodys going to want to miss it even the ones who went home scared a priest could go through his entire career without facing this kind of situation that was the irony of it not a lot frightens me i can deal with most physical pain emotional pain stress i can achieve separation from the weakness of the body but there are leaps i cant make aspects i cant face youre worried by the nonphysical syd leaned back and took a deep pull on his cigarette samuel dennis spicer he said church of england because you cant resist it overpower it slot it is that what you mean samuel dennis spicer church of england merrily smiled you talked about any of this to winnie sparke winnie hed been about to bring the cigarette back to his mouth he brought his arm down why would i theyre saying in wychehill that youre seeing a lot of her told you he leaned his head back over the choristers stall didnt i you told me about the ladies of wychehill i assisted winnie sparke with her researches into the origins of the church parish records and a few other things anything else he squeezed out the cigarette between finger and thumb anything else my wife really wouldnt like your in essence stories of our separation are overstated having three parishes can be an advantage merrily you go missing for a while they all think youre in one of the others fiona took the kids down to reading to get away from a difficult situation we have a house and her familys down there so it seemed expedient i go down every week or we meet somewhere yesterday it was in berkshire hungerford that works separation shes used to that least im less likely to get killed as a clergyman seemed easier to let people think wed split otherwise thered be three restless parishes wondering how long before the new guy but why didnt you why didnt you just leave go for a new because i was sent here never yet failed to complete a mission one way or another like god was his field commander but obviously merrily understood and the difficult situation that would be drugs partly emilys been a problem shrinks say she has an addictive personality as a kid she overate you tried to cut down the mars bars to three a day tantrums cold turkey on mars bars you believe that with adolescence it stopped all the weight dropped away and we were so relieved that it was quite a while before we realized whatd replaced it the shoplifting conviction was a clue then robbing the offertory box she was in rehab joyce told you all this i assume joyce the parish talkingnewsletter and then the royal oak changed hands merrily said and suddenly it was all on your doorstep like a sweetshop yeah theres a group of us countywide parents of kids with drug problems we attend briefing sessions with the police regional seminars we learn what to look out for like roman wicklow did you know about him suspected but you didnt tell the police one man with a rucksack spicer snorted take wicklow out of the picture and theres another one in place by next week in a different beauty spot better the devil you know if theyd arrested him he couldve fingered others his sort dont finger people what about raji khan merrily said raji khan he looked almost amused is a very clever boy somebody like me says a word against him its like the crusades are back i must be starting a holy war anyway not your problem your problems more ethereal its my problem too but weve been into that what are you asking me to do your requiem should be broadened i was thinking a wider brief for a start you might give this place some attention what are you trying to lose longworth for a start i dont know what his problem was but i reckon st dunstans only compounded it you look at the records you find that what existed on this site could have been no more than a single monks cell a celtic hermits primitive stone hut so he builds a pseudocathedral look spicer sprang up walked into the nave pointing out empty stone ledges blank areas of wall when i first came there were terrible pictures on these walls of saints and angels figurines in niches merrily looked around light oak furniture a marbled font he was right there was little of the period clutter that even churches less than a century old accumulated theyre in storage none of them great works of art no treasure phoney highchurch iconography reeking of hierarchy grotesque to me forbidding like that hideous angel on longworths tomb when we had one small statue nicked i talked the parish council well preston devereaux into safeguarding the rest he didnt need much encouraging his family always found upper wychehill an intrusion his grandfathers on record as having attempted to stop longworth building youve virtually stripped the place best we could bit by bit over a period theyre all newcomers here nobody missed anything but i didnt get rid of it its as if its built into the stone what is longworths grandiose concept longworth himself he brought something here thats caused an imbalance this church is disproportionate to its surroundings and to the community its a big stone egotrip and its like the houses are hiding away from it below the road over the road squeezing into the rocks it explains a lot about wychehill i found a journal kept by one of my predecessors thirty forty years ago even then the population was unstable people buying and selling coming and going syd spicers voice was crisp and carried across the body of the church with hardly an echo whatever you thought about joseph longworth hed known who to consult about acoustics i know a bit about geology spicer said rockclimbing used to be my specialist skill i was an instructor some of the time so i know about rock theres a small fault through wychehill did you know that i mean the whole of the malverns that was volcanic but a long time ago the shifts in this area theres been more recent action here i say recent eighteenth nineteenth centuries a history of earthmovement and then quarrying merrily followed him down the central aisle no wonder winnie sparke says the hills are in pain shes not a stupid woman syd spicer said she gives you all this fey stuff but thats her screen if you think shes more gullible than you are you start to lose your inhibitions tell her more than you intended to c winchester sparke former professor of anthropology back in the us did you know that yes specializing in ancient history comparative religion philosophy anthropology smart woman dont be fooled we had a serious talk about this once her theory is that the whole of the malvern range was one huge ritual site because it was so volatile people didnt live here they came here to experience transcendence to have visions thats the pagans and the early christians the hermits in their cells and their caves like in tibet presumably thats not the point of christianity though is it thats smoke smoke and incense wasnt longworth supposed to have had a vision i have a theory about that spicer sat down on the edge of a pew well its not my theory but it fits you mess around on volatile rocks on operations or just on exercises and you become aware of occasional phenomena linked particularly to fault lines and places where the earths crust has been been disrupted lights usually balls of light youve seen it couple of times its like ball lightning might have been ball lightning gets people excited about ufos but its natural i think the ministry of defence knows about it i think thats what longworth saw preston devereaux says the story is that longworth saw the angel of the agony in a blaze of light which presumably is why theres a representation of it on his tomb id go for just the blaze of light is there any actual record of what longworth believed he saw did he ever describe it if he did it wasnt around this locality maybe he told elgar its all smoke merrily and id like to get rid of it starting with the music im sorry which music lostes music his lush extravagant choral works its become clear to me that thats part of the problem its not the place for music like that and certainly not the place for experiments i know what youre saying and it was odd merrily thought that a man inclined towards a blanket rejection of the numinous should be saying it i think youre saying that for sacred music to be effective it needs a strong working spiritual foundation an abbey a cathedral like the difference between a puddle and a well and if youre being literal about that the wychehill well disappeared with the quarrying spicer shrugged i might be wrong if i am but i thought about it all the way back from berkshire and it was the only conclusion i could reach which means that as from next week tim loste and his choir can go and look for a new home you mean youre evicting him im within my rights as priest in charge i checked whats more i think its for his own good hes being drawn into an unhealthy fantasy when are you going to tell him ive already told him merrily i went in the back way from the rectory while you were talking to winnie sparke i told him there were probably dozens of other churches and halls that would be overjoyed to have him and the choir i said he might want to think about moving that this place wasnt good for his health that mustve sounded like a threat not the way i put it i assure you what did he say he said he said he didnt know how he was going to tell winnie syd god almighty no wonder spicer had needed a cigarette shell go completely bloody berserk this whatever shes trying to reach through loste this has become the central focus of her life merrily if the central focus of her life is producing a bestselling book on the secret source of elgars inspiration well she can do that anywhere cant she im not sure she can not the way she sees it and im not sure thats the entire she needs to get out of here too the quicker the better out of the area what are you saying spicer stood up and stepped out of the pew and of course this had to be done before sunday evening oh i see jesus syd you have a problem with that you mean so that on sunday evening we can solemnly invite god to wipe away every last taint of longworth and lostes brand of anglocatholicism think about it it makes sense he walked towards the main doors maybe you should stay for a few minutes on your own get the feel of the place merrily sat down in a pew the confluence of at least three sunbeams spicer probably didnt want them to be seen leaving together people might talk what a total bloody it wasnt quite a sectarian isssue but it was close she wondered if hed served with the sas in northern ireland and something had left a bad taste no that was ridiculous his decision to stop the choral singing could be justified purely on the basis of what theyd said about puddles and wells but there was already a bad taste in her own mouth and spicer still hadnt told her everything he knew of course merrily was sure of that part four on our hillside night after night looking out on our illimitable horizon ive seen in thought the soul go up and have written my own hearts blood into the score edward elgar from a letter for some it is the living on after the action that requires the final reserves of courage tony geraghty who dares wins the special air service to the gulf war the planthire code jane thought there are still women like this my husbands out shed said you should really come back when my husbands in it was a detached bungalow on an estate on the wrong side of hereford not that there was a right side any more with all the roadworks connected with the building of new superstores that nobody wanted except lyndon pierce and his powercrazed mates taken jane and gomer most of an hour just to get here and jane wasnt planning on moving without some answers mrs kingsley its you i wanted to talk to if thats all right mrs kingsley was a tiredeyed woman in an apron sixtyish with a resigned sort of look she didnt seem like a guardian reader but i dont really understand what you want she said as i say my husband deals with our finances ok wrong approach stupid to say it was about her inheritance stupid to try and sound mature and official shouldnt have nipped home to change out of the school uniform start again my names jane watkins and im doing a project for for school im a you know a schoolgirl oh mrs kingsley looked happier which school is that erm moorfield its near yes i know it i had a nephew there well i probably hes a bank manager now in leominster now what did you want to know again well its this project on on my greatgrandfather alfred watkins you know who i mean he was a county councillor and a magistrate back in the s and mr watkins mrs kingsley smiled at last and nodded and came down from her front doorstep yes i know about mr watkins and his photography and his ley lines and he was she looked suddenly uncertain your greatgrandfather oh no sorry jane did some rapid arithmetic i always get this wrong great greatgrandfather it takes me ages to trace it back through the generations were all over the place now you know the watkinses jane glanced back at gomer sitting at the roadside in the old us army jeep he was driving now hed said he probably wouldnt be much use not knowing mrs kingsley only her late aunt of course it was my grandmother knew mr watkins not me mrs kingsley said im not that old my grandmother you see was very well connected that was what i was always told although i was quite small when she died i imagine she couldve told you some marvellous stories about mr alfred watkins really well that thats what i heard jane said you see we live in ledwardine yes thats where my aunt and all the main people in ledwardine told me the person i couldve spoken to if i wanted to know about alfreds connections with the village was mrs pole do you know mr bulldavies james bulldavies absolutely james said mrs pole was erm he said she was a real lady oh she was im so glad mr bulldavies remembers her they all do mrs kingsley ted clowes the senior churchwarden ted said jane you want to be sure and get mrs pole into your project and her family which erm could eventually be published of course by the ledwardine local history society so that was what you meant when you mentioned my inheritance mrs kingsley said well it you meant colemans meadow mrs kingsley said i think that was what it was called well im afraid i didnt inherit the land dear that was my cousin hes the farmer well yes but as youd probably have known if youd seen the local television news tonight mrs kingsley said where he was interviewed oh shit the reporter did say theyd tried to find the instigator of the protest but you were keeping a low profile although they did have quite a good photograph of you from one of the newspapers just when you thought you were being so smart it was strange though mrs kingsley said that they didnt mention you were the greatgreatgranddaughter of alfred watkins well its not something i talk about mrs kingsley said no i dont suppose you do you silly little girl which was when gomer came over he wasnt even smoking and hed buttoned his tweed jacket gomer parry plant hire handing one of his cards up to mrs kingsley once put in a new soakaway for your auntie but i dont suppose herdve talked about it much at family gatherings for a man of seventyodd he moved fast must have seen janes face folding up and hed been there before she reached the bottom of the steps mrs kingsley stood on the top step holding the card the ambering sunlight flashed from windows all over the estate and boiled in gomers bottle glasses brung janie over on account o the importance o this see good girl means well but her gets a bit emotional takes things to heart gomer took off his cap got herself in a real state over this argybargy missus as you can likely see mrs kingsley looked at the card said faintly plant hire gomer looked solemn it was touching really the words plant hire for gomer represented some old and honourable tradition of saving the countryside from flood and famine bringing mighty machinery to the aid of the needy a planthire code of decency was implied and it shone out of gomers glasses you see much of your cousin gerry gomer said gerry murray lyonshall no ar gomer said what id yeard jane looked at him curious hed had very little to say in the jeep on the way here but gomer knew about the local network its grudges and its feuds and what he didnt know hed find out you know him mrs kingsley said no but i knows of him if you see what i mean standing there with his hands behind his back not pushing it little and lean the cords in his neck like plaited bailer twine gerry knows what he wants and makes sure he gets it mrs kingsley said one way or another yeard that too and your auntie maggie seems to me her was a bit like janie yere worried too much about what was right and what was wrong kind o thing mrs kingsley looked down brushing her apron it was beige with black cats on it my aunt did talk about you once or twice mr parry she said youre making this very difficult for me ar i have some letters and photographs what mrs pole left you you obviously know about them mabbe i was going to offer them to the hereford museum or perhaps the woolhope club gomer looked blank the naturalist and local history club that alfred watkins belonged to jane said it still exists mr watkins was a member yes among other important people the photographs belonged to my grandmother hazel probert i think its what she would have wanted after all this time mrs kingsley looked out over the housing estate you could hear lawnmowers and strimmers and a few children shouting across the estate and another estate on higher ground you could see the top of dinedor herefords own holy hill jane found she was holding her breath after the tv item i brought them down mrs kingsley said on television it didnt look like the same place all that fencing and the signs thats nothing to what itll look like when its covered with executive homes jane said well mrs kingsley said i cant let you take the photographs but i can let you see them i suppose they explain why my grandmother might not have wanted someone like gerry murray to have the meadow of great renown merrily got in and there was nobody there except ethel forking out a tray of felix drifting through to the scullery it felt like weeks since shed last been in here doing ordinary things the answering machine was overfed no longer accepting messages the air was stale and stuffy and there was the rattle and hum of a bluebottle in the window she opened the window sat down at the desk with a bag of crisps and rang lol no answer rang his mobile engaged she needed advice wanted to pray but wasnt sure what shed be asking for shed never felt so confused laying her head on the sermon pad she closed her eyes forget the answers some coherent questions would help despite the open window the bluebottle wouldnt go out as though it was determined to tell her something all the buzzing things that wouldnt go away merrily jerked upright the phone was ringing right next to her ear last birthday jane had bought her another oldfashioned black bakelite phone with a real ring loud and warm and thrilling like the church bells which had once pealed across the land from steeple to steeple to warn of impending invasion she grabbed the phone in a panic something quaking in her chest merrily frannie you all right she shook herself blinking rubbing at her eyes sorry i was i dont know why im calling you really bliss said i didnt plan to i was just tearing through the cid room with no time at all to spare not now no bloody way but a little voice is going ring merrily youre not a man who responds to little voices nah youre right you been listening to the local radio at all today merrily havent even had it on in the car probably afraid of hearing people talking about jane just tell me this isnt about jane not unless shes shot somebody the problem was my grandfather mrs kingsley said it seems mr watkins turned up at the door this day quiet sort of chap my grandma always said according to my mother very polite and could he have a look at their bottom meadow jane clung to an arm of the sofa he came he knew he really knew about the ledwardine ley my grandma was all of a flutter of course that such a man as mr watkins should be calling on the likes of them she was quite young at the time not so very long married theyd all heard of mr watkins quite a public figure by then though not because of ley lines this was when exactly jane asked about i would guess the old straight track hadnt been published im fairly sure of that so not many people knew what it was all about to be told you had an ancient trackway across your land which had been used by stone age people well it didnt mean anything certainly not to my grandfather gomer said hedve likely been in the first world war then your ole grandad yes he was mr parry and came back a different man not the man grandma married my mother used to tell me he just wanted a quiet life surrounded by his own land positively antisocial it wasnt a very big farm even if you included the orchard and he was determined to hold on to it my grandma liked to go to concerts and the plays but he would have none of it wouldnt take a holiday and was suspicious of anyone who appeared on his land particularly someone with strange equipment like mr watkins i expect you can guess what that was jane didnt he sometimes use like surveying tools surveying tools mrs kingsley laughed good heavens he wouldnt have got as far as the gate no his camera that was enough aunt margaret who would have been a very small child at the time thought she remembered some of this but i suppose the details were filled in for her later as she described it mr watkins stood for a while at the field gate then walked the length of the meadow to the other gate near the foot of cole hill and then he came back and he said mr probert would you permit me to take some photographs i suppose his camera was pretty big and on a tripod in those days there werent that many cameras in herefordshire having your photo taken was a big occasion almost ceremonial it was a matter of taking your place in history and you had to look your very best and of course that field didnt despite all grandads efforts it was still poorly drained and thered been floods and so grandad says no absolutely not because it would be a permanent reflection on him you see the state of that field and he was a very proud man mrs kingsley held out a faded sepia photograph of a couple standing in front of a fairly rundownlooking cottage the man wore a tie and a waistcoat and a bowler hat and he wasnt smiling well mr watkins tried his best to explain that the field was very important archaeologically and he wanted to include it in a book and of course this made things worse a book the state of that field preserved for all eternity to be sniggered over by farmers all over the county my grandad took what he believed to be the only reasonable action open to him and respectfully ordered mr watkins to leave his property at once mr watkins appealed to him to think again and said he would call the next time he was passing and he did call again but in the meantime my grandad had been talking to some other councillor who told him not to worry as mr watkinss ideas were nonsense nothing changes does it jane said bitterly mr watkins said please could he just take some photographs if he promised they wouldnt be used in his book or published in any way at all just as evidence of what was but farmer probert im afraid refused to believe him he couldnt get his head round the idea of just taking a photograph and not doing anything with it he didnt think mr watkins would be so wasteful of an expensive plate and he turned the poor man away again of course my grandma was deeply embarassed by now she was as i say quite a refined lady with her books and her windup gramophone not many folks yereabouts had a windup gramophone back then gomer said definitely not mr parry and do you know i think it was that gramophone that saved the day mrs kingsley rose and went over to a sideboard under a framed colour photo of some children and a horse ive done quite a lot of research on all this since it came into my possession as youll see its our familys claim to fame our small place in history gomer looked at her shrewdly wouldnt reckon gerry murray be all that interested in histry nor as hardup as he led my aunt margaret to believe mrs kingsley snorted bringing his accountant to convince her of the parlous state of his finances jane looked at gomer brung his accountant did he missus gomer said mrs kingsley didnt reply she unlocked the top section of the sideboard and took out a stiff parchment envelope mr watkins was always very polite but he was canny i think the word would be the next time he came back it was market day when he knew my grandad would be in town and my grandma would be on her own and this time he had a friend with him she brought the envelope back to the sofa where jane and gomer sat it had a wingclip which she undid a titled gentleman she said of great renown great renown and not only in hereford i should imagine my grandma was practically on her knees when she saw who it was jane said the prince of wales ill show you in a minute but first ill tell you the result of it mr watkins offered her a deal if my grandfather let him take pictures of the meadow for the record hed take some other pictures of grandma and the distinguished gentleman together and he would give her the pictures to keep cool jane thought the man was a true watkins well there was absolutely no way that hazel probert was going to turn mr watkins away certainly not with his distinguished companion and the promise of the souvenir of a lifetime and so the photos were taken that very day while grandad was at the market brilliant jane said and do you know i dont think they were ever shown to him or even mentioned from that day until the day he died she kept them secret for the whole of her life you can imagine her hiding them away in her bottom drawer and only bringing them out when her husband was at market sharing her pride with no one then how and they were only entrusted before she died the week before she died to aunt margaret the eldest daughter her mother thinking she was the only one who would understand mrs kingsley handed the opened envelope to jane jane looked at her hands to make sure that they were clean dont worry i checked when you came in mrs kingsley said well have a cup of tea when theyre safely away again aware that her breathing had become shallow jane carefully slid out the pictures there were four of them in cardboard frames each one protected by tissue paper she was going to be the first outsider to see original and almost certainly historic photos taken by alfred watkins himself she could almost feel him bending over her with his pointed beard and his glasses on the end of his nose she shivered slightly go on mrs kingsley said the first one was a bit faded but like all watkins pictures nice and sharp jane saw a woman she guessed to be in early middle age but could have been younger hard to tell the severe way they had their hair in those days she was dressed in a long skirt and she had a little handbag and a bashful smile and she was standing on the ley the trackway even clearer then than it was now and this this was just everything jane could have wanted incontestable proof that the great alfred watkins had photographed colemans meadow the picture had been taken from the cole hill side with the steeple of ledwardine church soaring above the womans head and the head of the man who jane hadnt really noticed at first quite an ordinarylooking elderly guy seriouslooking with a big white moustache a hairy jacket and a trilby hat jane thought she mightve seen him somewhere before but well she hadnt really expected to recognize him anyway there were two other pictures of the couple and a third taken from the other side the old guy on his own pointing towards cole hill and he was kind of smiling and he hang on gomer jane showed the photo to gomer he scrutinized the picture very carefully holding it up to his glasses then he lowered it slowly bugger me janie thats ole wassisname ennit black vapour trails bliss said it was nothing fancy this one not some rituallooking killing in a beauty spot that annie howe would take away from him for the headlines this is an oldfashioned downhome nasty sordid backstreet i woke you up didnt i im not in bed merrily said i just go on malcolm france fortysix years old independent security adviser know what that means do we minder partly also a private inquiry agent which wasnt attracting enough business for a fulltime occupation so mal did everything from following wives to recommending burglar alarms on commission and guarding the rich or the famous when necessary it was a living its where a lot of us go when they kick us out im sorry frannie i hadnt realized he was an excolleague what happened not a colleague no i knew him but not well all that animosity between cops and private eyes thats for the story books we keep in with them now with an eye to the future he was found early this afternoon back of st owens street broad daylight merrily not a robbery i hate that kind of thing makes me angry a crime committed with never a thought that they arent going to get away with it we think they were even on view two men in white coveralls familiar sight nowadays with all the healthandsafety regulations were seen by a number of witnesses to walk into the building carrying a paint spray nobody saw them come out which suggests that the coveralls were packed away in a case and the fellers who came out were wearing nice suits in hereford that didnt use to happen in hereford did it bliss said merrily heard a car pulling into the vicarage drive the bluebottle was still making hysterical circuits of the window or maybe it was another bluebottle she was very tired of people buzzing her and then flying out of range a key turned in the front door thank god and did you explain why youre ringing me i said it wasnt robbery but we think his laptop had been taken and some disks no sign of case notes or files lying around the office anyway so we got permission from his family to check out his bank accounts discovering that among recent payments was one from a ms cw sparke of wychehill malvern merrilys body jerked the chair legs scraped the thinning carpet thats a surprise then is it bliss said what was he doing for her i dont know all we have is a receipt for including exes winnie sparke paid this man peanuts merrily hed get more than that for finding a lost dog most clients it runs into thousands anyway there it is shes among a dozen or so of his customers were checking out although it may have nothing do with his current business however what do you know about her shes a writer from california but shes lived here quite a few years divorced i was thinking more about her links to our friend mr loste actually she paid for his lawyer and she collected him from worcester nick it might be just a coincidence but its interesting shes working on a book with loste hes probably very important to her career at this stage any indication she might not trust him might want him checked out its possible but unlikely she told me stuff about his origins that she might not have i dont know frannie thats the truth i mean loste even you re thinking loste knifes a man on the beacon and then you did say this was a shooting head and chest pistol looks like the gun got completely emptied into him more enthusiastic than efficient i saw loste go into the church late morning that rule him out hard to say yet you going back to wychehill tonight hope not only therell be some uniforms keeping tabs on tonights young persons social event at the royal oak you havent seen the tv havent seen anything me neither but it seems theres trouble following press and tv items with a bloke called holliday who reckons innercity trash elements have turned his village into an apocalyptic battlefield mr hollidays now saying that hes received personal threats from whom from anonymous supporters of the royal oak presumably its not significant enough to worry us but i thought id pass it on merrily turned at a shadow and saw lol in the scullery doorway they had one anothers keys now well she said if i come across anything dont worry about it its possible that mals murder is linked to his former occupation in which case ill probably be sidelined again look ive gorra go what was his former occupation like a number of local security advisers in this general area who werent formerly in the police until six years ago he was a serving soldier in hereford thereabouts bliss said it was clear that lol had a lot to tell merrily but there were things that needed to be dealt with first fears racing like black vapour trails across an already darkening sky before she could think about any of it there was jane to deal with janes with gomer lol said theyve gone to check out some details about the history of colemans meadow shes ok though shes fine shes with gomer and under the circumstances that s ok i mean gomer has no axe to grind here i im pretty sure its ok all right look thanks for it mustve been ill put the kettle on ill do it need to keep moving there are some things i want to run past you and if you tell me its all crap i just might not go insane merrily filled the kettle and plugged it in the clock said and the light on the creamwashed walls was beginning to weaken i dont know whether you got any of that but bliss is investigating the murder of a security consultant and private investigator who was a former member of the sas as was syd spicer and a few hundred other blokes in this county lol reminded her i was told that spicers marriage had broken up but he tells me today hes just sent his wife and daughter down south while he stays here because he says his mission is not yet over the daughter emily became a serious user in hereford and he was worried about the proximity of the royal oak heroin i dont know he doesnt tell you a lot and although hes with an antidrug group in herefordshire he doesnt involve himself in the campaign by the wychehill residents action group neither does the chairman of the parish council preston devereaux whose eldest son appears to have had similar problems and im told went out with spicers daughter devereaux a man who is conspicuously sitting on a lot of bitterness and rage about the government and the way the countryside gets treated becomes curiously blase when you mention the royal oak it wont last he says raji khan will move on move on is devereauxs favourite expression merrily put tea bags in the pot thinking this out although the antidrugs group works with the police spicer admitted tonight that he suspected roman wicklow was dealing on the beacon and didnt see the point in telling the police ok thats odd lol said so spicer and devereaux two strong selfsufficient arguably dangerous men who know each other well but dont conspicuously hang out together two men in public positions locally who nonetheless keep low profiles youre suggesting they dont trust the police to do a proper job theyve got some vigilante thing bliss thinks raji khan is behind the influx of heroin crack and whatever sells into the market towns bliss suggests that khan with his social position his connections has a bit of a charmed life i met khan this afternoon and just a feeling wondered about a special relationship with annie howe hes very cool far less wary than than spicer for heavens sake i dont know what to say lol paced the flagged floor sas men are well trained in the use of knives to dispose of people without any fuss but wicklow that wasnt exactly discreet was it god merrily said spicers a but you dont really have anything other than conjecture do you nothing at all hes also a priest priests have done worse lol said even in your limited experience well one priest and he wasnt even trained to kill look why not just unload it all on bliss but if it turns out its nothing at all to do with spicer a fellow priest what does that make me cautious how does any of this tie into the killing of this guy in hereford turns out that winnie sparke was one of his clients bliss doesnt know why you have any ideas merrily shook her head but spicer and france had to know each other theyre about the same age they mustve served together well yes but what does that i dont know im just a humble bloody vicar what do i do with this lol do i call bliss back i dont know either lol said but i can give you a very good reason to call winnie sparke a perfect universe this is starlight cottage winnie said who is that this is merrily watkins winnie what do you want when it came to it nobody could do cold better than someone from the sunshine state i wanted to talk to you about the whiteleafed oak merrily said pause whiteleafed oak i dont know what youre talking about im sorry winnie but i think you do merrily said gripping the big bakelite phone for some kind of support whiteleafed oak is a hamlet at the southern tip of the malverns it seems to be the joining point of the three counties worcestershire herefordshire and gloucestershire winnie was silent the three counties that come together every year for what seems to be the worlds oldest music festival the three choirs which although it only officially dates back to the eighteenth century reflects something a lot older i mean the concept of perpetual choirs it had taken most of an hour to become basically conversant with this from the information that lol had picked up from athena white oh god athena white and it was coming up to eight pm and half of the churchyard wall was in shadow at one stage merrily had gone up to janes apartment in search of books which might illuminate the subject coming down with a paperback entitled sound and the shaman and not discovering until shed laid it on the desk in front of lol that it had been published by an american company called taliesin and written by one c winchester sparke the name appearing in small perfunctory lettering under a picture of an irish bodhran drum with feathers attached to its frame one of those books which sold purely on subject and the authors identity was of little significance in the beginning the book began was and is the sound the idea of perpetual choirs seems to have begun as a druidic concept it also seems to link into the theory of the music of the spheres attributed to pythagoras way back before christ in which the planets are believed to resonate according to a musical pattern that maintains celestial harmony a perfect universe merrily paused looking at lol felt like she was in the pulpit lol was nodding the perpetual choirs stop me if you start to lose interest were supposed to have maintained that level of harmony on earth as above so below each choir would have at least twelve members monks in christian times bards or whatever before that singing in shifts so that it never stopped and the choirs were said to have been set up in churches or temples on the perimeters of huge circles in the countryside but where did this idea come from merrily had demanded desperately watching lol spreading out an os map on the carpet a map with black lines and circles drawn on it he had after all obtained the information from athena white a little old woman whom merrily had encountered perhaps twice in those scary early days of deliverance a longretired civil servant with a childs voice and a childs instinctive remorseless cunning a repository of arcane data whod made that intimidating new assignment seem even more like a journey to the centre of the earth merrily had been slightly afraid for the womans soul whereas wary tentative lol could casually approach athena real name anthea it helped to keep reminding yourself of that and emerge enlightened or at least slightly infatuated the musician lit up by this beautiful but possibly apocryphal concept resurrected in the early s in england by the earthmysteries scholar john michell who had suggested that maintaining the perpetual chant was how the druids kept control over the celtic tribes presumably because nobody would risk breaking the sonic connection between heaven and earth and then it was absorbed by christian communities perhaps using gregorian chant and only fragments of knowledge seem to remain apparently it was thought that there were twelve choirs in a circle like a big clock but as i say only fragmentary three choirs twelve choristers the figures one and two adding up to who told you all this winnie sparkes voice was distant as if she was looking away from the phone into space of course you can explain anything with numbers biblical scholars do it all the time but chanting in any religion you can name is designed to induce a higher state of consciousness and something psychological or whatever something certainly seemed to work when tim loste put choirs of twelve into three churches one in each of the three counties two ancient churches and wychehill which was built on an ancient site you did some homework i had help we dont have a record of druidic chant but gregorian chant goes back a long long way and elgar while elgars music is modern it arose from his grounding in the catholic church and i think much of it was nurtured and developed by the three choirs festival the festival rotates among the cathedrals of hereford worcester and gloucester right lol had said all of which are at least medieval obviously loste doesnt have access to cathedrals but littleused ancient parish churches are easier and the three he chose are roughly equidistant to whiteleafed oak where the counties converge and theres more over the years elgar wrote a lot of music for the three choirs i believe merrily said having been connected with the festival since i understand the age of nine or if you want to be esoteric about it that would be three times three listen winnie sparkes voice was higher now and sounding satisfyingly abraded i dont have time for this right now you keep saying that you dont understand i have to go collect tim where from his selfdefence class goddamn you merrily im sorry that was you have something planned for tonight dont you choirs singing in the three counties from nine pm till three am is that because this is the last chance youll get to approach what you that your doing winnies voice was like cracking ice getting us kicked out of the church no of course it isnt it had already happened when i merrily waited the big phone clammy against her ear ok listen winnie said i spend all of friday and saturday evenings with tim when the royal oak starts up hell go crazy else i get down there well before dark and sometimes we have to get out of wychehill we go we go someplace like whiteleafed oak merrily said was that where you sent tim when the parish meeeting was on in wychehill why cant you just leave us alone i wish i could but i cant why cant you because nobody tells me the whole truth and when so much is being hidden sometimes things have to be hidden you stupid woman for the sake of preservation i didnt mean that this is so difficult so easy for the cops but a priest had no right to demand answers and you were on shaky ground even asking questions malcolm france merrily said do you know about that who malcolm france was found dead this afternoon at his office in hereford two seconds of silence almost sizzling on the line what are you doing winnie screamed why are you lying why are you giving me this shit france was murdered he was shot repeatedly im sorry if winnies breathing was turning to panting i want to help merrily said i would like to help you and then she kept quiet not wanting to give away how little she knew france was killed in his office listen this is crazy that was a personal thing nobody was supposed to i got fucking human rights and this was a terrible mistake how could merrily possibly know about winnie being a client of frances if winnie chose to push this it would rebound heavily on bliss winnie said who else knows this probably half the county its been on the radio no the oak the oak just me and my friend lol who you met last monday night the guy you thought was the exorcist ok listen winnie sparke said you wanna talk about all of this well meet you well meet you there in an hour give me time to talk to tim well meet you there but you have to promise to leave us when i say before nightfall ok sure ok park where you can and go through the fivebar gate and keep walking you wont miss it nobody could wont miss what its about the only goddamn place i feel safe winnie one hour where the oak neighbours gomer and jane drove to the east of the city down the deep shadow of st owens street with its heavy brooding shirehall where two police cars and a van were parked small town see janie gomer said when they stopped at the lights calls itself a city but it ent like worcester and gloucester small town out on its own on the border even smaller back in the s so everybody of a particlar class knowed each other and them bein neighbours for years it could make a difference jane said couldnt it in ledwardine mabbe but mabbe not dont get your hopes up still dont prove that ole lines any moren a bit of a sheep track yes but now we can show that alfred watkins knew about it and it was really important to him and he wasnt the only one dunno girl comes down to it its just a couple ole boys helpin each other out they rattled through the lights to the hampton bishop road where jane had come with eirion the other day in search of alfred watkins this fairly pleasant treeshaded suburb and the river wasnt far away gomer turned the old jeep left into vineyard lane where theyd looked for alfreds house and then they got out into the smell of rich mown grass and walked back to the main road towards the setting sun the big white victorian house was on the corner converted into flats now the usual plaque revealing its historic importance jane hadnt even noticed it the other night with eirion although it had been mentioned a few times in school over the past couple of years plas gwyn the white place for nine or ten years these two men had been close neighbours even if only one of them had been famous at the time it wasnt really janes idea of a nice house although back in edwardian days she supposed it must have looked really modern and flash it had four floors and a verandah it was well functional in those days mrs kingsley had told them there werent many houses around here and plas gwyn had had major views across the river and the water meadows to the black mountains across the border country to wales and elgar had loved the idea of that when newly knighted at the height of his fame hed moved here in with his wife alice and his daughter carice wow mr alfred watkins and sir edward elgar it made total sense that they shouldve been mates elizabeth kingsley had drawn up a chart showing that theyd been almost exact contemporaries elgar had been born in and had died in watkins was born in and died in and so much in common both of them photographers elgar was said to have had a darkroom here at plas gwyn where he also like watkins invented things both of them members of the woolhope club both them fascinated by the landscape and most of elgars hereford years had been kind of slow and uninspired where music was concerned he hadnt composed much here at all mrs kingsley said leaving him time to spare for his other interests the council in search of some reflected glory had even offered to make him mayor of hereford but hed politely and wisely in janes view turned it down jane remembered mrs waters the art teacher at moorfield talking about this when the elgar sculpture was being planned for the cathedral green and how elgar got disillusioned because although he was this megaceleb he thought nobody really understood his music elgar at low ebb in hereford just as the great revelation was coming to sixtyish alfred watkins billowing towards him across the humpy fields in great waves of vision of course by the time the old straight track was published elgar had left this house but he loved the city mrs kingsley had said and he was always coming back to stay especially when the three choirs festival was held here used to meet his old friends like the playwright george bernard shaw who was always trying to encourage elgar to get back into some serious composing after the death of his wife in so he and alfred watkins stayed in touch obviously sure tbe gomer said jane getting a picture in her head of these two elderly guys alf and ed standing on dinedor hill with the citys churches aligned below them in the vastness of the oldgold evening the air filling with ancient energy and orchestral murmurings alf going bit of a problem dye see best ley i ever found and i ent allowed to go in there with my camera something i could help with you think old chap ed tilting his head to one side people seem to think a lot of me these days for all the wrong blasted reasons of course well mabbe alfs beard splitting into a slow grin mabbe you could too its weird gomer jane said how things happen kind of simultaneously mums into this ridiculous situation over at malvern where some people think that like elgars ghost has returned she stood on the pavement in front of plas gwyn and checked for messages on the mobile jane im so sorry mum sounded upset what ive come home and obviously theres a lot we need to only ive got to go out again with lol shouldnt be too late could you stay with gomer please the sun was dropping like a great molten weight into wales and the air was warm and airless janes bare arms for some reason were tingling the lesson there was at first a cramped deadend kind of feel as they edged out of the volvo merrily had had to squeeze it onto a rough verge one wheel partly overhanging a ditch might be somebodys parking place but there was nobody about in the hamlet of whiteleafed oak to ask a few bungalows cottages and nowhere to park because the lane was so narrow but it was wooded sundappled intimate it didnt have the wideviewed isolation of wychehill locking the volvo merrily could hear a radio from an open window and there was a small trampoline and a yellow bike in one of the sloping front gardens whiteleafed oak was livedin the sun was burning low in a sky like tarnished brass the air was heavy and humid and the only sacred sound was placid evening birdsong merrily looked around there were no directional signs no indication of where to find whatever was to be found lol opened out the os map on the bonnet of the volvo there were several pencil lines drawn on it one of them lengthways more defined than the others this is what jane found a northsouth line along the spine of the range touching all these hills midsummer hill hangmans hill pinnacle hill perseverance hill north hill on or at least close to their summits cutting along the side of herefordshire beacon and passing through wychehill church you cant fault the alignment merrily admitted not without a bigger map anyway and if we extend the line south lol continued it with a thumb we can see that it begins at whiteleafed oak obvious when you know lol said is this a ley line i dont know most of these are natural features but they were probably all ritual sites or part of one huge ritual site merrily said moel bryn the sacred malverns she was quite glad to see whiteleafed oak marked on the map didnt even recall seeing any road signs pointing to it although it was only a few miles out of ledbury past the eastnor castle estate and into a twisting singletrack lane this was a place you would never find by accident nor particularly search out nearby villages like eastnor and eastwood were picturesque in the traditional sense whiteleafed oak was not lol folded up the map better find this place before it gets any darker still be light enough to find your way park where you can and go through the fivebar gate and keep walking which fivebarred gate merrily opening out her hands over there along there its apparently the hamlet itself which marks the point at which the three counties merge nothing obvious here not even a church only a possible druidic processional way this was what athena white had told lol although she hadnt been here in many years the fact that theyd been directed here by athena white was why merrily was wearing under her thin sweatshirt her pectoral cross why shed slipped a pocket bible into her jeans and taped to the volvos dash the text as if she could ever forget it of st patricks breastplate merrily said what on earth happened here thinking and why didnt i know about it with the hamlet of whiteleafed oak out of sight nearly half a mile behind them she was standing on what might have been might still be a processional way looking around in the calm of the evening finding that the place was instantly familiar and perceptibly strange familiar because of wellknown landmarks like the stone obelisk projecting like a stubby pencil from eastnor park in herefordshire and may hill in western gloucestershire identifiable from the black mountains to the cotswolds by the stand of pines on its summit at the tail of the malverns three counties were drawn together by landmarks and legend the closer countryside was scabbed with odd mounds before it scrolled out into low hills woods and copses and isolated clumps of conifers all of it textured like velvet in the softening light and it was strange because none of this seemed random it was as though each feature of the landscape had a special significance a role to play in some eternally unfolding drama and if they carried on walking into the arena and it did feel like an arena theyd be given their own parts to play perhaps this was the great lesson to be learned about all of nature although there were only certain spots where you could receive it with any intensity places of oh god wake me up before i turn into jane palpably sentient scenery they were alone in the landscape but as they followed a vague path over a shallow rise the sunset turning flat fields into sandbanks she couldnt lose the feeling that something knew they were coming you wont miss it winnie sparke had said nobody could she was right merrily saw that lol had stopped about twenty paces away as though he was wondering how best to approach it if he should take off his shoes nobody said it was still here his voice quite hoarse nobody said it was still in use merrily said ok it probably wasnt the original one after which the place was named but it had to be many centuries old even without white leaves it had grown into the heart of an earlier belief system which conspicuously lived on there were several other oak trees nearby young satellite churches around this ancient ruinous cathedral venerated merrily said still on a serious scale there was enough veneration to cover several christmas trees but the great oak with its enormous swollen bole had easily absorbed it all offerings ribbons tied to twigs fragments of coloured cloth foil labels with handwritten messages flowers balls of wool tiny intimate symbolic items stuffed into folds and crevices snagged in clawed branches hundreds of them some fresh some decaying some fusing with fungi on the blistered bark small sacrifices people were still coming here now to make small sacrifices immense in the muddied light the oak represented an everyday naked paganism you uncomfortable with this merrily lol walking softly all around the oak considered steps as if he was moonwalking or something i dont know she said i just its very human all these people making their pilgrimages leaving their small offerings in what a celebration of survival she dared to touch the tree with one hand what about you to be quite honest it kind of excites the hell out of me mmm thought it might like you read about ancient theories on music and it seems so remote and theoretical but when you actually find a link with a bit of landscape only an hour or so from where you live and then you come for the first time and its its a tree lol merrily it is so palpably not just a tree well it its certainly the oak in the big picture over tim lostes fireplace im sure of that it was all rolling at her like the ball lightning that spicer had talked about connections forming all the saplings in the pots outside lostes house and the one planted in his garden had they been grown from acorns picked up here descendants of the whiteleafed oak it was as well to keep reminding yourself that the central reason you were here was finally to get to meet tim loste without whom lol stepped back as if the atmosphere was too charged so close to the massive tree you brought a blocked musician to what was alleged to be the most powerful source of musical energy within his ambit you had to expect a certain fascination if a few white leaves appeared on your oak tree it was taken as a sign of major change athena so if there was a tree here that was full of white leaves maybe it was seen as a place where you could find transformation that figures winnies blueprint for tim loste seems to be all about transformation like the dream of gerontius the processing of the soul you mentioned there were some other pictures on lostes walls lol said mostly they were places i didnt recognize hills churches but some were well known stonehenge he said glastonbury she stared at him what the hell else did that woman tell you lol sat down in the grass outside the growing shadow of the oak i didnt want to confuse you with the bigger picture before you rang winnie the three choirs is only the local part of the story im not sure i can handle this merrily sat next to him and he told her his face shining in the blush of evening about the big picture twelve of them a dozen perpetual choirs in southwest britain on the perimeter of a vast circle supposedly their locations including stonehenge glastonbury and llantwit major in south wales site of an ancient monastic college not exactly recorded history poetic history it could be valid but scepticism merrily thought might be safer at this stage if you plot the big circle lol said you find whiteleafed oak is the centre equidistant from stonehenge glastonbury and llantwit the pivot but these stonehenge glastonbury et cetera were the only known sites the only ones actually named in early welsh literature the others have been identified in places like meifod near welshpool llandovery in west wales and goringonthames the word goring comes from cor which means choir so were sitting at the centre of arguably the most important focus of musical energy in britains oldest established culture a culture in which music was not one of the arts part of entertainment but a crucial element in the structure of life an element in religion but also part of science and mathematics and all the more spiritual for that so all these offerings oh i shouldve mentioned that some people visiting the presumed sites of perpetual choirs have said that they can still be heard as a kind of droning like distant bees but then people are impressionable erm just the birds lol said thank god for that so were assuming that elgar knew this place elgar said there wasnt a single lane in worcestershire that he hadnt been down wouldve been an easy walk from birchwood where he was living when he composed caractacus is this his sacred oak look lol stood up and walked down below the tree where guarded by younger oaks there was a depression in the ground a hollow merrily looked down at a charcoal stain near its centre fires were still being lit here worn bits of branches were lying around in the shallow pit like discarded bones so much here suggestive of bone a knobbly outgrowth at the base of the great oak itself was like a big bovine skull with one jagged eye socket everything has its dark side lol said the last segment of sun went into the ground like a household fire collapsing in a shower of bright red sparks so this merrily said is where new age paganism meets high catholicism this very spot the three counties though i mean the three choirs festival is this posh prestigious the sort of thing that sophie attends are we really looking at something distantly descended from some folk memory of pagan chanting the official version is that it was set up as a clerical charity about three hundred years ago religious music performed handel and purcell but who knows be interesting to hear what loste has to say except theyre not here merrily stepping away from the edge of the pit looking all around she said an hour or they might be waiting for darkness lol said according to dan the choirs start at nine until three in the morning would they really be here rather than with one of the choirs maybe loste standing under that tree remotely conducting his three choirs from the centre of the circle maybe well get to see dont build up your hopes between us and him theres sparke the western sky was like dull copper and the air was heavy with stored heat merrily noticed that she and lol were almost whispering as if the oak might be absorbing it all to be replayed to future generations lol said you want to go back to wychehill see if shes around what if they come here while were gone they wont necessarily come the same way we did loste knows the hidden paths ill stay if you like on your own here he shrugged merrily tried to make out his expression but it was too dim now veils of mauve and sepia its less than ten minutes away lol said and weve both got mobiles ill walk with you back to the car and when youre on your way back you call me so i can be waiting for you if they turn up ill call you straight away ok just you know dont do pagan things merrily im not jane i dont even know any pagan things they walked back hand in hand towards the hamlet of whiteleafed oak the night was warm and the air smelled like a wholefood shop only a few weeks to the first hay harvest and that rich caramel scent which merrily would always associate now with the frome valley and the first night shed spent with lol some things were not worth risking theyll come back she told him loste and winnie the songs your songs theyll come back you know they will she looked back at the oak a fat old openair preacher or maybe a conductor the branches like a blurring of arms summoning and gathering in three hundred and sixty degrees of sacred sound the trees are singing my music or am i singing theirs jesus merrily was quite glad to be leaving but not glad that lol was staying in the country after dark travelling back to ledwardine in the opentop jeep the thoughts blowing through janes head were exhilarating and bewildering couldnt wait to tell mum and lol get some idea of where this could take them she was on firm ground at last she could speak out the council guys had made so much of the fact that the colemans meadow ley wasnt in the old straight track now she had proof that watkins had known about it and seen its importance and and so had elgar britains greatest composer this figure of serious international distinction whose involvement nobody could ignore it was just a question of getting one of those incredible pictures photocopied and although they hadnt pushed it at all it had seemed like mrs kingsley was well up for that clearly no love lost between her and murray and this breakthrough was entirely down to gomer ciggy between his teeth glasses like goggles his cap in his lap and his dense white hair like smoke in the dusk driving like he was really concentrating on the road but he was clearly concentrating on something else about three miles from home he slowed this new leisure centre what you reckon o that girl came out of the blue didnt it nobody ever said we needed one mum doesnt know where it came from ah well gomer said where it all d come from i reckon is stu twigg huh he owns the land what the village halls built onherited it off his ole man last year gwyn twigg no had a petrol station over towards monkland supermarket opens up at leominster cheap petrol gwyn shuts down but hes got these bits o ground all over the place worth a good few hundred grand so hes all right ennit when he dies stus in the money lazy bugger though stu twigg calls hisself a mechanic all he does is messes around soupin up ole bangers and scarin the life out o folks in the lanes got him now jane said i think white jaguar thats the boy came round a corner once had irene in the ditch hes insane not insane enough he dont know the value of land gomer said ground rent on the villagehall site thats peanuts see only publicspirited gesture gwyn twigg ever made mabbe owed somebody on the parish council a favour anyway word is stus been talkin serious to one o the supermarket chains you mean with a view to only one suitable site for a supermarket in ledwardine they reckons only its got a village hall on it this didnt take a lot of thinking out the village hall was s and a bit run down not exactly a listed building jane said so if there was a new village hall like one that was built somewhere else or a posh new leisure centre with playin fields whatd need a bigger site mabbe a greenfield site outside the village kind o thing if you had someing like that stu could flog the villagehall site to the supermarket and clean up and wed have a big flash superstore dominating the bottom of church street like a a shrine to commercialism ar someing like that you wanner take a guess who stus accountant is janie wow jane lurched forward against her seat belt you are kidding open secret girl like i tole you startin off thinkin your local councillors bent always saves a bit o time gomer that is just so ent even the whole story girl supermarket chain they got a limit kind o thing what i mean is a place needs to have a particlar head o population to make it worthwhile movin in and ledwardines borderline needs mabbe a hundred or so new houses to qualify see where im goin yere luxury executive jane lost her breath homes its a start thats and it dont stop there i been talkin to jack brodrick see jack was a surveyor with the ole radnorshire council he dreckon colemans meadows a key strategic move strategic see his word what it means is this you got housing on colemans meadow you gets to put a road through the ole orchard as was which opens up the whole of the east side o ledwardine and then youre off and big time janie more new estates up the back of ole barn lane out towards the bypass and all the way to gomer gave jane a sideways glance and crushed out his ciggy jane pictured it the back of old barn lane that would take the housing to the bottom of cole hill from the other side sure tbe which would mean with colemans meadow built on cole hill would be totally boxed in course this is only what jack brodrick reckons christ gomer shrewd ole bugger jack mind pierce is quietly stitching up the whole village well be like like a new town looks that way how long have you known i dont know janie its all guesswork ennit its not jane leaned back against the passenger door her head out of the jeep as if this would blow away the images of black and white houses crushed by an avalanche of pink brick gomer drove on towards the ledwardine turning is it jane screamed against the slipstream mabbe not gomer said as gomer slowed for the ledwardine turn jane checked her mobile found the message from mum so what was new maybe mum and lol would be home by the time she got in anyway she didnt want to call back now there was just too much to say and she was too angry they came into the village ledwardine in the smoky dusk the black and white houses timeless and ghostly in the fake gaslight from the square and the orange and lemon light spilling from the diamondpaned windows of the black swan no neon outside the swan the highpowered cars and suvs of smug diners a few young guys of fourteen or so with lager cans on the square imagine it in five years with twice the population two ways it could go either a refuge of the rich with high gates and burglar alarms and suspicion and unfriendliness or teeming streets vandalism drunkenness fights burglaries and gutters full of infected needles and crack pipes not that there was anything new about all that even in ledwardine in centuries past the gutters would probably have been overflowing nightly with blood and vomit and like well everybody got drunk sometime it was just just that the kind of mass drunkenness you got in the cities now was symptomatic of something scary an almost suicidal hopelessness seeping through society jane had done this really heartfelt essay on it for the school magazine the attitude was the world is made of shit the politicians of all three major parties are clueless tossers on the make the countrys already more than halfway down the toilet so if you dont get pissed tonight tomorrow could be too late thered been times when shed felt that way herself obviously and although she hadnt used the words pissed or shit in the essay it had still been censored good old morrell good old rob maybe it was time to leave make her own way somehow home is it huh sorry gomer i was you wanner check if the vicars back janie gomer had stopped the jeep at the edge of the market square engine clattering actually gomer i wouldnt mind like now therell be nobody about checking out colemans meadow see if theyve taken the fence down or anything they ent gonner do that girl only i feel bad about just going to ground all day not having the courage of my convictions wisest thing you hadnt got no proof yeah and now we have can you take me back to mrs kingsleys in the morning get those pictures photocopied iil do that youre a star gomer but still tomorrow morning seemed a long way off what if call it paranoia but anything could happen in this sick world what if mrs kingsley had changed her mind what if lyndon pierce and gerry murray had found out and persuaded her to hand over the photos and by tomorrow morning they were ashes best to stay away from the meadow i reckon janie dont invite no trouble till youre ready for it gomer pulled the jeep onto the square switched off the engine ill come over the vicarage with you if they ent back mabbe get some chips brilliant see all i was thinking maybe more protesters mightve turned up ive got this fantasy of like one of these old peace camps where people come and occupy the site got new laws to prevent all that now theyre stifling everything spontaneous arent they free speech whatever happened to that ent gonner stifle me girl gomer said too old to be stifled see they walked across the square and under the market hall it was around ten pm and the only light was in the northern sky a strange light with swirls of white like cream in dark coffee there were no lights in the vicarage chips then is it gomer said yeah why not my treat youve done a great job tonight gomer all we have to do now is make sure everybody knows and about the leisure centre and everything weve got to wake up the village easier said than done janie thing is gomer froze what jane said year that all jane could hear was the sound of a distant engine like a lorry or something carrying the way sounds did in the country after dark gomer stepped back onto the square his head on one side its a jcb ennit gimme a couple more minutes i could mabbe tell you what size and how old jane smiled gomer parry plant hire never sleeps gomer wasnt smiling he stood hunched looking down at his doc martens listening hard comin from the orchard it is i dont seems to me there ent many places back there where you can manoeuvre a jcb specially at night see he looked at jane and there was no light in his glasses he took the ciggy out of his mouth and coughed unhappily you know what theyre doin dont you the blade of course lol had halflied to merrily and he hated that but now he was compelled to go through with it by evening light the sacred oak had seemed inspirational its weight its setting the glow of sunset had instilled a transitional tension which was unsettling and he needed that badly needed to be unsettled again have something reawoken in him even if it was through fear of the unknown it was odd since the sun had gone down the sky seemed brighter the landscape as he neared the oak had the eeriness of a vast attic lit by a single candle the voice of dan the chorister was crackling behind his ears like tinnitus i was a bit cynical about the whole idea at first but id do it again tomorrow i mean it id travel a long way to do it maybe the words of dan the chorister had been quietly playing at the back of his mind for hours vibration going through you like wiring different parts of you lighting up in some kind of sequence wasnt just three churches coming together it was like being inside a big orb of sound like wed broken through to another place lol was wondering when since the terror and adrenalin rushes of the comeback concert at the courtyard hed last experienced anything approaching that level of connection what use was he to merrily or jane if he couldnt feel their level of commitment the way both of them from their different directions were driven while he was just the hangeron the timid inhabitant of the witchs cottage who hadnt been able to construct a serviceable song for over a month night had widened the landscape nothing visible between lol and stonehenge and glastonbury abbey two tawny owls conversed across the valley he stopped and looked up stars planets spheres and then as the naked dead topmost branches of the sacred oak appeared over the nearest horizon like a claw he was shaking his head because this was faintly despicable he should have gone with merrily but lol kept on walking until at some point the whistling arose jane followed the tiny beacon of gomers ciggy through the churchyard through the wicket gate and into the orchard which had once encircled the village all that was around her now was the sluggish sound of the jcb flexing its metal muscles a friendly sound normally shed always associated jcbs with gomer gomer parry plant hire drain your fields clear your ditches lay your pipes dig your soakaway now it was a grinding headache maybe the fantasymigraine shed invented coming back to haunt her karmic retribution clanking dragging ripping an organ of destruction darkness closing in on mellow old ledwardine slow janie gomer said they were beyond the church into the patch of ground where jane had found the circular bump that might be a bronze age burial mound too dark now to make it out there was a moon somewhere but its meagre light wasnt getting in here and the nettles were high she must have been stung a dozen times already but that didnt matter sweating grit in her eyes she stopped at the sound of a heavy blade on stone raw friction a pulling back a meshing of gears careful girl wire gomer breathing hard was feeling his way along an old barbedwire fence not the kind of fence you tried to climb over at night without a torch hed wanted to go back to the jeep for his lambing light but jane had been frantic by then and anyway there were headlamps on the jcb she could see them at last through the trees and the shape of the big yellow digger itself monstrous now and brutal an implement of scorched earth gomer found the stile and tested its strength with both hands before climbing over and waiting to help jane down but jane didnt need any help and she hit the ground running ripping the back of a hand on the bottom of the sign on which she could have read if thered been any light herefordshire council planning department bast janie stop it jane screamed you total bastards bursting into colemans meadow where theyd taken down a section of the new fencing to let the jcb in the jcb that was approaching the middle of the meadow along twin bars of yellowwhite headlamp beam moving in for another attack jane ran out towards the digger and hands grabbed her the jcb reared up like a rampant dinosaur and its mudflecked lights went spearing across the meadow towards jane as she wrenched herself away and then ricocheted from the yellow hardhat worn by the man whod held her arms health and safety regulations are very explicit he said thats as far as you go jane backed away coughing pulling hair out of her eyes as he bent and picked up a lamp throwing the beam full in her face mightve known he said this is she could hardly speak for the rage and the shock this is wrong this is illegal this is a crime against not wrong at all lyndon pierce said and certainly not illegal this is private land and the man in the digger is the owner of the land and also of the digger as it happens the lamp beam swung to one side to find gomer he was panting and his ciggy had gone by god you ent bloody changed lyndon boy ent changed one bit not your problem mr parry i dont know what youre doing here pierces tone was remote he didnt look at gomer but i strongly suggest you leave immediately and take this girl with you before she gets into any more trouble its not your business ent your business either youre supposed to be a councillor boy supposed to see both bloody sides im not taking sides im observing im here as a member of the herefordshire council planning committee an official observer he looked out across the meadow and jane followed his gaze the digger had reversed back into a corner of the meadow its blade up and retracted its headlights illuminating what it had already done to colemans meadow revealing the extent of the massacre here i go now in fact lyndon pierce said observing jane was too shattered to cry it looked like pictures shed seen of the somme more than half the central track had been dug up ripped away the surface turf torn off and dumped in rough spoil heaps and deeper more jagged furrows dug out where the ground was softer water coming up from somewhere pooling in the glistening claysided trenches theyd systematically destroyed it theyd all but obliterated the ley theyd waited until it had got dark and the few protesters had gone and then theyd opened the fence and let in the jcb like letting a hungry fox into a chicken house to do its worst the enemy was pointing at them across the meadow and jane could see the shape of its driver hunched behind the levers in the reinforced glass cab gerry murray presumably sitting there watching them now waiting an agent of the darkness stop him janes fingers were sticky stop him while you can while theres still some of the track left because its not going to look good for you tomorrow when when the truth comes out truth pierce laughed jane felt the delta of blood washing down from the back of the hand shed slashed on the sign oozing between her fingers jane the only truth thats coming out is the kind of truth thatll be damaging to you and your mother and your mothers hippie boyfriend now go home quietly before you make things worse like im really going to let you destroy an ancient monument weve been there jane this is no more an ancient monument than your friend mr parry youre just youre just a scumbag and a all the names she wanted to spit at him but that would just be abuse and childish like the sad underage drivers you saw howling wanker at the traffic cops in all those cheap tv documentaries why do you she stared up at him and then turned quickly away feeling tearpressure why do you have to do this ill remind you one more time pierce said that youre on a development site and youre not wearing protective clothing if you dont go ill be calling the police to have you removed and well see how good that looks in the papers now be a good girl and let mr murray finish the preparation of his ground preparation he hasnt even got planning permission yet even if its as good as a done deal this is just sick mindless peevish destruction why do you have to do this because of you you stupid little pierces face coming at her dark with eveningstubble what do you think all this fencing cost to keep those cranks out eh what if they come back tomorrow and theres even more of them what then well good no not good jane bad for all of us costly so to forestall the possibility of further public disturbance mr murray took the entirely sensible decision to remove what our county archaeologists have formally confirmed was never there in the first place and invited me as the local representative to come along and observe that no regulations were breached and thats what im doing thats it all right he turned away adjusting his hard hat he was wearing a khakicoloured shirt and cargo trousers like he was in the sas or something on a special highrisk mission so he invited you is it gomer said i gotter say everything twice for you is it mr parry sure you dint invite yourself strikes me this is just the sorter thing youd think of all by yourself thats all lyndon pierce didnt reply because like all you care about jane said is protecting your corrupt schemes and the bungs youre getting from the guy whos flogging his land to the supermarket firm and the bungs youre probably getting from the developers of the luxury executive pierce turned slowly too late to stop now youre just totally fucking bent just like your dad with your crap marbellastyle villa and your naff swimming pool and your you couldnt lie straight in bed gomer said quietly janie right pierce turning to gomer the lamp under his face uplighting it the way kids did to turn themselves into monsters now i want you to remember this mr parry first off i dont give a fig what this nasty little girl says on account shes too young to think of any of it for herself like fuck she is janie so im holding you solely responsible for that actionable shite even though nothing you say counts for a thing round yere and never did never did ole man jane kept quiet stopped breathing because pierce had lost it his accent had broken through again and his language had broken down gomer went silent too this was like confirmation well wasnt it pierce shone his handlamp from gomers face to janes face and back again youre halfway senile mr parry you and your bloody plant hire you dont even know what bloody plant hire means youre a joke ole man you ent even safe to climb into one of them no more pierce jerking a thumb at the jcb his words coming faster and everybody knows everybody knows you always got it in for farmers like gerry does their own drainage rather than paying good money out of pity to a clappedout ole fart like you for half a fuckin job gomer didnt say anything but something tightened in his neck and he went rigid the lamplight swirling like liquid in his glasses for a terrified couple of seconds jane thought oh christ hes having a stroke wanting to kill pierce and only dimly aware of the jcbs engine revving up until pierce turned to the meadow his hardhat tipping back as his arm came up like the arm of some petty romanemperor figure you wanner watch he said all right you watch no jane screamed no pierce brought his arm down a chopping motion on the other side of colemans meadow the big digger rocked its blade lowering and then it began to roll on its caterpillars towards the last pathetic piece of old straight track oughter be in an old folks home you ought parry pierce said as he walked away i should think about that i were you hed been blocking the long view of cole hill which never entirely faded away on summer nights a lick of moon had risen behind it like a candle on a coffin down below the last four or five metres of track made a perfect shadow stop him please stop him jane arching forward screaming at pierces back you shit he was gone hed walked casually away into the orchard and all there was left was the yellow lights and the roaring and jane looked back at gomer but gomer wasnt moving he was just standing there a bit bent now like one of the old dying apple trees in the derelict orchard behind him it was almost over jane was on her own shed failed shed mishandled everything through immaturity her eagerness to do something be somebody she couldnt live with that she was only half aware of running blindly towards the diggers bobbing lights running out sobbing into the meadow where the ruined ley carried what remained of the ancestry of an historic village oh not historic in the sense of having kings or dukes living there or battles fought on its soil more important than that she heard a shout from behind her glanced over her shoulder and saw gomer stumbling after her and she shouted back at him no but he was already slipping sideways into a newmade trench sinking down on his knees and her heart lurched and she desperately wanted to go rushing back to help him but she was too far now too far gone and convinced despite the savaging of the meadow that she could still see the mystic line glowing and alive and fresh with the clean crisp scent of apples sharp with the cool dry tang of the cider hardened by the hooves of hereford cattle with hides the colour of the soil marked out by the shadow of the church where the bells had called generations of farm workers to prayer still walked by the sombre shades of alfred watkins and his distinguished musical associate and the spirit the sad sepia spirit of lucy devenish herself hiding her anguish in the folds of her poncho as jane threw herself into the gutted ground and rolled in front of the blade remembering the hurt half past ten and no signs of apocalypse parked alone in the bay outside wychehill church with the window down merrily could just about hear the choir not what shed expected not the fulsome floating sound which had gilded the air last monday night when she and lol had arrived in wychehill this was lowlevel and travelled in pulses shed walked quietly down to the church some of whose windows were quietly aglow sliding into the porch with the idea of inching open the doors to see if loste or winnie was in there but the doors were locked no audience for this choir tonight shed crept outside again found a metal bucket and positioned it upside down below one of the clear windows and stood on it ave mary she heard low and liquid ave mary she saw a group of heads in the chancel in a nest of candelight a candle in a pewter tray on the lectern a candle on the pulpit eerily dickensian also workmanlike not a performance anyway the conductor was bald merrily had fled back to the car two police vehicles went past slowly a lurid traffic car and a dark blue van perhaps the action wouldnt start until the early hours perhaps it wouldnt start at all perhaps khan was right and what worried people like leonard holliday was not so much the reality of the royal oak as the idea of it any challenge to the idyll hard however to imagine holliday ever experiencing an idyll she lit a cigarette looked across at the rectory like everywhere else it was in darkness ledwardine vicarage was never entirely in darkness if there was no light on in the house a lowpowered bulb would be burning in one of the outside lanterns the light of the world the glow of sanctuary no sanctuary here she got out and locked the car and walked up through the cutting into church lane saw a tv flicker in hannah bradleys cottage and thought about knocking no time stay focused she walked on up the lane surprised at how bright the night was with a moon that was far from full there was a single guiding lamp at the top of the steep path down to starlight cottage but the place itself was unlit and clearly deserted even the windchimes unmoving in the herbscented silence wind chimes part of the illusion of innocence if sparke had deliberately misdirected her neither she nor loste were going to be easily discovered tonight merrily didnt hang around walked quickly back up to the lane and down the hill towards the church a bulkhead light blinked on across the lane and a door opened hey i thought it was you hannah said is there something wrong looking for winnie thats all merrily walked across the road you havent seen her i never look out for her hannah was standing by her gate she wore a keane tshirt and shorts she looks out for herself how do you mean nice bloke tim loste used to be i dont know what hes like now i wouldnt know either merrily said i havent been allowed to talk to him join the club phew its hot tonight innit yeh i do a bit of running on the hill you know and i ran into tim a few times i thought hed be all up in the air and highbrow but he wasnt not like that at all quite uncomplicated really we went to the theatre in malvern once matinee it had some quite famous actors in it from tv it was a laugh then she found out winnie and that was it our paths as they say stopped crossing and not for want of me going out of my way ill tell you when was this hannah few months ago i think hes back drinking now she wont stop him shell bloody kill him before shes done and thats a shame go on tell me merrily leaned on the gate hannah looked up and down the lane and then lowered her voice but not much when we were in malvern right we ran into this old mate of tims from when he was a teacher and i remembered his name after and i rang him up to ask him like you know whats the situation with tim and he said the sparke woman was the reason his engagement was broken off tims what you mean she oh nothing like that shed eat him for breakfast she just tells him hes a genius shes good at making people feel special i dont know if hes a genius or not but whats it matter if genius is being miserable all the time you know he tried to top himself if you see her you can tell her what i said i dont care any more i wish i could get between them but he wont listen and how are things with you i just dont go that way any more on the bike hannah said you getting anywhere with it to be honest dont know back at the car merrily lit another cigarette brought out the phone watched it flare up singing in her hand and called jane again her call could not be taken left another message on the voicemail and then called gomers landline gomers partner danny thomas kept the firms only mobile as gomer had never been known to charge it up no answer at least this was likely to mean that wherever jane was gomer was also there made no difference she should be there there was nothing much to be done here if loste and winnie were doing a last night of the proms before they were barred from wychehill church it was perhaps none of her business on the other hand when somebody had deceived you she rang bliss voicemail frannie merrily said i dont really know what to say to you except that somethings not right here which of course you oh sod it just call me back she killed the connection and her cigarette leaned back into the seat time to go and collect poor lol drive back to whiteleafed oak hamlet and then call him on the mobile call him away from the perpetual choirs nice concept lovely imagery the great and beautiful mystery how elgar tapped into the music of the spheres the ultimate unprovable theory but also un dis provable clever winnie she decided to drive back to the ledbury road by the slightly longer route that would take her past the royal oak which after all shed never seen fully operational the moral cesspit the gateway to hell the road taking her past the gaunt edwardian home of tim loste which she hadnt yet checked she made out its wall and its peeling railings no lights on here either and she hadnt expected any but as she accelerated away something did catch her eye not a peeling railing but oh hell merrily braked lowered her window looked behind her for oncoming headlights and when it was clear there was nothing reversed along the road to the front of the house and switched off the engine she couldnt see it from here and had to get out the narrow house rose up against the hill like an upended domino double blank and halfway into lostes cramped driveway she was able to confirm what shed seen from the car it was the oak sapling planted in his tiny front garden the tree which eventually would have crumbled his foundations and fused destructively with his supporting walls the oak which she now knew represented something infinitely bigger a symbol of something is all winnie had said a symbol he could use for meditation merrily walked up to the front of the house and held the sapling in both hands halfway up where it was gleaming white not white leaves somebody had snapped its trunk jane tasted the earth it was cold and gritty and bitter and her ears were full of roaring night get up nergh jane rolled away from the blade but kept on hugging the earth get up out of there before i pull you out a voice she didnt know then a voice she did dont touch her gerry you must never touch them these days id like to fucking ive already called the police lyndon pierce said jane you know whatll happen if the police have to move you youll be arrested youll be charged youll appear in court and when youve appeared in court once at your age thats the slippery slope jane dug her fingers into the soil opened her eyes slightly and saw the white eyes of the jcb heard its engine idling she saw the boots of gerry murray heard the voice of lyndon pierce again mother wont survive that be on your way the pair of you no skin off my nose women vicars that was always gonner be a mistake jane concentrated on the roaring of the engine in her ears and gripped the earth one hand aching where the grit was in the bleeding cut the earth smelled rich and raw and warm now warm as the grave i been talking to tessa bird in education pierce said looks like youre finished at the school anyway youre maladjusted jane always been a problem child what the fuck she heard the change in the engines tone a gear change like a huge throatclearing when she opened her eyes the diggers lights were receding murray screaming get the fuck out of there you mad ole bastard swallowing wet clay jane saw the swirl of the diggers lights and then the night went mad it wasnt the wind there was no wind it wasnt an accident either the sapling was too thick in its lower trunk for merrily to clasp a hand around someone had bent it over until it split it wasnt quite severed but the top three or four feet of it were hanging off she felt the violence still in the air could almost smell someones sweat it was in some indefinable way like when she and syd spicer had been standing by the remains of lincoln cookmans car as if the violence had been inflicted on the atmosphere itself and the atmosphere wanted you to know that it was remembering the hurt she went around the path to the back door to see if the oaks in plant pots had been damaged they seemed to be intact although one was knocked over but the back door which tim loste was said never to lock was ajar and the bar of pinkish light down the side was amidst so much darkness a lurid shock merrily took a step back and waited no suggestion of movement inside she didnt go in but she prodded the door a little wider open and called out mr loste not really expecting an answer but from out on the hill behind the house she could hear a distant sound both explosive and staccato like duelling machine guns dance music from the royal oak somehow deflected from the hill bouncing back toward the house and the road i spend all of friday and saturday evenings with tim when the royal oak starts up he needs me hell go crazy else if they werent here and they werent at whiteleafed oak where were they with her left trainer merrily pushed the door further open saw into the kitchen which she hadnt really taken in when she was here with annie howe it was basic but not small pine units and cupboards up to the high ceiling a microwave a dishwasher a coffeemachine an empty pizza packet on the worktop near the microwave all of this lit by one long thin peachcoloured strip light no conspicuous damage no sounds of intrusion so who had left the door open had the sole objective been the killing of the oak tree who would have known its importance presumably only winnie sparke and merrily now and lol she stepped cautiously over the threshold mr loste it seemed so unlikely that she hadnt met this man she knew so much about or did she like all the impressions you received of elgar the individual portraits of tim loste didnt quite match he was inspired and inspirational he was crazy and manipulative there was certainly nothing of him in this kitchen opposite her the door to the hall was wide open the hall was in darkness she started thinking about the big framed photograph of whiteleafed oak over the mantelpiece in the living room and all the other pictures of the sites of the perpetual choirs obvious and easy targets if someone really wanted to upset him she went into the hall always hated being inside someone elses house when they werent there especially in the dark merrily felt around for a light switch and as soon as her hand found it one of those little metal nipples the light from a white crystal bowl in the ceiling sprang into the otherworldly eyes of edward elgar urging mr phoebus out of the shadows towards her it also fanned unevenly into the living room where the glass protecting the photo of the whiteleafed oak had indeed been smashed the picture tipped so that it looked as if the whole room was awry as if a sudden gust of wind had rushed into it tossing winnie sparkes slight body back into the bookshelves in a hot shower of blood unseeingness the line was open but there was no voice then the signal cut out and the screen went dark and the music from inn ya face was going whoomp chissa hiss whoomp like machinery deep inside the hill frannie merrily said urgently frannie she looked up in blank despair from the lawn behind caractacus the moon was high but the house was in the shadow of the hill all right shed try him she went back to the path opening up the phone again illuminating the screen and scrolling down the list to bring up blisss mobile number sorry bliss said im norrin leave me a message frannie please letting some very real distress come through like she could prevent it get back to me get back to me now when she snapped the phone shut her hand was shaking she could see this in the peachy glow from the kitchen door she squeezed the phone hard gripped the shaking hand with the other hand tried to pray for selfcontrol couldnt she didnt have a choice any more she had to go back in there make sure merrily felt the tautness of impending panic in her chest turned away and saw a glinting from the edge of the lawn where it met the path knife merrily walked around it the hill going whoomp chissa chissa hiss whoomp the perpetual technochoir from hell she bent down and found the remains of a bells whisky bottle possibly smashed against the wall of the house tim lostes whisky smashed on his way out after he she shook the phone call me lol frannie call me what if they didnt what if bliss didnt call back for an hour or more she should go back to whiteleafed oak after after shed been back in there after shed gone back and checked once more made dear god absolutely certain that there was going to be no need for an ambulance calm down this cant be done without calm it definitely was the cello concerto but where a cello was veined and richly visceral the whistled theme was faint and remote and fusewirethin and painfully isolated it was as if lol thought as if this was how it was meant to be heard to convey its meaning in which case its meaning was solitary the sky was clear and starry and smeared with a buttery northern light and the whistling made slow luminous coils and lonely whorls on the silence twice it had stopped and then started up again from a different direction the way tawny owls might answer one another across the vastness of the valley the oak tree was flat and featureless like a massive spidery blot of indian ink lol kept on walking towards it a joke but who in this situation wouldnt be unnerved it would be eerie enough after dark outside your own front door on ledwardine market square one reason being that nobody did this any more nobody seemed to whistle no window cleaners no butchers boys with baskets and nobody whistled this achingly sad regretful as he approached the oak tree the whistling seemed to develop a slow and rolling rhythm like the breathpattern induced lol caught himself imagining by even heavy pedalling on a gradual incline only me hed thought it was coming from under the tree perhaps from the hollow that looked like a sacrificial pit but when he reached the oak the whistling was still some distance away across to the right it stopped again lol crept up to the oak and lowered himself between two of its varicose roots pushing himself back into the bole spreading out his legs against the roots gripping cakes of bark in his palms and staying very still just another part of the tree an offering of himself in return for shelter shelter against madness as it began again the moon was higher now with an amber cast and he saw over to the right the east where the distant eastnor obelisk was anyway he thought he saw a movement he kept still and the tune continued fluidly long beyond the point where his own version might have feebled out under the circumstances with your own breath coming faster all rational judgement in suspense it was impossible not to imagine for one thoughtdissolving moment this time when it was over lol spent some seconds with his eyes closed trying to breathe evenly before lifting his hands and beginning with as lazy and relaxed a rhythm as he could summon to applaud merrily took three or four long breaths before stepping into the kitchen walking directly through to the hall this time touching nothing activating the livingroom light by brushing the metal switch with her sleeve last time shed seen it only by the light washing in from the hall now two big white wall brackets were flaring theatrically scattering shadows and it was so much worse blood on the books blood on the pictures blood on the walls blood on the writing table gouts and drips and smears and winnie sparke in silent freezeframe winnie wore one of her long filmy dresses which seemed now as if it was hanging together in threads of blood and tissue her arms spread out across the bookcase with books pulled out and the empty fireplace her buckled bare knees touchingly girlish a breast partly exposed cut into like a flaccid fruit her face ripped in several places top lip joined to her nose by strings of blood and mucus her throat slashed many times but the worst of it was never the gore it was always the unseeingness of the eyes and the open mouth through which no breath passed the room was hot and clammy and stank and worst of all it was so waxily still merrily swallowed bile and then something overtook her and she was just standing there raging you got him out you brought him home keeping your secrets playing your cards why couldnt you just talk to me talk to anybody she froze what if hes still here what if hes upstairs what if hes halfway down the stairs and listening not likely believe it seriously not likely he was long gone hed gone lurching out with his whisky draining the bottle and smashing it against the wall in his agony and selfhatred please god let it be selfhatred and repentance let there be no more of this and then hed gone walking out on to the hill why i mean why for christs sake has he done this to you winnie his saviour his mentor his there could be no halfwayrational explanation not this time not like the disposal of the drug dealer on the beacon this was frenzied this was full on the killer looking her in the eyes as it was being done this screamed insanity merrily looked into winnie sparkes last frozen cry could only see one eye through the blood and the hair winnie sparkes good hair and the eye was a dead eye it had been floating in blood and now the blood had congealed around it like a stiff collar why couldnt you talk about it letting the sob empty itself out of her as she did all there was left to do pray her job take her and hold her and calm her take her from this place now take her into light following this with the lords prayer the oldest exorcism power and the glory for ever and ever amen quelling the dread she opened her eyes and was able for just a moment to hold herself in and remain calm in the presence of a new shadow in the room winnie sparke hung there no less dead it was not winnie sparke who was breathing who said amen softly from the doorway behind her snaps batons shouldnt have done that he said sternly you broke the vibration looming over lol nodding his head as though it was too heavy for him he wore baggy grey sweatpants and a white singlet with dark stains and smudges on it percussive noises clapping his hands clumsily sometimes they missed break the connection gone he moved in his bent shuffling way over to a halfcollapsed bale of straw flopping down on it with his legs apart his hands clasped between them his body rocking slowly take a pew old cock lol found another damaged bale to sit on there was a lamp on the floor between them one of those batterypowered lanterns with a blue plastic shade spraying a light like watered milk over the long shed that was either an openfronted barn or a horse shelter whatever it was a walk of only a minute or so from the oak and hed come wading out of it soon after lol had started clapping staggering behind his lantern dazed survivor of some iron age tribal skirmish lol had recognized him at once from merrilys brief description and his accent and the way his words came blustering out as if his lungs were organ bellows wasnt working anyway tell the truth ran out of puff you need to do the whole jolly thing all the way through until you become he stopped blinking slowly sliding back along his bale bringing down a strawstorm from another his mouth slack really dont know wassa matter with me tonight what was obviously the matter was coming sickly sweet and sour off his breath lol didnt get too close it was as well to remember this guy was only here because of a shortage of evidence his weighty ragged moustache hung down either side of his mouth more mongol warlord than victorian composer his stomach overhanging his sweatpants like a bag of sugar under his singlet i look all right to you i suppose lol said aware of tim loste really looking at him now trying to focus over the moist pink bags under his eyes trying to remember where exactly are you from me led lol thought about it changed his mind knights frome he paused mate of dans dan dan from much cowarne dan good lord yes tim made to clap his left knee missed and clapped the hay tumbling sideways kicking over the lantern lol caught it tim pulled himself upright super chap just you know went into it didnt inter inter lectulise finest tenor in much cowarne lol said absolutely wherever the fuck much cowarne is they both laughed lol looked out of the open front of the barn across the moonlit landscape it was like being in a grandstand the field seemed luminous and there was another oak tree with two dead branches bleached like bones you on your own tim squinted up at the wooden rafters and the flaking galvanized roof the light was fanning out from the circular lamp like a merrygoround with moths riding it for the moment tim said where is she she winnie sparke tim let his head fall forward into his big hands began breathing hard into them like some kind of exercise to head off an asthma attack lol saw dark stains between tims fingers he said are you tims shoulders were heaving are you hurt im tim peered out through his fingers i think im in a bit of a mess frankly old cock you walked here dont remember wheres winnie tim looked at him silently through those discoloured fingers winnie said youd meet us here she talked to my friend on the phone she said youd meet us here winnie i his voice dropped i dont remember did she walk over with you from wychehill no just the two of us but youre alone i think think something happened lol felt a small abdominal chill his glasses kept misting he took them off rubbed them on his sleeve put them back quickly on the way here dont remember tim said look lol brought out his mobile flipped it open i think we could do with some help here help tim repeated vaguely like he was recalling something help me his voice melting into a wail as he came to his feet help me im whore you calling old cock just a friend lol brought up merrilys number shell get us some help peering at the keys through misting glasses he sent the call listened to merrilys phone ringing and then tim lurched at him ramming him off the bale snatching the phone as it flew up lol leaping up making a grab for it but tim was taller and fumbled it well out of his reach lumbering out of the barn into the night twisting around his arm going back this monstrous baby throwing something out of its pram lol saw his phone disappearing into the night like a tiny silver spacecraft for a while in the redspattered white room neither of them spoke syd spicer was in dark jeans black clerical shirt dog collar his small eyes were flat and unmoving well done he said merrily came shakily to her feet her jeans damp at the knees didnt even remember kneeling down not many of us wouldve done that merrily not alone in a situation like this neither of them spoke again until they were on the back lawn and the air was the kind you were prepared to breathe she waited while spicer shut the back door he was she noticed wearing black gloves i was once he said in another life given some crude medical training i think what you need is a hot sugary brew and a sitdown im all right of course youre not all right who could be can you get the police i need to go somewhere right away merrily i have to collect lol ill come straight back where is he just bear with me she prodded lols number into the mobile it rang and rang christ call the police thats in hand merrily you cant go anywhere she walked away down the side of the house it had gone too far now she was in over her head just wanted to get over to whiteleafed oak find lol patch things together make sure jane was all right and then go to the police and if necessary answer questions until the sun came up she looked back at spicer what about tim loste he can take care of himself i hope i mean whats he going to do now wheres he going to go merrily hell have gone out on the hill stopping next to the brutalized oak failing to prevent her voice rising to an unnatural shrillness he always does he has a place he goes to where he went to with winnie which is the place where i left lol because winnie said theyd meet us there and lols not answering his phone and theres a man out there fresh from pointing wildly at the house that spicer stepped back shaking his head merrily walked down towards the road feeling in her lefthand hip pocket for her keys aware that he wasnt following her at the bottom of the drive she realized the car keys werent in her pocket must have left them in the ignition shed only got out to look at the sapling she stopped at the side of the road looked from side to side couldnt take it in at first she turned on spicer bewildered he shrugged i meant to tell you that was why i came in only it got superseded someones nicked my car yeah i saw you drive past about twenty minutes later the car comes back the other way couple of kids in it i didnt figure youd have asked them to go down the shop and get you some cigarettes she leaned against the railings closing her eyes a gift is a gift spicer said sadly for what its worth i reckon youve just become the first genuine victim of the notorious criminal element frequenting the royal oak suddenly without preamble like a baby tim was howling crashing back and flinging himself face down into the rotting hay and straw beating his fists into the broken bales lol ran past him into the open saw how long the grass was and the nettles saw that the chances of finding the phone before the morning were remote and even then better to take off fast get away run back to the centre of the hamlet wait there for merrily bang on someones door and ask to use the phone he started to walk away dont go sour whiskybreath on the air tim loste standing very close behind him think i need help it was as if throwing the phone out of the barn had expelled what remained of his energy blown out his candle he went back and sat down meekly on his bale looking at the baked mud floor then up at lol in the lamplight i remember dan dans got a beard tall as me bald lol stood in the open mouth of the barn considering the options he could probably walk out of here now and keep walking and tim wouldnt necessarily follow him but what would that achieve youre not dan are you tim said im lol kind of names that short for laurence lol loste sounding it like a bass note and who are you lol asked him me tim loste leaned back into the hay im the chap whos come here to see god build a cathedral mustnt push it move yourself into deep shadow introduce the subject of edward elgar and watch it forming in the milky lamplight what your old boss dick lydon the hereford psychotherapist would have called an elaborate fantasy structure except maybe it wasnt there was clearly something wrong with tim loste no question there except what was it there was whisky breath but this wasnt normal intoxication for long periods his thoughts would appear fluid usually when he was interested in the subject under discussion elgar anyone who didnt understand what elgar was about tim had no time for them fortunately he hadnt had to mix with many people like that the only child of orchestral musicians hed grown up in sussex not far from brinkwells elgars house when the composer was living down south the place where hed met algernon blackwood writer of ghost stories and sometimemagician lol came back to sit on the bale he said he knew about brinkwells ah tim beaming whitely in the lamplight so not like most of the airyfairy types who come out here friend of dans lol reminded him dan finest tenor in much cowarne good old dan tims eyes were cloudy again often meet people here all times of the day and night disappointing wispy types never want to talk about elgar brinkwells lol said you were at brinkwells i was drawn to it from an early age six maybe earlier had a nanny for when the parents were on tour used to take me to brinkwells until i could go on my own just the fields around there you know better when i could go alone wed go for walks and hed be pointing out things look at this young un your nanny was a bloke not the nanny old cock tim leaned forward hands on knees his big face uptilted summoning memories or the ones hed fabricated earlier used to wait for him or hed wait for me there were some old trees bit like this you could stand by the trees and hed be there he loved those trees there was a legend that they were supposed to have been monks who got bewitched when blackwood came to visit he took him to see the trees were they oaks suppose they mustve been what do you make of these young un hed say can you see the monks lol wondered how much of this tim had blocked in years later it wasnt unusual for an only child to have a famous imaginary companion even one who must even at the time have been dead for over forty years he loved all trees didnt he lol said ill say what about the whiteleafed oak well of course this was his favourite walk this was where caractacus was formed and then gerontius everything leading up to gerontius but he kept jolly quiet about whiteleafed oak people do its a place of powerful initiation elgar said that did he no i mean was that elgar or winnie sparke tim looked away that lamp getting fainter do you think dan need to bring some new batteries should we switch it off you keep the lamp here under the hay with this tim tugged out a stiffbacked folder covered in brown leather and opened it up on his knees dont always need light here though if theres a moon you come here a lot lol leaned into the light so that he could see what was on the pages tim closed the book quickly it was musical manuscript a score tim leaned over and switched off the lamp inflating himself into this hulking shadow against the chalkdust night tim lol hesitated do you think elgar knew about the idea of the perpetual choirs tim looked for him who did you say you were friend of dans yes but were you in my choir once dan talks about you you made a big impression he told me about the night you divided them into three and sent some of them to little malvern priory and some to redmarley dabitot hmm yes tim seemed to relax redmarley that was terribly significant you see elgars mothers family came from there his mother carried the strand a countrywoman my mother bit of a townie didnt like me to go out without a mac or walk on the wet grass but elgars mother encouraged her offspring to go out in all weathers so that they were always at home with nature whatever the conditions so they were you know part of it yes ann elgars family were actually from redmarley it was like talking to very old people ask them what they had for lunch and their minds went opaque but talk about the past and the stories came spinning out greenmouldy tape gliding smoothly past stillkeen magnetic heads what about little malvern well that was important because its where elgars buried at the catholic church there st wulstans didnt want to be planted there didnt want to be buried at all they had to talk him into it and i suppose he agreed for the wifes sake terribly proper alice a traditionalist what elgar really wanted was for his ashes to be scattered where the river severn meets the river teme lol gazed out between the uprights supporting the open front of the barn at the secondary oak tree with the white dead branches and when you separated the choirs it was important that the three churches were in the three counties it was just an idea tim said played around with different permu permutations different churches winnie it was winnies idea it was all winnies idea at first tims voice down to a whisper dan was telling me about wychehill church lol said st dunstans he was a patron saint of music wasnt he was that the quarry guy joseph longworths idea he was paying for it so he got to choose st dunstan was an abbot of glastonbury where one of the original perpetual choirs was said to be yes winnie spotted that at once she always says that once something is put in train all sorts of wonderful coincidences occur in a preordained sort of way tim fumbled around in the straw and then looked up dismayed didnt bring it did i i always bring water from the holy well cant understand maybe you dropped it somewhere no i tim was clenching and unclenching his fists like the grab mechanism on a crane mustve left in in a hurry never mind lol said why did winnie want you to come to wychehill im the chap whos come to see god well the church had been built for the performance of choral music longworth wrote to elgar asking what he could do to make amends having heard that elgar and bernard shaw were jolly miffed about the damage caused by the quarrying elgar not in the best of moods at the time wrote him a cursory reply saying something like oh go and build a damn cathedral winding longworth up really quite surprised when longworth wrote back saying where do you want your cathedral then where did you find out about this tim parish records its all documented more or less so when elgar realized the chap actually had a few quid to spare he decided that hed better give it some thought and he consulted some people blackwood and a chap he knew in hereford watson leyline man youve probably heard of him all you whiteleaf oakies as winnie used to call them are into all that you mean watkins you mean alfred watkins i sure yah watkins friend of elgars when he lived in hereford hed been doing some work around the beacon mapping out his lines and hed come across the foundations of what appeared to be an ancient chapel or a monks cell at wychehill and told longworth that if he built his church there it would be a very significant thing to do so what youre saying watkins and elgar advised longworth to build his church on the ley from whiteleafed oak along the malverns was blackwood involved in this too winnie was sure he mustve been former member of something or other the golden dawn thats the outfit studied magic blackwood wrote a novel the human chord about a mans attempt to recreate celestial music call out the secret names of god you really know your stuff dont you glad we met but you know i dont think im even supposed to talk about this tim is it possible that elgar in later years perhaps by talking to blackwood did know about the supposed significance of whiteleafed oak winnie thought he must have been at least instinctively aware ofwhy am i here do you know i dont remember i dont tim began to tremble like hed been hotwired his engine coming alive what am i doing can you help me lol bit his lip hands pressing into his knees god tims eyes filled with panic ed he said wheres ed cant do it without ed tennis courts no choice merrily had to go with spicer and she was close to frantic itll take twenty minutes please they were getting into spicers golf outside the rectory his car he could call the shots merrily if there was one thing i learned in my former life its that preparation and intelligence are invariably more important than skill technique and courage all that stuff from the comics theres something i need to know before we go anywhere something i need to check before we pick up your mr robinson it wont take long and it wont wait are you going to phone the police then or shall i i told you its in hand i made a call while you were screaming at poor winnie thought you needed to get that out of your system good of you ive a trusted friend wholl contact the right person in the police and explain it fully otherwise it could get messy and another thing you need to know tim loste didnt kill winnie you got that he didnt kill wicklow and he didnt kill winnie she stared at him his face flecked with the colours of the dashlights on what basis can you possibly oh and i didnt either in case you were considering that possibility this is not what you thought there is evil here on an almost unimaginable scale and we do need to collect your friend at some point right now though there are things i need to know that could save us all some grief grief i blew it merrily i left things too late if its anybodys fault whats happened to winnie its mine should have got them out of that church a week ago should never have let them in i dont understand nor me yet not fully spicer turned left this is the road to old wychehill farm he put on the headlights now listen to me were going to be quite open about this if prestons here its best you stay in the car and ill run some parish business past him itll be unconvincing but it doesnt matter a lot at this stage i dont think hell be here but i need to be sure spicer drove carefully into the valley on full beams and pulled up conspicuously in the centre of the courtyard gravel spurting there were lights in the big house and a couple of wroughtiron lanterns twinkling romantically among the stone holiday units but the outbuildings themselves were in complete darkness and there were no other cars around no signs of holidaymakers in residence the victorian turret the pines and the monkey puzzles were stageset silhouettes against the pale powdery night the idyllic effect spoiled only by the figure naked from the waist up legs braced the shotgun levelled at the windscreen of the golf you fucking stop there spicer kept the engine running best if you dont get out just yet merrily you really think merrily was sinking slowly down the passenger seat im going to get out get fucking back ill take your fucking head off spicer lowered his window hugo one more step ill blow your fucking windows out the twelvebore vibrating shards of moonlight on the twin barrels kids a bag of nerves spicer murmured something took him over the edge shouting out of his side window syd spicer son come for your old man youre fucking lying been a bad night aint it hugo dont make it worse im coming out all right im gonner walk under the lamp to your left so you can see its me promise you i wont come any closer just under the lamp yeah so you can id me you keep back a jerk of the shotgun no worries spicer got out of the car walked across to a wroughtiron lamp projecting from one of the buildings now see whos that with you thats mrs watkins the lady vicar youre making her nervous hugo finally recognizing spicer preston devereauxs younger son lowered the gun just fractionally through the car window merrily could smell fumes like a smouldering bonfire or an incinerator sorry to scare you son spicer said i wasnt nah nah you got good reason to be wary way thingsve been lately louis with you hes with dad theyre meeting a guy about installing tennis courts tennis courts tennis courts eh smart move spicer walked up to the boy be having an eighteenhole golf course next yeah look ill tell them you spicers back blurred across the windscreen merrily didnt see how it happened but it happened in nearsilence and when spicer stepped aside he was holding the shotgun and hugo devereaux was writhing on the lamplit gravel she gasped sat up springing open the car door and rolling out to find spicer breaking the shotgun taking out both cartridges putting them one by one in his pocket he looked down at the boy god have mercy on you son but she saw that hed taken off his dog collar what followed was surreal and desperately chilling reality distanced like she was watching down the wrong end of a telescope the minds way of handling an experience that was both alien and vividly shocking theyd followed hugo devereaux into the house and spicer still wearing his black gloves was opening doors and cupboards like a burglar seemed to know his way around as well as if he had the layout in his head kicking open the door of the beacon room with its long window the british camp like a high altar hard under the haloed moon syd stopping to listen in the churchy stillness cellars hugo by the back stairs keys ill get them but theres nothing down there good you go first spicer no longer had the shotgun with him just a bunch of keys on a ring merrily followed them hanging back trying to filter out what was most important primarily that if spicer was correct and loste hadnt murdered winnie or wicklow lol was in no direct danger at whiteleafed oak it was something spicer had followed hugo to the top of some stone steps going down curving no handrail fluorescent lights were stammering on hugo couldnt be more than eighteen or nineteen was stumbling in front of spicer without argument his head bent his body occasionally twitching in pain merrily staying well back a hand on the wall on either side not trusting spicer not by a long way the cellars at the bottom had strip lights at crazy angles on the low ceilings there were several rooms and spicer checked them all before motioning the boy into a square and windowless cell where wooden crates and cardboard boxes were stacked can i ask you to do something merrily could i ask you to go back to the car and if mr devereaux or louis or both should happen to appear in their new land rover or indeed if anyone appears in anything drive out past them and blow the horn once and what will you be doing ill be talking to my friend hugo and if he helps me as im sure he will ill join you in a very short time why have you taken off your collar i was hot i swear to you before god that im doing the best i can to spare lives prevent violence i might be proved wrong and thats my responsibility no hugo had been edging towards the door dont son spicer said wearily please i can hurt you very badly in a very short time and if you insist on making me prove it well both be very upset no shame in this in your place id cooperate fully because id realize the situation was seriously weighted against me we understanding one another hugo hugos narrow face was white under the striplight except for eyes which looked hot and red his cheek was grazed and flecked with grit from where hed fallen outside spicer said im sure mrs watkins would be more inclined to do what im suggesting if she thought you werent going to get hurt fuck off hugo said it had never sounded feebler mans world eh hugo spicer said was that what it felt like when you were dealing with winnie that wasnt like wicklow was it wait in the cave or somewhere out of sight then a quick bang on the head and the rest is just well just basic butchery piece of cake for a country boy done some slaughtering have we pigs maybe enjoy that did we made us feel like a big grown man power of life and death hugo sniffed hard wouldnt look at spicer spicer said maybe wicklow was even easier than pigs he glanced at merrily she didnt move avoiding eye contact in the blueish gassy light spicers face was flat like his voice but when theyre in front of you facing you full on and they know its coming and theyre fighting to stay alive thats not so easy is it he took a step towards hugo who edged himself into a corner stumbling over a crate i mean that is unbelievably more difficult even when its two of you hard boys against one little woman merrilys mouth was suddenly dry amazing how long the life stays in them isnt it syd spicer said you slash and you slash and theyre all over the place wouldnt have believed it would you how much life there is to deal with when theyre determined to keep it hacking it away bit by bit but it still clings on and you start to panic too and shes screaming and crying and flailing and spitting just to hold on to that precious godgiven gift of life so precious to her and so cheap to you up to now and maybe this is when you realize for the first time what a huge item life is but you cant stop now and you just keep slash stop it fuck you hugo running at him face red and wet and twisted just syd spicer sidestepped and tipped him almost gently to the stone flags he said over his shoulder would you do that merrily wait in the car keep a lookout no merrily said i dont think so difficult times in old england the line lol said the line from here from whiteleafed oak through all the hilltops and wychehill church how does winnie see that an energy line or a spirit path there was silence except for an owl somewhere lol was thinking about jane and colemans meadow where the dead can travel he said im just trying to help you to remember tim began to rock backwards and forwards his bulk alternately blocking out the moon and then exposing it hed gone soft and rambling again exercises to do winnie gave you exercises breathing and meditation pretty hard at first but i kept on i persevered and then it i had to visualize him walking and mr phoebus we had a photo enlarged to lifesize and put it in the hall so it looked as if he was there waiting to to ride out and you visualized this yes sometimes when i was walking the hills at night i felt i was able to hear what he could hear the hidden themes in the whistling of the wind id just start walking and hed bring me here come along young un he loved to come to whiteleafed oak one of his favourite walks when he lived at birchwood when he was working on g on gerontius when his mind was hovering between life and death and whatever comes he was walking this path in his dreams and he still does yes so you visualized elgar coming along the path to and from whiteleafed oak or along the road with mr phoebus to wychehill church or the other way so earlier on when you were whistling the cello concerto sometimes when you do it properly all the way its as if there are two of you whistling it its very weird and thrilling lol succumbed to a small shiver and is that where you walk along the spirit path from hilltop to hilltop by the iron age sites and the monastic chapels and shrines from wychehill to the beacon hangmans hill midsummer hill whiteleafed oak yes thats the way you came tonight tims face contorted to escape from the demons im sorry just when you think youve come through it all the demons are there tim swung round its the price you have to pay for what for daring to reach for the highest you have to get past the demons first and who are the demons tim stood up moved to the open front of the barn holding on to one of the supporting uprights began to beat his head against it in the end merrily had agreed to go out and move the car out of the yard into a space suggested by spicer behind one of the barns shed just had to get out of there she took the opportunity to try again to get through to lol voicemail jane voicemail gomer endless ringing in an empty bungalow and now it was late getting on for eleven surely she didnt try bliss again as she stood in the yard breathing in the soft sweet summer air a different countryside lay revealed the moon was high now and white and hard less of a security lamp than a hunting tool owl sounds flickered through the woodland a screen for shadowy slaughter owls hunting talons out jets of blood and small lives taken big lives too and god looking diplomatically away supervising the sunrise in another hemisphere merrily felt numb isolated cored by outrage and horror also starved of light starved of knowledge a spectator who didnt even understand the game when she went back the atmosphere in the cellar was tight with a strippeddown harshness syd spicers sleeves were rolled up the reverend s d spicer try to imagine him celebrating communion visiting the sick organizing a donkey for the church nativity play the gullet he was saying nodding yeah that makes sense i shouldve thought of that syd and hugo were sitting on upturned crates hugo looked up when merrily came in then looked away merrily noticed a new bruise just below his left eye but more than that he looked emotionally beaten dulled by defeat he sniffed occasionally his eyes watering his thin face bony in the purply fluorescence resentment there and selfpity the sullen ugliness of corrupted youth she looked at syd at his still small eyes the gullet hugo is on his gap year merrily syd said he was going to spend it with the west malvern hunt but of course the ban put a stop to that theyre not even doing drag hunts hugo whats the point of that hugo said its a joke a lot of disappointment in your family then hugo snorted and a lot of rage syd said to understand this you need to understand the rage the way it ferments the ingredients remember when the mp for worcester was in the forefront of the campaign for a total ban mustve seemed like a betrayal from within yeah betrayal upon betrayal the hunting ban was just the final insult years before that theyd killed your grandfather turned your dads life around the government the ec the way the farmers in every other european country seemed to ignore the new rules but britains farmers got away with nothing and then the great plagues mad cow disease and the ban on exports foot and mouth when the countryside smelled of smoke and burning flesh itll never be the same hugo said we built this country we made it what it was and now theyve giving it all away to the scum eating their cheap foreign meat from supermarkets owned by foreigners and the one law they pass that isnt crawling up the euroarse its a ban on hunting theyll be coming for your guns soon land of hope and glory mother of the free joke syd said you know sometimes thinking back to the regiment it was hard to work out who you were fighting for had to come down to values in the end you start thinking youre doing it for blair and brown it dont work at all luckily we still got her maj syd smiled obviously its worse for an old family came with the conquest the devereauxs bit later good long time though longer than the windsors a long and glorious history going down the pan were not the only ones no i appreciate that syd said difficult times in old england tell me about wicklow came to my father for a job did he cheeky it was a bit like close to blackmail thought he was clever but he didnt know anything really thought he was hard and we were middleclass and soft they dont know what hard is the city boys strip off all the bling and boasting take their guns away theyre weak thick as shit its why they always get caught you dont need scum like that and was i right syd said you waited for him in the cave no he was using the cave dealing out of there thought that was smart we waited for him to come out of the cave we were in the trees then the rocks behind the cave you and louis yeah bang pro job then louis sent the text to khan text what was that for hugo shut his mouth syd put his head on one side looking sorrowful his fingers flexing slightly it was enough louis had these lines about druid sacrifice from an elgar cd hugo said we put it in the text to khan from wicklows phone louis said it was like a warning of what he was taking on old england showing its teeth syd said how dare these lowlifes pollute the malverns with their noxious substances and the elgar that would also be why the police pulled tim neat double whammy dad didnt think so he didnt think it was cool doing him on the stone either hes like you dont get flash you dont get cocky and if it looks a bit intelligent the police can narrow it down right away but louisd done it by then and it did work nearly but then someone else figured it out someone your ole man really did underestimate for a while yeah your dad know what you did to her tonight hugo stared at the stone flags does now he was here when you came back yeah mad pretty pissed off hugos head jerked forward hedve wanted it done though he said he pissed off that you couldnt handle it or that louis made you go with him mainly hugo found a sickly smile mainly he was mad that loste wasnt in the gullet merrily said the gullet syd ignored her so wheres he now your old man and louis out there he finishing the job maybe where i dont know syd tilted his head put his hands on his knees as if he was about to get up terror bloomed in hugos eyes merrily went cold i dont know please hugo rolled off his crate onto the flags putting his hands up honest to god syd stood up hugo rolled away he was weeping im locking you in son syd stepped away from him at some stage the policell be told where you are when they arrive id cooperate fully if i were you hugo nodded sagging not trying to get up its completely finished hugo but im guessing you knew that in lostes back room theres a point where you cross a barrier and louis led you right to the wire and you didnt go over its a life you didnt quite take and youll be grateful for that hugo said nothing syd motioned to merrily and followed her out of the door the door was oak and reinforced and not very old syd tried various keys until one of them locked it i hope you didnt want to pray with the boy merrily but im afraid that wouldve conveyed the wrong message unlike hitting him again once god forgive me but experience suggested it needed underlining or he mightve thought he could get away with lies or halftruths intelligent lad and hedve been able to string the cops along for a while but we dont have a while we did the best we could we hit on the weak link that was the easy part i suspect weve exhausted our quota of good fortune for one night merrily went ahead of spicer up the stone steps into the manuresmelling back hall with its coat hooks and its wellies and waited for him by the door to the courtyard she felt reduced and dirty and a long and twisted way from god whats the gullet syd spicer hung the bunch of keys on one of the coat hooks the gullet is this deep pool flooded quarry up near the beacon people get drowned there sometimes kids thinking its safe for a swim on summer nights like this only its very very cold and its on tim lostes regular route they knew this theyd followed him enough times takes him close to the gullet the plan was to mess him with winnies blood and turn him loose and catch up with him near the gullet and then oops only what happened with winnie hugo couldnt take it hes only a boy hugo went badly to pieces and louis had to take him outside case he left vomit anywhere and of course by the time louisd slapped some sense into hugo tim was away not quite on the usual path either which was understandable under the circumstances and they couldnt find him they were going to toss him in the gullet drown him nothing easier so many accidents there but this would be suicide louiss scenario ends with the recovery from the gullet maybe tomorrow of the body winnies blood not quite washed away murder and suicide case closed only tim had wandered off cant trust drugs where did you put the car merrily what drugs wheres the car in the dutch barn like you said trying to keep pace with spicer across the yard what am i not getting what crucial piece of information have i been denied spicer kept on walking pointing around the courtyard building to building the density of it row upon row nicely leaning stone and timbered alleyways reaching back into the fields and the woodland merrily persisted drugs theyd spiked his scotch roofies what rohypnol know what that is the daterape drug compliance do what you want with them softened up plus it causes shortterm memory loss which is useful tim habitually leaves his door unlocked for elgar or whoever hugo comes in earlier in the day spikes his whisky with rohypnol tasteless odourless works well with alcohol as we all know on men as well as women if you get the dose right the effects are usually predictable can be used in combination with certain drugs to improve the high hugo told you this emily once your dont ask but whether that means loste was sitting there with a vacant smile on his face when they were killing winnie oh my god we dont know that we dont know how much he had but that sounds likely it can take hours to wear off maybe hes asleep somewhere on the hill maybe i dont know time he comes out of it blood on his hands and his clothes he may even think winnie was down to him but the plan was he wouldnt come out of it they reached the car and merrily handed spicer the keys glad she wouldnt be driving syd what is this thinking what bliss had said about outrage killing fight for our traditions were branded criminals devereaux had said this governments scum antienglish dont get me started rage against the system little englander vigilantism gone mad winnie hacked to death by the sons of a former lover like the climax of some old and bloody folkballad we could spend all night going over the farm spicer said and i could doubtless show you signs things that are obvious when you know but it would take a long time and im afraid we dont have that kind of time whiteleafed oak you said thats where he goes loste loste yes he was gripping her shoulders youre sure about this we were supposed to meet them there tonight loste and winnie lols waiting in case he theyll find him then maybe they already have what about lol i dont think we should hang around merrily what will they do to lol they surely why dont i drop you in the village give you the keys to the rectory dont even think about it all right spicer opened the passenger door for her perhaps a serious prayer wouldnt come amiss i can never seem to do it when im driving mr phoebus and the whiteleafed oak tim loste and the oak stood together under the moon with its acidgreen halo tell me about the demons lol said hed followed tim out of the barn leaving the lamp behind in the hay tim no longer staggered as if beating his head on one of the uprights had unblocked something he looked slowly around the whitewashed wooded valley and finally up at the great oak its branches laden with dark foliage and glittering things like some weird midsummer hoar frost a living symphony this tree look at the complexity of it were old mates now im bringing up some of the children tim started to laugh sat here meditating for hours all weathers freezing cold snowed on soaked to the skin elgars mother would have approved yes was nobody curious about what you were doing the few people who come here if youre meditating they leave you alone they understand that much lol tried again the demons that is the royal oak the demonic counterpoint to what youre doing like when the demons come for the soul of gerontius theyre discordant theyre taunting him didnt really notice it tim said not at first you didnt hear the noise i could block it out with headphones put on the old cans close my eyes and im in a concert hall or a cathedral or when im writing just put them on unplugged and its a blank canvas but she made me take them off she said it was meant winnie made me take my headphones off while i was writing to experience the violence suppose i didnt react strongly enough so we walked down the hill one night a saturday night wed been drinking well i d been and she said this is evil its deriding you and it was filling the valley terribly loud and i was getting pretty sick of it and i said cant we go and then she took me to where there was a loose stone in the wall she made you throw the stone through the window had a few drinks and you learn not to make her annoyed and then just stood there thinking what the bloody hell have i done now next thing theyre all on me big chaps beat the shit out of me and where was winnie gone for help she let them beat you up tim sat down under the tree shes a writer he said driving through wychehill picking up speed but not too much syd spicer said you understand about louis devereaux now loves to kill merrily fumbled out a cigarette both hands shaking once you sat down it all caught up with you again odd thing was emily was always antihunting till she started going out with louis and then it was oh he just does it for the riding and the excitement i wasnt too happy about a teenage kid going out with a bloke six years older so i asked around theres a few hunting types in my other parishes some of them very doubtful about louis they passed the gates of wychehill church with its cracked lantern alight cant you go any faster syd too many traffic cops theyll stop anybody tonight merrily had rung bliss again and left a slightly hysterical urgent message on his voicemail now she was even wondering about trying to get howe meanwhile groping for selfreassurance no way anyones going to mistake lol for tim loste not even in the countryside in the dark please god she lit the cigarette lets have the worst then im telling you this in case we run into him heroics are inadvisable louis will kill anything example when the hounds start to slow up in the chase they get shot a side of hunting seldom advertised louis would volunteer to do it for other hunts as well which made him popular with kennel men who mainly dislike that side of it theres more of course mostly hearsay essentially people who love to kill will find or create a need for it justification what it tells me is that killing wicklow after louis justified it to himself would have been an act done in a frenzy of pure excitement you understand that feeling i understand the rush you get when you convince yourself that in the great scheme of things its not only justified but necessary when you know that a difficult situation can only be resolved by an act of swift efficient intense and quite colossal violence and to a woman no spicer said no i could never see that far merrily thought irrationally of lyndon pierce and the blue tits tiny mean cowardly violence with no risk to self for the devereaux boys something far bigger a war but winnie sometimes its a fine line merrily luckily in the armed forces especially the more handson areas theres also a very thick line and its called training and without that without training theres no efficiency and no safe judgement in this instance were looking at a perceived justification gone wild your daughter had a relationship with louis wouldnt hear a word against him well hes a charming boy ok he was arrested for attacking an mps minder during a prohunt protest well a lot of strong feelings at the time ok he went to pieces when the ban went through poor boy his life dismantled goes off to the city at weekends to work off his frustrations nicked for possession of coke gets a caution well he was chastened by that and look how hes changed merrily was thinking about the five minutes or less shed spent in the company of louis devereaux posh educated goodlooking flirtatious he was one of the reasons you wanted emily out of wychehill he was one of the reasons i wanted winnie out of wychehill so stopping them using the church partly syd merrily gulping smoke i still dont know why they did this wicklow yes an invader from the hated cities but winnie im not getting it syd swerved into the ledbury road under the ramparts of herefordshire beacon take too long merrily and im still not totally sure of my facts and your blokes out there and he doesnt know what else is does he at first seeing the curious white clouds in the northern sky lol had thought for a moment that time itself at whiteleafed oak was unreliable and this was the dawn but the visible landmarks had told him the lights were in the wrong part of the sky these were just unusually pale clouds over the southern malverns gassy white and luminous as if they were chemically producing their own glow it lit up the valley like a vast sports stadium and lol was starting to see the pattern the structure this much was not fantasy tim loste was working on a piece of music in the dramatized semioperatic style of the dream of gerontius and it was about gerontius or rather about the spiritual and emotional challenges for elgar of composing what was regarded as his greatest work orchestrating a metaphysical world but it was also about lostes own links with both gerontius and elgar some perceived by loste some perceived or constructed by winnie sparke bizarre but art was allowed even expected to be bizarre when you came to wychehill it was as if you were entering a different world elgars world and winnies your guardian angel that really came to you in a dream tims eyes widened there was enough light now to see that they were not yet normal like an owls eyes had a horrible ghastly dream dreamed that winnie was bleeding i heard her screaming her heart out i saw the shadows of demons but i couldnt do anything why couldnt i do anything lol looked at the stains on tims singlet when was this i dont know last night gha ghastly he stared at lol his eyes still too wide look i dont how do you know all this about me just know people whove worked with you whose lives youve changed what are you doing here i think i wanted to learn im a musician of sorts yes tim seemed to accept that his mind veering off again used to walk the hills night after night listening to g along the path gerontius wanting to die because i knew i was never going to be as good as that i was engaged and she wanted us to go to london chance of a teaching job with some conducting on the side with a jolly decent choir but winnie was on the scene by then said i mustnt leave elgar got the ring thrown back at me pretty bad times at work all got too much kept on listening to g over and over got drunk embraced death but then winnie told you that you didnt have to die she rescued you you called her the guardian angel she said the journey could be accomplished in this life through the use of symbolism with great art as a byproduct whats it going to be called tim looked blank for a moment the white clouds were like pillows on the lumpy mattress of the hills mr phoebus he said at last mr phoebus and the whiteleafed oak i like it its a wonderful title winnies doing a book too all about me and elgar elgars biographer kennedy says elgar scored gerontius in a kind of trance lol said yes composing g he said he could look out from birchwood and see the soul rise tremendous emotional experience state of nearecstasy when hed finished it that was the summer hed learned to ride a bike in his element laughing and joking and then tims chin sank into his chest then it all went wrong first performance in birmingham complete disaster chorus was underrehearsed and performed badly the chorus master had died suddenly and the man they brought in to replace him wasnt up to the job all went to pieces elgar was suicidal actually suicidal it brought on the most dreadful depression i wish i were dead he kept saying he wrote ive always said god was against art swore hed never again attempt to write religious music closed his mind against the spiritual course in later years g would be beautifully performed its genius exalted but in the early days elgar thought it was cursed why because he thought god was punishing him for overreaching his mere humanity for daring to approach to approach god i suppose headon you mean through the music after the soul has withstood the torments of the demons after his encounter with the angel of the agony as he approaches judgement hes given one glimpse sudden cataclysmic of the holiest god a glimpse of god yes and elgar had to convey that in music couldnt do it tim said or wouldnt shied away from it as a catholic he was afraid it might be approaching blasphemy anyway thought hed finished ive put my hearts blood into the score he said and sent the manuscript to his publishers thought hed got away with it but his friend there friend and confidant august jaeger accused him of bottling it running scared of the big moment jaegers saying youre not doing enough with this youre not showing us god youre not giving us the moment pushing him and elgar the timid catholic going cant not humanly possible almost blasphemous to try to convey in music the ultimate blinding light tims deceptively warlike face glowing now with sweat in the unnatural night whiteness and this you see in my own work this is elgars most agonized solo we agreed winnie and i that it should contain elements of foreboding perhaps a premonition of that disastrous first performance in birmingham nice touch lol said jaeger was joshing him knew exactly how to handle the poor chap he said something like of course conveying the full glory of god that would take a wagner lol nodded elgars major influence had been wagner so elgar goes back to try again looks like musobanter to us now jaeger winding elgar up but it would have cut him to the quick yes of course he went back back here to whiteleafed oak where else and what happened on a basic level i suppose youd say he simply restructured some chords to manufacture a climactic moment this short series of swiping chords and then do you know g to a point certainly this point the guardian angel had warned the soul that the momentary vision would blow him away with its power when it finally happened it was barely flaggedup and it went through your spine that single chord every time you heard it like a razoredged shining scythe you see my job here i have to capture the moment it came to elgar or mr phoebus fails thats why youre here have to catch the moment and more more no good just copying elgar dan you have to try to take it further or whats the point further than elgar winnie believes that whatever happened to him was so personal and terrifying that he was still afraid to orchestrate the full intensity of it clearly the buildup to that one frightening revelatory slashing chord was enough to convince jaeger winnie god knows dan im not the bravest chap on the block either but winnie believes i can widen the crack in the door thats lol stepped back thats a big thing tim the biggest thats what the preparations all been about those three simultaneous choirs in the three churches yes and the shes not without ambition is she winnie and the exercises the meditation and the visualization endless and the need for elgar to be part of it i just couldnt hack it at first too much of an ordinary bloke dan tim sighed sat down on the grass there was a girl on a bike legs pumping up and down for a while we no his voice going shrill and transatlantic dont you realize you will never have a chance like this again you gonna throw it all away winnie i owe her so much you see saved my life made my life lol said nothing tim blotted the sweat from around his eyes with the heel of his palm yes we had a practice in the three churches would have been wonderful to have the three cathedrals hundreds of choristers but even winnies energy doesnt extend that far and did you come here to whiteleafed oak when the choirs were in the three churches no i was at wychehill then drove to little malvern it was a runthrough only a runthrough did winnie think it was going to be just a runthrough dan i was scared quite often scared gerontius has always scared me you think its easy to live with something so cosmically huge day in day out and the nights tried to psych myself up on the quiet booze wasnt doing it i even went up the hill one night scored a few not my thing at all normally few grams of coke offthey said id killed him did you know that lol nodded i was scared dan this hallowed place i dont know is it hallowed are we fed still by the old choirs help me would be good to think so and lol saw it all now the psychology of it she said the journey could be accomplished in this life through the use of symbolism with great art as a byproduct all it needed was for tim to believe in it strongly enough through months of meditation visualization conditioning and the magic would happen are you frightened lol said tim covered his face with his hands for a moment and then tore them away and looked all around at the strange blanched landscape a winter landscape in the heat of june looked up into the northern sky where the white gaseous clouds hung like smothered lamps over the southern malverns a great orchestral slash of light dan his one shattering glimpse of god and gerontius sings worshipful submission as a kind of triumph tim stepping away from the tree raising his arms releasing this vast torn and piercing tenor take me awayyyyyyyyyy tim sank to his knees kept his eyes down think its time for you to bugger off dan you need to be alone for this otherwise theres no courage required tim said is there suppose not what are you going to do tim placed a hand on his chest over the stained singlet all happens in here right lol turned and walked away from the oak just be careful tim grinned after a few paces lol looked over his shoulder to see what he knew he was going to see what the combination of the moon and those northern clouds had done to the leaves of the oak lifeforce a painfully slow and twisting halfmile short of whiteleafed oak syd spicer asked merrily to feel under her seat for a small leather case night glasses hightech he cleared his throat we all loved our gadgets the hereford boys the hereford boys she found the case look theres something i shouldve mentioned but with winnie merrily gripped the sides of her seat every time she thought of the name she saw the breathless mouth the unseeing eyes the body ripped up like old clothes a woman who was sometimes a lifeforce and sometimes a vampire we can see this place from some distance right reasonably well but theres lots of cover when you get there dells copses within a minute a small green area came up in the headlights a display case for local notices this the village yes and the fivebarred gate end of that little lane but you cant get i mean youll just block the track ill pull in here then close your door quietly when you get out at the fivebarred gate spicer pointed ahead of them he was still wearing his thin black gloves know what that is shiny white clouds weird noctilucent clouds quite rare sometimes caused by chemicals sometimes natural second night this week weve had them maybe a good thing maybe not but something to be aware of what were you going to tell me back there when you mentioned the hereford boys i dont know whether you heard this on the news a former sas mans been shot in hereford spicer kept on looking over the gate but hed gone still a security consultant merrily said do you know his name malcolm france he went on watching the bright clouds bliss the detective i know called me about it his records had been stolen but they found out from the bank that hed once been paid two hundred and fifty pounds by winnie sparke syd he was standing so still youd swear he wasnt breathing just tell me merrily said my mate we were working together until a few seconds ago i thought we still were oh god im syd spicer held up his palms for silence ill give you the basics winnies convinced shes going to be the next mrs devereaux and all her money problems are over when he dumps her she starts obsessing over whether theres someone else kind of woman she is life on the scrap heap not for winnie comes to bits on my kitchen table i tell her theres this mate of mine could check him out she doesnt have much money to spare and therere things i want to know too it was expedient i put up some of the fee on the side cash in hand i shouldve told you about him ages ago but it circumstances intervened how were you to know i did know i knew winnie had been his client yeah well another thing you should know syd said he was the guy i rang back at wychehill soon as i saw the body i left a halfcoded message i told him to go to the police with everything he knew mal always checked his messages very assiduously every hour i was about to call him back bring him up to date he has had police contacts and credibility merrily felt lightheaded now nobody in the police could know they were here she watched syd spicer opening the gate he was a bloody good guy went through the first gulf war did bosnia syd kicked the fivebarred gate hard once until it jammed against the long grass and quivered were on our own he said and your training says go back phone for help except your blokes yes he is lol didnt go far how could he where was he supposed to go was he going to leave a damaged man to wait like some halfdemented hermit in the rocks for god elgar had been right it was a kind of blasphemy or at least arrogance not really tim lostes arrogance he was the tool of someones elses ambition all he was going to face tonight was the cold unredemptive shining of his own madness his own induced madness and yet lol walked away over the rise and followed a slow arc back towards the open barn went down on his knees as he approached it patting the grass in search of his phone and yet he understood he understood the desperation of elgar who had done it before made art and was afraid as you always were every time that you were never going to be able to do it again that your best had gone and he knew that what elgar was drawing from the landscape was not like his contemporary vaughan williams inspiration from an english rural tradition because elgars style was influenced more by german music wagner no this was about pure electrical energy energy was what elgar with his daily walking and his fiftymile bike rides was all about what he was tapping from the countryside was its lifeforce the trees are singing my music or am i singing theirs what happened when the trees stopped singing or in lostes case never had sung much how far would you go lol looked into the sky where strange white lights were kindling pale sparks in the springing antennae of the ancient oak he imagined tim loste huddled like a goblin into its bole the difference was that elgar had been a natural he didnt need photo blowups or three choirs singing praise to the holiest at the stroke of midnight or whatever kind of golden dawn ceremonial magic they were planning he didnt need a structure this was wrong lol on all fours felt his heart beating and discovered one hand was embedded in a patch of nettles it came out stinging like hell and holding the mobile phone still switched on and it still had battery life lol let out a long breath stumbled to his feet and took it into the barn crouching in the hay he found three messages the last of which ended winnie murdered keep away from it i love you hed started to call her back when he heard a voice tims voice conversational if he was talking to god it hadnt taken long to break the ice lol moved out of the barn up the rise he saw tim with roots humped around him like serpents and across his knees the leatherbound book open to the score of mr phoebus and the whiteleafed oak the man sitting next to him handed him a hip flask and tim drank into the pit merrily watched preston devereaux screw the top back on his hip flask and stow it inside his dark green overalls she slipped back behind syd spicer with no idea how to play this looking at lol coming up the rise and willing him not to move not to speak looking across at syd and realizing he had no idea how to react either seeing preston devereaux coming slowly to his feet among the roots of the sacred oak tim loste huddling into the tree nobody spoke syd was watching devereaux the vapour trail of a plane you couldnt hear was like a chalk scribble on the shiny sky it struck merrily the chances were that none of them could be entirely sure what the others were doing here or how much each of them knew in which case go for it she walked up to the base of the tree put out a hand mr loste my names merrily ive been trying to talk to you for days relief was amazing at first it weakened you and then it flung you back into life with an unexpected strength and a vividly heightened sense of reality suddenly there was nothing you couldnt handle which was probably dangerous but what the hell tim loste was on his feet now his back to the bole of the oak his hand felt like soft cheese merrily glanced at lol gave him a halfsmile her eyebrows slightly raised and then turned back to tim he had winnies blood all over him she wondered if hed even noticed it without syd the chances of him talking his way out of this one would have been remote annie howe would have him charged by daybreak and a press release put out merrily wondered how long the effects of rohypnol lasted wondered what was in preston devereauxs hip flask how much of it tim had drunk im sorry we had to meet like this mr loste but we heard you were coming to whiteleafed oak and syd very kindly offered to show me the way she looked up at devereaux of course we didnt expect i like to walk devereaux said slowly when the tourists have gone home dont get many nights like this where you can see for miles syd said its what did you call it noctilucence syd said happens more often in other countries ive spent time in quite an intimate place really the malverns merrily looked at lol id imagine its hard to go anywhere without running into people you know sorry you are dan lol said im in tims choir merrily nodded chanced her arm again we thought winnie might be here didnt meet her on the way we havent seen her lol said on your own preston syd walked across and stood with his back to the tree only thought i saw one of the boys possibly louis he hadnt had he yes im on my own tonight syd nice to get away for a while merrilys relief twisted into tension as she moved close to lol well devereaux said if youve come all this way to talk to tim merrily i should leave you to it i dont know what the subject of your discussions going to be but if its what i think it is well you know my views ill say goodnight to you he walked away merrily whispering to lol did you get my just does loste know about winnie no whats he doing here on his own long story basically hes come to expose himself to the blinding light of god like gerontius take me away what yeah night preston syd called out careful of the gullet preston devereaux walked no more than forty paces before he stopped and shrugged and turned back four of them sitting on the ridged and knobbly earth at the edge of the sacrificial pit like some surreal midnight picnic party tim loste hadnt moved from the oak syd spicer was hunched between devereaux and merrily his legs overhanging the hollow as if he was conducting a confirmation class at the front of his church careful of the gullet hed wanted this confrontation some payback for all those weeks without his family or something merrily was furious and anxious if this was an example of the benefits of training the bastard hadnt left the regiment a day too soon i suppose were people who know each other mostly syd said and what we are preston devereaux had his cap tilted over his eyes reluctant returned exile begetter of murderers you for instance are such a clever man preston with such stupid sons devereaux didnt look at him shouldve stopped when you were ahead all you needed was to sit tight and do nothing devereaux slipped him a look yeah thats what i thought syd said thats exactly what you were doing nothing been shifted through old wychehill for quite a while or mal wouldve known you shouldve ignored wicklow too somebody else wouldve had him sooner or later maybe you were ignoring him but not louis louiss a real hard man louis has to act merrily sat with goose bumps forming on her folded arms unsure of the sense of this fears over lol had blocked all meaningful consideration of what might be happening the phrase outrage crime covering all family you always reckoned it was a curse syd turned to merrily the boy louis likes to show off show how inventive he is for a long time i was thinking i wonder if preston knows do i have a word but sometimes god saves us from ourselves you noticed that preston devereaux said irritably all the conversations weve had syd you never brought god into it not once this is not a good time to start fair enough to answer your earlier question merrily winnie gave mal two hundred and fifty quid up front to find out if preston was seeing another woman winnie against everything she stood for being crazy about preston on a whim i bunged mal a quiet grand to extend the inquiry into not that he wouldntve done it anyway purely out of interest maybe a bit bored with the work he was getting this was the real thing again we sat up late one night at the rectory and planned it like an operation the hereford boys ride again winnie was mals cover story if they rumbled him he liked that we both liked it im afraid am i supposed to know who youre talking about devereaux sounding bored oh im very upset about mal preston and god help me very angry my guess is it was someone came in from wales rather than louis but that changes nothing it still all comes back to old wychehill merrily coughed im not badly wanting a cigarette not really getting this diversification merrily preston decided to follow the governments advice to the letter government helps destroy the basis of traditional agriculture farmers complain government says use your heads be adventurous diversify preston devereaux a deeply embittered man full of hatred some of it justified fair play says thank you for the advice ill do just that putting words into my mouth syd merrily realizing even as devereaux spoke that there was no need to and we turned it around by god we did in spite of the shinyarsed civil servants and the scum from brussels she gazed into the pit dear god trying to be a priest mal tailed preston day after day syd spicer said into worcester gloucester and cheltenham parts of birmingham finally down towards tregaron near where the old acid factory was back in the s the only deals preston cuts in wychehill at the moment are with people who come to stay in his holiday apartments but im guessing that in the early days it was buzzing preston devereaux slid his hand into a pocket of his overall syd moved closer to him devereaux brought out a packet of cigarettes held it up syd nodded but prestons still got to be directing the business else why would he be making the visits sometimes he goes alone to worcester or cheltenham sometimes its him and louis mal had to lie a bit to winnie because occasionally theyd drop into clubs and massage parlours as well sampling the pleasures of the cities they were poisoning but mostly it was private houses or the offices of an independent cattlefeed dealer or a couple of familyowned abattoirs the service industries victims of blairs slow demolition of englands oldest industry devereaux said merrily shifted on the baked earth still resisting the urge to smoke how long since mal france told you all this syd over a period up to last night on his way back from the west wales coast had to leave in a hurry to lose someone on a motorbike seems to be a string across the border counties and down through midwales couple of coastal landowners some of it mainly smack comes in that way all courtesy of selected tightlipped farmers and no profession has tighter lips than farming inbred silence inbred resentment watertight supplemented in this case by people who lost jobs after the hunting ban a feudal thing really old feudal instincts almost god forbid a crusade devereaux lit a cigarette syd moved away from the smoke not quite sure how long its been going on maybe two years maybe four it only starts to make serious sense when you look back to prestons formative years his university years oxford merrily said balliol in the s wasnt that guy the welsh guy mr nice howard marks thats him worldclass dope dealer living legend in his field and as it happens a student at balliol college in the s you knew him preston before my time not that much before by my reckoning maybe you just had some of the same contacts im guessing here you understand im just a simple cleric but where mr marks stuck with dope marijuanabased goods evangelical with him merrily remembered yeah a real calling so hes always maintained the fact that he also made a few fortunes before he was nicked and banged up in the states preston its different different background altogether and different attitude fuelled by this selfrighteous blind resentment powerful its in his norman blood blood of the vikings devereaux smiled merrily saw lol stand up and wander over to the oak tree mal reckoned it probably wasnt as difficult as you might think syd said just a question of renewing old student contacts and making connections with new ones cultures have changed of course wouldve taken patience at first convincing the sources but when they know youre a safe pair of hands and that you mean it thats the important thing showing them that just because you come from money that doesnt mean youre soft merrily said wicklow would reverberate nicely but the way it was done stupid attentiongrabbing but like i say louiss immature he thinks its hugely clever the sacrificial stone he sent a text about human sacrifice to raji khan from elgars caractacus whether that was intended to point to tim whatever it came off when youre arrogant and cocksure and on a high things often do come off for a while but its cleverclever and so immature preston knows that anybody in their right mind if it was really necessary to get rid of wicklow theyd do it the way someone got rid of that guy in pershore forget his name chris smith which the police think was wicklow smith worked in an abattoir ah one of your boys preston devereaux said nothing not once had he admitted to anything specific farms abattoirs feed merchants little crack labs some of them the stuff moved in cattle transporters feed trucks the kind of countryroad vehicles the police were never going to search in a million years shambolic but also very neat i believe we might also be looking at secret compartments in the suvs and peoplecarriers of the holidaymakers coming to stay in prestons luxury units bet youd find some of those holidaymakers had only just been on holiday some to spain some to lessfavoured resorts like which is it these days rotterdam be more than happy devereaux said for the police to search all my buildings id challenge them to find a trace of anything lying fallow at the moment are we preston movable feast innit what a dozen farms more whichever way you look at it this has to be the most successful farmers cooperative since the first iron age village what about raji khan merrily said still a bit of a mystery there syd said hes not clean obviously but he must be a very small player by comparison cant be involved or hed never have been allowed to move in so close what was that like preston raji moving in you mustve been awful nervy did he know or didnt he if he ever found out that could be tricky and always a possibility with ambitious little men like wicklow around and do you officially support the opposition leonard holliday and wrag difficult one especially if it attracted too much publicity merrily said thus engaging the attention of hundreds of thousands of elgar enthusiasts all over the world you really had to curb mr holliday didnt you and maybe do something about tim loste syd said very much a wild card and supported more than supported by your former good friend but not any more winnie sparke i tried to warn her best i could she wouldnt buy it syd she said this is england lol didnt do drugs the only reason he had to be grateful to his psychiatric hospital a sojourn in medication city and you never wanted to swallow so much as an aspirin ever again the white in the sky had dulled the oak was going grey a great and beautiful mystery had shrunk to something squalid lol sat down next to tim whispered to him how much did you drink from the hip flask chap offers you a swig not the thing to decline dan depends whos offering raised it to my lips faked it oh if he brought it back now id drink the lot elgar was right old cock gods against art may just be lol said that artists dont have mystical experiences artists are a medium think of it as an internal process youre not aware of you dont have to see blinding light and the heavenly host you might sit down tomorrow and itll all come out in the music youre full of bullshit dan anyone ever tell you that never lol said honestly im normally a lowkey sort of bloke but it did seem to me as if the leaves had turned white dont give up give it a try for winnie tim said tim thought it was a dream thought it was a fucking dream i didnt know either im sorry blocked it out why didnt i stop them why couldnt because somehow you were drugged sedated ive been there seen it happen i can tell you for certain there was nothing you couldve done its a sick fucking joke dan ive been sitting here all this time waiting for tims hands squeezing the roots either side of him as a gentleman im listening to you devereaux said just not talking to you a gentleman merrily sat up a gentleman who kills kids teenagers with infected syringes teenagers who murder old ladies in their own homes to steal enough to keep them going for another week preston devereaux stared into the shadows below his feet the cities are a lost cause mrs watkins reinfecting themselves on their own sewage nothing to be done about that the road to ruin no doubt the two of you can find biblical parallels and out of the ruins will rise what better government devereaux said at first merrily thought he was coughing over his cigarette but he was laughing she looked at syd spicer where was he going with this did he have some plan that she couldnt see why hadnt he just let devereaux walk away why did he have to throw out that remark about the gullet why did you kill winnie sparke syd asked i didnt whoever murdered france took his files merrily said just wanting to end this presumably thats where they found winnies name who would recognize that but you winnies names on mals books syd said so it must be winnie whos paying him to look into the drug operation and winnie being winnie a loose cannon my fault shouldve been my name syd this is not something you could ever have predicted who rumbled mal syd said id like to know that preston devereaux tossed his cigarette end into the pit who told you about the gullet he said you were going to take tim back that way right you waited for mr robinson to leave and then you were in with the spiked scotch and time to go home tim how desperate was that who told you about the gullet hugo actually hugo devereaux looking at him at last we have to get our information where we can where is he syd hes a boy hes no more a boy than half the drug barons in birmingham and if you tell me he hasnt killed anybody i wouldnt be sure and neither could you cant control these boys like you used to can you let them go too far down the road maybe thats another reason old wychehills been fallow for a bit you trying to rein louis in before its too late tell me who rumbled mal or what or tell the police when they get here i dont mind itll add to what theyll have learned from hugo already naming names faster than they can write them down hugo doesnt know any names boy goes around with his eyes shut does he its over preston its disintegrating as we speak thats what im trying to get across to you youve told me some farfetched theories thats that s because im not trying to trick you mate and because ive been trying maybe not too successfully to be a priest sometimes especially lately i have to keep reminding myself that thats what i am now i can look at this situation and see clearly what would be the best way of dealing with it if i was still in the army the situation being the situation being a dangerous young man out there and probably more dangerous because hes frightened and not really with his background the big gangster he thinks he is hes clever but clevers not the same as smart police see what louis did its an armed response unit marksmen all over the hills the soldier in me would take him out asap expedience but the priest doesnt want another death not even louiss and how would the priest avoid that i think by letting you walk away like you did a short time ago you presumably know where he is so you can explain to him what ive just explained to you and then the two of you can walk into a police station of your choice or leave the country leaving young hugo to take all the weight nah youve got some honour left its the best thing you can do as a father and a clever man exercise some control over your boy tell him its pointless preston devereaux straightened his back hands on his knees there was a glaze of sweat on his forehead under the line of his cap wheres the point in that syd when youve already told him perhaps louis devereaux had been there the whole time plenty of cover coppices and dells perhaps syd had known this he halfturned and looked up at louis with no surprise merrily was on her feet backing away instinctively looking for lol but seeing only louis devereaux a halfsilhouette in the grey light as still for a moment as any of the oaks arms extended rigid as dead branches both hands clasped around the pistol whered you buy that louis syd said mildly very professional they say you can get them in hereford these days glock the gun twitched move away from my father rector what for which one of us you planning to shoot to prove your old man isnt in control any more and shut up shouldnt that be shut the fuck up got to get the tone right the correct phraseology shut the louiss hands jerking around the pistol i could kill you now or blow me away even blow all of us away thatd simplify things a lot like that feller in hungerford in the s you probably dont remember that youdve been just a kid but he shot himself in the end like the bloke at dunblane it always ends where they shoot themselves merrily couldnt move louis was panting with rage and frustration and probably fear on a hot night it was the most unstable combination imaginable and all syd had was the other ending is death by armed response unit like ive already told your father lots of police marksmen all over the hills automatic rifles night sights make that thing look like a spud gun and you like the crass amateur you undoubtedly are you make one more remark like that and then and for a while you get to learn what it was like for all the foxes you used to hunt only with not even the faintest possibility of an earth to escape to no escape at all from those boys terrorismtrained now and they dont take any chances at some stage one of them gets you in the crosshairs and takes you out you dont even see him taking aim like a wasp doesnt see the rolledup newspaper syd standing there with his arms by his sides an unmoving target merrilys heart going please god please god please god we can get away louis said any time we want just a question of whether nah it doesnt happen son not at this level whether we leave you fucking dead when we go you dont understand you graduated to a new level of achievement tonight mate syd said in the big school now where they spend millions hunting you down preston devereaux stood up can i talk to my son dont ask me preston hes got the weapon what do i do louiss whole body bending backwards like a waterskier tensed around the swivelling pistol what do i do you probably give the gun to me preston said we can still get out of this hes got to be lying about armed police we could louis turned the pistol pointing directly at merrily she felt a spasm below her heart like a long needle going in take mrs watkins with us and then what louis syd said demand a helicopter grow up son stay fuck louis spun but not at syd stay fucking there merrily heart jumping heard a cry from lol tim tim loste was lumbering out from the tree in his stained singlet he looked like an oldfashioned butcher arms sleeved in sweat finger out pointing at louis you were wearing a a balaclava dont come any closer louis said you wanker recognize your voice wearing a balaclava with eyeholes louis preston devereaux said its not necessary big knife you had this big she was screaming at you to stop screaming and screaming and and crying and you just you bloody bastard tim tumbled sobbing into louis and louis shot him twice seventeen i went to sleep tim said now im refreshed he tried to laugh a dry skittering noise came out merrily vaguely recognized the first words sung by the soul after death in the dream of gerontius feel so much lighter he said thats good isnt it yes merrily said thats very good time seemed to have slowed the white clouds had diminished and so had the humidity a small night breeze rattled among the boughs tim said youre jolly pretty i didnt didnt realize youd be so young way winnie talked it was as if you were some old he stopped for a breath it was a terrifying noise like a small breeze in a mound of dead leaves doesnt matter what winnie said does it i suppose not shed rung for an ambulance said shed found a man badly injured didnt know how syds advice what they didnt need was an armed response unit shed given them directions from the hamlet of whiteleafed oak her name and her mobile number telling them they could probably get an ambulance across the common without any difficulty if they took it slowly lol had brought half a bale of straw up from the barn and they put some of it under tim raising his legs syds advice he walked over both gone merrily said nothing i could do not without more of this maybe theyll get to a vehicle in time maybe they have arrangements in hand maybe theyll be on a boat out of fishguard by morning cant see that he wouldntve made provision boltholes foreign bank accounts syd had phoned west mercia police on the general number someone from worcester coming back to him merrily didnt know what had been said but spicerd had the impression that they already knew some of what he was telling them and theyd confirmed this by asking if he was the man whod left a message on malcolm frances mobile some explaining then for syd later she whispered to him theres hardly any blood internal then keep him warm dont move him merrilys head was filled with a prayer that she couldnt articulate she felt as if she was hovering over the entire scene the wooded arena with its hints of neolithic mounds its ghost of a processional way and the sacred magisterial oak stuffed with twinkling symbols of vain hopes and dreams and at its splayed feet a man whose plea to be taken away had been answered in a blinding flash tim loste looked up at her from his bed of straw his face creamed in sweat hannahs pretty yes she is used to watch out for her when she came past on her bike wished i had a bike follow her down two of us whizzing down the hill super mmm all i ever wanted really thought i might buy a bike but winnie said it would be the wrong kind not like mr phoebus no but you rode mr phoebus sometimes in your daydreams with hannah tims eyes filled up with tiny pools of moonlight know what i dont want merrily bent close to him now his sweat smelled sour you know what i really dont want wheres dan im here lol was kneeling on the other side dan knows remind me lol said it was possible to speak with normal voices now but they were whispering because tim loste was whispering tim smiled under his edward elgar yardbrush moustache through his sweat dont want the angel of the blasted agony would anybody lol said tim looked at merrily and started to say something but he was suddenly fighting for breath she beckoned syd urgently and he pushed more straw under tims legs lessens strain on the heart dont move him and dont let him get too hot syd being the soldier again as if too many priests would spoil the prayer from quite a distance away merrily heard a single gunshot not uncommon except this wasnt she was sure a shotgun she exchanged a glance with syd he went still tim was mumbling something to lol who was shaking his head no no you havent failed winnie failed thats all it couldnt work for someone like winnie you mustve known that of course it couldnt winnie and her academic magic her hitandmiss mix n match spirituality try this try that merrily suddenly saw the callousness of it whatever happened to tim winnie would have had a book out of it she could almost see the hovering spirit outlined in the acid colours of the moons halo making notes an even better book if tim was dead you just need to change the end lol said its easy seven tim said seven lol turned to merrily as tim said something else she shook her head was that seventeen lol thought for a moment and then he smiled tims eyes lit up a quiet glow appearing on the edges of the pupils faraway unknowing eyes like the light through clouds merrily took in a rapid breath just before the second shot came out of the forestry she heard the nightshredding squawks of emergency vehicles and took tim lostes hand and began to pray a list merrily bliss said quietly on the mobile before you say anything im afraid theres nothing i can do not tonight anyway frannie she said wearily where the hell have you been they were in syd spicers kitchen her and lol it was nearly two am i just called to leave a message never imagined youd still be up he sounded knackered his accent thickening just gorrin from shrewsbury went up to talk to a guy my victim malcolm france was working for bloke with serious form and it looked promising but it wasnt what we thought and im pigsick and i know its your daughter and i know that parrys a family friend but this time what you know ive always liked gomer pairsonally but some things what are you on about bliss paused where are you im tell me what you were talking about first the charges against gomer parry i did pick up your messages but i was on a major investigation i might be able to pull the odd string but not tonight cid were consulted but its a uniform thing now out of my hands gomer gomer and jane what have they done do you know a place called colemans meadow heard of it vaguely theyve trashed it with a jcb taken a fence out and destroyed an expensive vehicle are they all right oh they re all right for the present that old mans a complete maniac of course which you know and jane listen i can suggest someone you might possibly talk to tomorrow but i cant get involved merrily i cant pull any thats why you didnt return my calls you thought i was going to ask you to pull strings on behalf of jane and gomer ive had a bloody long night merrily ive gorra mairder inquiry not any more frannie merrily said hadnt really been his week had it or anyones she knew she needed to go home but the police had found both bodies in the forestry no backroad network farm to farm to fishguard and the ferry to ireland louis had been shot in the back of the head evidently while relieving himself his dad presumably having offered to hold the gun for him preston had been found some distance away hed fumbled it blown a piece of his head away but was not dead hed died like lincoln cookman in the ambulance it was numbing i cant question it syd spicer said you know what the suicide rate is among exsas you come out into a shrunken world and its like your coffins being assembled around you every day another little screw going in the sudden smallness of everything the petty regulations the way your hands are tied by the kind of people you just want to smack he talked about that feeling of confinement how you had to find a way out of that preston devereauxs answer was to slide out of the system by shedding his humanity like excess weight merrily lit a cigarette ironically dumping your humanity now seems like the best way to survive in farming a cows no longer daisy its a product with a government bar code the state penetrating your life at every level syd said nobodys more aware of that than the farmer whose only rulers used to be the elements state doesnt like the idea of guys out there being independent officials come swarming over your land like maggots and youre clawing away to get them off before they start eating into your brain maybe preston felt he was finally reclaiming his norman heritage as a robber baron the normans controlled the hunting in the malverns the devereaux dynasty controls the drugs but knowing that at any time it could all go to pieces that he could lose everything his family had built up over the centuries did that add to the necessary sense of danger maybe lol said he thought hed already lost everything that it was just useless packaging and the only part of it worth preserving was the whatever was still alight inside him merrily thought about this about devereaux telling her how hed put all his valuable furniture into the holiday units stripping his own life back she saw him in the beacon room in his anonymous muted green overalls surrounded by mementoes of the past the fox heads and the picture of him with eric clapton she looked at syd you knew that if you could get them to walk away syd had changed into his cassock as if in some vain attempt to convince himself that what had happened in the last several hours had happened to someone else didnt see him having any taste for life as a fugitive still less as a prisoner who even if he hadnt actually personally killed anybody he had killed though hadnt he merrily said what about lincoln cookman and his girlfriend i meant murder yes well merrily bent her head into her hands this is probably nonsense but when i went to talk to raji khan at the royal oak roman wicklows family were there collecting his stuff including his small sports car quite a deep colour of orange which might look red at night i dont know it was just a feeling i had and i dont get them often syd sat back a mazda i think it was a nissan but about the same size and shape and late at night coming towards preston devereaux at speed with a black guy inside he told me he was very tired at the time he said if he hadnt been so tired it wouldnt have happened an impulse thing if wicklow was preying on his mind you said wicklow killed that man in pershore he was tortured before he was shot merrily said maybe he gave wicklow information leading wicklow back to devereaux then wicklow turns up at old wychehill to ask for a job blackmail in a thin disguise what if wicklow tells khan assuming khan doesnt already know suspecting that khan had a charmedlife arrangement with annie howe merrily didnt think he did know i could be totally wrong about the wychehill crash anyway how could he know theyd both be killed he couldnt syd said but he was a massively angry man in a business that brutalizes i remember he was in a very excited state that night in fact i dont rule out that preston like louis partook of the produce in his careful way it could even be that cookman had been involved with wicklow the police did find a bag of crack under his spare wheel anythings possible and most of it wont come out the cops have too many angles to follow up could take weeks with several forces involved could be dozens of people charged but its not our problem is it meanwhile lol said do we ring a and e at worcester hospital theyll ring us merrily said tim has no known relations in the country not that anybody knows of she pushed her cup away one of the parameds had mentioned the possibility of damage to the pulmonary artery the kitchen seemed dim the garden where it was lifted towards the bald hill was pallid with tired moonlight and what remained of the socalled noctilucence i mayve screwed up badly syd plucked at his cassock probably gonna get out of this now the cassock you know what i mean quittings not in your nature syd or your training he smiled faintly increasingly i admire you merrily youve watched it fall to pieces from your point of view every deliverance angle going one after another down the toilet thats what you think merrily sank her head into her arms looking up at him from tabletop level you really dont see anything bordering on the paranormal you mean you do syd she said when ive slept ill make you a list you think there should still be some form of requiem i dont know you think that would make everything all right in wychehill sweetness and light and harmony and mr holliday inviting mr khan to afternoon tea what do you think i suppose i think truth sometimes heals on its own winnie said there was a festering wound in the hills maybe she added to the infection maybe she lets be fanciful annoyed elgar bringing him to judgement when all he wanted was to pedal up and down whistling his sad little upanddown cello tune bringing him to judgement what right did she have it was essentially a magical ritual you know what they were she stood up what theyre still doing presumably in your church merrily had never been a hymn kind of person but she knew them most of the words if not the tune in this case oh wisest love that flesh and blood which did in adam fail praise to the holiest in the height thats what the heavenly choir sings before the appearance of the angel of the agony lol said tims expanded it i think dan said it goes into a speakingintongues kind of chant he said thats when you start to get high they were in the parking bay outside wychehill church the singing was much louder now than when merrily had last heard it standing on an upturned bucket below a window as if the choristers had been pacing themselves like athletes you think we should stop them syd spicer stood under the cracked lantern his eyes uncertain how longs it got to go what time is it now syd twotwenty it ends at three lol said let them finish then syd brought out his keys you want to go in lol nodded merrily had caught a movement in the churchyard join you in a few minutes ok sliding among the bushes and the graves not a moment too soon because within a few seconds there were voices behind her talking to syd and one of them was annie howes no im not sure she heard syd say she was here not long ago do you want to talk to me first she was standing under the statue of the angel of the agony pink cardigan over a summer dress with cartwheels and roses on it male and female voices cascaded down through the warm air fluid and ethereal coloured rain gods presence and his very self and essence i thought merrily said that on friday and saturday night you stayed in behind locked and barred doors sometimes i sit at the window mrs aird said from the front dormer i can just see the church gates i had the window open tonight to hear the choir then i saw you come in with the rector and the other gentleman merrily sat on the edge of the tomb looked up into her face meagrely lit by the candles inside the church what dont i know about you mrs aird oh dear is it that obvious i did think of ringing ingrid sollars but there hasnt been much time oh well mrs aird said ingrid doesnt know anything really i dont make a point of telling people my family history not round here especially theres still quite a bit of strong feeling in certain quarters she glanced up at the angel of the agony whose face even by diffused candlelight reflected none of the compassion that you might expect oh merrily said i see i think he was my grandfather joseph longworth i dont remember him he died when i was very young i didnt even know where he was buried for a long time it was quite a shock when i first came here i can imagine he left some money in trust for wychehill church the interest to be handed over as a lump sum every ten years as directed by the principal trustee which at present is me as the eldest in the family he wanted the money to perpetuate the churchs connection with elgar ah what i was told was that elgars music was not very popular by the time my grandfather discovered it in the s he became you know besotted with it he thought it was the greatest music ever made in england he wanted to help and to make up in a small way for all the damage done by the quarrying and i suppose hes been proved right hasnt he about the music somebody said he created wychehill church as almost an altar to elgar well i came to tend it mrs aird said im the first of our family including my grandfather ever to live in wychehill and its all been very strange very strange indeed i used to be afraid to stand here especially after dark you came twentyfive years ago twentyfour when my husband retired he was some years older than me you didnt have to wait long for a house to come on the market here its always been like that it was a very unhappy place when we came i made it my business to try to cheer people up it was a a vocation you might say it made me feel content here i felt my grandfather this will sound silly probably not to me i felt he was helping me so when mr loste came and established his choir good way to perpetuate elgars music i made a donation from the fund towards the choir and hiring musicians sometimes you gave tim money anonymously through my solicitor i didnt want them to know i didnt want that woman i heard she is it true im afraid it is dear god mrs aird sank down on to the tomb whats happening here mrs watkins merrily told her without mentioning names that the people responsible were no longer a threat that there was nobody out there any more to be afraid of she wondered if that was true and if the divide which had opened up all those years ago like a fissure in the rocks between longworth and the devereaux family old wychehill and upper wychehill might in some way be closed what would happen to old wychehill now in theory it was hugos but what would happen to hugo as soon as i handed over the money mrs aird said i knew it was wrong somehow and i didnt know why i had terrible dreams one night she hugged her arms i saw him she looked up him the angel i was watching the sunset and just after the sun had gone down he was there in my garden dont think im mad no and the next day the lorry crashed into the church wall it was probably a coincidence but thats not what you think is it at the time did you see him again no and the light the lorry driver said he saw he thought it was the sun but it was too early perhaps it was like the policeman said he was overtired but i thought of the ball of light that my grandfathers supposed to have seen and then mr loste and then hannah i didnt know what to believe it was getting too much for me and then i talked to ingrid and mrs aird let her arms drop and turned to merrily how much of it was lies do you know no merrily said i dont sometimes you never do sometimes you just have to push on regardless and hope you get some help she looked up something had happened she saw through the steep plainglass window a very small glow as if only one candle was left alight and the choir had faltered voices trailing like ribbon she stood up the last candle didnt go out but the choir stayed silent merrily heard the church door opening and lol came out and she walked over to him he looked anxious he the conductor was this guy dan hed stepped in at the last minute because the usual guy couldnt make it and he just he stopped it he said he had to sit down suddenly felt cold and weak and then he got up again and went round blowing out the candles it was weird whos that merrily turned and saw mrs aird walking back along the drive towards the road there was darkness there the cracked lantern at the entrance had gone out cold inside with dread she took out her mobile and opened it up its screen flaring orange and white and called the hospital in worcester where tim loste had been taken helium it was unearthly seeing elgar like this disorientating in his striped casual jacket and his hat with the brim raffishly upturned at the sides and was that a cigarette for heavens sake between his fingers he wasnt exactly smiling but you felt that under that wild west marshals moustache he was on the edge of one standing on the track with his arms spread as if emphasizing its width yes it had to be a cigarette that was smoke in the air you spent all week searching for him in the malverns and here he was in ledwardine something mischievous and yet rueful about that nearsmile the main difference between watkins and elgar at this stage of their lives was that elgar was more or less played out in his sixties while watkins was only just beginning his greatest work crackling with vision maybe elgar in ledwardine was returning a favour for getting longworth off his back no dont get fanciful whenever i think im getting somewhere jane lowered her face into her hands just when i think im breaking through i screw up its like theres something inside me something demonic stop right there flower jane looked up annoyance turning to something between hopelessness and an unhealthy kind of repentance anyway it was almost pitiful i was going to say dont call me flower like im seven years old but yeah call me flower call me flower till i grow up maybe getting thrown out of school maybe thats what i need maybe i should go away where i cant harm anybody merrily thought of telling her that the one person this didnt seem to have harmed was gomer parry who when shed seen him in the eight till late had looked ten years younger despite facing charges which could include taking a mechanical digger without the owners consent and criminal damage to a fence and a silver bmw he said hed deny that this last offence had been criminal as hed had no way of knowing that pierce had brought his car round in order to drive gerry murray home so murray could leave his jcb on site overnight which was plain daft anyway more likely tove banged pierce gomer said bloody little crook merrily had advised resisting making that point to the police bliss had suggested that gomer might get a caution but only if he admitted an offence of say aggravated taking without consent which gomer being gomer she wondered if she should ring robert morrell at home and make a crawling apology telling him how stressedout shed been and what a difficult year it had been for jane wondered whether this might actually work or whether jane would just despise her probable answers no and yes just before twelve syd spicer had rung to say that hed spoken to tim lostes parents in france hed asked merrily how shed feel about conducting the funeral the full requiem as high church as she was prepared to go incense even shed said ok the young guy at the door was in jeans and a mappa mundi tshirt neil cooper herefordshire council i think ive seen you somewhere before merrily said its possible yes i wondered if jane was in well she jane appeared in the hall oh this is mr cooper jane from the council look jane said i overreacted i behaved like a kid but on the other hand im not going to apologize i dont expect you to neil cooper looked grim but i think you ought at least to come and see the extent of what youve done you and your volatile friend for what its worth im accepting full responsibility gomer thought i was in danger and thats why he did it in fact it was an act of protest merrily said jane also he was insulted by lyndon pierce made to look small and old and knackered gomers a proud sort of guy in his way and hes a good guy and he could drive a jcb in his sleep and pierce was stupid to leave his car there with no lights i really dont want to argue cooper said if youre prepared to face up to all right ill come ok but if youre going to offer me any kind of a deal like the police did to drop gomer in it merrily watched them go wondering what all this was going to cost in terms of money and their future in the village then she went over to lols lol was sitting on his sofa with the boswell guitar merrily sat down next to him and listened while he played a couple of strange drifting chords singing in a low mumble dont need the angel of the agony dont want the pomp and circumstance he put the guitar down lay down here when we got in slept for a couple of hours and i woke up and that was in my head crap its haunting merrily said develop it do you think and when you record it have simon st john on cello elgar would hate it tell me would that have bothered you before um seventeen merrily said you remember it wasnt wasnt seventeen it was severn teme elgar said he wanted to be cremated and have his ashes scattered at the confluence of the river severn and the river teme so tim meant there wasnt much cremation back then they talked him out of it and now hes with alice in little malvern where does the severn meet the teme no idea i wonder if theres a country church near there and an amenable vicar with a fondness for elgar take some arranging and negotiations with relatives of course but youre thinking tim thinking both of them tim and elgar in essence but faraway eyes and a lonely bicycle lamp in the dusk a floating sadness i just dont know merrily said it was a mess no arguing with that a spreading wound in the belly of the village ok some of it had been done by gerry murray before they arrived but a lot of it was clearly down to gomer the way the fence had been smashed down and spread across the field the way the council sign describing the plans for luxury executive homes had been snapped off halfway up its post and crunched and splintered into the mud that used to be colemans meadow and pierces car of course the car was still there pierces bmw with its windscreen smashed and its bonnet turned into a sardine can well it had been dark how was gomer supposed to know that pierce was giving murray a lift home and wasnt the fact that pierce was doing this a clear demonstration that they were in this together pierce wouldnt want that coming out would he he wouldnt give a toss he had jane unhinged crazy as a binge drinker on new years eve and dragging an old man into it he wouldnt get jail for a first offence jane hoped at his age but thered be a heavy fine and worst of all the possibility of some kind of ban and if they stopped gomer driving his jcb hed just slink off and die all her fault if anything happened to gomer because of what shed done she just couldnt go on living here didnt want to live here any more anyway the afternoon was dull and sultry a bleak posse of clouds had gathered around cole hill it was like a sign colemans meadow was desolate an old battlefield but the only blood was hers why are you doing this to me jane said ive messed up i admit it neil cooper strolled out to the middle of the field he wasnt badlooking in an insubstantial kind of way but it is a ley jane shouted after him or it was im not sure i believe in leys cooper said yeah well you wouldnt look at the state of this he bent down come on look at it sod you jane said youre determined to rub my nose in it arent you will you come here jane sighed how much more of this monday shed have to face morrell tuesday shed be looking for a new school or a job maybe stacking shelves for jim prosser its my day off actually neil cooper said i just heard about it on the radio and thought id wander over ok here she went and looked over neil coopers shoulder to where a great slice of soil and clay had been peeled away like a giant pencilshaving murrays work but somebody had been at it with a spade and there was a trench there now neil cooper tapped the bottom of it with a trowel it rang sharply off something oops shouldntve you know what this is jane jane stood sullenly on the edge of the trench which was still roughly aligned with the ley no its a stone neil cooper said approximately four metres long like a very big cigar it was about half a metre under the surface a large part of it wouldve been underground but when it was standing it wouldve been taller than me jane said standing cooper walked lightly along the bottom of the trench and then stopped it seemed even longer at first and then i realized that he bent down tapped again with his trowel that this was a separate one how do you mean and then i brought in a couple of mates and we found a third what have you ever seen harolds stones at trellech whats that forty miles from here thereabouts she and eirion had been twice harolds stones were magnificent jane felt herself growing pale probably not going to be quite that tall neil cooper said but when we get them up at least as high as wern derys which is the tallest prehistoric stone in herefordshire and of course as a stone row who are you i get the feeling we met once before when i was working on the renovation of the cantilupe tomb in the cathedral i certainly recognized your mum im with the county archaeologists department now cooper was on his feet jane theyve been buried for centuries theyre way beyond living memory and there are no records there was a time when farmers would do this because the old stones got in the way of ploughing bury them broke them up sometimes fortunately that didnt happen here although the one at the far end was quite badly chipped by mr murrays jcb but then if he hadnt been so determined to destroy your bit of ley line we wouldnt have found out about it if we ever did find out until the housing estate was well under way and then it wouldve been just rescue archaeology because the estate would have planning permission whereas now these are real actual prehistoric standing stones jane felt like her body had filled up with helium and her voice was coming out in this thin squeak id stake my future career on it neil cooper said what what does that mean means a long and careful excavation and then with any luck the stones will get raised again and carefully repositioned just as they once were and the and the housing estate what housing estate neil cooper said jane went down on her knees in the trench rubbing away the soil getting dirt all over the big plaster on the back of her hand she closed her eyes and saw a swirl of faces neil cooper looking down on her with elgar on one side of him and alfred watkins on the other peering over his glasses eyes alight and all of them in the enveloping shadow of the batwing poncho of lucy devenish this time we ll call the media neil cooper said if thats all right with you i need to talk to my agent jane said credits plus although links between edward elgar and alfred watkins have not been mentioned in major biographies of either man the geographical facts as discovered by jane watkins speak for themselves however confirmation jacob ocallaghan records in elgar a herefordshire guide how the bythen eminent composer joined the famous woolhope naturalists club possibly introduced by his neighbour alfred watkins and laurence meredith notes in in the news herefordshire that elgar who had a photographic darkroom at plas gwyn was also a great friend of herefordian alfred watkins inventor of the modern photographic lightmeter and he and elgar frequently met to discuss photography thanks to woolhope member sue rice for pointing this out it seems unlikely that watkins and elgar would not also explore their mutual fascination with the landscape whiteleafed oak of course exists as described right down to the severely limited parking please treat it with respect the theory of whiteleafed oak and the perpetual choirs was as explained first outlined in comparatively recent times by john michell in his inspiring books city of revelation and new light on the ancient mystery of glastonbury developed by john merron in an article in the ley hunter magazine investigated by members of the malvernbased british society of dowsers and guarded by val de heer of the aquarius shop malvern who supplied essential background did elgar know it none of the biographers mention it but local people say yes definitely the earliest mention of the three choirs festival seems to have been about it was established for the performance of sacred music originally handel and purcell by the combined choirs of the cathedrals of gloucester worcester and hereford with an orchestra behind them and it was always held in the late summer a

the great man as a complex mixedup human being no one however seems to have quite pinned him down michael kennedy distinguished music critic and former northern editor of the daily telegraph is quick to squash suggestions that elgar was a liberal claiming triumphantly that he went foxhunting while jacob ocallaghan points out that elgar allied himself with the campaigns of his vegetarian friend
