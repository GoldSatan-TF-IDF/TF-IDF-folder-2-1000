craig russell the long glasgow kiss chapter one some concepts are alien to the glaswegian mind salad dentistry forgiveness until the night small change macfarlane died i had no idea just how unforgiving glasgow could be my education in vindictiveness was about to be completed it was midheat wave hot and sticky and i had an even hotter and stickier date with lorna macfarlane the night her father was murdered i had parked my austin atlantic up above the city on glennifer braes from where you could see glasgow stretched out below dark and sullen in the muggy night but to be honest we didnt take in much of the view looking back its ironic to think that two members of the macfarlane family had been on the business end of a blunt instrument at roughly the same time lorna was quite a bit above the usual glasgow standard she was pretty with strawberry blonde hair and a knockout figure like most lowlifes made good her bookie father was always striving for a touch of respectability and had sent lorna to a fancy boarding school in edinburgh the aim had probably been to turn her into a proper little lady but whatever languages were taught there i had found out in the back of my atlantic that when it came to french lorna was a natural linguist if i had to describe my relationship with lorna at that time the word shallow would fit best mind you it was an adjective that could have been applied to almost all my relationships with women lorna and i were however particularly mutually undemanding she was killing time until she landed the right type of husband material and me well i was just doing what i always did if events hadnt taken the turn they had that night i think we would have drifted apart without acrimony but that night up on glennifer braes we had no idea what was ahead of us my ignorance was especially blissful i was completely unaware that a blood debt was about to be extracted or what a baro or a bitchapen were and if someone on that humid toohot summer evening had mentioned the name john largo to me i would have assumed they were talking about a character in a wild west movie which would have been apt in a way the west didnt get any wilder than glasgow but john largo was no cowboy he was what the french would call an eminence gris a shadow a very dangerous shadow with a long reach after our backseat tango i drove lorna home to pollokshields glasgow had its own social geography meaningless to anyone from outside the city but allimportant to its minority of middle classes glasgow by and large was a classless sort of city where the only thing that counted for anything was how much money you had the glasgow accent was common across social boundaries intelligibility or more correctly the comparative lack of unintelligibility was the only indicator of status the result was that social prestige tended to be determined by geography or more subtle social indicators such as proximity to a toilet that flushed or whether your grandmother still lived in a slum when it came to the accounting of turf small change had done well over the years better than almost any other bookie in glasgow but he hadnt earned the kind of cash or respectability to spring him over the clyde out of the southside and up the glaswegian social ladder the macfarlane residence therefore lay in pollokshields on the south side the house itself was large detached and the usual unimaginatively sturdy scottish victorian sandstone villa in a street of nearidentical unimaginatively sturdy scottish victorian sandstone villas all following the usual presbyterian imperative to temper prosperity with anonymity in a search for some kind of distinction almost all the houses in the street had names not numbers and when we reached ardmore there was a knot of black police wolseleys blocking the drive thats usually my cue to see how far and how fast i can travel in the opposite direction but lorna started to panic and parking on the street i went with her up to the house it was clear something deeply unpleasant would be waiting for us it was sixfootsix of tweed and oxblood brogues that went by the name of detective superintendent willie mcnab whats going on i asked and mcnab ignored me miss macfarlane he spoke to lorna solicitously and i was impressed at how convincing his human being act was could you come with me please he steered her into the lounge first casting a and dont you fucking move look over his shoulder at me i smiled it was nice to be noticed i was left standing with the cop doing guard duty on the front door he was a big lad a highlander like ninety per cent of the uniforms in the city of glasgow police highlanders were recruited for size not intellect and they were easy to bewilder with shiny beads or electricity it only took me a couple of minutes to wheedle some information out of him small change macfarlane glasgows most successful bookie and lornas father was apparently lying stretched out on his study floor ruining the wilton with several pints of onegative whee think he whass chust in the door from the races my new hebridean copper chum confided musically he whas a bhookie you know somewhone clobbered him whith a statue hof his favourite greyhound billy boy i frowned my dismay what are the odds of that when mcnab reappeared in the entrance hall i was still on the threshold but could see past him through the door and into the living room lorna was sitting on the sofa distraught and being comforted by her stepmother i took a step into the house but was halted by mcnabs huge hand on my chest and what exactly was your involvement with jimmy macfarlane i decided to continue our communication by glares and i gave mcnab my best take your fucking hand off me look it was as effective as if id spoken to him in nepalese and the restraining hand remained planted on my chest small change none i said im a a friend of his daughter thats all how good a friend well lets say were seeing a lot of each other at the moment and thats your only connection with james macfarlane ive met him a few times mainly through seeing lorna i said omitting to mention that small change had promised me a couple of tickets to the forthcoming big fight between local boy bobby kirkcaldy and the german jan schmidtke the fact was that the first thing id thought about on hearing of his demise was whether small change had managed to earmark the tickets for me before getting his head pulped i decided that expressing such sentiments would expose one of the less appealing aspects of my nature there again it maybe wasnt that bad my second thought had been to wonder how long it would be after her fathers death before lorna would be in the right frame of mind for some more backseat wrestling no other business asked mcnab you havent done any work for him snooping i shook my head suddenly feeling sullen i looked down at the hand on my chest a stout fist uncoiled thick fingers flaky knuckles crisp white shirt cuffs beneath tweed well see and make sure to keep your nose out of this lennox he said this is police business ive no intention of getting involved i frowned i was confused by mcnab clearly feeling the need to warn me off what was the motive well lets see mcnab rubbed his chin with his free hand in mock thoughtfulness macfarlane was one of glasgows richest bookies and greyhound breeders he just came back from the races with a bag full of cash which we cant locate let me think got it crime of passion you should stick to what youre good at superintendent and leave the sarcasm to me and you leave the police work to me this is a simple robbery well get this one all by ourselves lennox a couple of days and well have the bastard in custody ah i smiled and nodded appreciatively the scottish legal system at work a model of fairness and justice where every man is considered innocent until proven catholic i could picture the scene housebreakers as burglars were called under scottish law tended not to use violence i imagined a procession of the usual suspects having the crap beaten out of them at police headquarters in the movies police detectives were always reassuring people they questioned that it was just routine i wondered if that was the line the city of glasgow police used we wont keep you long its just routine a few more boots in the ribs then youll be able to pick your teeth off the floor and leave can i ask you a question mcnab interrupted my musings youre in the business of asking questions superintendent i said without adding that usually the answers were beaten out of the mug being asked go ahead why dont you fuck off to canada is that a question or the new slogan of the canadian immigration bureau its catchy ill give you that youre quite the wag arent you lennox he looked past me or over me out beyond the garden as if he wasnt fully focussed on our conversation then suddenly he locked his eyes with mine and leaned in his face in mine his hand on my chest there was no question about his focus now do you remember our last little chat in st andrews square mcnab referred to the city of glasgow police hq how could i forget you me and that charming lad from the hebrides with the wet rag wrapped around his fist if you dont cut the wisecracks i could arrange a reunion keep your lip buttoned lennox answer my question why dont you fuck off back to canada i like it here i replied ignoring the logical pickle of answering his question with my lip buttoned the glasgow air agrees with me if i were to leave my pleurisy would probably clear up and its taken me such a long time to perfect it i sighed and gave a shrug i dont know maybe one day i might go back when im ready id give it some serious thought if i were you he dropped the hand from my chest it had been there so long i felt the warm heavy ghost of it through my jacket and shirt point made and taken superintendent willie mcnab could put his hand on anyone in glasgow any time and for as long as he wanted theres a lot of people i know who dont like you lennox people who still think you know more about the mcgahern case than you let on then theyre wrong i threw a hasty fake smile over my discomfort at mcnab once more digging up dead history very dead history i keep telling you superintendent theres a lot less to me than meets the eye can i go and talk to lorna now just remember to keep your nose out of this business with macfarlane lighting a players mcnab took a long draw then blew a jet of smoke out into the muggy pollokshields night or ill arrange a change of scenery for you myself am i clear crystal if theres one thing i can say about your veiled threats superintendent its that theyre all threat and no veil maggie macfarlane poured me a scotch while i sat and consoled her stepdaughter lornas real mother had died ten years before and jimmy small change macfarlane had remarried maggie his second wife couldnt have been any more than ten years older than lorna when some men achieve a certain age provided theyve also achieved an appropriate bank balance they give up the family saloon for a flash sports car all sleek lines and curves and an exhilarating ride that makes them feel for a moment that theyre young again even if they cant quite cope with the horsepower second wives can be like that maggie macfarlane was definitely like that and at our initial meeting the first time i called to pick up lorna maggie had somehow given me the clear impression that if i ever wanted to take her for a quick spin then that was just fine by her how are you holding up i asked maggie truth was she was holding up just fine a little too fine i just cant believe it she said handing me the scotch and pouring herself one poor jimmy who would do such a thing i took my scotch and put my arm around lorna and persuaded her to take a sip of the whisky she was at that stage where the crying had stopped and she simply sat ashen and still she coughed and screwed her eyes tight as she swallowed the scotch the fire in the whisky seemed to catch light in her expression and she glowered at maggie i have a few ideas said lorna in a low spiteful mutter happy families i was upset for lornas sake but i glanced at my watch it was past closing time and it was fast getting past the time when my secret knock could get me into the horsehead bar i decided to break the tension did you find the i mean was it you who found mr macfarlane i asked maggie she sat down on the chesterfield opposite us crossing her legs with a hiss of silk on silk it was of course the most inappropriate time for me to take a look at her legs and i made a great effort not to as usual i failed her lips were deep crimson around the cigarette she lit some fancy foreign brand with filters and a band of gold paper i was at a friends place in bearsden she said holding me in a steady blue gaze i got back about an hour ago when i got here i knew something was wrong because the front door was ajar then when i went through to jimmys study she dropped her eyes and took a long slug of scotch what did the police say not much just that they think it was a robbery someone who knew jimmy would be coming back with the nights shawfield takings have the police mentioned any names maggie was about to answer when mcnab came into the living room without knocking knocking was something other people did miss macfarlane could i ask you a few questions he looked at me pointedly before adding in the kitchen might be best maggie waited until lorna and mcnab had gone before answering no no names but i would imagine they have some ideas i gave a low laugh theyre not ideas people the police thinking has an annoying habit of getting in the way of a conviction when lorna came back from talking to mcnab she was in tears an effect his company often came close to having on me i went back to dutifully comforting her and stayed with daughter and stepmother without as much as once asking if small change had happened to mention anything about boxing tickets before his untimely demise i was nothing if not a gentleman from what i could pick up it looked like mcnab was probably right small change had had his brains bashed in for the nights takings he had brought back it would have been a tidy sum all right but not so tidy as to be worth hanging for and if mcnab was personally involved in the case then someone would definitely hang i actually found myself grateful that i had the most solid of alibis i hung around until about two am by which time the police had gone i promised to ring in the morning and left chapter two the streets i drove through to get back to my flat were deserted and i reflected that there were probably cemeteries more lively than glasgow at two in the morning that was probably why i was so aware of the headlights in my rear mirror i wasnt sure if they had been with me since pollokshields but they had certainly been there for long enough for me to become suspicious i didnt pull over outside my flat instead i drove along great western road and turned into byres road taking a random right into a silent residential street lined with sandstone tenements and semidetached houses sootstained darker than the night sky above them the lights in my mirror held back as far as they could without losing me but nonetheless followed my arbitrary route again completely at random i pulled up outside a tenement stepped out of the atlantic locked the door and walked with a sense of purpose into the tenement close the car drove past an austin one of the big jobs black or dark grey the kind the police cruised around in i saw a driver and passenger but i couldnt make out either figure other than that one of them had shoulders to make atlas jealous small change macfarlane was a big enough fish all right but i didnt see why his case warranted so much attention i didnt see why i warranted so much attention from the police given my tangential involvement the car cruised around the corner and i heard the synchromesh get a grinding as it did a threepoint somewhere out of sight stepping out of the shadows i went back to my car and leaned against the wing my arms folded patiently waiting for the unmarked police car to drift around the corner sometimes i can be too smart for my own good the austin reappeared and pulled up next to me it was a sheerline too fancy for the police something vast and dark unfolded from the passenger seat and cast an improbably large shadow in the lamplight hello again mr lennox twinkletoes mcbride said in his earthrumbling baritone and smiled at me i straightened up from the wing of the atlantic this was interesting twinkletoes what are you doing here i thought it was the police why are you tailing me youll have to ask mr sneddon that he said earnestly im sure he can elucidate you twinkletoes pronounced every syllable deliberately eeloosihdate still reading the readers digest i see i said amiably im improving my word power twinkletoes beamed i imagined how much more interesting his expanded vocabulary would make the experience of having your toes lopped off with bolt cutters twinkletoes speciality as a torturer and the origin of his nickname or ehhpeethett as he would probably call it an expressive vocabulary is a true treasure i smiled youre not fucking wrong there mr lennox mr sneddon wants to see me now i asked i unlocked my car ill follow you twinkletoes stopped smiling he swung the back door of the sheerline open well bring you back to your car afterwards if that isnae inconveeneeent okay i said as if he was doing me a favour but the thought did run through my head that i might return unable to count to twenty on my fingers and toes twinkletoes mcbride may have been sadistic and psychopathically violent to order but at least he was a friendly sort of cuss the same couldnt have been said of the driver of the humber a thin meagre and nastylooking thug with bad skin and an overoiled teddy boy cut id seen him before lurking menacingly in the presence of willie sneddon to give him due credit lurking menacingly was something he did extremely well and it made up for his lack of conversational skills we drove out of the city west passing through clydebank and out along the road to dumbarton the only car on the road the ugly tenements eventually gave way to open country and i began to feel uneasy a free taxi ride from twinkletoes mcbride in itself was enough to make you wary but knowing who had summoned your presence was enough to start the lower parts of your digestive anatomy twitching twinkletoes was one of willie sneddons henchmen willie sneddon was the king of the southside one of the socalled three kings who ran almost all the crime worth running in glasgow willie sneddon was bad news of the worst kind when we turned off the road and headed up a narrow farm track i started to think that the news was about to get worse i even found myself casting an eye over the car door handle reflecting that at this speed jumping from the car wouldnt be a breakneck job getting caught by twinkle and his taciturn chum though probably would be willie sneddon was the kind of social host to become piqued if you declined his invitations once id started running if i wanted to hang on to my teeth toes and maybe even my life id have to keep running until i was back in canada we jolted over a pothole i calmed down it made no sense that sneddon had anything unpleasant planned for me other than his company which in itself would fill my unpleasantness quota for the month i had done nothing to offend sneddon or either of the other two kings the truth was i had tried to avoid doing work for them as much as i could over the last year i decided to sit tight and take my chances the farm track ended as you would expect at a farm the farmhouse was a large victorian granite job suggesting a gentlemanly sort of turfturner beside the house was a huge stone barn that i guessed was not being used for its original purpose unless it was home to an equally gentlemanly breed of cattle the two small windows in its vast flank were draped in heavy velvet that glowed emberred in the night and yellow electric light shone from under the heavy wooden barn door twinkletoes and happy harry the driver conducted me from the car to the barn i could hear voices coming from inside a lot of voices laughter shouting and cheering twinkle pressed an electric bell push and a peephole slid open as we were checked out by whoever was on the other side ive never been to a milk bar speakeasy before i said cheerfully to my lessthancheerful driver does sneddon have an illicit buttermilk still in here he replied by lurking menacingly at my side twinkle pressed the bell push again maybes we shou try da udder door i said in my mocknew york gangster voice and smiled it only served to confuse twinkletoes and deepen the menace of his companions lurk i had half expected the doorbell to be answered by a heifer in a dinner suit as it turned out i wasnt far wrong a bullnecked thug swung open the door stepping across the threshold was like diving into a pool we were immersed in a humid fug of cigarette smoke whisky fumes and sweat and the faint copper smell of blood a simultaneous wave of noise and odourheavy warmth washed over us men shouting in angeredged eagerness the odd female voice shrill and penetrating the barn wasnt exactly full of people but they were elbowjostle crowded in a circle around a raised platform upon which two heavily muscled men were beating the bejesus out of each other both were stripped to the waist but they wore ordinary trousers and shoes rather than boxing gear and no gloves nice i thought bareknuckle fighting unlicensed unregulated illegal and more than occasionally fatal i had never really understood the need to pay to watch a bareknuckle fight in the west of scotland in glasgow particularly it seemed to me redundant like asking a girl out on a date in the middle of an orgy twinkletoes put his hand on my shoulder and i nearly buckled under the weight mr sneddon says we was to get you a drink and tell you to wait till he was ready a girl of about twenty with too much lipstick and too little frock stood behind the crepedraped trestle table that served as a bar unsurprisingly she had no canadian club and the scotch i took as a substitute had the same effect on the lining of my mouth that i imagined it would have on paint i turned back to the fight and took in the audience most of the men wore dinner suits and the women were all young showily dressed and anything but wife material the look of the men turned my gut that pink scrubbed fleshyfaced look of accountants lawyers and other lowermiddleclass glaswegians out slumming it this was their little charabanc ride to vice i guessed there were more than a few glasgow corporation bureaucrats and even a copper or two here by personal sneddon invitation the stench of venality mingled with the sweat and boozetinged air a cheer from the crowd drew my attention back to the fighters i didnt mind a boxing match myself but this was not sport no skill other than using your face and head to break your opponents knuckles the face of each fighter was the mirror image of his opponent white skin puffed and swollen and smeared with spit sweat and vivid streaks of blood eyes reduced to slits hair sweatplastered to their scalps and both faces were expressionless no fear or anger or hate just the emotionless concentration of two men engaged in the hard physical work of doing harm to another human being each punch had the sound of either a wet slap or an ugly dull thud neither man made an attempt to dodge his opponents blows this was all about beating the shit out of each other until someone fell down and didnt get up both fighters looked exhausted in bareknuckle there are no rounds no breaks for rest or recovery if you were knocked to the ground you had thirty seconds to get back up to scratch the scored line in the centre of the fighting area theres something about bareknuckle fighting that holds your unwilling attention and i found myself focussed on the brutality on the raised platform the fighters seemed oblivious to everything around them probably everything before them and after them i remembered the feeling from the war in combat you have no past no history no future no connections to the world outside youre not even connected to the men you kill in any human way i recognized the same dislocation in these two men one was slightly smaller but heavierset than the other blood from his nose was backofthehand smeared across his upper lip and cheek and one distended eyelid was purpling up and threatening to close over his eye it looked as if it was only a matter of time before his larger opponent would be able to take advantage of his compromised vision but the smaller man suddenly swung an ungainly but brutal left hook it connected with the bigger fighters cheek with a sickening snap even across the barn and through the cigarette haze i could see the big man had stepped out of his body for a moment and his arms hung limp at his side the spectators roared delight and fury depending on whom theyd placed their money and the smaller guy slammed a nosebreaking jab into his opponents face blood cascaded over the big mans mouth more roars from the crowd this was the end the smaller fighter had the smell of victory in his bloody nostrils and tore into his adversary his barefisted punches slapping loudly into the bigger mans ribs and gut another roundhouse left sent a viscous arc of blood and saliva through the air and the big man dropped like a felled tree there was no congratulation for the winner or commiseration for the loser the serious business of settling bets got underway and there was another jostle around sneddons illegal bookie and a couple of enforcers sneddon would be happy the disgruntled faces hanging back outnumbered the beaming eager grins of the winners after a while everyone made for the bar and i eased back into a corner with my gutrot scotch and contemplated the success i had made of my life it had so very nearly gone wrong a few different choices and i could have ended up wealthy and contented three thousand miles from glasgow missing out on the edifying experience of watching two bruised apes beat the crap out of each other in a scottish barn twinkletoes returned with a shortish compactly built and hardlooking man wearing a suit that was well tailored and expensive without being flash his blond hair looked freshly barbered and there was a brutal handsomeness in the face unfortunately the ugly deep crease of an old razor scar on his right cheek clearly dated from a time before he could afford the kind of expert needlework evident in his clothes hello mr sneddon i said do you know where you are lennox hernandos hideaway aye very fucking funny sneddon said without a smile this is my newest little sideline you see the fight yeah lovely pikeys sneddon shook his head in wonder they fight like fuck for pennies they would do it for the love of it mad fuckers and you run a book on it sneddon nodded its been a good night ill bet i said old ben franklin once said that the only certain things were death and taxes but that was before sneddons time otherwise it would have been death taxes and willie sneddons hand in your pocket ive had the place six months it took a while to fix it up i got the house the barn the whole fuckin farm because some toff bet more on the ponies than he had in readies wanker its quite poetic that i run a wee gambling thing here considering i got it because of gambling aye mr sneddon thats eyeronic said twinkletoes at sneddons side was i fucking talking to you sneddon glowered up at twinkletoes who loomed above his boss twinkle made a hurt face and sneddon turned back to me anyway ive kept this place pretty quiet i dont even think cohen and murphy know about it yet so keep your mouth shut sneddon referred to the other two kings handsome jonny cohen and hammer murphy i took a moment to ponder why everybody felt that they had to tell me to keep my mouth shut all the time if they dont know about it then im sure they soon will i said this is a village masquerading as a big city nothing stays quiet for long like small change macfarlane getting his coupon smashed to fuck sneddon smiled or moved his face around in an attempt the result was something cold hard and careless yeah just like my god it doesnt take long for word to get around macfarlanes not cold yet is that why you had twinkletoes and smiling lad pick me up sneddon cast a glance over his shoulder at the crowd lets go over to the main house its quieter id been to sneddons house in bearsden a mockbaronial mansion with manicured gardens a few times this place was totally different as soon as i stepped into the entrance hallway i knew that this was a business premises from the outside it was a victorian farmhouse inside it was a victorian brothel all thick velvet crimson drapes chaiseslongues and rubenesque tits in frames on the walls the living room of the house had been converted into a bar with scattered sofas on one a working girl sat with a bored expression as a drunken customer drooled and pawed inexpertly at her mel torme crooned from a record player in the corner and the bar was manned by another girl in her early twenties who too had applied too much makeup and too little frock what do you think asked sneddon in a tone that suggested he didnt give a toss what i thought nice ambience brings out the romantic in me sneddon snorted an approximation of a laugh he tapped twinkletoes on the chest and nodded in the direction of the drunk and the girl twinkletoes obliged by conducting them out of the lounge so whats a nice boy like me doing in a place like this i asked sneddon told the girl behind the counter to pour us a couple of whiskies and i noticed she brought a single malt up from beneath the bar the good stuff you was at small changes place tonight what business do you have with him was he getting you to do a bit of sniffing for him the only sniffing ive been doing has been around his daughter all pleasure no business you sure sneddon narrowed his eyes it made him look all brow which was an advantage in glasgow athens had been the cradle of democracy florence had given the world the renaissance glasgow had refined to a precise art the head butt the glasgow kiss as it was affectionately known amongst the nations of the world i would be put out if you was being less than square with me listen mr sneddon i would think a long time before id lie to you i know twinkletoes didnt get his name because he dances like fred astaire im attached to my toes and i like to think its a mutual arrangement and anyway i was asked the same thing tonight by superintendent mcnab mcnab sneddon put his glass down on the bar what the fuck is he involved for i thought it was a robbery gone wrong its a big case i guess small change was high profile i said hiding how impressed i was with the speed and accuracy of sneddons intelligencegathering operation then i realized i was part of it anyway he took a lot of convincing that i wasnt involved with macfarlane so you had nothing to do with small change or his business like i said im seeing his daughter thats all whats the problem sneddon waved his hand at me as if he had been flicking away an annoying fly nothin its just that i had some business going on with small change oh sneddon gave me a look listen lennox if youre hanging around macfarlanes place you can maybes help me out if i can i said and smiled hiding the sinking feeling in my gut keep me up to date on what the coppers are getting up to and if you get a chance see if you can find anything like small changes diary appointment book whatever he kept details of meetings in or maybe a log book with events and stuff in it may i ask why no you fucking cant then he sighed as if relenting to a childs demand for ice cream okay i had a meeting with small change this afternoon a project we was working on together im moving into the fight game not like tonight something more than a couple of pikeys knocking the shite out of each other real boxing i was talking to macfarlane about a couple of fighters things could get complicated if the police found out and what was small change bringing to the table its not important listen this deal was nothing big i just dont want that kind of police attention i never want police attention but specially not if that fucker mcnabs heading the case can you check it out for me or not i made a big deal of thinking it over im not trying to be funny mr sneddon but if i had an appointment with you i dont think its the kind of thing id put in a diary i mean that could be evidence like you say i dont think macfarlane had the kind of business that he would want recorded somewhere thats because you dont think the way me and macfarlane do i have a diary every fucking appointment every talk i have with murphy or cohen goes into it like you say evidence kings evidence if i ever need it cohen and murphy do the same thing insurance and i know that macfarlane had a mind like a fucking sieve only when it came to things like that as a bookie he could tell you what was running where and when and what the odds were right off the top of his head but stuff like meetings hed have to write times and dates down or hed forget i dont think i can help the coppers took away boxes of stuff from his study id guess theyve already got their hands on his diary youre smarter than that lennox sneddon fixed me with a hard stare small change wouldnt keep his diary somewhere obvious and the coppers are too fucking stupid to look anywheres thats not obvious you know something if i had a suspicious nature id start wondering if you dont want to help me i would maybes even start to think youve been trying to avoid me maybes even murphy and cohen too whats the matter lennox getting too good for us ive done more than my fair share for you sneddon i put my glass down on the bar i was maybe going to need my hands free if only for twinkletoes to lop my fingers off if i remember rightly it was me you called when you were hauled off down to st andrews square last year i dont think you murphy or cohen have anything to complain about but youre not my only clients sneddon looked at me with a sneer okay lennox youre a tough guy i get it find small changes appointment book or whatever he used to keep that kinda stuff in and deliver it to me and ill pay you three hundred quid whether my names in it or not ill have a look if i can i had told sneddon id think long and hard before i lied to him when it came to it i did it in the bat of an eyelid i had no intention of snooping around the macfarlane house on his behalf but there again three hundred quid was three hundred quid it was best to keep my options open was that all you wanted to see me about there was something else i fixed my smile with glue sneddon saw through it thats if it isnt fucking beneath you to do a job for me lennox he said maliciously of course not anyway you dont need to worry you wont get your hands dirty its a legit job what is it like i said im getting into the fight game me and jonny the kike have each got a share in a fighter you and handsome jonny cohen yeah me and cohen you got a problem with that me not at all its very ecumenical of you im not prejudiced ill do business with anyone absolutely anyone he paused except fenians of course anyways this young fighter weve got shares in hes going places he has a couponmashing right hook the thing is hes been getting a bit of grief what kind of grief fucking stupid stuff a dead bird put through his letterbox paint on his car that kinda shite sounds like hes upset someone has he spoken to the police sneddon gave me a look aye seeing as i have such a cosy relationship with them thats the first thing i said he should do use your head lennox if the polis start sniffing about then theyll sooner or later end up on my doorstep or jonny cohens wed both rather keep our investment quiet it was cohen what said we should get you to look into it discreet like discretion i said sententiously is my middle name so who has he pissed off enough to start a vendetta no one or no one that he can think of i mean hes hurt a few in the ring but i dont think thats what this is all about i reckon that someone has put a stash on him to lose when he fights the kraut and theyre just trying to put the wind up him before the fight you know like chucking a fish supper into a greyhounds kennel the night before the race wait a minute you said before he fights the kraut by kraut do you mean jan schmidtke is your boxer bobby kirkcaldy hes not my boxer i own a piece of him you could say so what i blew a long low whistle thats a wise investment mr sneddon kirkcaldys tasty and youre right he is going places oh again sneddon smiled the only way he could sneeringly i am so fucking pleased that my business decisions meet with your approval cohen and me both lost sleep worrying that wed gone ahead without your okay i had to admit sneddon was much better at sarcasm than mcnab but still nowhere near as good as me im just saying that kirkcaldy is hot property i said the stakes are high with him literally you got any idea whos trying to spook him sneddon shrugged thats your job you find out if you do dont let them know youre onto them you want the job usual fees reaching into his handtailoring sneddon pulled out his wallet and handed me forty pounds in fives it was more than most people made in a month but didnt seem to lighten sneddons wallet too much theres another hundred in it for you when you give me a name for whos behind all this malarkey fair enough i took the money with a smile it was part of my customer relations policy there again smiling when people gave me money came pretty naturally to me it was a clean job legit like sneddon had said all i had to deliver was a name but i tried not to think too much about what would happen to the face behind the name once id delivered it you said you were talking to small change macfarlane about a couple of fighters was kirkcaldy one of them fuck no no it wasnt nothing in that league just a couple of potential upandcomers thats all small change didnt even know of my interest in kirkcaldy youve got to fucking watch what you say to bookies this is kirkcaldys address sneddon handed me a folded note is there anything else you need i made a show of a thoughtful frown even though the idea had come to me as soon as i had heard mention of kirkcaldys name maybe it would be a good idea if you could spring me a ticket for the big fight means i can check out anyone dodgy i would sincerely fucking hope that youve got to the bottom of this before then but aye i can manage that anything else if there is ill let you know i said inwardly cursing that i hadnt thought of a reason to ask for two tickets right you can fuck off now said sneddon i wondered if the freshly minted queen followed the same court etiquette and dont forget to have a sniff about for small changes appointments book ill get singer to drive you back to your car you know singer dont you sneddon beckoned across to the teddy boy whod driven me and twinkletoes out to the farm oh yeah we chatted all the way over here i leaned forward conspiratorially to be honest i found it difficult to get a word in edgewise sneddon gave me another of his sneersorsmiles singer certainly didnt seem to like my witticism i could have been becoming paranoid but i thought i detected even more menace in his lurking aye said sneddon singers not much of a conversationalist not much of a singer either come to that are you singer singer interrupted his lurk long enough to shake his head you could say singer is a man of action not words sneddon paused to take a cigarette from a gold cigarette case so heavy it threatened to sprain his wrist he didnt offer me one singers da was a real bastard used to beat the shite out of him when he was a kiddie knocked his mother about too you know more than normal but singer had this talent he got it from his ma he had a cracking wee voice on him or so people tell me never heard it myself anyways at weddings and shite like that singer and his ma was always asked to stand up and give a song not that he took much asking did you singer he used to sing all the time the only thing the wee bastard had i looked at singer who returned my stare emptily he was obviously used to sneddon discussing his most intimate personal history with a complete stranger either that or he just didnt care but it used to wind up his da no end hed come home drunk and no one was allowed to make a sound any peep out of singer and his da would kick the shite out of him literally sometimes then one day singers old man comes back with a really black one on wee singer is innocently chirping away with his ma in the kitchen but his da gets the idea that there should be a meal on the table for him he goes fucking mental he grabs singer and starts to beat the shite out of him so his ma comes to try to defend the wee fella so do you know what he does i shrugged i looked at singer i had a good four inches on him but he was a hardlooking bastard viciouslooking but i didnt like listening to sneddon rejoicing in his misery he cut singers mas throat sneddon answered his own question there was a hint of awe in his voice took a penknife a penknife mind and cut her throat from ear to ear right in front of the wee fella so singers never sung or spoken since im sorry i said to singer because it was the only thing i could think to say he looked at me expressionlessly aye a bad bastard was singers da they hung the fucker at duke street and singer was put into an orphanage then a kind of funny farm because of him not talking and that sneddon looked at singer knowingly but youre not mad are you singer just bad all the way through i found out about him because tam one of my boys did time with singer shared a cell will i tell him what your speciality was singer singer unsurprisingly said nothing but he didnt nod or move or blink someone grassed him up to the police for a robbery he did but without the witness there was no evidence but singer didnt kill the bastard he cut his fucking tongue out all of it kind of poetic isnt it yeah i said singers face was still impassive positively audenesque anyway said sneddon i like having singer around dyou know the ancient greeks liked to have mutes around at funerals professional mourners anyway i look after singer now dont i singer singer nodded and singer looks after me and my interests i was acutely aware of twinkletoes absence in the car on the way back into town as if he had left twin voids of space and silence i took a players navy blue and offered the packet to singer who shook his head without taking his eyes off the road he was that kind of guy focussed i had forgotten exactly where id left the car but singer found his way to it first shot thanks i said as i got out of the car singer was about to drive off when on an impulse i tapped on his window he rolled it down listen i just wanted to say what what the hell was it i wanted to say i just wanted to say that im sorry about the wisecracks i made you know about you not talking i didnt know about well you know that was a shitty break i fell silent it seemed best considering i seemed to have lost the ability to string a coherent sentence together singer looked at me for a moment in that cold expressionless way he had then gave a nod he drove off i stood and watched the humber disappear around the corner wondering why the hell after all of the other shit i had done and seen in my life i had felt the need to apologize to a cheap glasgow hoodlum maybe it was because what had happened to singer had happened when he was a kid it was the one thing i found tough to take the crap that happens to kids in war in their own homes not for the first time i considered the colourful life i had forged for myself here in glasgow and the interesting people i got to meet chapter three its funny at the time i didnt think of the week after small changes murder as the week after small changes murder i had other things to think about other things to do its often only in retrospect that you see the significance of a particular moment in your life at the time its just the same old crap and you just stumble along oblivious to the fact that you should be keeping a scrapbook or a diary or photographing the minutiae of your life that at some time in the future you would look back and think if only id known what the fuck was going on obviously i saw lorna every day that week and obviously i kept my hands out of her underwear i am nothing if not a gentleman and anyway experience had told me that the ardour of even the most enthusiastic of mattress companions diminishes with grief not with death with grief id learned during the war that death and violence tend to be powerful aphrodisiacs for both genders suffice it to say i became the most solicitous and least lecherous of suitors to be honest i had other distractions they say eskimos have a hundred words for snow glaswegians must have twice that many for the different kinds of rain that batters down on the city yearround in winter glasgow lies under an assault of chilled wet bullets in summer the rain falls in greasy tepid globs like the sky sweating on the city completely atypically glasgow was experiencing a dry and searingly hot summer half of the citys population spent most of that summer looking up squinting at the sky and trying to form the word blue i found the hot weather disconcerting usually any sunlight in glasgow was mitigated by a sooty veil thrown up by the factories and tenement chimneys but that summer there were disorientating moments when the sky cleared and the heat and the light reminded me of summers back home in new brunswick it was only ever a fleeting illusion though repeatedly shattered by the fuming darkbillowing reality of the city around me at least i got to wear lightweight suits that hung better when it came to material the scots had a yearround preference for tweed the scratchier and denser the better a scottish acquaintance had once tried to reassure me that tweed from the isle of harris was less scratchy explaining that this was because it was traditionally soaked in human urine i could have been accused of being picky but i preferred couture that hadnt been pissed on by an inbred crofter i had spent three days getting all the gen i could on sneddons fighter bobby kirkcaldy had been born in glasgow but raised in lanarkshire first in an orphanage and then by an aunt both his parents had died prematurely from heart attacks when kirkcaldy was a child tragic but not unusual if cardiac disease had been a sport then the entire british olympic team would have been made up of glaswegians young bobby kirkcaldy had used his fists to fight his way up and out of the motherwell slum that had been his adoptive home to put his success in context motherwell was the kind of place anyone would fight like hell to get out of id been able to track down a couple of businesses that kirkcaldy had invested in and it was clear he was getting good advice on cashing in on his success when he eventually hung up his gloves either that or he was as nifty with investment as he was in the ring in fact for someone approaching the height of his boxing career he seemed to have his mind and money on other things my office was three floors up across gordon street from central station and by thursday i had done just about all i could do on the phone and was going to take an afternoon trip out to see young mr kirkcaldy i decided to drink a coffee and read the newspaper before i left i like to keep up with things i never knew when rab butler or tony eden would ask for my advice all the news was gloomy britain wasnt the only nation struggling with the loss of an empire the french were having the stuffing kicked out of them in indochina by the vietminh there had been a clash of razor gangs in the gorbals a man had been run over by a train on the outskirts of the city the police hadnt issued a name the only thing that cheered me up was an advertised assurance that apparently taking an amplex chlorophyll tablet each day guaranteed breath and body freshness obviously an attempt to break into an underexploited market i was in the middle of rip kirby when i got a pleasant surprise a very pleasant fivefootthree blonde surprise i recognized her as soon as she walked into my office despite the fact that we had never met before she dressed with an elegance that glasgow didnt stretch to cream silk blouse figurehugging powder blue pencil skirt long legs sheathed in sheer silk her throat was ringed with a necklace with pearls so big the diver must have had to bring them up one at a time earrings to match she wore a small white pillboxtype hat and white gloves but had a jacket that matched the skirt draped over the same forearm as a handbag that in a previous life had swum in the nile or the florida everglades i stood up and tried to prevent my smile from resembling a leer it probably just looked goofy but sheila gainsborough was probably used to men smiling at her goofily hello miss gainsborough i said please sit down what can i do for you you know me she smiled a famous persons smile that polite perfunctory baring of teeth that doesnt mean anything everybody knows you miss gainsborough certainly everybody in glasgow i have to say i dont get many celebrities walking into my office dont you she frowned lowering her flawlessly arched eyebrows and wrinkling a fold of skin on her otherwise flawless brow flawlessly i would have imagined shrugging off the thought and the frown she sat down and i followed suit ive never been to a private detective before never seen one before come to that other than humphrey bogart in the pictures were taller in real life i smiled at my own witticism goofily and i call myself an enquiry agent so why do you need to see one now she unclipped the sixtyguinea crocodile and handed me a photograph it was a professional showbizzy shot colour i didnt recognize the young man in the picture but decided in an instant that i didnt like him the smile was fake and too selfassured he was wearing an expensivelooking shirt open at the neck and arranged over the collar of an even more priceylooking light grey suit his chestnut hair was well cut and lightly oiled he was goodlooking but in a tooslick and weakchinned sort of way despite his dark hair he had the same striking pale blue eyes as sheila gainsborough hes my brother sammy my younger brother is he in show business too miss gainsborough no well not really he sings occasionally hes tried every other kind of business though some of which im afraid havent been totally honourable she sighed and leaned forward resting her forearms on the edge of my desk her skin was tanned not dark just pale gold the cute frown was back its maybe all my fault i spoil him give him more money than he can handle i noticed that she had a vaguely americanized accent i spoke the same way but that was because id been raised in canada as far as i was aware sheila gainsborough had never been further west than dunoon i guessed she had been voicetrained to sink the glasgow in her accent somewhere deep and midatlantic is sammy in some kind of trouble i too leaned forward and frowned my concern taking the opportunity to cast a glance down the front of her blouse hes gone missing she said how long a week maybe ten days we had a meeting at the bank hes overdrawn the account i set up for him but he didnt turn up that was last thursday i went to his apartment but he wasnt there there was two days mail behind the door i took a pad from my desk drawer and scribbled a few notes on it it was window dressing people feel comforted if you take notes somehow it looks like youre taking it all that little bit more seriously nodding sagely as you write helps has sammy done this kind of thing before gone off without letting you know no or at least not like this not for a week occasionally hes gone off on a bender one two days but thats all and whenever im in town you know not on a tour or in london we meet up every saturday and have lunch in cranstons tea rooms on sauchiehall street he never misses it i noted i nodded sagely you said his account is overdrawn have there been any more withdrawals since he went awol i dont know suddenly she looked perplexed as if shed let him down let me down by not checking can you find that out fraid not you say you were supposed to attend the meeting at the bank with him im a cosignatory she said the frown still creased the otherwise flawless brow with due cause i thought her brother sounded like a big spender a high liver if he hadnt been trying to pull cash from his already overdrawn account then he wasnt spending big or living high or maybe even simply not living then you can check i said the bank will give you that information but not me even the police would have to get a court order have you been to the police miss gainsborough i was waiting i kept thinking sammy would turn up then when he didnt i thought id be better getting a private detective i mean enquiry agent why me i asked i mean who put you in contact with me i have a road manager jack beckett he says he knows you i frowned cant say or at least knows of you he said she hesitated as if unsure to commit the rest of her thought to words he said that you were reliable but that you had contact with well that you knew people that were more the kind that sammy has been mixing with i see i said still trying to place the name jack beckett and making a mental note that if i ever did come across him to thank him appropriately for the glowing character reference there was a silence a taxi sounded its horn outside on gordon street a riverbubble of voices rose up from outside and through the window i had left open in the vain hope it would cool the office i noticed a trickle of sweat on sheila gainsboroughs sleek neck so exactly what kind of people was sammy mixing with you said he had gotten involved in less than honourable businesses what do you mean like i said sammy isnt really in show business as such but he does do the odd singing job hes not great if im honest but good enough for glasgow hes been singing in nightclubs and mixing with a bad crowd gambling too i think thats where a lot of the money has been going which clubs i dont know not the ones i started in there was one he went to a lot i think he sang there too the pacific club down near the river oh yes i said oh fuck i thought handsome jonny cohens place you know it i know the owner i can have a word have you ever heard of the poppy club she asked cant say that i have why when i went to his flat there was a note by the telephone that said the poppy club nothing else no number i looked up the phone book but theres no poppy club listed in either glasgow or edinburgh i wrote the name down in my notebook reassuringly whats sammys full name i asked james samuel pollock pollock thats my real name well it was my real name i changed it by deed poll so you were sheila pollock ishbell pollock ishbell my agent didnt think that ishbell pollock had the kind of ring to it that a singing stars name should have really i said as if confused as to why anyone would be blind to the charms of a name like ishbell pollock they had done a good job on her a glasgow club singer one amongst thousands but they had had great raw material to work with sheila gainsborough had the looks she certainly had the looks and the voice to stand out from the crowd shed been talentscouted groomed repackaged managed she maybe had the looks and the voice but the name ishbell pollock and the glasgow accent would have been dropped faster than utilitymark panties on ve day i wrote sammys full name in my notebook when did you last see sammy lunch at the tea rooms a week past saturday what about friends girls people he used to hang around with and you said he has been associating with a bad crowd can you put any names to them he has this friend barnier a frenchman sammy mentioned him a couple of times i think they were friends but it could have been a business thing first name she shook her head sammy always just called him barnier there cant be that many frenchies in glasgow i dont know i said they probably come here in their droves for the cuisine we both smiled anyone else i was at his flat one day and he got a telephone call from a girl they sounded intimate all i got was her first name claire but there were a couple of guys he knew who i really didnt like the look of rough types names sorry i only saw them once waiting for sammy outside the club they had the look as if i dont know as if they didnt want to be seen but they were a shiftless sort late twenties one about fiveeight with dark hair the other maybe an inch shorter with sandy hair the one with the dark hair has a scar on his forehead shaped like a crescent i sat and looked at her deep in thought she looked back eagerly obviously reassured that she had provoked some deep investigative cogitations what i was really thinking about was what it would be like to bend her over my desk okay thanks i said once the picture was complete would it be possible for us to go to your brothers flat have a look around she looked at her watch i need to be on the sleeper to london tonight ive a lot to do beforehand could we go now i stood up and smiled my car is around the corner the atlantic had been sitting in the sun and i rolled down the windows before holding the door open for sheila gainsborough to get in i found myself casting an eye up and down the street in the desperate hope that someone anyone i knew was there to see me let this beautiful rich and famous woman into my car two youths passed without noticing followed by an old man wearing a flat cap and despite the temperature a heavy thick dark blue jacket and a neckerchief tied at his throat he paused only to spit profusely on the pavement i didnt take it as a sign of his being impressed even with the windows open the car was stifling the air heady in its confines hot wood and leather mingled with the lavender from sheilas perfume and a vague hint of a musky odour from her body sammy pollocks flat was on the west side of the city centre but not quite the west end we drove without speaking along sauchiehall street to where the numbers started to climb into the thousands and she told me to turn right a ribbon of park broke up the ranks of threestorey georgian terraces there were some kids playing on the grass and mothers prams parked beside them sat indolently on the park benches beaten listless by summer heat and motherhood pollocks apartment was actually over two levels of one of the semigrand stone terraces at one time the terrace would have gleamed golden sandstone a once brightly coloured arch of stained glass and lead work sat above the door almost viennese charles rennie mackintosh style or similar but glasgow was a city of ceaseless work dirty work the unending belchings of smoke and soot had blackened the stone and dulled the glass it was like seeing a parson in frock coat and breeches after hed been sent down a mine for a few shifts youve always had a key i asked sheila as she unlocked the door she sighed look mr lennox i can tell youve guessed the setup i own the flat i own it i furnished it and i let sammy stay in it i also give him an allowance how old is sammy twentythree i see i said i thought of a twentythreeyearold being handed everything by a sister who herself had yet to hit thirty i thought about when i had been twentythree fighting my way through europe with only a vague hope that id make it to twentyfour sammy pollock was only thirteen years younger than me but he was a completely different generation lived in a different world she read my mind you disapprove of sammys way of life i envy sammys way of life i wish id had it when i was his age youre a very generous sister you have to understand something letting her hand rest on the door handle she looked at me earnestly with the bright blue eyes im five years older than sammy our parents are both dead and im well i feel responsible for my brother and ive been lucky got the breaks and thats put me in the position to help the only person i care about in the world sammys not a bad kid hes just a bit silly at times immature im just worried that hes got himself in with a bad crowd got into trouble i understand i nodded to the door she still held shut shall we someones been here it was the first thing she said when we walked into the living room sure enough the place was a mess some of the mess was clearly bachelor living at its best overfull ashtrays stickybottomed beer bottles and whisky glasses bonding maliciously with the expensive walnut of the side tables a jacket tossed carelessly on an armchair a couple of dirty plates and a coffee cup it was a vernacular i was familiar with myself but there was another dimension to the disorder a thirdparty purposeful element like someone had been looking for something and in a hurry sammy sheila called out and moved urgently across the living room towards the hall i took a couple of steps and halted her progress with a hand on her arm the skin was warm moist beneath my fingertips let me have a look i said you wait here i had already closed my hand around the leatherdressed springsteel sap i carried in my pocket when i was in the hall and out of sheilas sight i took the sap out mr pollock nothing hello i moved along the hall an ivorycoloured telephone sat on a chesthigh hallstand another full ashtray beside it i noticed some of the butts were filters not something you saw a lot of and they were rimmed with crimson lipstick i slipped one into my pocket i moved on checking each of the rooms as i passed the flat was bright and expensively furnished but each room had been turned over with papers and other debris scattered all over the floors i climbed the stairs and found the same on the upper floor i came to pollocks bedroom more clutter strewn across the floor something shiny caught my eye glittering in the sunshine once i was sure we were the only ones in the flat i called down and asked sheila to come upstairs you said you were sure someone has been in here i take it the flat wasnt like this when you were last here she shook her head sammy was never houseproud but not this this looks like hes been burgled i nodded to the bedside cabinet there was a lead crystal ashtray and a brick of a gold table lighter no house breaker is going to leave without that in their pocket this hasnt been a burglary this was a search i bent down and picked up from the floor the shiny item that had caught my eye it was a small polished steelhinged box lying open on the floor i looked around my feet and found the contents that had spilled out does your brother have any medical condition i should know about i placed the syringe and needle back in the metal box and held them out for sheila to see is he diabetic sheila looked at the box and her expression darkened no he doesnt have any medical condition but this means something to you i asked she looked at me hard for a moment before answering ive been around a lot of musicians its part of my job musicians and artists well they experiment with stuff narcotics yes but i dont think or at least ive never had any reason to think that sammy would be involved in that kind of nonsense for a moment we both gazed silently at the metal syringe box in my hands as if it would surrender its secrets to us if we stared at it long enough it could have been sammy himself of course i said i could have sounded more convincing maybe he came back to collect stuff pack a bag i pocketed the syringe box ill check his wardrobes and drawers she said dully maybe ill notice something missing if hes taken clothes she stepped past me the room was hot and stuffy and as she passed i again picked up a whiff of lavender and musk the dressing and the flesh oh boy lennox i thought youve got it bad this time there was a sound from downstairs and we both froze someone was opening the apartment door sheila had closed the snib over behind her and that meant whoever was coming in had a key again i stopped sheila as she made her way to the bedroom door clearly to call out her brothers name i put a finger to my lips slipped past her and moved as quickly and quietly as i could back down the stairs again unpocketing the springhandled sap i reached the bottom of the stairs just as a young man with black hair and a dark complexion opened the vestibule door and stepped into the hall hello i said with a friendly smile keeping the sap out of sight the darkhaired man looked at me his eyes wide with surprise who are you what are you doing here the eyes narrowed as surprise gave way to suspicion i kept smiling and tightened my grip on the sap you know in these films i said where someone says im asking the questions here well thats me lets start with why you have a key for an apartment you dont own or rent and seem to come and go as you please are you a cop he asked lets just say im investigating the disappearance of sammy pollock but youre not a cop his eyes narrowed further suddenly he looked unsure of himself you sent by largo largo he looked relieved then the hardness came back to his eyes his head lowered slightly into his shoulders and he slipped a hand into the side pocket of his jacket playtime upstairs sheila gainsborough must have crept towards the stairs a floorboard creaked my darkhaired chums eyes cast in the direction of the sound and he looked less sure of himself he clearly thought i had reinforcements in the wings i was a little piqued that he thought id need them to deal with him if youre not a cop then fuck you he turned and went back into the small tiled vestibule moving swiftly but without panic oh no you dont i reached out and grabbed his shoulder just hold on a minute he was about three or four inches shorter than me and he misjudged the vicious backward jab with his elbow instead of hitting me in the face or throat it slammed painfully into my chest and sent me backwards it gave him time to open the front door and he was stepping through it when i ran for him i slammed the door shut on him with the flat of my foot all my weight behind the kick the edge of the door caught him on the shoulder but glanced off and smashed into his cheek jamming his head between the door edge and the jamb he was stunned a thick bulge of blood swelled up on his cheek then turned into a torrent down the side of his face and neck staining his shirt crimson oh sorry i said did i catch you with the door his hand made for his pocket and whatever was in it but his movements were sluggish and unfocussed i snapped the sap at him hard twice the first blow cracked something in his wrist and the second caught him on the nape of his neck his lights went out and he went down half in and half out of the door i grabbed him by the back of his shirt collar and dragged him back into the flat i turned to see sheila standing halfway down the stairs her eyes wide and a hand to her mouth did you have to do that she said once she had recovered sufficiently he had a go i said and hes got some kind of weapon in his pocket he was going for it i bent down and pulled out a switchblade i flicked the release and held the knife up for her to see see selfdefence you seem to relish defending yourself mr lennox i shrugged and pulled the slumped figure to his feet he was still groggy but looked at me maliciously i didnt like that so i gave him the back of my hand twice and hard across the uninjured side of his face setting boundaries for gods sake thats enough lennox sheila stepped forward staring hard at me she was right it was enough it was too much i had that hot tight feeling in my chest the desire to hurt someone else that i learned during the war slept in me i could see sheila didnt like the person she was looking at at least we had that in common i didnt like me much either i steered our visitor back into the flat and dropped him into the armchair sheila followed us in and leaned against the wall she lit a cigarette and smoked it urgently other than that she was calm and collected impressive i gave the man in the chair the onceover midtwenties the doublebreasted blue pinstripe not cheap but not expensive same for the shirt and tie i noticed his shoes were not the newest and brown leather i felt like giving him another slap just for that black or burgundy shoes with blue pinstripe not brown whats your name fuck off he said sullenly cradling his injured wrist theres a lady present i said grabbing a fistful of pinstripe burton watch your mouth or youll get a little more pampering from me he looked across at sheila and muttered something apologetic so whats your name costello very funny i expect bud abbott is outside on lookout i gave his midprice tailoring a twist in my fist its true paul costello thats my name i let him go and straightened up you jimmy costellos boy yeah thats me he looked suddenly sure of himself youve heard of my da then youll know that he wont like it much when i tell him you did this to me he held up his wrist and turned his cheek to me why do you have a key to this flat i asked mind your own business im going to phone my da and hes going to sort you out for this good and proper i nodded miss gainsborough could you wait for me in the car i held out my car keys to her but she didnt take them what are you going to do she asked her tone simultaneously injecting disapproval and suspicion dont worry said costello hes not going to do anything he didnt know who he was dealing with now he does and hes going to try and talk his way out of it except he wont he sneered at me like mr costello says we have a bit of a disagreement i need to talk to him in private i shook the car keys as if i was ringing a bell please she took the keys sullenly and left slamming the door behind her after shed gone paul costello glared at me maliciously shiteing yourself now arent you you know who my da is all right you should check who youre dealing with before you start throwing your weight about he winced cradling his injured wrist with his other hand i think youve fucking broken it let me look at it i bent down and costello looked at me suspiciously seriously let me look at it he held out his hand and i gingerly felt the wrist joint he yelled out its not that bad i said i think ive cracked a couple of bones thats all thats all wait till my da finds out youre right i said still examining the wrist you should always know who youre dealing with before having a go take me costello winced again as i found a sensitive spot on his wrist it was beginning to swell up maybe there was a more significant break after all as i was saying take me i do know who your father is i dug my thumb hard into costellos swollen wrist he screamed and i dont give a crap dyou think that your pigarsed mick father is someone i should be scared of he tried to pull his hand away and i rewarded him with another vicious squeeze more screaming truth is i work for the three kings you know the three kings costello nodded staring wildly at the wrist he could not free from my grip well i work for them all on and off i do know your father and hes nothing in the scheme of things a nobody if hammer murphy decided to squash him he could as easy as a bug so you run to pop with tales and ill do the same with hammer murphy we understand each other i punctuated my question with another vicious squeeze of his wrist his face contorted and when i eased the pressure he nodded violently again okay i continued now that we understand each other i think we should have our little chat now why do you have a key to this flat sammy gave me one why were friends what do you mean friends goodmate friends or knobjockey friends what the fu i interrupted his profanity with a light squeeze im no poof he protested when he got his breath back sammy and me are just friends now youre going to find this a tad difficult to believe i said selfdeprecatingly but i have a lot of friends myself and none of them have a key to my place try again mr costello junior thats the truth sammy lets me crash here every now and again i work at the club too what club the poppy club poppy club ive never heard of it i work at the riviera my das place sammy sings there now and again the riviera my laugh came out a snort very glamorous and on what particular part of the ligurian coast does your fathers club reside costello looked at me as if i was talking japanese in glasgow it paid to keep your cultural references simple wheres the riviera club partick near the river he said this time my snort came out a fullblown laugh costello looked offended its a classy place im sure it is it must be high on every vips itinerary i would guess you see a lot of princess margaret fuck you now now junior dont get tetchy or ill hold your hand again speaking of holding hands why are you so cosy with sammy pollock i wouldnt have put you two together weve got ideas business ideas hes fed up of just being sheila gainsboroughs brother and im fed up being thought of as just jimmy costellos son please stop im getting all teary when did you last see sammy a couple of weeks ago i was out of town where out of town whats it to you i smiled and squeezed he winced and glowered london he strained it through his teeth i was down in london for a couple of weeks so you didnt know he was missing i let go of his wrist and lit a cigarette you fucking enjoy this dont you he smiled maliciously through his pain hurting people you really do enjoy it dont you oh please dont generalize i looked offended then smiled ingratiatingly i dont enjoy hurting people i enjoy hurting you lets just say its our thing now i let the smile drop as i leaned forward did you know sammy was missing missing is he missing i know hes not about that doesnt mean hes missing i tried to get him on the phone a couple of times from london i just thought id missed him been unlucky thats why i came around today what kind of business i blew smoke into his face what what kind of business are you and sammy thinking about getting involved in just i dont know artist management we were going to represent some of the musicians who work the pubs and clubs the better musicians we know a lot of them so we thought wed offer management are you sure youre competing with bernard delfont and not ici what costello gave me an irritated frown i wondered if you were thinking about getting into the pharmaceutical business i took the metal syringe box from my pocket opened it and held it out for costello to see is this supposed to mean something to me i was just wondering if you and sammy were thinking about supplying more than career advice to your musician chums youve lost me mister if costello was lying then he was hiding it well although most of his expression was tied up with pain i got the feeling his cheek was now competing with his wrist for his attention whos largo what you thought i was a cop then you thought id been sent by someone called largo largo nothing i mean nobody someone i owe some money to i thought hed sent you round here to see if id show up does sammy know largo does he owe him money too no costello kept my gaze he didnt look like he was lying but with a slimy piece like him it was difficult to tell you didnt answer me who is largo ive never heard of him just a guy just a guy who sends people to collect his debts apparently listen largos got nothing to do with sammy they dont know each other he winced and eased his wrist closer to his chest with his other hand give me the key i said pocketing the syringe box again what give me the key sammy pollock doesnt own this flat and you sure as hell dont so hand it over after he handed me the key with his good hand i hoisted him up and escorted him out of the flat the heat hit us as soon as we were on the street youve not heard the last of this costello glowered at me clutching his injured wrist i took a step towards him and he scuttled off in the opposite direction sheila gainsborough was standing by the car the sun catching the gold in her hair well did you manage to beat the truth out of him listen miss gainsborough i think we need to understand one another young mr costello whose acquaintance weve just made is a less than desirable type i know his father or at least know of him jimmy costello is even less desirable hes a gangster and a thug youve come to me with a problem your brother has gone missing and the first thing we find out is that his flat has been turned over by someone then costello junior arrives with a key to the flat you pay for and seems to come and go as he pleases im sorry if my methods seemed a little direct but having made young mr costellos acquaintance i am now a lot more concerned about your brothers disappearance than i was an hour ago sheila gainsborough did her cute frown again did costello explain what he was doing there and why he had a key well to start with he doesnt have one any more i handed her the key and it was swallowed by the alligator costello claims they were friends and potential business partners but he was pretty vague about what type of business representing musicians does your brother know anything about working as a talent agent sammy not a thing i doubt if costello has taken a course on it either i started the car but paused before moving off does the name largo mean anything to you what the place in fife no this isnt a place its a person costello thought i had been sent by someone called largo sheila stared ahead for a moment thinking the scent of her hung in the small humid silence no she said eventually i dont know anyone called largo and i cant say ive ever heard sammy mention anyone by that name okay i said and smiled ill take you back into town id recommend you continue with your plans and travel down to london ill have a sniff around is there somewhere i can get in touch snapping open the alligator she pulled out a visiting card this is my agents number his name is humphrey whithorn if you need to get in touch he can always find me but what are you going to do youve got nothing to go on ive got the clubs where he worked i can start there i took the card the name sheila gainsborough sunk silver grey into thick white vellum whithorns name was at the bottom right smaller like everything else about her the card shouted quality and money i tried to imagine the name ishbell pollock on the card it didnt take in the meantime it would be good if you could check with your bank to see if sammy has made any attempts to withdraw more money i drove her back to my office where i asked more questions about sammys lifestyle after we ran out of straws to clutch at i promised to do everything i could to find her brother stretching out a hand for me to shake she nodded and stood up i walked her to the door not much of a walk in my tiny hotbox office and promised her that i would keep in touch watching her as she made her way back down the stairwell i noticed how she seemed to glide rather than walk her gloved hand hovering above the banister and her high heels light on the stone steps sheila gainsborough had a grace i hadnt seen in a woman for a long time it reminded me for a moment of someone else and the memory hit me in the gut someone else was someone dead when sheila disappeared from view i turned back into the heat of my office i sat at my desk for a long time trying to pinpoint the source of the uneasy feeling that was beginning to gnaw at me my digs were on great western road it was a good enough place the whole upper floor of a typical glasgow victorian villa its not uncommon to come across a place to stay by happenchance someone knows someone who knows somebody else who has a room to let the happenchance that had led to my flat becoming available was a german uboat fortuitously hitting a royal navy reserve frigate directly midships the frigate had gone down faster than a clydebank whore on a payday docker and took with it a young junior officer called white no big deal just one of the millions of brief human candles that had been prematurely snuffed out during the war this insignificant statistic however had been a universeshattering tragedy for the pretty young wife and two daughters of the junior naval officer a future that had once shone so brightly now lay rusting at the bottom of the atlantic with the hulk of the broken frigate i had encountered the fractured white family when looking for a place to stay mrs white had advertised the place in the glasgow herald with only a navy widows pension to survive on fiona white had come up with a drastic but practical solution she had the upstairs of the house converted into a more or less selfcontained flat and put it up for rent with an insistence that the successful tenant be able to display exceptional references my references had been the most exceptional you could buy from a forger and mrs white had accepted me what i couldnt quite work out was why she had let me stay given that i had had a couple of late night visits from the local constabulary over the last couple of years but there again the place wasnt cheap and i was sedulously prompt with the rent each week the truth was that i could have easily moved on to a better place but i had become fond of the little white family anyone who knew me wouldnt have been at all surprised that my first thought when i had met the pretty young widow was that maybe i could console her and she was the type of woman you really wanted to console but as time went on something unpleasantly chivalrous had crept unbidden into my attitude towards her and i felt somewhat protective of the sad little family downstairs there was a wall phone on the stairs that we both shared and when i got back to my digs i phoned lorna i had hoped to satisfy her with a call but she was insistent that i come round doing the gentlemanly thing was getting to be a bad habit and i drove across to pollokshields when i arrived at the house i was surprised to find my hebridean chum back on guard duty at the front door chust forr the laydees peace hoff mind he sang reassuringly to me i sat between lorna and maggie the atmosphere so charged that i expected to be struck by lightning at any time i comforted i soothed i made my talk as small as it was possible to make it avoiding anything that might remind us all that we were just twentyfour hours on from a brutal murder maggie made some tea and offered me a cigarette from a hundredbox on the coffee table i noticed the brand was four square made by dobie of paisley thats not what you were smoking the other night i said the fancy cork tips oh those she shrugged jimmy got me them its not my usual brand reaching into my jacket pocket i pulled out the stub id lifted from sammy pollocks hall stand ashtray i held it out to maggie so she could see the twin gold bands around the filter she frowned thats them all right where dyou get that its a case im working on missing person is the missing person french not that im aware why do you ask that montpellier thats the brand french jimmy got half a dozen packets from someone probably smuggled maybe thats why youve found someone else smoking them maybe someones smuggled a lorry load in could be i turned to lorna have the police got any news have they said anything about the investigation superintendent mcnab has been back she said her eyelids looked heavy and settledin grief had dulled her expression he asked some more questions what kind of questions who dad had seen over the last few weeks if anything unusual happened i nodded willie sneddon was right to keep his meeting and dealings with small change quiet and did anything unusual happen recently no it was maggie who answered not that either of us knew about but jimmy played his cards close to his chest he kept anything to do with business to himself she paused for a moment there was only one thing not worth mentioning go on someone left a box for him a delivery i remember that said lorna frowning it was strange a wooden box with nothing in it but a couple of sticks and a ball of wool wool yes said lorna red and white wool all bound up together doesnt sound significant i said did the police go through your fathers stuff again i mean in his office no why i just wondered i shrugged and sipped my tea did your dad keep an appointment book at home why are you asking it was maggie who cut in more than a hint of suspicion in her voice the thing about suspicion is that it can be infectious and i found myself wondering why she felt the need to be cautious like i said to you before the police arent the most imaginative bunch maybe they didnt think to check for an appointment book at his home jimmy didnt need one said maggie he kept everything up here she tapped a demiwaved temple he didnt need an appointment book thats what i thought never mind do you think it would help asked lorna without any of her stepmothers suspicion maybe at least we would know who he had seen on the day he died i decided to drop it maybe maggies answer would be enough to get sneddon off my back i stayed for over an hour or at least until i felt i had fulfilled my duty as consort to the bereaved daughter lorna saw me to the door and kissed me as i was leaving it was a desperate kind of embrace and her fingers squeezed tight and hard on my arms it made me feel sad sad because she really needed something from me and i really wanted to give it to her but i couldnt because it wasnt there in me to give lorna and i had been in it for the laughs nothing more and that was the way our little diversion should have played but now with her father murdered and finding herself alone she was looking for something that neither of us had signed up for she seemed to sense its absence and drew back from me something cold had formed in her eyes a frost of realization and resentment listen lorna i began save it lennox she said when i came out of the mouth of the drive a car turning in was forced to brake i waved my thanks but the driver ignored me heading up the drive as soon as i was clear he didnt even look in my direction but i took a long look at him the car was moderately fancy a nearly new maroon lanchester leda or daimler conquest polished to gleam like a sleek droplet of fresh blood the driver himself looked pretty polished he was driving hatless so i could see he was around thirty with black hair and a pencil moustache neat tailored as far as i could see i pulled up at the kerb and considered going back up to the house to see what he wanted he wasnt a cop too wellturned out and expensively carriaged i got out of the car and walked a little way up the drive ducking behind a bush to take a surreptitious look he was at the door and i could now see i was right about his suit it was expensive he was tall maybe a couple of inches on me which was rare for glasgow maggie opened the door and let him in she knew him that was clear and they both unconsciously took a look back down the drive as if checking no one was watching or maybe he had mentioned our brief encounter at the bottom of the drive they couldnt spot me behind my euonymus camouflage and disappeared into the house there had been something about the way they had greeted each other that lay somewhere between the intimate and the professional maybe they had some business together there was of course a limit to how surreptitious they were being lorna was still in the house unless i had a less than charitable thought about my recently bereaved sweetheart and dismissed it almost in the same instant it occurred to me no conspiracy here lennox and even if there is i told myself leave it alone youve been warned and anyway while there might have been a moral imperative to help bring small changes killer to justice i had paying cases to work on and i was never much one for moral imperatives chapter four it was getting late but i thought id call into the horsehead bar for a snifter before heading home the horsehead had become my unofficial second office at one time my main office but recently id been trying to make at least a halfhearted stab at legitimacy and had been spending less time there when i arrived big bob the barman grinned at me i grinned back he was a good sort big bob id often wondered if hed become a barman for the alliterative effect that if he had been known as fat fred he would have become a fireman whatever big bob had been before his time behind the bar he was a tough sonofabitch now so close to the war there was a bit of an unspoken rule you recognized other men whod been through the mincer and you didnt talk about it you identified each other as a common breed but you didnt talk about it well fucking well bob poured me a canadian club where have you been i thought youd fucked off back to canada you working for the new brunswick tourist office too i asked he frowned ive been busy bob anyone been asking for me naw just little bollocks over there he nodded in the direction of a youth at the end of the bar i beckoned for him to come over i take it hes been nursing that half all night i asked bob who gave a knowing look and nodded give him a fresh pint hows it going mr lennox davey wallace beamed at me as he came round to my end of the bar and big bob handed him his beer davey was about five feetseven as freshfaced as the glasgow atmosphere would allow and dressed in a toobig secondhand suit that had been expensive once a war and a generation ago hi davey i said business good he bubbled with enthusiasm any new cases same old stuff davey i answered with a smile davey wallace was a dreamer a good kid but a dreamer for many within its boundaries glasgow was as much a prison as a home the bars that confined them were the class system and in almost every case the lack of any viable alternative to a life of manual labour the shipyards and the steelworks devoured the citys young id often wondered if rotten row glasgows appropriately named maternity hospital simply put apprentice instead of boy on birth certificates davey was an apprentice an apprentice welder working the morning shift in the shipyard started at fifteen and would most likely work there until he was sixtyfive by which time he would have given up his passion for rocknroll probably because hed be deaf from the constant riveting before he hit forty but now davey wallace seventeen years old parentless at seven in an orphanage until fifteen unmarried and with no kids yet to bind him further to an ineluctable industrial fate escaped into the cinema every afternoon and saturday night where he would meet up with a different gang bogart cagney mitchum robinson mature when davey had found out that i was a reallife enquiry agent he had approached me in the bar like a greek shepherd approaching zeus since then he had taken every opportunity to remind me that if i was ever looking for help thanks for the pint mr lennox youre welcome davey shouldnt you be in bed what about your early shift i sleep in the afternoons mostly then as if correcting himself but im always available you know if you needed any help on one of your cases mr lennox im always here i exchanged a look with big bob who grinned listen davey i said its not like you think it is its not like in the movies theres nothing glamorous about what i do for a living his expression dulled you should try working down at the shipyards anythings glamorous compared to that really i grinned i would have thought it was riveting davey either didnt get or didnt appreciate the gag and stared at his pint glumly it was i had noticed a scottish tradition i sighed listen davey i cant offer you a job because i dont have a job to offer i struggle to pay my own way at times but heres the deal if anything comes up where i need an extra pair of eyes or need any kind of help ill give you a shout okay he looked up from his beer and beamed at me anything mr lennox you can rely on me okay davey why dont you finish your beer and get off home like i say ill get in touch if i need anything i let him hang on my elbow till he finished his drink after he was gone big bob came back and poured me another canadian club you realize i only keep this pish in here for you he said why cant you drink scotch like everybody else i cast my gaze around the bar trying to penetrate the bluegrey cigarette haze a knot of older men in flat caps sat huddled around a table in the corner playing dominoes and smoking scrappy rollup cigarettes swirled in cloudlike tobacco smoke they paused from their game only to sip their whisky and laid their dominoes on the beerringed table top with the joyfulness of grim titans toppling graveyard headstones glasgow at its most goyaesque i dont know bob i said wistfully maybe its a delight im saving myself for oh for fucks sake bob said suddenly distracted and looking over my shoulder i turned and saw that four young men had come in through the side door of the public bar tommy jimmy bob called to the two other barmen and the three of them stepped out from behind the bar with a squaredup purposefulness and crossed to the young men i noticed that the newcomers were dressed in rough work clothes one wore a heavy leather armless tabard over his jacket and all four were wearing rubber boots i noticed that their hair was longer than the usual and the guy with the tabard had thick black curling locks they had the sunburned look of men who spent more time outdoors than in fucking pikeys bob muttered under his breath as he passed me okay you lot fuck off out of it ive told your mob before youre not welcome here all we want is a drink said curly with a dull expression and a hint of irish in his accent it was clear he was accustomed to welcomes like the one big bob was offering just a drink quiet like no trouble youll get no drink here you lot dont know how to have a quiet drink ive had the place wrecked before by your kind now fuck off one of the others stared hard at bob he had the ready stance of someone thinking about kicking off curly put a hand on his shoulder and said something to him i couldnt understand the tension went from his frame and the three walked out silently but not hurriedly fucking pikeys bob repeated after they were gone gypsies i asked irish tinkers theyre over here for the vinegarhill fair in the gallowgate theyve pitched up camp by the old vinegar works they seemed reasonable enough to me i said big bob crossed his popeye forearms across his massive chest aye they seem that way now but a few drinks in them and they go fucking mental by the end of the night id be picking the furniture up for firewood if i start letting knackers drink in here drink and fight thats all these bastards know yeah drink and fight i repeated trying to work out how this fact distinguished them from the usual glaswegian customer its funny i was at a pikey fight the other night aye i bet there was blood and snotters all over the place fucking mental bob shook his head in a way that reminded me of the awe sneddon had displayed when talking about his tinker fighters i got back to my digs about ten as i passed her door i heard fiona white switch the television off i had bought a set six months before when my cash flow had been going through one of its sporadically positive periods i had come up with the pretence that the television would be better in their lounge more room some crap like that the truth was that i had no great interest in television i still couldnt see it replacing radio one of my greatest disappointments had been to see the actor valentine dyall for the first time on television the face behind the voice behind the man in black on radios appointment with fear turned out to look like a dyspeptic bank manager i had told mrs white that i could watch it at any time if that was okay with her but she was to feel free for her and the kids to watch it whenever they felt like it i knew they did but she had a habit of switching it off when i was in my flat she had told me when i had assured her that it was really okay with me for them to watch as much tv as they wanted that she was worried that she would wear the tube out the truth i knew was that she didnt want to feel she owed me anything she didnt want to owe anyone anything it was a drawbridge that had been drawn up a long time before i had first encountered her fiona white was an attractive woman still young but i really couldnt recall ever having seen her smile i went up to my rooms and listened to the overseas service for a while before tuning into the home service there was an item on the news about the forthcoming fight between bobby kirkcaldy and jan schmidtke it was one of the most anticipated fights in the citys boxing history despite the fact that the result was a foregone conclusion the german slugger schmidtke was universally considered to be outclassed and outgunned by the stylist kirkcaldy i grinned smugly at the thought that id managed to spring a ticket for the fight after all the grin faded though when i thought about how bigleague willie sneddons and jonny cohens ambitions were becoming taking a slice of bobby kirkcaldy was stretching them beyond glasgow i started to feel uneasy about getting mixed up in whatever dodgy dealings were going on behind a sporting event of national significance but there again that was the business i was in dodgy dealings that summer and for about a year leading up to it ever since id gotten involved in all kinds of shenanigans down at the docks and ended up with holes in me where there shouldnt be any i had been trying to get myself straightened out it was difficult to frame a description of my life without resorting to profanity and it was true to say that my life was truly fucked up i guessed that was what people said about me oh there goes lennox okay guy fucked up though i had made a great effort over the last twelve months to diminish the fuckedupness of my life i had one overarching ambition that one morning while shaving i could look in the mirror without disliking the person who looked back at me the truth was i had been a straightforward bright and as enthusiasticasallhell allcanadian kid growing up on the shores of the kennebecasis with rich parents and an education at the uppercrusty rothesay collegiate college nothing fuckedup there but then a little austrian corporal decided to fuck up more than my world and i found myself an officer in the first canadian army and four thousand miles from home and up to my knees in mud and blood the first canadian or at least those who led the first canadian had an enthusiasm for throwing my countrymen into the mincer normandy dieppe sicily wherever there was a seriousordnancerippingthroughhumanflesh party we tended to get the first invite my excursion started in sicily and lasted all the way through italy holland and germany it was somewhere along the way during my grand european tour that the kennebecasis kid became yet another casualty of war whoever it was i became during the war he fitted right in right here in glasgow and it had been while i stood in glasgow wearing a demob suit that i otherwise wouldnt have been seen dead in and holding a ship ticket to halifax nova scotia that i had first encountered the three kings theres this misconception that all gangsters are the same that all coppers are the same some people even believe sometimes with a fair amount of justification that all gangsters and all coppers are the same the truth is that the underworld is a community like any other with the same range and variety of personality physical type and character that you find in any walk of life you cant even say that they are united in dishonesty or immorality some villains have a very strict moral code some dont the three kings were a good example what willie sneddon jonny cohen and hammer murphy didnt run in glasgow wasnt worth running in glasgows three leading crime lords had sat down over lunch in a civilized manner in the elegant surroundings of the regency oyster bar and discussed the future the upshot was that while they sat and divided the lunch bill equally between them they had done pretty much the same to glasgow there had been nothing elegant or civilized about what had preceded their lunch a vicious gang war sneddon and cohen on one side murphy on the other had threatened to wipe them all out added to which the first casualty of war was profit by the time sneddon cohen and murphy emerged from the regency a coronation had taken place the three crime lords had become the three crime kings but like i said no one is the same and the three kings were very different people willie sneddon was a truly nasty piece of work devious and malignant sneddon the gorbals hard man had robbed murdered and tortured his way to the top but he was smart even subtle subtlety was not something you associated with hammer murphy in much the same way you wouldnt associate camels with the antarctic michael murphy had gained the epithet hammer after pulping the skull of rival gang boss paul cochrane with a lead barrelheaded builders mallet in front of the assembled members of both gangs murphy was a man of limited intellect but possessed a viciousness as truly awesomely monumental as the chip on his shoulder he had embraced his new nickname with enthusiasm and was known to wield a hammer against knees elbows and skulls whenever a suitable opportunity arose it was he had once confided in me good to have a trademark jonny cohen the third king was a perfect illustration of the variety of personality and type within the criminal fraternity known as handsome jonny because of his filmstar looks cohen was a decent kind of guy and a devoted husband and father who lived a quiet life in newton mearns telaviv on the clyde as it was known in glasgow or at least he was a decent quietliving kind of guy when he wasnt holding up banks organizing jewel robberies running illegal bookies that kind of thing it was also true to say that jonny had moved a few souls closer to the lord in his time but they had all been competitors or active playmates in the big glasgow game no civilians i liked jonny i had good reason to he had saved my neck and when i first arrived in glasgow it had been jonny who first suggested he and his colleagues could perhaps make use of my skills dont get me wrong i had known exactly the kind of people i was getting involved with and i had known that some of the enquiries i carried out for them took me very close to and often over a very fudged border between the legal and illegal id gotten involved in some seedy and unpleasant shenanigans and as time had gone on i had felt like i was sinking deeper and deeper into a personality that i really didnt care for thats why over the last twelve or thirteen months id been making a real effort to straighten myself out and that meant having less to do with the three kings instead i had been doing fine upstanding work for the community mainly staging infidelities in seedy hotels for divorce cases but the two cases i was now working on threatened to drag me back into the cosy embrace of glasgows most dangerous men one thing that unites the criminal fraternity is that they dont tend to keep bankers hours extortion with menaces vice armed robbery and running brothels takes it out of you and your average gangster tends not to be a morning person so i decided to wait until the following afternoon before paying jonny cohen a house call even though i knew that he of all the kings had the closest to a normal daily schedule i gave him a ring after lunch and we arranged to meet conveniently at the pacific club that evening about five i stood before the pacific club and contemplated glamour its a funny thing glamour the word itself was as scottish as they come meaning a spell or an enchantment cast over someone to enrapture them it was odd that having invented the word the scots were totally at sea with the concept whenever they strived to achieve it it just came out all wrong no that wasnt entirely true there were exceptions sheila gainsborough had glamour in spades naturally and effortlessly a rare achievement given the lack of it in her origins the pacific club was intended to be glamorous it failed more than that its failure was the kind that would have helped neville chamberlain feel better about munich the pacific club was the ground floor and basement of a sootblackened building on broomielaw down on the north bank of the clyde as it dissects the city centre it was a gloomy place even in daytime being almost tucked under the latticed ironwork of the rail bridge over the river the sun was still blazing when i got there and it was a relief to step into the clubs clammy coolness like walking into a subterranean cave officially the pacific was a private membersonly club a legal wriggle that allowed handsome jonny cohen to circumvent most of the licensing laws like all such nighttime venues it had that depressing tacky look during the day like a seaside resort offseason the air in the club was clear but the greasy odour of stale cigarettes clung to every surface there were two dozen chairstacked tables a small stage and a bar in the corner the nautical theme was represented mainly by ship life rings emblazoned with ss pacific club on the walls and by some netting halfheartedly arranged over the stage the small curved bar had a driftwood sign above it stating that it was the hawaiian hula bar and some more netting draped around it there were crab shells dotted about the netting maybe it was just me but i couldnt image anywhere within the known universe and probably several parallel ones that could possibly be further away from some sundrenched azuresea tropical island than the broomielaw in glasgow although i had to admit the pacific club was probably as good a place as any to catch crabs i got there about ten before five just as the staff were arriving to unstack the chairs from the tables and start preparing for a long night of overpriced drinks underclad girls and mediocre jazz handsome jonny was already there he beamed a searchlight grin of perfect teeth above the cary grant cleft in his chin he looked clean cool and fresh i am definitely no slouch at turning myself out but i had the distinct feeling that jonnys tailor and barber had gotten together to conspire to give me an inferiority complex i was suddenly aware that my shirt was clinging to my back with sweat jonnys thick dark hair had been immaculately cut and for a second i wondered how feasible it would be to travel to hollywood from glasgow once a fortnight for a trim i decided to keep my hat on for the moment stands scotland where it did lennox he reached out his hand and i shook it wrong character what youve got the wrong macbeth character macduff asks ross stands scotland where it did the character of lennox doesnt say anything much to anybody just sticks by his king and ends up getting killed for it is that the kind of lennox you are the question is which king would you stick by jonny didnt wait for an answer and grinned you know what i like about you lennox talking to you is always an education its the company i keep ive been hanging around with twinkletoes mcbride sometimes its just like the brains trust when we get together anyway i think its fair to say you and i have learned a few things from each other about each other dont you jonny jonnys smile stayed in place but changed a little like a wisp of cloud passing across the sun what can i do for you lennox well ive got two cases on at the moment and youre involved in both in a way oh i take it one is the bobby kirkcaldy carryon willie sneddon has asked me to speak to kirkcaldy looks like someones trying to spook your fighter one of the staff started to vacuum and jonny winced at the noise he beckoned for me to follow him and we sat at a table right at the back of the club on an elevated section that overlooked the small stage it was odd seeing handsome jonny cohen here he could not have looked more out of place which was even more odd because it was after all his place if you had seen him here as a customer with his looks and expensive haircuts and tailoring you paid for in guineas not pounds you would say to yourself that guys slumming it but he wasnt a pacific club customer he was the owner and jonny the businessman knew that he didnt need to lavish his good taste or better cash on the place i took my hat off and ran a smoothing hand through my phersons cut the finest oneandsixpence could buy you in glasgow but it still wasnt hollywood just a minute he got up again and went across to one of the girls preparing the bar he sat down again and once more hit me with his searchlight smile ive got a treat for you the girl came back with a bottle and two glasses thanks fran he said and took the bottle from her and held it towards me cradling it in both hands as if presenting me with an award all the way from bardstown kentucky heaven hill bourbon i know you prefer ryes to scotches go on try it he poured me a glass and i took a sip perfect i said and it was you know sneddon and i both have a share in kirkcaldy yeah but murphy hasnt jonny shook his head as if id suggested he sell me his sister for sex not likely and its best he doesnt know anything about this hes always moaning that we leave him out of stuff well this time we did hed start throwing his weight about and there are other people involved with kirkcaldy whod run a mile if they took one look at murphy i know the feeling i said sneddons got this bee in his bonnet about kirkcaldy being got at jonny said with an almost sigh i can see his point jonny shook his head somethings not right about it lennox its not just a spook job all of this shite nooses left on his doorstep nooses i put my drink down sneddon didnt say anything about nooses he said kirkcaldy had had paint poured over his car and a dead bird put through his letterbox yeah said jonny those too but someone laid out a hangmans noose on his doorstep and did sneddon tell you about the paint on the car the colour i mean i shook my head red blood red and the dead bird wasnt just a sparrow or shite like that it was a dove a white dove now what the fucks all that about put it all together and it looks like someones making some kind of death threat i said id say that would fit with warning him off winning this fight naw something doesnt feel kosher about it all said jonny it was me who suggested to sneddon that we put you on to it theres more to this than some kind of halfarsed attempt at fight fixing you know what i mean i shrugged ill explore every avenue as they say in all the best cop movies you said two what you said there were two cases you were looking into that i was involved in some way oh yes well not you so much as this place i said looking around me you know the singer sheila gainsborough course glasgow girl made good nice singing voice and the lungs to go with it i said anyway her brother has gone missing oh yeah sammy gainsborough sammy pollock gainsborough is her stage name shes legally changed it now to gainsborough but it was pollock her brother is sammy pollock ive got news for you he goes by the name gainsborough now at least professionally cashing in on big siss success id guess so you do know him sure hes sung here a couple of times hes nothing to write home about okay voice but hes no match for his sister when did he last sing here about three weeks ago jonny took a cigarette case from his pocket and offered me one we both lit up sammy was filling in for a cancelled act last minute thing he wasnt a regular booking here havent seen him since even as a customer was he a regular reasonably thats why we were able to get him to stand in for the act that cried off sick he wasnt just available he was here did you know that hes involved with jimmy costellos son paul costello jonny frowned no i didnt now that is one greasy little shite now that you mention it hes been around the club a few times i wouldnt have linked him with sammy though i dont think ive ever seen them together not here do you think young costello has something to do with sammy gainsboroughs disappearance i dont know jonny he says he didnt even know that sammy was missing maybe he isnt could be hes off on a bender somewhere and hell wash up in a couple of days or so if he is missing i would take a long hard look at costello if hes anything like his old man hes a twisted wee bastard trying to squeeze cash from anything he can lay his hands on ill bear that in mind how well do you know costello i mean costello senior i havent had a lot of dealings with him he runs a bookie and a pub in the east end pays tribute to hammer murphy and murphy calls on him for stuff now and again borrows extra muscle that kind of thing murphy really does run his patch as a kingdom or a fiefdom costello does as hes told pays what hes told and is left to do his own thing so long as murphys kept in the know thats pretty much what i thought and is costello junior learning the trade from his old man costello has two sons paul and his older brother michael i dont think costello has much time for either of them paul is a wanker and michael turned out to be a real disappointment to his old man oh yeah imagine the shame of your son turning out honest when youve devoted your life to thieving must have been a huge blow to costello to see the fruit of his loins turn out to be lawabiding michael even considered the priesthood apparently but instead moved to edinburgh and works as a civil servant shit my tone and expression registered my sympathy for both father and son a civil servant in edinburgh no one deserves that do you know of a frenchman called barnier i asked alain barnier sure whats he got to do with anything according to sheila gainsborough hes been hanging around with sammy pollock jonny smiled alain barnier doesnt hang around with anyone they hang around with him hes a smooth operator whos he with no one come on jonny everyone whos got a piece of action in this town is aligned with you murphy or sneddon barnier is mainly legit sure i think hes got a few tasty deals on the side but nothing that we would be interested in i do the odd bit of business with him what kind of business whats his line officially hes an importer he imports wine mainly and spirits he also brings in stuff from the far east furniture ornaments that kind of shite hes lived here for about a couple of years and he supplies some of the fancier restaurants in town edinburgh too but if theres anything else you need brought in he probably can arrange it for you jonny poured us another each and tilted the heaven hill bottles label in my direction once more barnier was my contact for this stuff cognac too let me guess he doesnt like to put the customs man to any trouble hes very considerate that way saves our hardworking public servants a lot of paperwork but the stuff he brings in has always been at the quality end you could say nothing youd find at paddys market word is that side of his operation isnt as good as it was rationing coming to an end has been bad for business what about cigarettes does he smuggle those too fancy french brands jonny shrugged doubt it suppose its possible though have you ever heard of the poppy club jonny its maybe got something to do with barnier it definitely has something to do with sammy pollock poppy club its not listed in the phone book maybe its not licensed never heard of it lennox by the time he poured the third bourbon i was beginning to glow i reappraised the pacific club but the glow didnt catch it still looked depressing where would i be able to find barnier i asked hes here if weve got a good jazz act on fridays but not every friday youre best trying to catch him down at the river he has an office of sorts down there more a shed near the bonded area is that where he liberates his goods from bondage jonny shrugged wouldnt know if he does it will be through bribery the odd brown envelope to a watchman copper or taxman barnier is no outandout crook like i said just sails close to the wind law wise you two should get on i better go i said draining the glass thanks for the whisky jonny saw me to the door and after the gloom and bourbon of the pacific club we stood squinting for a moment in the bright sunlight lennox said jonny shielding his eyes with his hand yep this other case sammy pollock i know you have to follow it up but dont let it get in the way of finding out what the fuck is happening with bobby kirkcaldy sneddons getting as antsy as hell the fights in just over two weeks time and like i say theres something about the whole thing stinks as far as im concerned ill see him tonight thanks again for the bourbon jonny had of course been right whenever i thought of the sammy pollock case i smelt grief whenever i thought of the kirkcaldy case i smelt money there was a lot of it riding on kirkcaldy and i guessed jonny cohen and willie sneddon would be in a big bonus mood if i got it all sorted out for them and i had to a certain extent done the sniffing about that id promised sheila gainsborough id do but there was something about the thing with sammy that was nagging away at me anyway i hadnt had a chance to practise my french for a long time chapter five the british empire the most avaricious piece of land theft since genghis khan saddled up a pony was a remarkable thing what made it particularly remarkable was that it had been carried out by the british probably the most apologetic race on the planet i always imagined them as some kind of impeccably wellmannered latterday vikings frightfully embarrassed about all the raping and pillaging i suppose my interest in the globespanning collection of raj colonies dominions mandates and protectorates lay in my being very much a product of it i was born in glasgow but shipped off with my folks when i was still a baby and canada was still the dominion as far as everyone was concerned then after twentyone summers the mother country of which i had had no direct contact or even recollection suddenly and urgently needed my assistance four thousand miles away and now sixteen years on i was living in the second city of an empire on which despite classroom assurances to the contrary the sun was most definitely now setting for a century and a half glasgow had been the empires industrial heart but the war had screwed all of that up britain had ended the conflict all but bankrupt if the united states had not come along in with a close on four billion dollarloan then the sceptrd isle would have gone bankrupt now former enemies were fast becoming new competitors in shipbuilding and heavy industry things were changing fast in the world they were changing faster in britain and fastest in glasgow not that you would have guessed it from the activity in the docks as i drove past them it was tenthirty in the morning and already hot i had both the atlantics windows rolled down and as i drove past the quays the sound of metal being hammered clashed seared and cut rang dull but loud in air so muggy and thick with grime you could have strained it it was as if the temperature was being increased by the activity itself to my left a forest of cranes jostled at the waters edge swinging ceaselessly loading and unloading docked ships or supplying vast sheets of heavygauge steel to the yards i drove on past the huge redbrick dockside bonded warehouses five storeys high behind tall fences i parked on the street and went to the gatehouse and asked where alain barnier had his offices the gateman was the usual retired cop with the usual icouldntgiveafuck attitude and the best i could get out of him was directions to some other smaller shipping offices where they might have a better idea it took me half an hour of asking around before getting a pointer to barniers office by the time i got down there it was after eleven as jonny had said it was more of a shed than an office one of a rank of semicylindrical nissen huts like a row of sequoia logs half sunk into the earth the sign above the door said barnier and clement import agents i knocked and went in as soon as i did i could see that this was no front but a genuine working office there was the kind of ordered chaos thats impossible to fake a counter separated the main body of the hut from the reception area there was a push bell on the counter and next to it a paper spike piled high with impaled shipping bills there were three desks behind it halfadozen filing cabinets and a woman the woman was about fiveone and dressed in a businesslike grey suit that strained a little at the waist and bust she had a pale round face and black hair coiled in a perm so tight and unyielding it could have withstood an abomb test she had a small thinlipped slit of a mouth that she had tried to flesh up with red lipstick can i help you she asked coming around from behind her desk and to the counter she stretched the thin lips in a weary perfunctory smile im looking for mr barnier is this about the key lan she asked the key lan i frowned whats a key lan she ignored me mr barniers not here at the moment did you have an appointment no no appointment when will he be back youll need an appointment to see mr barnier my eyes work just fine without an appointment when will he be back she had large round green eyes set into her round face and she used them to stare at me as if i had been a congenital idiot an appointment she came close to the kind of syllable by syllable pronunciation favoured by twinkletoes mcbride the sign says barnier and clement is mr clement here monsieur clement she said correcting my pronunciation dropping the hard t at the end of the name and sounding it out as clemmong in the way that only the scots can murder the french language does not work here he is based in our french office i see there was the usual hinged lid arrangement on the counter and swinging it open i stepped through the counter and onto her side the round green eyes grew rounder youre not allowed in here ill wait i said and sat down behind one of the desks pitching my hat onto a pile of papers probably best seeing as you cant tell me when hell be back or where i could find him my dumpy girlfriend with the round eyes and thin lips lifted the hatch on the counter as if holding it open for me you cant wait there you go underestimating me again i can wait ive done it before lots of times in fact between you and me im rather good at it she picked up the telephone on her desk and dialled a number she turned her back on me and spoke into the mouthpiece in a hushed but agitated voice after a moment she turned and held the receiver out to me wordlessly i smiled cheerfully at her we were getting on so well you are looking for me the voice on the other end of the line spoke perfectly articulated english the french accent was distinct but not heavy mr barnier i wondered if we could have a chat a chat about what no suspicion or guardedness just impatience im trying to get in contact with someone you may be able to help me find them who id rather we discussed this facetoface and as soon as possible if you dont mind where could we meet for whom are you looking he asked again with the acquired perfect grammar of a nonnative english speaker sammy pollock you maybe know him as sammy gainsborough there was a pause at his side of the connection then in the same contractionless formal english there is something about this which suggests to me your interest is professional rather than personal yet you did not identify yourself to miss minto as a police officer thats because im not if i had it would have been impersonation im not very good at impersonations except maurice chevalier but im sure as a frenchman yourself youd be able to see through that one i do not have the time for this what is your name lennox you do know sammy pollock dont you mr barnier i do however i do not know him well insufficiently well in fact to know anything about his whereabouts id still like to talk to you mr barnier i am afraid i am too busy for this i cannot assist you with your enquiries and these are enquiries are they not i take it you are some kind of private detective im just helping someone out mr barnier sammy pollock has gone missing and im trying to ascertain his state of health and whereabouts i would be obliged if you could spare me a few minutes there may be something you know that seems insignificant to you but that could help me track sammy down i am sorry as i said i do not have the time i quite understand ill explain to mr cohen it was he who suggested i speak to you i got what i wanted a small silence at the other end of the line barnier was putting things together in his head whether they came together in an accurate picture or not i didnt really care do you know the merchants carvery in the city centre he said at last a sigh spun through it i know it i said the merchants carvery was a noriffraff kind of bar and restaurant in a riffraff kind of city barnier obviously had style and the cash to back it up i couldnt see someone like that being involved with sammy pollock even less with scum like paul costello but it had to be checked out meet me there at eight pm he said in the bar thank you mr barnier ill be there i drove back towards the town but before i got to the centre turned up the north road towards aberfoyle my head hurt a dull persistent throbbing in the temples and behind my eyes glasgow had pulled a curtain over the sun a thin darkflecked veil of cloud the temperature stayed hot however and the air around me seemed denser heavier i knew that the pain in my head was a warning of a storm coming getting out of the city didnt do much to ease the oppressive air that was now playing my sinuses like an accordion after about fifteen minutes i was up around the mugdock area where glasgow yielded to open countryside and scattered expensive houses the sun had broken through again but the prestorm heaviness continued to hang in the air and the sky to the west was the colour of shipyard steel bobby kirkcaldys place wasnt the most expensive but it was a huge step up from his origins in motherwell but then again having a toilet indoors and one that you didnt have to share with four other families was a huge step up truth was i quite admired kirkcaldy as a boxer he had started off welterweight later moving up to middleweight but retaining a certain grace and lightness on his feet i had seen him fight twice and it had been like watching two completely different boxers kirkcaldy was one of those boxers who while probably no mental giant in any other way seemed to possess a profound physical intelligence a constant process of interpretation and fine recalibration to match every move his opponent made it was as if he could read any fighter within the first minute of a round and adapt his style to suit if he was up against an infighter kirkcaldy subtly increased his range forcing his opponent to stretch outside his preferred zone if kirkcaldy was up against an outfighter he closed in with tight jabs forcing his opposite number always backwards and onto the ropes one of the fights i had seen had been against pete mcquillan mcquillan was a slugger and bruiser a stump of a man who struggled to stay in the middleweight bracket and in terms of style was just one step up from the pikey bareknuckle boys mcquillan winning a fight and he had remained undefeated until then depended either on a knockout or his doing so much devastation to his opponents face that the referee stopped the match then he had been matched with bobby kirkcaldy it had been an amazing thing to watch mcquillan viciously scything empty air while kirkcaldy had danced around him placing stinging jabs with absolute precision it took mcquillan to a place hed never been before the distance kirkcaldy had been the unanimous points winner now he was the clear favourite for the european middleweight championship and would be meeting the west german jan schmidtke and i would be there i had a ticket the house was roughly the same size as macfarlanes in pollokshields but was more recently built maybe in the twenties or thirties and it benefited from a more prestigious geography it had also benefited from whitewash which made it look bright and foreign in the sunlight the front door faced south but was shielded by a deco arch edged in earthred brickwork the whitewash walls beneath the red tiles and the terracotta brick detailing was an ambitious attempt to give the house an almost mediterranean look which in scotland was an achievement akin to making lon chaney look like clark gable i wasnt sure how much of the credit should go to the architect and how much to the alien climate that seemed to have invaded the west of scotland the door was answered almost instantly when i rang the electric pushbell i got the idea that they had heard my atlantic crunch its way up the drive they were looking out for visitors welcome or otherwise i guessed it wasnt bobby kirkcaldy who answered the door but someone probably even more pugnaciouslooking an older man in a dark suit and thin woollen tie he was lean and meanlooking and he had the appearance of something assembled from the toughest material he had white bristle for hair and a deeplined leathery face that was more than weatherbeaten it looked as if anything capable of giving it a beating weather or otherwise had had its turn on his face his flattened nose had that thick rubbery formless look that suggested it had been broken so many times that there was no cartilage left to give it any kind of meaningful shape the damage wasnt just visually apparent when he spoke he sounded muffled and nasal even more than the average glaswegian did what do you want he asked a quiet life money a beautiful girl and a sense of inner peace he looked at me blankly along with the crap he had clearly had the humour beaten out of him im here to see bobby i sighed i was not appreciated here my name is lennox im expected he looked me up and down i mirrored his examination it was difficult to age him he could have been a battered fifty or a fit seventy it was obvious he was an exfighter but i reckoned as much damage had been done to his face outside the ring as in it i tilted my head and smiled impatiently the old warrior stood to one side to let me in i was going to hand him my hat but he didnt look the jeeves type so i hung on to it and followed him down a long hallway with terracotta tiles on the floor and tasteful art some original on the wall i guessed that a motherwellraised boxer like kirkcaldy would probably have about as much good taste as my elderly companion with the devastated nose would have a sense of smell i put the domestic aesthetic down to a good decorator he led me into a large lounge with big french windows that looked out over a massive expanse of landscaped garden to the green hills beyond it was a nice place the kind of nice you had to pay for again what struck me most was the way it had been furnished glasgow was generally a makedoandmend kind of city britain was a makedoandmend society mainly because until recently the countrys very survival had depended on it postwar nearbankruptcy had added inertia to the pendulum swing from austerity to prosperity added to all of this was scottish social conservatism i had seen a few homes that had been decorated in the contemporary style jonny cohens for example but generally modernism was distrusted and when it was used as decor it was normally done halfheartedly or clumsily overdone all of which is why bobby kirkcaldys home would have looked to the average scot like a hollywood set this was all good stuff if the furnishings werent original bauhaus or le corbusier or eames they were pretty good copies there was a wall filled with books i had the uncharitable thought that kirkcaldy the boxer must have told his interior designer to make him look smarter just like in the hall the art on the lounge walls looked original most of it was modern and edgy abstracty stuff but there was something about that kind of art that appealed to me like the furniture it was new and for me new was good again i put it all down to an overpaid interior decorator bobby kirkcaldy stood up when we came in he had been sitting on a leather lounger by the big windows and when he got up and crossed the room to us he did so with the same easy grace with which id seen him move in the ring he had thick dark hair and unlike the old guy at my side there wasnt the usual evidence in kirkcaldys face of a boxers career his nose didnt look as if it had ever been broken and there was only a hint of the highcheeked angularity of a fighters face he was wearing an opennecked shirt and lightweight trousers the look was casual but had jermyn street all over it you lennox asked kirkcaldy he didnt smile but there was nothing overtly hostile in his manner either just businesslike im lennox you know why im here to look into this nonsense thats been going on youve been hired by willie sneddon to be honest i think all this shite bothers sneddon more than it bothers me kirkcaldys voice was light almost gentle but he managed to inject a hint of distaste when he articulated willie sneddons name he spoke with a quiet confidence and had less of an accent than i had expected when you saw him up close as opposed to the distance a boxing stadium compels there was an intelligence in the eyes but there was something else that i couldnt define and it stopped me liking him i turned and looked at the punch bag who had shown me in and then back at kirkcaldy its okay kirkcaldy said you can talk in front of uncle bert uncle bert has coached me since i was a kid uncle bert looked at me expressionlessly but there again hed probably had the mobility to form an expression beaten out of his face years ago i found myself silently questioning his qualifications as a boxing trainer seeing as no one seemed to have taught him the meaning of the word duck okay i said i looked around the room in the way you do when youve got to that point where you should have been invited to sit but havent nice place like the paintings im never sure where abstract expressionism ends and lyrical abstraction begins these are neither said kirkcaldy i dont trust isms political or artistic i just buy what i like and what i can afford and the only reason i can afford it is because of the fight game he picked up that we were still standing and pointed to a sofa that hovered just clear of the polished wooden floor i lowered myself onto it there was a lot of lowering involved kirkcaldy certainly didnt talk like the average streettoring pugilist and i started to suspect the books on the shelves werent just for show there was a certain type of workingclass scot who deprived of it in their childhood treated learning and knowledge as if they were bullion i thought i was above making snobby judgements id just proved to myself that i wasnt it was clear to me now that the impression of physical intelligence kirkcaldy showed in the ring was part of something bigger do you know much about art mr lennox he asked and sat down on the eames chair opposite uncle bert remained standing it was probably force of habit staying upright had cost him dearly in the past some i said i was interested in it before the war then it was kind of expected of me to get interested in the war but i still like to visit the odd gallery kirkcaldy smiled and nodded there was nothing to the smile in the same way there had been nothing to sheila gainsboroughs smile you know this is a lot of nonsense dont you i shrugged it sounds to me like someone is trying to spook you before the big fight there are a lot of people betting a lot of money one way or the other on this fight and some of those people arent above dodgy dealings to protect their investment its obviously somebody trying to spook me but its not working i dont spook easily and anyone whos had anything to do with me would know id quit the ring before throwing a fight has anyone approached you about it phone calls notes under the door that kind of thing no nothing like you say just a spook job trying to put me off my preparation for the fight i nodded and noted maybe it would get back to sneddon that i had nodded and noted this was a wild goose chase just like the thing with small changes appointment book the only thing that surprised me about it was kirkcaldys willingness to accept it was someone trying to queer him for the fight like jonny cohen i got the impression this was about something else i decided to run the idea past him is there anything else anybody with a grudge or some dispute youve got going that might explain this he pursed his lips and thought it over for a moment no i can honestly say i cant imagine anyone doing this for personal reasons i see i said it was interesting that he had to think about it before answering as if he had never before considered the possibility we talked for another half hour during which i noted down each of the things that had happened the dates the times kirkcaldy gave me the information in a goingthroughthemotions manner i asked if i could see the car that had been splashed with red paint it had been repainted the noose had been thrown out as had obviously the dead bird what kind of bird was it i asked what i dont know a bird a dove or a pigeon i think but i do know it was white pure white so probably a dove how did it die i dont fucking know he became agitated and the motherwell in his voice became more pronounced what will you do he asked wearily well ive nothing to go on youve no idea of who might have a personal grievance against you theres not a lot i can do other than watch your back for a while i can watch my own back he said and cast a meaningful look at uncle bert well if you dont mind ill keep an eye on things of course i cant be here all the time so if anything happens you can get me on one of these numbers normally i scribbled down my office and home number as well as the number for the phone behind the bar at the horsehead by the time i left kirkcaldys place the shipiron sky had turned even darker and the air even more oppressive it was damphot and i could feel the pressure like a band around my head i had only been driving for a couple of minutes when the weather broke if theres one thing glasgow can do well better than anywhere else i know then its rain there were a couple of bright ugly flashes in the sky and the rain hit my windscreen before the deafening thunder rolled over me it didnt just rain it was as if there was a pentup fury driving the thick heavy bullets of rain that rattled and drummed furiously on the roof of my car and mocked the best but feeble efforts of my windscreen wipers as i approached blanefield and headed into bearsden i had to slow the car to an almost crawl unable to see more than a few feet in front of me i had time on my hands before i met the frenchman so i drove down to argyle street the torrential rain hadnt stopped but i was lucky enough to get parked a thirtysecond dash away from the corner tearooms i went in shook the rain off my hat and moaned to the waiter i handed it to about the sudden change in the weather there were only a couple of other tables occupied and i sat in gloomy silence when id finished my lamb chop and mashed potatoes i drank a coffee and smoked gloomily contemplating the rain through the window a fools errand no matter how long i thought it over the bobby kirkcaldy job remained a fools errand willie sneddon was thrashing about in the dark trying to protect his investment other than sit outside kirkcaldys house all night there was very little i could do and if it came to a twentyfourhour surveillance job then it would cost sneddon dear hed be better getting twinkletoes mcbride to park himself outside or singer this was a muscle job i was going to have to tell sneddon so after id settled my bill at the cashiers desk and collected my hat i went back out into the rain it had eased considerably and with its easing it had taken some of the stale heat out of the air but glasgow was glasgow again dressed in rain and shades of grey it took me only a couple of minutes to get to the merchants carvery in the citys business district it meant that i was early and i decided to wait in the car until just before eight the merchants carvery was glasgows attempt at class it sat looking out over a square of park in the middle of a grid of georgian and victorian terraces as the carverys name suggested the citys wealthy traders and industrialists had once occupied the surrounding houses now most had been converted into offices sitting parked outside i made a little wager with myself that i would be able to pick out barnier when he arrived as it turned out the only people i saw going into the restaurant was a middleaged couple both dressed in tweed the merchants carvery was one of those places designed or more correctly decorated and furnished to intimidate a place you were meant to feel out of place to me it was overdone way overdone the plush red leather of the booths was just that little bit too plush and much too red if the carvery had been in edinburgh it wouldnt have been quite so overdone i went in and handed my hat over again this time to an attendant in a white waistlength jacket and pillbox cap he was without doubt the most geriatric bellboy id ever seen and i worried that he would buckle under the weight of my fedora i told him i was there to meet with mr barnier and he nodded towards a tall man standing at the bar with his back to me it was going to take us an age to cross the lounge so i thanked my elderly hop and gave him a twoshilling tip i reckoned that the weight of halfacrown would tip him in more ways than intended monsieur barnier i asked the mans back and he turned to face me alain barnier was not what i had expected for a start he was tall and lighthaired not quite blond with greenish eyes to me he looked more like a scandinavian or german than a southern frenchman his skin tone wasnt dark either although i knew he had lived in glasgow for at least a couple of years but there again no one could be as pale as a glaswegian scots were the whitest people on the planet and glaswegians came in pale blue tints except for those who had been burned scarlet by unaccustomed exposure to the big fiery ball in the sky that had until a couple of hours ago made a mysterious appearance that summer barnier was a striking man handsome with deep creases under his eyes that suggested a lot of smiling but there was something a little cruel in his features i estimated his age to be about forty other than his slightly golden skin tone there were a couple of other things that gave barnier away as a foreigner his clothes were expensive but not showy and not tweed his suit was extremely welltailored in a pale grey lightweight flannel run through with a faint white pinstripe it didnt look like a british cut added to that he was immaculately groomed and wore a neatly trimmed moustache and goatee beard that gave a point to his chin my first thought was of a cardincoutured fourth musketeer my name is lennox m barnier i said in french we spoke on the telephone this afternoon i was waiting for you drink he beckoned to the barman with a casual authority that scots find difficult two cognacs he said in english please he said reverting to his native tongue and indicating one of the plush leather booths at the back of the lounge bar we sat down you speak french very well m lennox but if you dont mind me saying so you have a strong accent and you speak slowly like a breton i take it youre canadian yes new brunswick the only officially bilingual province in canada i said and was surprised at the pride in my voice but youre not a francophone yourself that obvious barnier shrugged and made a face he was french i expected it no not particularly but you have a strong accent i assumed english was your first language where are you from yourself m barnier the drinks arrived toulon well marseille originally then toulon i sipped the cognac and felt something warm and golden infuse itself into my chest good no he asked a smile deepened the creases around the eyes i supply it it is one of the best it tastes it i had some of the bourbon you supplied jonny cohen that was excellent too ah yes you mentioned you knew m cohen barnier looked at me over the rim of his brandy glass by the way you rather annoyed my miss minto really i said raising my eyebrows and trying to look as innocent as i had been at sixteen when my father had interrogated me about some missing cigarettes and whisky we seemed to be getting on so well i learned a new word key lan or is it two words there was something in the mention that stung barnier he quickly hid it i cant have you upsetting her miss minto is a very determined lady who is essential to the efficient running of the office why did she ask me if it was about the key lan am i pronouncing it right she was referring to an item weve recently imported miss minto probably thought you wanted to see me about it thats all im flattered that miss minto thought i was rich enough to buy it she didnt the items gone astray in transit its more than likely been incorrectly crated and labelled thats all miss minto probably thought you were from the insurance company barniers smile had dropped and his tone now suggested that the small talk was over what exactly is it you want from me m lennox ive been engaged to look into the disappearance of sammy pollock you may know him as sammy gainsborough i hardly know him as either m pollock was an acquaintance nothing more my dealings with him were so infrequent that im struggling to remember the last time i saw him why is it that you are asking me about pollock can you remember i mean barnier made a show of running through a mental inventory he pulled gently at his goatee smoothing it into an inverted peak it would have been about two or three weeks ago a friday he was at the pacific club at the same time i was it is a dreadful place please dont tell m cohen i said so he is a valued customer after all but it really is an awful place i go there because ironically m cohen does tend to get rather good jazz acts on fridays anyway i saw young m pollock there he did a turn sang a few songs to fill in for a noshow act he was there with a girl if i remember correctly but we didnt speak that night and you havent seen him since listen mr lennox barnier reverted to his flawlessly articulated grammatically perfect english i really have no idea whether i have seen him since or not sammy pollock is not someone who features in my consciousness much it may be that i have seen him and not noticed now i repeat my question why are you asking me about this young man you must excuse me m barnier but its my day for straw clutching i was told that sammy pollock was seen in your company on occasion the truth is that he really does seem to have gone missing and im more than a little concerned for his welfare so far ive not been able to come up with the slightest hint of where he is i looked at the frenchmans face there was nothing to read in his expression maybe it was just that my imallatsea act didnt wash or maybe he just wasnt interested did you have any business dealings with pollock i asked no none the occasions where you saw him did you know the people he was with again no listen i dont mean to be rude but i really dont think i can help you any further he drained his glass it was a gesture of punctuation our conversation had come to a full stop thanks for your time m barnier i said in french i left barnier in the carvery picked my hat up from the geriatric bellboy and headed out into the street the rain had stopped but the sky still looked badtempered it wasnt alone it had been a fruitless day and i was too tired to go up to sneddons bearsden house or even to ring him telling willie sneddon that you really cant do his bidding is something done facetoface and in the right frame of mind i didnt get into the car straight away but went to the telephone kiosk on the corner fed it some copper and called the number sheila gainsborough had given me in london the english accent at the other end told me that he was her agent and she wasnt there i know i said she gave me this as a contact number i see are you lennox his voice was a tad too high and slightly effeminate i gave a small laugh at the thought that i obviously expected theatrical agency to be one of those robustly masculine professions like steelworking or mining thats me i said tell me lennox do you have anything to report oh boy he was losing my affection big time with that tone thats why im phoning i said well he asked he spoke to me as if i was the hired help to be fair i was but there again so was he miss gainsborough told me she could be contacted through this number i take it youre whithorn will you be seeing her this evening i see miss gainsborough almost every evening he said proprietorially shell be here in about half an hour tell her lennox called and that i will phone again this evening about ten oclock if she could make sure shes available to take the call why dont you just tell me what you have to report and ill pass it on i gave another small laugh louder this time for him to hear client confidentiality friend i would have thought that would have been a concept youd be familiar with im not just miss gainsboroughs agent mr lennox im her advisor her friend ill phone back at ten i hung up i decided to make a point of putting a face to the voice that had been at the other end of the line i had already decided i would dislike humphrey whithorns face as soon as i saw it i walked back to where i had parked i didnt pay much attention to the wolseley parked three cars back from my atlantic until an unnecessarily large man in a formless raincoat and a toosmall trilby planted himself on the pavement squarely in my path another appeared at my side smaller but still robust and with the kind of face you would avoid looking at in a bar or anywhere else i felt the second guys firm grip on my upper arm just above the elbow i could tell right away that these were no policemen they were somebodys goons okay lennox said the raincoat mr costello wants to see you now i felt relief of sorts having to deal with any muscle is tiresome but normally compliance comes from knowing whos behind the muscle costello didnt carry that kind of weight and i made a bored irritated face does he now i said for some reason the image of barniers homely insistent little secretary came to my mind and i decided to follow her example im a busy kind of guy tell costello to make an appointment the fingers around my arm tightened and i turned to the second guy and smiled they were hard men men who were in the business of hurting but jimmy costello was not famed as a criminal mastermind and his lack of genius extended to the quality of goon he recruited they had probably been following me all day and i wouldnt have spotted them in the rain there had been a dozen suitable places for them to have made their move on me this was not one of them a stupid choice of place to pick me up off the street we were in the middle of the business district admittedly at eight fortyfive in the evening but outside a wellrespected eatery and there was a district police station two blocks away no this was as dumb a choice as they could have made and the ideal place for me to kick off but they were too stupid to realize it and the goon with the vice grip on my arm looked as sure of himself as his partner did now he said with a viciouslooking grin are you going to come quiet or come the cunt there was something i found out about myself during the war it was something i could have done with not finding out for the rest of my life something ugly and dark i lay awake at nights wondering if the war had created it or if it had been there all the time and it might never have been awoken if the war hadnt come along as i stood there with two violent thugs trying to coerce me into a car i felt it begin to stir deep inside and greet me as an old friend listen guys i said in a friendly voice but quiet quiet so they had to strain to hear it im not coming with you and if you try to make me someones going to get hurt tell costello if he wants to see me he can pick up the phone like everybody else if hes peeved because i smacked his kid about then tell him sorry but i dont give a crap whadyou say the big guy in the raincoat frowned and leaned forward which is what i wanted him to do i only had one arm free so i swung a kick at the spot on his raincoat where i reckoned he kept the family jewels my reckoning was dead on and he folded the guy with my arm yanked me backwards again what i expected him to do i went with it keeping your distance from your attacker isnt always the best strategy in a street fight and i rammed into him bending him backwards onto the bonnet of the wolseley i fell on top of him facetoface he got a punch in and jarred my head with it making black and white sparks dance for a split second across my vision with my free hand i had grabbed my hat as it came off from the punch i pushed it into and over his face covering his eyes and pulling it away just as my brow slammed into his nose i was just mentally complimenting myself on my excellent management of the situation when a mule kicked me to the right of my spine just above the kidney i heard two lungfuls of air pulse out of me and i was in that panicked winded place where filling your body with oxygen fills the universe the big guy in the raincoat who had kicked me grabbed my arms and pulled me back from his bonnetsprawled partner i was still struggling to catch a breath but knew if i didnt pull myself together i was in for a kicking suddenly the big guy let go of me and i leaned forward my hands resting on my knees and pulled long deep breaths into my emptied lungs i turned to see something that didnt make any sense then turned my attention back to my bloodyfaced chum who was pulling himself up from the bonnet of the wolseley i now knew i only need concern myself with him the thing that hadnt made sense when i had turned around was seeing alain barnier behind me very efficiently beating the crap out of the raincoated thug but i still had my hands full and kept focussed on my chum who was now pulling himself upright from the bonnet of the wolseley i took a step forward ready to hit him when he came up he wasnt as stupid as i had taken him for because he read my movement and bracing his elbows on the bonnet he swung his foot out and up it was a vicious kick but it missed its target and i was able to grab his ankle i gave his leg a hard yank and his body slid off the cars bonnet like a ship being launched from a slipway he came down onto the pavement hard and there was the sickening sound of his skull against the kerb he lay still and for a moment i was genuinely worried that i had killed him he put my mind at rest by giving a low moan i heard the commotion continue behind me barnier and the other guy also shouts coming from the direction of the carvery i turned to see what was happening the big man in the raincoat looked the tougher of the two goons and was certainly the bigger i reckoned he would be more than a handful for barnier but when i turned around i saw that the undersized trilby had been knocked off his head there was blood coming from a cut on his temple as well as from the mess of his mouth it was barnier who fascinated me he stood back from his opponent almost calm i could see his eyes move constantly checking the big guys hands feet face as if reading every intention anticipating every move the big guy staggered forward and swung a clumsy desperate hook at barnier who stepped back gracefully as if allowing an elderly lady to pass him on the boulevard it was then i saw how the frenchman had been doing so much damage to his opponent he seemed to lean his entire body back and his leg swung round and up the side of his foot like a scythe through the air it slammed into the side of the big mans head costellos goon toppled like a felled tree i took a few backward steps until i stood shouldertoshoulder with barnier both of us ready should our playmates get up from the pavement there was a huddle of people behind us on the steps of the carvery and in the distance i heard the urgent trilling of a police cars bells i phoned them barnier said to me in french and without turning to me he was a cool one all right so we better get our story straight the goon whose head i had cracked on the pavement hauled himself upright leaning on the wing of his car he looked across at barnier and me his eyes were still a little glazed but he was focussed enough to see that we were ready to deal with any more fun and games and clearly decided that the playtime bell had rung he picked up his pals trilby and poked him with his foot muttering something about the police the two goons clambered clumsily into the wolseley and drove off who were your chums asked barnier again in french dissatisfied customers i said you best come back inside and get cleaned up i nodded and started to follow him into the carvery ignoring the arrival of a black police wolseley when we got to the front door barnier delivered me into the care of the geriatric bellboy who escorted me down some red carpeted stairs to the gents toilets there was an attendant there who looked shocked so i guessed that my face must have been a mess however when i looked in the mirror above the washhand basins it didnt look too bad and i asked for a wet towel to hold against my cheek to keep it from swelling up and bruising too much while i waited for the towel i washed my hands and face cupping some cold water and running it over the back of my neck i had to ease myself up slowly from the basin pressing a hand gingerly into the small of my back where the raincoat had kicked me i was getting too old for this i dried myself off straightened my collar and tie and got my elderly bellhop in the monkey jacket to dust down my jacket before helping me on with it perfectly dreadful sir he said with genuine dismay perfectly dreadful that one cant mind ones own business without being accosted and robbed in the street i nodded and smiled wearily that was obviously the story barnier had given them when he told them to call the cops i pressed the damp towel to my cheek the old hop disappeared back up the stairs and came down a minute later with ice wrapped in a napkin i was impressed he could move so fast i leaned against the porcelain tiled wall and held the ice to the side of my face after a few minutes i tipped both the hop and the toilet attendant and headed back up the redcarpeted stairs to the lounge when i got there barnier was at the front door talking to the two police constables it was the tenor of the place that the uniforms had to stay at the front door not even being allowed to conduct their interview in a staff room or office whatever it was that barnier had said to them they were clearly satisfied with it and they headed off back to the car without taking a statement from me the one thing i noticed about barnier was that there wasnt a mark on him and the impeccable grey flannel was still impeccable he came over to me slapped me on the shoulder and grinned i think you could do with another cognac no i could do with another cognac yes i said we went back and sat at the same booth what did you say to get rid of the cops i asked i told them that you were my cousin from quebec and that you couldnt speak a word of english i told them that the two guys outside had tried to rob you and that i and the manager in here had seen the whole thing i gave them a phoney description of the car and sent them on their way they didnt want to speak to me i told them you spoke only french and that you were going home in a couple of days and that you did not want the complication of pressing charges or having to delay travelling and they were satisfied with that this is the police we are discussing my friend dealing with a foreign national who is about to head off home is complicated and if there is one thing i have learned about policemen the world over it is that they do not like complications now why not tell me what that was really all about has it some connection to young mr pollocks disappearance yes or at least in a way sammy pollock was hanging around with paul costello hes the son of jimmy costello have you heard of jimmy costello barnier gave another gallic shrug and shook his head costello is a crook and a thug smalltime stuff but he has a small gang our two dancing partners would be paidup members costello also has a waster of a son it takes something to be such a washout that youre a disappointment to the underworld but thats what young paul is anyway he was hanging around with sammy pollock before he went missing he also had a key for sammys apartment i took it from him and we had a frank exchange of views so frank that i think i may have cracked the odd bone and papa costello is not pleased it would appear not but to be honest i dont think he gives a shit that outside was him going through the motions he maybe doesnt really care about me giving his son a slap but he has to be seen to take exception big people for appearances our criminal fraternity chums well i think you may receive a return visit from your friends or their colleagues he arched an eyebrow maybe i should hang around you that was pretty fancy footwork savate french foot fighting it is sometimes called the jeu marseillais because it became very popular in marseille in the last century sailors you see the idea is that if you are fighting on a ship at sea then it is better to have a hand free to hang onto something if the ship is pitching yeah i said id heard of savate but what id seen outside had been something more but i thought that savate was a type of street fighting dockers and sailors if you dont mind me saying you dont strike me as someone who spent his youth brawling in the backstreets of marseille do i not barnier replied perhaps not but if theres one thing i have learned in life its that people are very seldom who we think they are anyway savate has become a little gentrified over the years a sport alexandre dumas fils studied it i watched the frenchmans cruel handsome face the smile he framed with the trimmed moustache and goatee beard had something knowing about it and something melancholic he struck me as a weary sad satan well whatever its origins i said i was glad of it thanks for your help out there and with the police barnier gave a small shrug there seemed to be nothing more to say to each other and my feet took me back out onto the street and to my car this time there were no heavies waiting for me for the moment i would have to deal with the costello situation sooner or later as i opened the door of the atlantic i looked back towards the merchants carvery barnier was at the window of the lounge bar watching just as he must have done when he saw costellos men jump me barnier bothered me i had no reason to doubt what he had told me about his relationship or lack of it with sammy pollock what was bothering me probably had nothing to do with that at all it was just that there was something about the frenchman some shadow he dragged around with him and for a wine merchant he certainly knew how to handle himself i called in at lornas on the way back to my flat i had hoped that the cold compress had stopped the side of my face swelling up and bruising too much but it was still tender to the touch and lorna noticed it as soon as i arrived what happened she asked as she let me in but her concern was griefdulled and she was content with a dismissive shrug and a mumbled its nothing we sat in the living room alone maggie macfarlane was out making arrangements she had told lorna i wondered how many of those arrangements would involve the matinee idol i saw pull up the day before lorna looked tired and her eyes were redrimmed from crying i spoke softly and soothingly and did all of the right things that a sensitive suitor should do after a while and when the moment seemed to open up and allow it i asked her about the visitor in the lanchesterdaimler she looked at me blankly for a moment tall dark hair moustache i prompted a look of dull enlightenment crossed her expression oh yes jack jack collins he was dads partner and hes a family friend partner i didnt think that your father had a partner oh no not in the bookie business jack collins is involved with boxing he arranges matches i think hes like an agent or promoter for some of the fights he and my father were putting together some fights they had set up a company together jack and my dad were close jack really is like a member of the family they werent involved in arranging this kirkcaldyschmidtke fight were they no nothing as big as that why are you asking just curious i said why was he round here yesterday hes been helping sort out some of the business stuff i see helping your stepmother lorna looked at me puzzled then it dawned on her oh no nothing like that trust me i wouldnt put it past maggie i wouldnt put anything past maggie but i dont think jack is in the slightest bit interested apparently he has a string of glamorous girlfriends she made an attempt at a mischievous smile but her sadness washed it away as if it had been drawn in sand like i said jack and dad were very close theres no way jack would what did he want last night i mean just to see if he could help and he was looking for some papers that dad had did he find them no i dont think so i had a drink with lorna and she clung to me again when i was leaving i fought down the sense of irritation that seemed to well up inside me again lorna was breaking our contract of being mutually undemanding i was i thought to myself a real piece of work when i got back to my apartment i used the phone in the hall to call sheila gainsborough at the number she had given me for her agent the same light effeminate voice answered i asked to speak to miss gainsborough there was a sigh and a silence then she came on the line i went through the progress i had made which didnt take long have you heard from sammy at all no she said nothing the transatlantic voice sounded tired and strained i was hoping im still looking miss gainsborough i spoke to the frenchman barnier he doesnt seem to know sammy that well after all doesnt he she sounded surprised but only vaguely sammy mentioned him a couple of times i thought they knew each other oh he does know sammy just not that well we talked for another few minutes there was little more she could tell me and there was less i could tell her i promised to keep her fully informed of progress after i hung up i felt something dead and leaden in my chest every time i thought about sammy pollock the picture darkened a little chapter six when the war ended britain had committed itself to a more equitable society maybe that was why when beveridge and company were planning the welfare state and a fair deal for all willie sneddon jonny cohen and hammer murphy were coming up with the three king deal the whole idea had been to divide up glasgow equally between them fair shares the cake may have been cut up equally but somehow willie sneddon had managed to grab most of the icing of the three kings sneddon was by far the richest no one really knew but many suspected how he had managed to amass just quite so much wealth it was a quandary that had no doubt cost hammer murphy more than his fair share of sleepless nights trying to work out truth was that if you knew willie sneddon it wasnt that much of a mystery there was something dark cunning and devious about his nature even more than you would expect from your average crime lord sneddon was a wheeler and dealer more than just a criminal he was a criminal entrepreneur always seeking out that extra angle always trying to find some new way of squeezing a penny out of a situation i knew although i never discussed it with him that the bulk of jonny cohens money did not come from his clubs and other rackets the main source of jonnys income came from largescale criminal acts robberies mainly breakins long firm frauds the odd bit of extortion with jonny cohen and hammer murphy for that matter the bulk of their earnings came from big hits which yielded large sums of cash the big score willie sneddon was in the same line of business but everyone knew that he had so many other deals and rackets running at the same time that he had a steady constant cash harvest added to all of this there was the other dimension of his activities willie sneddon the businessman sneddon had displayed genuine acumen for legitimate business even if it had been founded on stolen extorted or counterfeited cash like most big league crooks he had started a number of seemingly legitimate concerns fronts through which to launder dirty money where sneddon had distinguished himself from the usual robber barons was in the way he had been able to turn these fronts into genuinely successful and legitimate businesses but it never took much scratching to expose the brass crook under the gilt veneer the fact was that wherever there was a shilling to be made crooked or legit sneddon had the nose to sniff it out all of this meant that sneddon unlike the recently deceased small change macfarlane had been able to make it across the social rubicon of the clyde and then some the sneddon residence a large mockbaronial mansion on a plot of land so big it could have had its own lord lieutenant and council was in the leafiest and most upmarket end of leafy and upmarket bearsden i knew that he counted a high court judge a couple of shipyard owners and several other captains of industry amongst his neighbours i wondered how the judge felt about sharing a laburnum and privet border with glasgows most successful criminal but there again willie sneddon had attained the level of wealth and influence within the city where some of the people he had dealings with no doubt thought it bad taste to bring up some of the more dubious origins of that wealth and of course the odd brown envelope stuffed with cash would have helped glasgow was a city where anything could be bought even respectability i couldnt put off seeing sneddon any longer he would be looking for news and the only news i had for him was that putting me on the bobby kirkcaldy case was a waste of time and that maggie macfarlane had confirmed that small change never kept a secret appointments diary it wasnt raining there was a more than halfhearted sun behind a milky veil of cloud and the air wasnt heavy and oppressively humid as it had been i got up shaved and dressed in a pale blue silk shirt with dark burgundy tie and a twobutton twopiece deep blue with a touch of mohair spun through it it had no weight and hung well and had cost me an arm and a leg deep blue socks and burgundy oxfords i brushed the shoulders of the suit jacket donned it and straightened my tie in the mirror i put on my new hat a skinnybrimmed borsalino and checked myself in the mirror damn this suit hung well it seemed such a shame to bag it down with the weight but i was expecting that i would sooner or later run into costello or a member or two of his robust entourage i habitually carry a sap with me six inches long springsteel with a lead ball on the end all encased in stitched leather but i was a slave to fashion and i didnt want it bagging my suit fortunately i had a slimline equivalent a nineinch blackjack basically the same principle but flattened out only the width of a wallet and almost like a small version of a barbers leather razor strop it was an elegantlooking thing slim and black like something chanel would have designed for al capone i slipped the blackjack into my inside jacket pocket on the left where i could pull it out with my right hand the leaden weight of it tugged that side of my jacket but i decided to live with it a flat blackjack is often missed when someone frisks you it feels like a wallet and i didnt feel like going out onto the street without some insurance i phoned sneddon to arrange a meet he told me he was tied up all day and couldnt i give him the information over the phone i said id rather talk to him facetoface and anyway it wasnt the kind of thing to discuss over the phone or some shit like that he bought it and told me to call round in the evening about eightthirty i had phoned him first to make the point that calling and arranging a mutually convenient time was preferable to being lifted from the street by twinkletoes mcbride added to which unlike the farmhouse out by dumbarton the place in bearsden was sneddons home as well as business headquarters maybe i could even persuade jimmy costello to follow the same diary etiquette though i doubted it before i went out i stopped at the hall phone and called lorna at home she was bearing up well it seemed but her voice still sounded tired and griefdulled i somehow got by with a promise to phone her later without calling in at the house i did ask her if the police had been around to ask anything else and if jack collins had been around again no to both questions then we had one of those long silences where we each waited for the other to say something something meaningful or comforting something to take us out of our depth shallow ill hear from you later then she said eventually her tone still colourless and hung up i drove out to the east end to dennistoun like many of the fine districts of glasgow it was a great thing to be able to claim that you came from dennistoun it was ever going back there that was to be avoided dennistoun was a warren of old tenements dressed in grime that had belched from chimneys when victoria had been a lass as i drove into it there were gaps and clear spaces where some of the more derelict slums had been cleared shiny new blocks of flats were already in residence on a couple of the cleared sites i drove to the far side of dennistoun to an incongruous green patchwork square of allotments behind those an equally incongruous building made out of corrugated metal sheets bolted together and which looked like it belonged in a shipyard i parked and went in through a door under a sign that told the world this was mcaskills gymnasium inside there were two practice rings the ropes sagging and the canvas grey and several punch bags hung unpunched from the ceiling it was quiet in the gym the only person was an old man in a turtleneck sweater and flat cap sitting over in the far corner on a battered old armchair reading a newspaper he looked up when i came in carefully folded the newspaper and came over to me hi lennox old mcaskill smiled at me it was a weary smile on a weary face that had also had more than its fair share of encounters with a gloved fist he jerked his capped head in the direction of the office at the back hes in there i went through to the office a lean man with a toolong face was sitting behind the desk smoking he looked about forty but i knew he was ten years younger than that he had put his hat on the desktop and i could see it was the kind of widebrimmed fedora that had been out of fashion for halfadecade i dropped my skinnybrimmed borsalino on the desk next to it to make a point mr lennox the man smiled and stood up he was tall no surprise the city of glasgow police had a minimum height requirement of six feet hence the fact that at least twothirds of their number came from outside glasgow he shook hands with me now it has to be said that city of glasgow cops were not in the habit of calling me mister or shaking hands with me unless it was to snap a pair of cuffs on me but detective constable donald taylor was different we had an arrangement thanks for coming donald you on duty backshift start at two did you find out anything about what i asked you he shook his head not much im afraid mr lennox bobby kirkcaldy isnt glaswegian he was born in motherwell to sniff around any more id have to contact the lanarkshire county police that would start questions but you would at least be able to check out whether he has a record or not oh aye i did that nothing and from what i can gather there are no rumours about him he seems to be straight what about the other thing small change macfarlane sorry no joy there either im not on the case and again if i start asking too many questions the gaffersll get suspicious i did talk to the evidence sergeant though conversational like he said they took tons of stuff away from macfarlanes place with his missuss sayso like nothing else couple of things inspector ferguson was asking about you he knows you know me no not really well not that we well do business inspector ferguson doesnt go in for that kind of thing it was just that he knew that id interviewed you about that business last year when you was away abroad i nodded jock ferguson had been my main contact in the police not paid for a straight copper or so i had thought i hadnt spoken to him in six months what was the other thing i asked its just one of the reasons i couldnt ask too many questions about the macfarlane thing theres been all kinds of top brass sticking their noses into it its like theres something more to it than just a simple robbery and i said impatiently i knew taylor was building up to something or building something or nothing up he knew that i only paid for results there was a yank in st andrews square he was in with superintendent mcnab and the dcc an american think so i passed them in the corridor he talked like you im not american im canadian yeah his accent was stronger he was a big man big as mcnab loud suits so whats this got to do with me well you know what tarts are like the typing pool and the women police constables were swooning all over the place because of his accent he was the talk of the steamie im friendly with one of the girls who works up in the dccs office she says they asked for all the files on macfarlanes murder so this guys an american cop dont know someone said he was a private detective like you okay i thought for a moment anything else going on just this other murder what other murder i asked the guy they found by the train tracks i thought that was an accident i lit another cigarette pushing the pack across the desk for him to help himself what are you einsteins up to you going to arrest the train driver superintendent mcnab is as mad as hell about it everyone was happy that it was the train that killed him i mean they had to use spades to get all of him gathered up but the pathologist who did the postmortem said the guy was dead before the train ran over him the other thing is he had two busted fingers and knuckles skinned to fuck the quack says it looked to him like the guyd been in a fight and was beaten to death then dumped the train mashed him up to buggery and the thinking is that whoever killed him dumped him on the tracks makes sense i said there was a good chance that no one would question that the injuries were caused by anything other than the train who was he no idea no ones reported anyone missing that fits and he didnt have any identification on him this pathologist is some new hotshot with fancy tricks he put in his report that from the stiffs build the calluses on his palms and his colouring he reckons he was a manual labourer of some sort it fits with the clothes taylor laughed a thin mean laugh i think the pathologists going to be our next murder victim supe rintendent mcnab is really pissed off that hes been lumbered with another killing doesnt like paperwork does the superintendent i nodded i could see mcnab prioritizing deaths nobodies somebodies and right at the top coppers if you killed a policeman then mcnab would be harder to stop in his tracks than the train that had mashed the labourers corpse taylor talked for another ten minutes without saying anything again trying to justify his fee when he was finished i thanked him and gave him the number of the wall phone in the hall at my digs give me a ring if you hear anything else itll be worth your while i opened my wallet and handed him three tenners coppers didnt come cheap after taylor had gone i went back out into the gym a couple of youths had arrived and had changed into boxing shorts and white singlets they looked skinny and too pale both were working the punch bags and old mcaskill was leaning against the wall watching them disinterestedly i walked over to the old man and slipped him a fiver thanks for the loan of the office mac do you know much about bobby kirkcaldy not much hes a great wee mover hes going to malky that kraut next week you reckon no doubt about it but youve never come across him i mean through the boxing naw he wouldnt pish on a place like this if it was on fire anyways hes a country boy no glasgow i smiled at the thought that mcaskill pictured motherwell as some bucolic paradise i suppose in comparison to dennistoun it was hes got a minder says hes his uncle about your age calls him uncle bert old mcaskill seemed to be concentrating it took a lot of effort he was clearly trying to retrieve something from a brain that had been rattled about in his skull by years of punches it must have been like trying to pick a specific ball out of a spinning bingo cage what does he look like like hes used his face to break toffee fuck hed clearly found the ball hed been searching for albert soutar is he kirkcaldys uncle i shrugged is his nose all busted to fuck i dont think to fuck covers it adequately he could sniff his ears with it that sounds like soutar all right and he had family out in lanarkshire thats one bad wee fucker or was in what way in the late twenties early thirties he went professional but he was shite a slugger who stopped too many punches with his head did a lot of bareknuckle too then he went inside prison aye he was in with the bridgeton billy boys razor gang he was supposed to have cut up a copper he kept his razor in the peak of his bunnet mcaskill touched his own flat cap he was a bad bad bastard he abused the privilege of being a cunt as my old da would say i smiled picturing the cozy fireside scene of young son on fathers knee being inducted into the world of abusive epithets so you think that uncle albert is the same guy could be mcaskill shook his head slowly if it is then hes so crooked he pisses corkscrews id be surprised if young kirkcaldy would have anything to do with him i drove out of dennistoun and had lunch if you could call it that at the horsehead bar i ordered a pie and a pint and while i was proving valid the scientific principle that oil and water dont mix i spotted joe gallagher a journalist friend at the other side of the bar i use the word friend loosely not just in terms of this guy but generally for the acquaintances i had made in glasgow since i first arrived in the city drinking buddy would have been a better description in joes case the price of information from journos is much cheaper than cops on the take usually a pint and a whisky chaser opens the channels of communication so i made my way round to joes side of the bar and asked him what he was having i left half an hour later my newspaper chum had told me that he had interviewed kirkcaldy on a couple of occasions smart kid in joes opinion he had mentioned the battered old minder who seemed always to be at kirkcaldys shoulder yeah calls him his uncle i believe i had said some uncle joe had muttered thats bert soutar bad sort it was eightthirty on the dot i pulled into the long uphill drive that led through gardens dense with thick glossyleaved shrubs and trees and up to sneddons mansion it was a pleasant evening the deepening blue of the sky didnt seem to suit as a backdrop for the victorian architecture of sneddons place gothic and the normal scottish climate and the scottish character were meant for each other even sneddons black bentley rtype seemed to lurk on the drive i parked behind it and went up to the house halfexpecting vincent price to answer the door and ask me in to see his waxworks vincent price would have been good my ring of the bell was answered by singer opening the door and silently standing to one side to let me into the hall sneddon didnt do his usual trick of keeping me waiting and i was led into his study the bookshelved walls were heavy with learning and the room had a rich smell of walnut and leather i somehow didnt think that sneddon spent much time in here acquainting himself with literature you got something for me already sneddon sat down behind a treeandahalf of desk id seen smaller aircraft carriers he was wearing a welltailored blue pinstripe threepiece with a handmade white and blue striped silk shirt and a pale and plum red tie it could have been the outfit of a surrey stockbroker but all it did was emphasize the razor scar and the hard vicious face behind it i saw kirkcaldy yesterday i said and theres nothing for me to go on he cant tell me anything this is a watch and wait job youve got to catch whoevers doing this in the act so watch and wait i cant be there twentyfour hours a day and i would have thought that youd maybe want a couple of your guys to be there to mete out some extemporary retribution when they do show up again i hired you because i want you to find out whats going on i mean whats really going on sneddons hard bluegrey eyes were fixed on mine as if trying to communicate a deeper meaning i see so jonny cohens not the only one who thinks theres something more to this sneddon looked over my shoulder and past me jerking his head in a gesture of dismissal i turned and saw that singer had been standing silently of course by the door i had thought hed left us alone after hed shown us in so if hed been lurking for my benefit then it had been a wasted effort ive got a lot of fucking money riding on kirkcaldy sneddon said after singer had left closing the heavy door behind him more than you can imagine what did he tell you referring to my notebook i ran through the facts as kirkcaldy had related them to me when i had finished and closed the notebook sneddon kept his hard eyes on me he raised a questioning eyebrow okay i said you want to know what i think rather than what i found out all right bobby kirkcaldy went out of his way several times to tell me that i was wasting my time that it was no big deal he positively leapt on the notion that this was all just some bollocks to put him off his game before the big fight and he reassured me that it would do no such thing so it was like he wanted to brush the whole thing off brush me off how did you find out about this anyway did kirkcaldy tell you no he didnt his manager told me and kirkcaldy had complained to him about it no as a matter of fact sneddons face remained impassive his manager turned up at the house and saw the car covered in red paint he asked bobby what was going on and got the same tale you did yeah i offered sneddon a cigarette he shook his head impatiently i took my time lighting mine kirkcaldy is very dismissive about the whole thing i asked him if it could be something personal a grudge an old enemy from the past that kind of thing and not related to the fight he made a big show of thinking about it before telling me he couldnt think of anybody now if it were me and someone was leaving dead birds nooses and crap like that on my doorstep i think i would already have done a lot of thinking about anyone who might have an old grudge to settle i dont think id need someone to come along and put the idea to me first so you think he knows what this is all about im not saying that but lets face it jonny cohen smells something fishy about the whole thing so do i now you seem to smell a rat what do you know about kirkcaldy i mean apart from his abilities in the ring not as much as id like you seen him fight couple of times yeah i know enough about the fight game to know that being a winner i mean a real winner is as much about what youve got up here as how hard you can hit sneddon tapped his temple with his forefinger and kirkcaldy has got it all he boxes clever but more than that hes ambitious well i thought you would have wanted that in a fighter youre backing aye i do but what worries me is how much ambition hes got outside the ring listen mr sneddon i leaned forward and rested my elbows on my knees theres no point in you being elliptical what the fuck does that mean you been at the readers digest with twinkletoes its clear to me that you have suspicions that youre not sharing the other thing is you could have dealt with all of this with your own men sitting it out until whoever is doing this shows up to pull another stunt but you got me involved to see if i smelt the same rat that you and jonny cohen clearly have so why dont you tell me what it is you really want me to find out sneddon moved his mouth into the ugly shape he took for a smile maybe i like being epileptic elliptical i corrected and wished i hadnt the coarse approximation of a smile dropped from sneddons face bobby kirkcaldy has a shadow with him all the time an old guy with a mashedup face kirkcaldy calls him uncle bert ive checked him out and it turns out hes an exrazor gangster called bert soutar bridgeton billy boys back in the thirties i remember the billy boys said sneddon i had no doubt that he did the billy boys had been a protestant sectarian gang organized along military lines sneddon had only one weakness in business one gap in his calculating objectivity he was a bigot to the bone but ive never heard tell of a bert soutar he did time sneddon made a face and shrugged cutting up a few fenians doesnt make him al capone you think its significant it suggests kirkcaldy perhaps isnt as upandup as he seems maybe uncle bert is connected to dodgy dealings it could explain the warnings okay said sneddon keep on it and see what you can turn up i asked you about something else small changes appointment book have you looked for that i asked small changes wife widow she said he didnt keep one she said he did keep everything in his head the police took some stuff away with them they warrant it no no warrant maggie macfarlane gave them the okay by the way shes already had a gentleman caller jack collins you know him oh aye i know collins small change had him as a partner in one of the bookie shops and smalltime fight arranging is there any reason that i should be looking at collins for anything sneddon laughed in a way that suggested he was out of practice you could say that why dont you look at collins for a family resemblance macfarlane used to do business with collins senior he was a greyhound breeder and racer a successful one truth was small change was supposed to have been doing more business with collinss mother if you know what i mean small change is jack collinss father aye and he knows it rab collins died of a heart attack twentyodd year ago since then small change paid for jack to go to a fancy school all that crap i see i made the kind of face you make when youve tried every combination but you still cant get the safe open there was a silence and sneddon studied me for a moment i hadnt realized until then that scrutiny can be aggressive something was going through his head something was always going through his head but this was tying up his attention and his expression okay he said eventually heres the thing i told you i met with small change earlier that day the day he was killed yes well you know the way small change wasnt totally legit but he was more legit than not kinda the way you are well like you small change would do the odd deal with me or cohen or murphy he never did nothing that would get him lifted by the police nothing that he could be tied in directly like he was as slippery as snail shit in the rain he liked to be the middle man the one who arranges everything and then hed get an arrangers fee or a percentage of what came out of it and he was fixing you up with something to do with the fight game thats what you told me sneddon made a face i know and to start with i thought it was we were supposed to be meeting to talk about bobby kirkcaldy i raised my eyebrows it was all coming together but what was coming together still wasnt clear i thought you said that small change had nothing to do with kirkcaldy he wasnt in that league aye aye right enough thats what i thought but he wanted to talk to me about some deal he wanted to broker he said bobby kirkcaldy was involved not as a fighter as an investor so you went to see small change what did he say the deal was thats the thing i went up to small changes place just as arranged got singer to drive me and wait outside in the car but when i got there small change was shiteing himself he was white as a fucking sheet he tried to cover it up but when he poured me a drink his hands were shaking like fuck then he comes out with all of this shite about being sorry to have cost me a wasted journey but the deal he wanted to set up had gone south did he tell you what the deal had been no or at least he spun me some shite about kirkcaldy setting up a boxing academy in the city but that the finance on his side had fallen through and you dont believe that sounds possible sneddon shook his head he spread his hands out on the walnut desk top fingers splayed and looked at them absently you know the business im in lennox the bookies the protection the whores the bank jobs the fencing you know what my business really is fear its fear what keeps the whole fucking thing together i have spent most of my life filling my pockets by making the other guy fill his pants he leaned back in his chair and stared hard at me so when i say that small change macfarlane had had the frighteners put on him i know what im talking about so did you challenge him i asked did you ask him what was really going on no there was no point i could tell that it would have done fuck all good someone had done a real job on macfarlane i could have brought singer in from the car and he would still have kept shtoom i nodded it was a good point if someone had been able to outmenace sneddon and outlurk singer then there was something serious going on sneddon had a cigarette box on his desk it looked solid silver and was so big it should have had fifteen pirates sitting on it he flipped it open took out a cigarette and nudged it across the walnut aircraft carrier in my direction i helped myself and used the matching silver desk lighter to light us both and he ended up dead the same night i said yep sneddon screwed his eyes up against the smoke thats why i want that appointment book not just to keep the cops from knowing you saw small change the day he died you want to know who he saw before you aye its maybes not even in the diary and you say his wife says he doesnt keep one anyhow thats what she said now i get why you wanted me to sniff around i paused for a moment i was like the clown in the circus standing dumbly till the plank the other clown is swinging around hits him on the back of the head it hit me oh yeah i said now i get it thats why youve got me involved with the bobby kirkcaldy crap its the same deal isnt it you want me to find out if kirkcaldy is tied up with whatever deal small change was brokering aye and my guess is that its fuck all to do with boxing academies or shite like that especially with what youve said about this dodgy fucking uncle he has in tow and the nooses and stuff maybes its connected with the deal i mean and nothing to do with the fight whats coming up i see i drew on the cigarette and contemplated the silvergrey writhes of smoke now this takes me into dodgy territory you too for that matter the police are all over small changes murder and i was left in no doubt by superintendent willie mcnab that his wife will be wearing my balls as earrings if i start sniffing around there was the sound of aged wood on wood as sneddon pulled open a desk drawer he reached in took something out and tossed it onto the desk in front of me it was a large white envelope it was tucked shut not sealed and it was stuffed thick rewardingly thick buy yourself some new balls sneddon nodded to the envelope i picked it up and slipped it into my inside jacket pocket without opening it it tugged satisfyingly at the material of my jacket balancing the weight of the blackjack in my other inside pocket i was going to have to start taking a satchel to work youre right the police are all over macfarlane like flies on a turd sneddon exposed his talent for colourful metaphor and i ask myself why the fuck that is he was an important bookie but the cops on the case are too many and too highup i nodded it fitted i had wondered about mcnabs involvement myself so you think the police are onto whatever deal it was that small change was setting up if thats the reason then its something really fucking big and if its really fucking big i really fucking want to know about it youve got contacts in the police havent you yeah i said reluctantly wondering how much sneddon knew about my arrangement with taylor then the tug of the heavy envelope in my jacket pocket reminded me not to be too reluctant so do you probably better than mine listen sneddon leaned forward and narrowed his eyes again he was all brow ive already fucking told you i dont want to be connected to this thats why im going through you you want the money or not taking a last long draw on the cigarette i stubbed it out in a boulder of crystal ashtray picked my hat off his desk and stood up ill get onto it i turned towards the door then checked myself you know everybody whos got a racket going in the city just about sneddon leaned back in his green leather and walnut captains chair a pirate captains chair probably have you ever heard of anyone called largo i asked he thought for a moment then shook his head okay thanks i just thought id ask industrial pollution can be a beautiful thing when i came out of sneddons i stood by my car for a moment looking out over to the west sneddons house was elevated in more than a social sense and i could see out across the treetops and past the edge of the city glasgows air was of the granulated variety and it turned sunsets into vast diffused splashes of colour like gold and red paint strained through textured silk i stood and gazed westward filled with a sense of contentment but that had more to do with the wad of cash weighing down my suit jacket than the sunset i climbed into the atlantic and headed back down into the city i should have been more on my toes this time there was a little more subtlety and a lot more brains employed i was driving back from sneddons and was passing along the curve in the road where bearsden notches down the social ladder to become milngavie when i saw a blue fortyeight ford zephyr six up ahead pulled into the kerb the driver had the hood up and he was standing next to it on the road he was about thirtyfive with dark hair and from what i could see smartly dressed i say from what i could see because he was doing what every true man does when his car breaks down he was standing on the roadway one hand on his hip the other scratching his head and like every true man he had had to take his jacket off and roll up his sleeves to do the headscratching it was a pose of helplessness mitigated by stubbornness youve tried everything and youre asking for help only as a last resort i muttered a curse when i saw he had noticed my approach and was vaguely wafting a hand about to wave me down its a rule you dont look too desperate for another mans help youre signalling in another member of the same auto club to provide the assistance that you would provide him in the same circumstances despite my efforts to the contrary i am a canadian that means no matter how hard i had tried to cure myself of it i suffer from the congenital chronic and truly canadian ailment of politeness i may have gotten lippy with gangsters and cops slapped the odd uppity hooligan and i may have fornicated cursed and sworn on occasion sometimes the same occasion but i had helped so many little old ladies across the street that the boy scouts had taken out a contract on me this guy clearly needed help i had to stop to help him i was being so canadian that it didnt occur to me for a second that this could have been a more discreet and subtle attempt by jimmy costello at abduction there again discreet and subtle were not traits you associated with costello having trouble i asked as i pulled up next to him and rolled down the window he smiled thanks for stopping he opened the door of the atlantic and dropped into the passenger seat before i could say anything it was then i noticed the small crescentshaped scar on his head i was doing a splitsecond inventory in my head trying to remember where id filed who had mentioned a fiveeight man with dark hair and a crescentshaped scar on his forehead when he produced a gun from his trouser pocket i recognized it as a webley pointthreetwo pocket hammerless the youngest it could have been was it could have dated back to the turnofthe century this is some kind of joke right i said with a derisive eyebrow raised at the revolver but at the same time i was assessing my chances of coshing him with the flat springhandled blackjack i had in my inside jacket pocket when people point guns at me i get tetchy i decided it was best to go along with my new chum for the moment there would be time to discuss my attitude towards being held at gunpoint later theres nothing wrong with this gun pal theres nothing wrong with my eightytwoyearold greatuncle frank but i wouldnt bring him along on an abduction trust me lennox this webley fires just fine im sure it did when mata hari used it to scare off the kaiser when he was chasing her around a banquet table where are you taking me an antiques fair the darkhaired goon sighed listen lennox lets not put it to the test mr costello wants to talk to you and the last time you got an invite you cut up rough he was better spoken than the average glaswegian he was also a cool enough customer my efforts to rile him and stall until another car came along werent working i could see over his shoulder that a second goon had come out of hiding and was dropping the hood on the zephyr six whats your pal got a flintlock blunderbuss i said cracking the joke with a smile to hide the fact that i was weighing up my chances of breaking his neck before he could pull the trigger hes going to follow us you can drive out to the pub to meet mr costello mr costello told me to tell you to take it easy theres no need to kick up a fuss you got all heated up and messed up tony and joe and it was all unnecessary this isnt what you think he gave an angled nod to indicate the road ahead lets go i looked at the gun it could still do the job right enough a bullet is a bullet even if firing it would probably take off a couple of his fingers so youre telling me this isnt all about paul costello youll have to talk to mr costello about that but no or not in the way you think okay i said and sighed where to the riviera club no my passenger grinned at me his teeth were nicotine yellow and pitted were to take you out to the empire just for a talk like nothing heavy so dont make trouble me i said in an offended tone im like rab butler im all for consensus my passenger directed me across the clyde and we drove into govan black tenements loomed on either side and he told me to park outside a public house emblazoned with a sign that declared this was the empire bar the sun was now hiding behind the tenements and dressed in a windingsheet of thin grey cloud but gloom was something you associated with govan oh look i said cheerily as we got out the sun is setting on the empire my companion replied by jerking his head towards the bar the gun was pocketed now but he rested his hand in the same pocket the ford zephyr six pulled up behind us and the second guy got out he was about an inch shorter than his colleague with hair the colour of dirty sand both of them were just the way sheila gainsborough had described them we walked into the bar it was noisy and it stank the air was thick with cigarette smoke stale sweat and whisky fumes a woman with unnaturally black hair was making shrilly unpleasant sounds in the corner accompanied by an outoftune piano the empire bar was the kind of place you would have described as spitandsawdust if they had bothered with the sawdust i allowed myself to be guided to a corner table guessing that prince rainier and grace kelly wouldnt be waiting for me there they werent a short fattish man in an expensive but illfitting suit was at the table looking at me glumly as i approached with my escort he had thick irishblack hair that needed a cut and a pencilmoustache over a slack ugly mouth i believe you wanted to speak with me i said without a smile and sat down without being asked unlike sneddon cohen or murphy jimmy costello didnt warrant a respectful tone but there again it was exactly that kind of attitude that had gotten me into some of my stickier moments over the last couple of years you want a drink costello asked his tone neutral whisky costello nodded to my darkhaired abductor who headed off through the fug and throng to the bar leaving us alone maybe this wasnt going to be the adventure i thought it would be the singer over by the piano seemed to enter a paroxysm of passion she was a thickbodied woman in her fifties about as curvaceous as a beer barrel with a round white face small eyes hair that was too dark and too long and lips that were too red she was clearly a singer of the traditional sort insofar as she was following the ageold glasgow tradition of adding an extra syllable to every lyric and then singing them through her nose a glasgow pub is the place to be if you have an aversion to consonants the singer informed me and anyone else within a fivemile radius that apparently the pipes the pipes were calling dhmnnaaanny bheehoy my escort arrived with two whiskies and a pint of stout then left us alone again you gave my boy paul a hiding said costello no anger he sipped his stout and looked at me with little interest he asked for it jimmy he went for a blade is this what this is all about no and thats not why i sent tony and joe to pick you up the other day either all of that shite it was unnecessary like i told your monkeys if you want to talk to me pick up a phone listen lennox dont fuck about with me im letting the thing with paul go im letting the thing with tony and joe go and believe me tony and joe dont want it let go so stop talking to me like im a piece of shite youve made it clear what you think of me but youre on my ground now i could hand you over to the boys and send you home with your nose out of joint i was about to answer when the singer in the corner reached new heights of volume and tunelessness dhmnnaaany behhooy dnhe behipes dnhe behipes harr cawhawhing you could try i said im working for willie sneddon and thats one nose you dont want to put out of joint so lets cut the crap what do you want why did you beat up paul i thought this wasnt about that it isnt not directly i just need to know why you and him had words was it about this gainsborough boy sammy pollock is his real name yes it was as a matter of fact hes missing yes sos paul there was a moments silence or there would have been if govans answer to maria callas hadnt continued to pipe up fuhhum glemn to glemn hend dehown dnhe mowmntehain sayhide dnhe suhmner his gehon hend hall dnhe flouwwurs fawhhawing what do you mean missing i asked what the fuck do you think i mean hes missing hes not around and no ones seen him for three days and you think ive got something to do with that no thats not why youre here i want you to find him im busy aye and one of the things you is busy with is finding the gainsborough boy its all connected paul was going around with him they had big ideas fuck knows what but they had big ideas costellos ugly mouth drooped even further beneath the moustache thats all paul has is big ideas no fucking guts or brains to make anything of them ideas i sipped the whisky in comparison the stuff they had served at sneddons pikey fight was nectar diss heyoo diss heyoo ewho mnuss geho hend heye mnuss stuhhay and you have no idea where hes disappeared to or why i asked costello shook a sullen ugly head the two monkeys who brought me here what are their names what costello looked confused the darkhaired one is called skelly his pal is called young why did you tell skelly to stick a gun in my ribs to get me here i take exception to people pointing guns at me costello looked at me dourly and shook his head hes a fucking bampot i told him to make sure you came here none of my crew should have shooters unless i say so ill sort him out its okay i said ill have a word with him i think its better coming from me if you know what i mean but thats not why i was asking about skelly and young i was told they were hanging about sammy pollock before he went missing if it wasnt them it was their twins going by the description i got theyre younger than the rest of my people they hang around with paul a lot maybe they think that hes the future some fucking hope but thats all there is to it paul hung around sammy and skelly and young hung around paul i made to take another sip of the whisky then put the glass back down again deciding id rather keep my stomach lined ill tell you what i said im still looking into this sammy pollock business if i find out anything about paul ill let you know ill pay you no need but youll owe me a favour the other thing is i need you to forget about what happened between me and paul and with your other three monkeys i already said theres more i looked across at the bar where skelly was talking to his sandyhaired chum im a man of principle you could say one of those principles is i dont let people point guns at me aw for fucks sake costello looked over to skelly at the bar then back at me couldnt you let it go i cant have you slapping all of my people around thats the deal costello paused for the clapping and raucous cheering that accompanied the conclusion of dhmnnaaany behhooy i felt like cheering myself when the applause died down costello nodded acquiescing in the only way he knew how sullenly now back to young paul i said the first thing i would have thought you would have done is to speak to this guy largo what who the fuck is largo you dont know anyone called largo should i i leaned back and sighed no reason you should everybody ive asked about largo has never heard of him when i came across paul at sammys flat he started off thinking i was a copper he took you for polis yeah i know i said with a sigh im making a formal complaint to my tailor anyway when he realized i wasnt he asked if largo had sent me when i asked him who largo was he gave me the brushoff but he did say it was somebody he owed some money to costello looked at me his was the expressionless kind of face that was difficult to read i dont like the sound of that he said at last why would paul be borrowing money from someone and if he did how come ive never heard of this fucker largo i caught paul on the hop it could be that this thing about owing largo money was just the best explanation he could think of on the spur anyway like i said im looking into who this largo might be because he could be connected to this thing with sammy pollock and paul dropping out of sight is probably connected as youve already guessed i paused for a moment what about the poppy club that mean anything to you costello shook his head has that got something to do with paul maybe i said maybe to do with sammy pollock maybe nothing to do with anything i stood up and picked up my hat okay would you tell your monkey to give me my keys back ill be in touch if i find out anything about paul tell me something lennox said costello this thing with sammy pollock and now with paul are you looking for people or bodies it doesnt look good does it i shrugged them disappearing doesnt mean theyre dead jimmy im beginning to suspect they were doing a bit of business on the side probably with this guy largo who no one knows anything about it could be that hes after them for money and theyve both had to take a powder for a while who knows hes my boy lennox my son hes a waster and a wanker but hes my son find him for me i dont care what you say ill make it worth your while i nodded okay jimmy ill see what i can find out i put on my borsalino ill be waiting at the car tell skelly to bring my car keys out to me fresh air was a relative term in glasgow but it was good to get out of the empire and onto the street i ignored the grubby tenements and looked up above the roofs and smoke stacks it was past ten but the sky was still reasonably light scotlands latitude made for long summer evenings there was a burst of noise behind me as the pub door swung open i turned and saw skelly come out his stooge young was at his side heres your keys lennox skelly smiled his yellowtoothed smile and held them out to me thanks i took the keys in my left hand and ive got a tip for you i reached inside my jacket pocket with my right hand for a minute from the expression on his face i think skelly really thought i was going to hand him a tenbob note i pulled out the flat springhandled blackjack and in a continuous backhand movement whacked him in the side of the mouth with it the sound was somewhere between a snap and a crunch and he dropped like a stone his friend took a step towards me and i held out my hand making a beckoning gesture with my fingers for him to keep coming young clearly decided to decline the invitation and backed off i leaned over skelly he was coming round his face was a mess of blood from the look of it i had done him a favour he clearly wasnt too keen on toothpaste and i reckoned he would have a few less teeth to clean in the future i patted him down with my free hand until i found what i was looking for reached into his jacket pocket and took out the small webley threetwo heres your tip skelly never ever pull a gun on me even an antique like this if you ever pull a stunt like that again ill kill you thats not just an expression ill stop you breathing got it he made an incoherent moaning sound behind his broken teeth i took it as his assent i pocketed the threetwo and turned to the sandyhaired goon if i see your face again itll end up in a worse condition than his have you got that he nodded have a nice night girls i said amiably then i climbed into the atlantic and drove off chapter seven i spent the next couple of days paddling hard and getting nowhere nowhere with what had happened to sammy pollock nowhere on what was going on with bobby kirkcaldy i was considering changing the name of my business to sisyphus investigations the one good thing was i was able to leave a message with big bob at the horsehead for young davey to get in touch i would maybe have something for him to do after all sheila gainsborough was back in town she called me on her return from london and didnt sound at all pleased that i had so little to report she insisted on talking facetoface and asked if i would meet her at sammys apartment i drove over that afternoon when i got there the place was unrecognizable the disorder was tidied and the air in the apartment was scented with beeswax sheila had gathered her blonde hair up with pins and was dressed for serious housework a red checked shirtstyle blouse the shirt tails tied in a bow at her navel exposing a couple of inches of pale midriff above the skyblue capri pants she had none of the sophisticated couture she had worn at our last meeting and her face was naked of makeup other than a quick sweep of crimson around the lips and she still looked a million dollars i had to tidy the place up she said it makes me feel better getting it nice for sammy to come back to i mean she asked me if i wanted a coffee and i decided to risk it coffee in glasgow was typically some chicory sludge from a bottle mixed with hot water but sheila was anything other than typical glasgow she returned with a tray encouragingly laden with a percolator two cups and a plate of pastries she poured our coffees and sat down opposite me her knees angled ankles together finishingschool style i thought again about how good a job they had done on her she offered me one of the pastries it was one of those oversweet things that had become popular since rationing had ended a doughnut with cream and jam filling what we used to call a burlington bun back home in atlantic canada i didnt know what they called them anywhere else no thanks i smiled i dont have a sweet tooth i noticed she put the plate back down without taking a pastry herself that figure was a piece of work the last time we spoke i was really worried about sammy disappearing she bit into her crimson lower lip and i found myself wishing she had been biting into mine now im frightened mr lennox he seems to have vanished from the face of the earth and you dont seem to have the slightest clue listen miss gainsborough i have found something out i didnt want to tell you on the phone but do you remember paul costello the guy we came across at sammys apartment she nodded i could see the trepidation in her eyes well i continued im afraid he seems to have gone missing too same setup the trepidation became fear and sheilas eyes glossed with tears i really think you should contact the police i said placing my coffee cup on its saucer and leaning forward i know youre really concerned and if im honest so am i but the police she paused and frowned why do you think theyve both disappeared my theory is that there is some truth in what costello said about this mysterious largo i dont think costello owed him money the way he claimed and i dont think this largo would send heavies here to sammys place if he wasnt in some way involved but costello denied that too so what do you think is going on i honestly dont know but im guessing that sammy and paul costello were involved in some kind of deal with largo and something has gone wrong if im right thats not necessarily bad news it could mean that sammy and costello have simply gone into hiding voluntarily that would explain why theyre so hard to find thats the way they want it but its just a hunch i think you should go to the police theres something clearly not right here even if sammy has headed off under his own steam it would suggest that hes got something to be afraid of no no police if what youre saying is true then theres a good chance sammys broken the law seriously broken the law he wouldnt be able to stand prison she frowned her cute frown for a moment then shook her head decisively no no i want you to keep looking for sammy do you need more money im fine for the moment miss gainsborough the only thing id ask is that you tell your agent that i dont work for him ive nothing to say to him about anything i deal with you directly are you okay with that she nodded i reached into my pocket for a cigarette but my case was empty oh hold on a minute she stood up and looked about herself sammy smokes im sure i found some cigarettes when i was tidying up oh yes she crossed to the dresser against the wall and brought over a silver desktop cigar box she flipped it open and offered me one theyre filtered she said apologetically then she frowned look theyre the kind you asked about the butt you showed me with lipstick on it i took a cigarette and examined it it had two gold bands around the filter yeah theyre montpelliers a french brand theres a lot of them about it would seem i lit the cigarette and drew on it it was like straining steam through a blanket i nipped off the filter between finger and thumb and dropped it into the ashtray pinching the ragged end tight sorry i said filters are okay for women but for me they kill the flavour sheila smiled the smile of somebody responding to something they hadnt listened to so youll keep looking she asked ill keep looking i said pausing to pick a couple of tobacco strands from my tongue i know you dont want the police involved but would you mind if i spoke to a couple of police contacts strictly on the qt and off the record what if they get suspicious the kind of cops im talking about dont get suspicious they just get expensive leave it to me we talked for another half hour i asked if she could remember anything more about the people her brother had been hanging around with particularly the girl claire i also asked her to think again about the name largo i drew a double blank i asked if there had been any places with which sammy had a particular attachment anywhere he may have sought sanctuary in she tried she really tried the poor kid but she couldnt think of anywhere anything or anyone that might bring me closer to finding her missing brother i left her to her desperately methodical housework as i was leaving i said that at least sammy would be coming back to the place all nice the truth was that we both suspected she was simply dressing a grave it was on the thursday night that i got a break such as it was i had been doing the rounds of clubs and bars most knew paul costello only as jimmy costellos son and the few that had heard of sammy pollockgainsborough again made the link only through sheila gainsborough i struggled to find any musicians or singers who had heard of them far less been approached with offers of representation i worked my way from the few hep joints glasgow had like the swing den and the manhattan to the rougher workingmens clubs that abounded across the city the caesar club was one of the latter category it combined industrial drinking with performers so bad that you had to drink industrially to tolerate them i arrived about ninethirty the caesar club was well named it was the kind of place that left no turn unstoned and the acts who took to the stage werent so much performers as gladiators i half expected to see nero in a dickiebow sitting at the front table giving each turn the thumbsdown when i walked in there was a comedian on the stage he had succeeded in warming up the audience in much the same way as boris karloff had warmed up an angry peasant mob with torches in frankenstein the audience was on the cusp of verbal violence turning physical and despite the fixed grin above the oversized bow tie i could see the comics eyes glittering as they darted desperately around the crowd i wasnt sure whether he was trying to find just one person laughing or trying to gauge from where the first missile would be launched i wondered why anyone would choose to be a comedian in glasgow when there were so many less hazardous career options like bomb disposal bullfighting or swordswallowing i started to feel a deep real sympathy for the comedian then i heard a couple of his jokes and decided he had it coming i knew the manager of the caesar club and he pushed an unbidden and unwanted pint of warm stout in my hand and conducted me through backstage this is who i told you about lennox he said as he led me along a narrow corridor and shoved open a cupboard door in the hall i could still hear the audience responding to the comics act and for the first time understood what baying for blood sounded like the cupboard turned out to be the smallest dressing room id ever seen and in my colourful career id seen a lot of dressing rooms this one however was not occupied by a chorus girl but by a small man of about fifty with large brown eyes and no hair to speak of on his eggshaped head there was no shade on the bulb that hung from the ceiling and its butter gleam on his pale skin added to the humptydumpty look he was dressed in a cheap dinner suit and bow tie a gleaming trumpet sat on his lap its case lying open on the shelf that passed as a dressing table he smiled when i came in youre the gent looking for young sammy i believe that i am you know where he is no i havent seen him in two weeks but thats what i thought id tell you about two weeks ago outside the pacific club you know mr cohens place well two weeks ago i was playing there friday night anyway i had finished my stint and was getting the bus home i was halfway along the street when i heard this commotion like sammy was having some kind of trouble with two men youngish fellows id say anyway there was a fair bit of pushing and shoving that kind of thing but not a fight not a squarego anyway not with two against one anyway this other fellow came out of the club calmed the whole thing down like what time was this about nine i was on early did you recognize any of them not the two troublemakers i recognized sammy of course the bloke who stopped the tussle looked to me like paul costello you know jimmy costellos boy theyre always hanging around the clubs together costello and sammy i mean did they go back into the pacific no they all got into a car and drove off they was next to the car when they was arguing i wouldnt have paid much notice its just that it was an odd thing i nodded a street scuffle in glasgow was nothing out of the usual you saw it every friday or saturday night what made it odd i dunno it was just odd they wasnt pished or anything like that it was more like he frowned his pale eggshell brow then it hit him it was like they was all agitated rather than spoiling for a fight sammy in particular it was like the other two had done something wrong what kind of car did they get into a big one white a ford i think a ford zephyr six could be yeah could be you know who im talking about ive run into them i think how well do you know sammy pollock sammy pollock sheila gainsboroughs brother i said and he looked enlightened it was becoming pretty clear that all around town sammy had been trading hard on his sisters name not that well i used to see him around in the clubs mainly did he ever say anything to you about representing you or any other musicians what do you mean represent did he ever talk about becoming an agent or setting up a talent agency with paul costello the small man with the glabrous head laughed what would they know about the music game no he never said anything to me or anyone i know fair enough i thought for a moment listen do you have any idea of where i might find someone who knows where he is theres that lass he hangs around with claire oh you know her already no know of her id very much like to talk to her do you know where i might be able to find her aye i do shes a singer not bad either claire skinner she sings at the pacific club some nights i think she lives out in shettleston i took a couple of quid from my wallet and handed it to the trumpeter from the sounds coming from the main club hall i would maybe have been better giving him the pocket webley id taken from skelly thanks thats been a help good luck out there i said and left wondering how long it would take all the kings men and horses to get there i phoned jonny cohen at home he said he knew the girl claire who sang at the pacific but he didnt know if her surname was skinner nor had he connected her to sammy pollock in any way are you sure its the right girl he asked thats what my source tells me but who knows can you give me an address for her i cant but larry who manages the pacific for me maybe has one or at least he can tell you who he gets in touch with to book her call by the club tomorrow night and ill tell him to give it to you thanks jonny i owe you yes lennox you do and lennox yeah i hope you heard me when i said you shouldnt let this shite distract you from the thing with bobby kirkcaldy i heard you jonny davey wallace turned up at my office at tenthirty just as id asked him to in the message id left with big bob he was wearing the same toobig and tooold suit that he wore to the horsehead he had a red tartany type tie and a white shirt and he had topped the lot off with a widebrimmed grey fedora that had a couple of decades worth of shape bashed out of it at least i thought i now knew what a private detective is supposed to look like daveys grin when he walked into the office was impossibly broad and gleeful making me wonder if i had done the right thing in bringing him in he was just a kid and a good kid at that but it was his choice now youre clear on what youre doing and more importantly on what youre not doing i got it mr lennox i wont let you down i reached into my desk drawer and pulled out a coarse linen bag it was heavy filled with pennies i tipped some out onto the desk take this bag with you youve got enough coppers there to phone australia if anything happens call the numbers i gave you and theyll get a message to me as soon as they can i tossed the bag in my palm a couple of times assessing the weight and keep the drawstrings pulled tight when youre not taking money out this cash bag wont break and it makes one hell of a cosh if you run into trouble you got that i got it mr lennox but i dont want you to take any risks davey just keep an eye on the kirkcaldy place and let me know if anything happens and remember note down times and descriptions of anyone you see coming or going i went back into my desk drawer and tossed a black reporters notebook over to him he caught the notebook and then stared at it wideeyed as if id just handed him the keys to the kingdom i drove up to blanefield and parked the atlantic along the street from kirkcaldys place it was difficult not to be conspicu ous but the car was far enough away and still had a clear enough view of the entrance to the kirkcaldy residence i gave davey a couple of quid a packet of cigarettes and a lamppost to lean on he took the duty so seriously that when i left him i found myself worrying that he might not blink until i returned i left the car where id parked it giving davey the keys so that he could take shelter if it started raining the weather had now definitely reverted to type and the milky sky periodically darkened into a glower i didnt want to be responsible for davey contracting pneumonia or trench foot both of which were possibilities in the west of scotland climate before i left him on sentry duty i called at kirkcaldys house the boxer wasnt in but uncle bert soutar answered the door he was wearing a shortsleeved shirt that exposed arms writhing with tattoos some of which had unhelpful suggestions for the pope if dourness could be measured on a scale then soutar was a bass baritone he nodded glumly and closed the door when i told him that the youth at the corner was with me and not connected to whoever had been carrying out the vandalism i knew of course that there would be nothing significant for davey to report that afternoon the kind of shenanigans that had been going on with kirkcaldy were the kind of shenanigans you got up to under cover of darkness while davey was earnestly leaning and diligently watching the kirkcaldy place i went to phersons on byres road for a trim and shave old man pherson knew his stuff and i came out with my face tingling and with a parting that made moses red sea work look sloppy afterwards i took a tram back into town and made a few fruitless phone calls from my office in pursuit of largo maybe it was because jock fergusons name had come up in conversation with my tame copper chum donald taylor but almost on an impulse i picked up the phone and dialled the number for st andrews square headquarters obviously detective inspector john ferguson knew nothing of my accommodation with one of his junior officers and he sounded surprised to hear from me all right surprised and maybe a little distrustful i have no idea why i bring that out in some people especially coppers he did concede he was free at lunchtime and we agreed to meet up at the horsehead bar ferguson and i hadnt spoken much in nearly a year it was onethirty by the time i got to the horsehead and the lunchtime crowd had already smoked the atmosphere into a density you could cut with a knife if i were to describe the ambience of the horsehead i would say it was eclectic there were clerks uniformed in regulation pinstripe shouldertoshoulder at the bar with workmen in flat caps and wellington boots it has to be said that no one could accuse glaswegians of not being fashionconscious and a few of the workies had rolled their wellies down from calf to anklelength as a concession to the warm weather i spotted a man in his late thirties over by the bar he had his back to me but i recognized his tall angular frame and the dull grey suit he always seemed to wear year round some policemen need a uniform even after theyve transferred to cid i understand it in a way the need to take off your job when you got home i squeezed shoulder first into the bar next to ferguson the man who had been standing next to him eyed me with that casual disinterested hostility that you only seem to find in glasgow hostelries i smiled at him then turned to ferguson hello jock ferguson turned dull grey eyes that matched his suit on me jock ferguson had anything but an expressive face it was practically impossible to work out what was going on in his head id seen more than a few men come out of the war with the same absence on their faces and i somehow had always known that jock ferguson had a similar kind of war to mine long time no see he said without smiling and without offering me a drink we were going through the preliminaries where have you been keeping yourself you know keeping my head down divorce cases company thefts that kind of thing still doing work for glasgows disreputable element now and again not as much as before things arent what they used to be jock gangsters have embraced the free market i cant compete with the rates your colleagues charge something set harder in fergusons face but he clearly decided to let it go before he would have laughed off a jibe like that because he knew i was referring to coppers other than him but this was not before i heard you were asking a few questions about me lennox after that business last year i could be accused of being paranoid but that would suggest to me that you think i had something to do with all that shite is that what you think i shrugged i just got to chatting with a couple of your colleagues are you telling me that you didnt have anything to do with it he held my gaze neither of us wished to define what it was that had happened the truth is that he shouldnt have even known about the events in a dockside warehouse that ended with me having a bullet in my side and someone very special to me lying dead at my feet her face blown off events that would not have taken place if information hadnt been leaked by a copper anything that happened had nothing to do with me thats what im saying yes okay if thats what youre saying then i believe you jock it was a lie we both knew it was a lie but it was a form of words that allowed us to move on for the moment so how are things busy mcnab has dumped this train death on me and hes piling on the pressure this new smartarse pathologist has got him farting fire you know mcnab shite killing shite doesnt interest him unless its all straightforward and easy which it usually is i nodded sympathetically the idea of working for a wroth mcnab was a frightening thought for a second i felt the weight of his hand on my chest so hows the investigation going any leads ferguson snorted sweet fanny adams weve nothing to go on except the body and you could carry that around in a couple of buckets anyway you didnt ask to see me to enquire about my level of job satisfaction what do you want lennox youre always after something before answering i nodded over to the barman and ordered a couple of whiskies he wasnt a barman i knew so i decided not to confuse him by asking for a canadian club you know this big fight thats coming up bobby kirkcaldy and the german of course what about it well kirkcaldys been getting some unwanted attention crap dumped on his doorstep veiled threats that kind of thing has he contacted us no in fact ive only been hired by one of his backers because kirkcaldys manager happened to find out about it kirkcaldy is doing his best to draw attention away from it one of his backers did you say ferguson raised an eyebrow the point is that something about it stinks theres this old guy who hangs around kirkcaldy a sort of bodyguardcumtrainer like i said old but as hard as nails goes by the name of bert soutar i was wondering if you could ferguson sighed ill see what i can do but quid pro quo lennox i might want something from you in the future my pleasure i smiled and ordered a couple of pies they were handed to us on bleakly white plates that were crazed with spidery grey cracks beneath the glaze it looked like the same kind of porcelain they made urinals from the pies themselves lay on what the french would call a jus of liquefied fat i had lost weight since id first arrived in glasgow the presentation didnt seem to put ferguson off and he squelched into the pie dabbing the grease from his chin with the paper napkin was that all yeah i said and sipped the whisky i believe old soutar used to be handy with a razor bridgeton billy boys that kind of thing anything you could find out would be really useful i can do better he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a nonregulation notebook and pencil he scribbled something down tore the page out and handed it to me thats the address of jimmy macsherry hes an old man now but was a real hard bastard in the twenties and thirties fought the sillitoe cossacks put a couple of police in hospital got ten years and the birch for his trouble he was a billy boy and knows anyone whos anyone in that circle but be careful how you handle him and itll cost you a few quid thanks jock i appreciate it i pocketed the note then a thought occurred to me oh theres maybe one other thing nobody else seems to know this guy but its worth a try have you ever heard of someone called largo like i said jock ferguson did not have the most expressive face but something crossed it that looked as if it had been powered by the national grid what do you know about john largo nothing nothing at all thats why im asking who is he where did you hear the name you must have heard the name somewhere i looked at ferguson he had turned towards me straightening up from the bar all of a sudden he became all copper and no acquaintance after all the asking around i had in that split second doubled my knowledge about largo i now had a full name for him but every alarm bell that could ring was now ringing it was clear that knowing the name john largo was enough to get me the kind of police attention i so studiously avoided i decided it was best to deliver the goods okay jock i can see that ive hit pay dirt but you obviously think i know something i shouldnt well i dont all i have is the name largo im investigating a missing person case its turned into two missing persons paul costello jimmy costellos son has also dropped out of sight but before he did our paths crossed he thought to start with i was one of your mob then he asked me if largo had sent me thats all of it ive been asking all around town if anyone knows largo and nobody i asked did until now so who is john largo now see that see that right there what you just asked if i were you thats a question i would never ask again john largo is someone you dont want to know anything about if ever ive told you anything worthwhile lennox its this john largo doesnt exist hear it accept it and get on with your life otherwise you might not have a life to get on with oh now wait a minute jock you cant ive got to go ill see if i can find anything out about soutar for you in the meantime try jimmy macsherry before i could say anything he was gone i leaned against the bar and looked down at the halffull whisky glass he had left i knew this was big big stuff when a scotsman leaves a free drink unfinished you know its serious bridgeton was the kind of place you felt overdressed if you wore shoes it seemed that footwear was optional until age twelve thereafter you were expected to wear heavy work boots with soles studded with metal segs that made a sevenstone youth sound like a nazi division marching down the street like ninetynine per cent of the population of bridgeton jimmy macsherry wasnt on the phone so i decided the best thing to do was to go down and do some door knocking i made sure i had my sap with me bridgeton was the kind of place you would feel naked without some kind of means of injuring another human being i got a call from davey before i took the tram down to bridgeton there was as expected nothing to report other than kirkcaldy had left for his afternoon session at the maryhill gym he had always trained in i had told davey to stay on the house not on kirkcaldy and thats what he had done i could tell he was worried that i would be disappointed that he had nothing to report but i reassured him he was doing just fine and he rang off as eager as when i had left him there for the rest of the world a glaswegian was a glaswegian was a glaswegian they all looked the same spoke with the same impenetrable patois worked in the same industrial sweatshop of shipyard factory or steelworks they all lived in the same kind of slum they also shared the same schizoid tendency to be the warmest friendliest people you could meet while at the same time displaying a propensity for the most psychopathic violence sometimes simultaneously within glasgow however lay a chasm that divided its working class on the surface it was a religious divide protestant versus catholic the truth is the divide was ethnic scottish glaswegians versus irishdescent glaswegians and the focus for the biblical hatred between the two communities were the football teams rangers and celtic bridgeton was part of the citys fringes and it looked pretty much like all the other parts of glasgows fringes the streets were lined with tenements or fourstorey apartment buildings the building material of choice in bridgeton had been red rather than blond sandstone or red brick but it was all pretty academic as all the buildings had been grimedarkened like every other structure in glasgow occasionally an ember of the underlying colour would glow through the soot giving a tenement the look of a dark rusting hulk looming into the sky like other parts of the city the worst of the slums were gradually being cleared to make way for new blocks of flats the spirit of the atomic age had reached glasgow and soon all of its denizens would enjoy the very latest modern amenities like flushing inside toilets but bridgeton was different from the other areas of the city in one way it distinguished itself in the intensity of its hatred for its neighbour this was the most ultraloyalist protestant catholichating part of glasgow a few weeks before as it was on the twelfth of july each year bridgeton had been a mustering ground for the pipe bands drummers and marchers who celebrated the victory of protestant king william of orange over catholic king james at the battle of the boyne and once they had mustered they would march triumphantly through the streets of glasgow especially the predominantly catholic streets surprisingly the curmudgeonly catholics didnt seem to get into the spirit of things and refrained from joining in with songs containing lyrics like were up to our knees in fenian blood surrender or youll die but glasgow was nothing if not a city of balance and fairness and there was an ultrarepublican catholic protestanthating part of bridgeton too the norman conks the catholic counterparts of the billy boys had been concentrated in the poplin street and norman street part of bridgeton their speciality as well as offering the same skills for plastic surgery with open razors as the billy boys was throwing molotov cocktails made with paraffin or petrol at the marchers on the twelfth or occasionally the odd sausage roll human excrement loosely wrapped in a sheet of newspaper i sometimes wondered how rio could compete with glasgows carnival atmosphere as i walked through bridgeton however there were no marching bands and little in the way of a carnival atmosphere in fact even on a pleasant summers day i couldnt imagine anywhere less festive i certainly was glad i hadnt brought the atlantic with me there were no other cars parked in the street in which macsherry resided and a knot of five or six children faces grimy and feet bare were playing maliciously around a streetlamp as i walked past one block doorway a man of about thirty stood watching me from beneath the brim of his cap he was wearing a collarless shirt and a waistcoat his shirtsleeves rolled up to expose forearms that looked woven from steel cable he had his thumbs looped into the pockets of his waistcoat and leaned against the doorway his heavybooted feet crossed at the ankles it was the most casual of poses but for some reason he gave me the idea he was some kind of guard or lookout the only other person i passed was a woman of about fifty who emerged from a house further up the street she was as wide as she was tall and dressed in a formless black dress or maybe it was just the body beneath that was formless she had a headscarf tied tight around her head and her legs were naked her stockings having been rolled down into beige bracelets around her ankles she was wearing dark tartan slippers on her feet something had caused the skin of her legs to mottle a purplish red and i suddenly felt the need to foreswear ever touching corned beef again she walked past me and eyed me with even more suspicion than the shirtsleeved sentinel i had just passed i smiled at her and she glowered back and just when i was about to tell her how pleased i was that diors new look had at last made it to glasgow i found the tenement i was looking for and climbed up the stairwell it was the weirdest thing about glasgow slums you could have eaten your dinner off the flagstone stairs or the doorsteps of each flat glaswegians took an inordinate pride in cleaning communal areas closes stairs entrances there was normally a strict rota and failure to have a sparkling doorstep or landing would result in the offending housewife becoming a social pariah the macsherry flat was on the third floor the landing was as spotless as i had expected but there was some kind of unpleasant smell wafting about in the air i knocked on the door and it was opened by a woman in her sixties who made the female id passed on the street look positively svelte hello could i speak with mr macsherry please the fat woman turned from me wordlessly and waddled back along the corridor leaving the door open behind her she tortured some vowels in quick succession which i took to be its someone for you a man in his late sixties or early seventies emerged from the living room and came to the door he was short only about fivefive but he was compact and wiry with a heavy head topped with white bristle there was something about him made me think of an older willie sneddon except sneddons razor scar was delicate needlepoint compared to the crisscross of ancient slashes on macsherrys cheek and forehead like uncle bert soutar this was a man whose history of violence was written all over his face but in a different vernacular what the fuck do you want i smiled i wondered if you could help me im looking for information on somebody someone from the old days fuck off he said without anger or malice and pushed the door shut i stopped it by jamming my foot between it and the jamb old macsherry opened the door wide and looked deliberately down at my shoe and then back up at my face he smiled it was a smile i didnt like and i contemplated the ignominy of having the crap beaten out of me by an old age pensioner sorry i said swiftly and held my hands up its just that im willing to pay for the information he looked at my foot again and i removed it from the doorway what do you want to know do you know or did you know someone called bert soutar aye i knew soutar whats it got to do with you youre not police no no nothing like that i represent a group of investors who have an interest in a sporting event mr soutar is involved with this event and were just doing a check into his background you see mr soutar has a criminal record you dont fucking say irony was not his strong suit i do say i continued as if i had missed his sarcasm not that that is in itself a problem but wed like to know the kind of people were dealing with did you know mr soutar well you said you was willing to pay for information i took out my wallet and handed him a fivepound note keeping a second fiver in my hand maybe we could i nodded along the hall if you like said macsherry and he stood to one side to let me in the living room was small cramped but again surprisingly clean a large window with no curtains looked out over the street below and there was a bed recess a typical feature in glasgow tenements in one wall the furniture was cheap and worn but there was the occasional item that looked incongruously new and expensive and i was surprised to see a small pye television squashed into one corner of the room it had a settop aerial sitting on it its twin extendable antennae each stretching at a wild angle from the other i understood macsherrys reluctance to let me into the flat the mix of new and old was the difference between the legitimately owned and the knocked off the fat woman whom id guessed was macsherrys wife left the room it was clear that business was often conducted here are you a fucking yank macsherry had a charming welcoming manner about him i guessed i wasnt going to be offered a cup of tea canadian i smiled it was beginning to make my jaw ache about soutar he was a billy boy and a boxer he fought bareknuckle hard cunt i know what this is all about its about his nephew bobby kirkcaldy thats your fucking sporting event isnt it im not at liberty to say mr macsherry soutar was a member of the bridgeton billy boys about the same time as you is that right aye i didnt know him that well though he was a mental bastard with a razor in his hand i can tell you that and with his fists but then when it got all military you know when the billy boys started having morning drills and stuff like that he fucked off he hated fucking fenians but he liked making money more he was still boxing though it was after he cut them coppers that was him finished i thought you said hed left the billy boys he had this wasnt a rammy it was after a match right enough but he was breaking into a credit union he had some fucking mad idea that the mounted polis would be too busy dealing with the rammy but two coppers caught him in the back close of the building from what i heard soutar got lippy with them and they was going to give him a bit of a doing that was his biggest problem too fucking mouthy for his own good anyways he always kept two razors in his waistcoat pockets the two cops made a move on him and he cut them both popped an eye on one you seen the state of his face yes i said he must have taken more than his fair share of beatings in the ring thats got fuck all to do with boxing bert soutar was too light on his feet to get battered like that in the ring or in a bareknuckle fight no that was the fucking polis that did that to him they halfkilled him took fucking turns with him you see it was a message you dont cut a cossack macsherry referred to the sillitoe cossacks the gangbusting mounted police squad set up by the then chief constable of glasgow percy sillitoe when soutar came out of prison he gave up the billy boys apparently he was a model prisoner inside and got out after six years and he came out with big ideas he said he wasnt interested in the billy boys any more he said there was no money in it and he was finished as a boxer the beatings he took in prison fucked up his face he couldnt take any more damage and couldnt get a licence cause of his face and cause he was an excon it was about then that he started hanging around with some flash harry who filled his head with all kinds of moneymaking schemes who was the flash harry i didnt know him at the time he wasnt from bridgeton and i think he was younger than us quite a bit younger but like i say flash as fuck soutar and this bloke got into the boxing game for a while fixing up fights in more ways than one if you get my fucking drift never saw him after that but i dont think the partnership lasted soutar just disappeared and macfarlane became a big fucking success macfarlane aye small change macfarlane that was the flash harry became a bigtime bookie fuck all good it did him considering he ended up having his coupon smashed to fuck i sat and nodded as if i had been processing the information hiding the fact that a dozen possible combinations of people and events were now running through my head the flat door was still open and i heard voices out on the hall the old fat woman and a male voice time to go i stood up and handed macsherry the other five pounds its not enough he said what i put on my best confused expression i wasnt confused at all another ten youve been paid for your time mr macsherry more than adequately paid he stood up i heard a sound behind me and turned to see the collarless sentinel had been the voice out on the landing and was now blocking my exit through the hallway he smiled maliciously at me another ten hand it over in fact let me save you a lot of trouble just hand over your fucking wallet i weighed up the situation sticky the old guy would have been tough enough to deal with on his own but the younger man tipped the scales well and truly against me i shrugged okay ill give you all the money in my wallet its nothing to me i just claim it back from the investors i was telling you about i frowned pensively then made out as if an idea had suddenly struck me why dont i just get them to come and see you in person you can sort out remuneration with them mr william sneddon is my employer mr jonathan cohen is the other investor i kept my tone friendly as if i really didnt mean it as the threat it was i know mr sneddon is very angry about people interfering in his business arrangements so im sure hell take your request for more payment seriously very seriously macsherry looked over my shoulder at the younger guy and then back at me why didnt you say you worked for mr sneddon maybe youre just pissing down my back and telling me its raining if theres a working callbox anywhere in this shithole then we can take a wander to it and you can ask him yourself or i could simply ask for twinkletoes mcbride to come down here and convince you of my credentials i dropped the friendly tone it was a careful balancing act some people dont have the sense to know when to be scared id have bet my last penny on macsherry being one of them he gave a jerk of his head in a signal for the younger man to let me past thanks for your help mr macsherry i turned and walked out of the flat casually and unhurriedly but i didnt take my hand from the sap in my pocket until i was out on the street and around the first corner chapter eight by the time i had waited for a tram it was nearly six before i got back to my office it was turning into another oppressive evening the air clinging humid and heavy and i felt my shirt collar damp at the nape of my neck again davey wallace called me at six on the dot as agreed davey couldnt drive and i told him to stay put and wait in the atlantic until i came up i decided id probably take a taxi up to blanefield and get it to take davey back home riding in a taxi was one of the luxuries in life most glaswegians only ever experienced on special occasions before i went up to blanefield i phoned sneddon i told him what had happened at macsherrys place he knew you was there for me he asked not to start with but i told him later fucking slum rats ill arrange a lesson in respect you better send a mob then from what i can see the old guy still has a crew of sorts and he has a reputation that must have been earned i neglected to tell sneddon that macsherry had backed down at the first mention of his name i was pissed because the old man had tried to turn out my pockets a lesson in respect as sneddon said aye well ill arrange a change of scenery for him i bet he doesnt get out of bridgeton much said sneddon reminding me of the promise superintendent mcnab had made me there was so much local colour here maybe fucking off back to canada would do my health a bit of good i did get something interesting out of the whole encounter i said did you know that bert soutar went into business with small change macfarlane some time around the start of the war no i could tell sneddon was doing the same jigsaw puzzle in his head that i had done in bridgeton no i didnt do you think its significant well this hot deal that turned into a fairy story about boxing academies it could be that small change was covering up the detail and not the principals maybe it was something to do with bobby kirkcaldy and maybe the deal was brokered through macfarlanes old chum soutar but macfarlane was going to broker the deal to me i could tell that sneddon was laying down the fact to see what i would do with it lets not forget small change had his skull cracked like an egg i said my guess is it was all about this deal he was at the heart of it and was playing for the big money not for some commission and i suspect uncle bert is involved some way you think he battered small changes coupon in i dont know maybe but i dont see why he would unless something went pearshaped with the deal whatever it was but maybe it was whoevers been leaving warning messages for kirkcaldy one thing im sure of is that kirkcaldy doesnt appreciate the attention weve been giving him speaking of which can i borrow a couple of bodies to take turns watching kirkcaldys place ive just got the one guy and me okay said sneddon you can have twinkletoes you two seem to get on yeah i said like a house on fire thanks ill let you know when i need him after i hung up i locked the office and took a taxi down to the pacific club like the last time i had been here they were just starting to get the place ready for the evenings trade the manager jonny cohen had running the place was a small handsome jew in his early forties called larry franks id never met franks before but he seemed to recognize me he came over and introduced himself as soon as i arrived he had his jacket off and his sleeves rolled up mr cohen tells me that youre looking for claire skinner he grinned widely franks had an accent difficult to place but there was a touch of london in it and a touch of something much farther away it was something you encountered every now and then the war still cast a long shadow and even though all but one of the displaced persons camps that had been spread across postwar europe were now closed there were still huge numbers of people building new lives in new places whatever frankss history it hadnt seemed to suppress his good nature can i get you a drink on the house thanks but no and yes i am looking for claire jonny said you have an address for her there you go franks grinned again and handed me a folded note he took from his waistcoat pocket i noticed something on his forearm and he tugged his shirtsleeve down casually but getting into fort knox would be easier what do you mean i unfolded the note it had an address in craithie court partick written on it its a pussy pound he said matteroffactly and without a hint of lasciviousness a hostel for unmarried women run by glasgow corporation its only a couple or so years old claire has her digs there but theyve got a matron and shell have your bollocks if you try to get in strictly no gentlemen callers youd maybe be better trying to catch her here the next time shes singing when would that be i asked to be honest it might not be for a week or more ive got a new combo booked in for the next two fridays no i need to see her before then i stared at the note for a moment my mind elsewhere im looking for sammy pollock or gainsborough as he seemed to prefer to be known claires boyfriend have you seen him lately that wanker franks grinned no not for a couple of weeks the last time he was seen was here there was a bit of a disagreement outside the club about two weeks ago did you see or hear any of that no franks pursed his lips pensively no cant say i did and nobody mentioned it either right i see i pocketed the note thanks and thanks for the offer of a drink ill take you up on that the next time im in sure his smile was still there but had changed he was reading my mind and i was reading his it said i dont need your sympathy i walked out of the stuffiness of the pacific club and into the stuffiness of the glasgow evening the taxi was still waiting for me i got into the back and told the driver to take me to blanefield i sat in silence for the whole journey thinking about larry frankss cheery manner and the number id seen tattooed on the inside of his forearm when i got out of the taxi i could have sworn that davey wallace was in exactly the same place in exactly the same position as when id left him in the morning we sat together in my atlantic and he ran through twenty minutes of detailed notes twenty minutes of detailed nothing he was a good kid all right and keen enough to make mustard makers the world over question their calling you free to do the same shift tomorrow i asked maybe a bit longer too sure mr lennox anytime and you dont need to bring me up here i know where it is and i can get the tram okay meet me up here a bit later make it six tomorrow nothings going to happen during the day i reckon how about your work will you still be okay for the early shift no problem mr lennox good i said of course it wasnt a problem having to cross the himalayas wouldnt have been a big enough problem to keep davey away i gave him a fiver you get off home now thanks mr lennox said davey with reverent gratitude this was not a good use of my time i sat watching kirkcaldys place for three hours without anything happening then bobby kirkcaldy arrived presumably after a day at the gym in maryhill he turned more than a thousand pounds worth of sunbeamtalbot sports its softtop folded down into the drive kirkcaldy was a successful professional boxer but even at that he seemed to be able to stretch his finances impressively maybe he had a paper round i leaned back in the drivers seat sliding down to get some support for my neck and tilted my hat over my eyes no point in being uncomfortable it still felt clammy and i had the window wound open but the air outside was clammy and sluggish and there was no breeze to cool me down i was going to have trouble staying awake i turned on the radio but all i could get was frank sinatra talking his way through another forgettable tune i decided to keep my brain active by going over where i was with everything there was a tiein with small changes murder all right bobby kirkcaldy was up to his neck in something that didnt follow queensberry rules there was a connection between small change and kirkcaldy through soutar here i was trying to avoid getting any deeper into dodgy dealing and all the time i was being sucked deeper and deeper into small changes murder in the meantime my other case my onehundredpercent legitimate case was getting nowhere i decided i would try to get in touch with claire skinner the next day but i knew it wouldnt get me anywhere sammy pollock had dropped off the face of the earth it took some doing and i was beginning to worry that it was the kind of dropping that could only be done professionally and then there had been jock fergusons reaction to the name largo if it was the same largo who paul costello claimed to know then it was someone outside the normal gangster circle yet someone important enough to be instantly recognizable to glasgow cid i wasnt given to much deep personal reflection maybe because i had seen in the war where deep personal reflection got you mad or dead but sitting there in a car outside a probably crooked boxers house in the countryside outside glasgow i suddenly felt homesick blanefield sat above glasgow the sun was lower now in the sky and filtered into tones of gold bronze and copper through the haze above the city in the valley below i experienced another of my reminiscent moments saint john had similar sunsets the industrial heart of the us lay in michigan and the dense grimefilled air would drift north and west exploding the maritime canadian sun into garnet beams and spilling red into the bay of fundy but the similarity ended there i thought back to those days before the war things had been different it seemed to me people had been different i had been different or maybe i hadnt a car pulled up behind me a bottlegreen rover i didnt need to turn around to see that the driver was twinkletoes either that or there was an unscheduled eclipse of the sun he came around to the passenger door of the atlantic and tapped on the window i opened the door and he got into the car causing me to be impressed with the atlantics suspension hello mr lennox twinkletoes smiled are you well im well twinkle you in the pink mr lennox in the pink mr sneddon sent me up here to take over watching mr kirkcaldys place singers going to take over from me until morning itll be a long night twinkle ive got the radio he said i find jazz has a mollyfying effect on my mood im sure it does who do you like listening to elephants gerald mostly he said with a smile who you know elephants gerald the jazz singer oh i said trying not to smirk you mean ella fitzgerald do i i thought it was elephants gerald you know one of them jazz names like duke wellington duke ellington twinkle i said i noticed the smile had fallen away from his face it was time to go but i could be mistaken enjoy anyway ill catch you later i left twinkletoes sitting in sneddons rover watching the kirkcaldy house reassured by his promise that he would be most abbsteamyuzz in performing his sentry duties i went straight back to my flat again as i closed the common entrance door behind me i heard the sound of the television in the whites flat being turned off i headed straight up the stairs to my rooms and set about making myself some real coffee and ham sandwiches with bread that should have been used at least two days before unless i had intended to use the slices as building materials i had just sat down to start eating when i heard the downstairs doorbell ring and fiona white answer it there was a brief exchange then the sound of heavy footsteps coming up the stairs it wasnt that i was inhospitable but i was not in the habit of receiving callers at the flat in fact one of the reasons i had established the horsehead bar as my outofhours office was because i kept this place pretty much off the radar of everyone i dealt with so before i answered the knock on the door i went to the dresser drawer where i put my sap whenever i hung up my suit jacket and slipped it in my pocket i opened the door stepping back as i did so and found jock ferguson framed in the doorway there was another man behind him bigger and heavier he was stretching a pale grey suit with extremely narrow lapels over huge shoulders and had a straw trilby type thing with a broad blue hatband on his head he had a big face that was a little too fleshy to be handsome and his skin tone was several summers darker than the locals the one thing that was missing was a sign around his neck proclaiming god bless america seeing ferguson at my door and in such strange company took me aback for a moment jock what are you doing here hello lennox can we come in sorry sure come on in the big american grinned at me as he entered he took off his pale straw hat and revealed the most amazing haircut i had ever seen his salt and pepper hair had been crewcut clipped almost to the skin around the back and sides but bristled upwards on top what made it truly amazing was the skill of his barber in making it perfectly absolutely flat across the top the picture of a hairdressing engineer scissors in one hand spiritlevel in the other leapt to mind lennox this is a colleague of ours from the united states this is dexter devereaux hes an investigator like you call me dex said the grin beneath the flattop i shook the americans hand then turned to ferguson you said mr devereaux is an investigator like me i asked or do you mean an investigator like you im a private eye like yourself devereaux smiled collegially at me im here on a private investigation criminal but private okay so what can i do for you i asked i realized we were all still standing sorry please sit down mr devereaux like i said call me dex thanks ferguson and the american sat down on the leather sofa i took a bottle of canadian rye and three glasses out of a cupboard i take it you guys arent so on duty that you cant have a drink speaking personally im never that much on duty said devereaux he took the whisky and sipped it mmmm nice he purred approvingly i thought you guys only ever drink scotch im not a scotch kinda guy i said and sat in the armchair opposite devereaux eyed my apartment his eyes ranging casually across the furniture the bottles on the sideboard the books on the bookshelves but it was the same apparent casualness of a progolfer preparing for a swing youve got a lot of books he said turning back to me you got any hemingway nope i said no hemingway just like ive got no blended scotch so what is it i can do for you mr devereaux please dex as for what you can do for us you mentioned john largo to detective ferguson here i believe i asked him if he knew him or anything about him and what do you know about john largo devereaux turned his eyes from me while he sipped the whisky all i know about largo is his first name is john and i only know that because jock here inadvertently told me and now i know that hes some kind of really big fish because someone is prepared to fly a twentydollaranhour private detective across the atlantic on his account and that im afraid is all i know other than someone who was a friend of someone who has gone missing knows him and now hes gone missing himself paul costello i told you about his father jock ferguson explained to devereaux who nodded almost impatiently but with his smile still in place there was something about the exchange that told me all about the hierarchy of this relationship this may have been fergusons town but devereaux was calling all the shots on this case whoever largo was whatever he was into it was big whos the friend of costello whos gone missing devereaux asked and took another sip of whisky again question and action both done with professional casualness im afraid i cant tell you that mr devereaux i said returning his smile client confidentiality my client doesnt want the police involved youre canadian asked devereaux yep new brunswick saint john thats practically maine im from vermont really thats practically quebec devereaux laughed youre not wrong there dyah know weve got the highest percentage of french americans in the states higher even than louisiana thats where my name comes from he laughed vermontfrench i mean not louisiana yes i did know that as a matter of fact like you say new englands just over the border from saint john and new brunswick is bilingual ah yes devereaux gave a sigh of exaggerated satisfaction at our exchange i got the feeling that the handsacrossthewater act was about to come to an abrupt end you know mr lennox it really would be a big help to us if you could see your way to telling us who your client is cant do it mr devereaux as an enquiry agent yourself you should know that but thats the only thing i cant do ill help you in any way i can who is john largo devereaux looked into his glass jock ferguson hadnt touched his whisky when devereaux looked up he was still smiling but the thermostat had been turned right down you cant expect us to trust you mr lennox if you dont trust us lets be honest ive seen detective fergusons colleagues at work the police here seem mighty interested in mr largo too if you were taken in for withholding evidence then it could be a long and painful process i dont give up my clients dex not for a beating not for cash and most definitely not because of threats i stood up i think you gentlemen should go devereaux held up appeasing palms okay okay take it easy colleague truth is i cant tell you too much about largo but youre right hes a big fish and hes here somewhere in glasgow ive heard all about your three kings some halfassed jock cosa nostra crap let me tell you sorry i cant keep calling you mr lennox whats your christian name just call me lennox everybody else does let me tell you lennox john largo could snuff out all three kings in the bat of an eye the difference between largo and the three kings is the difference between shark and pond scum the shark doesnt know or care that the pond scums there but he could destroy its universe with a flick of his tail from what we know about him john largo is a step beyond being a criminal he practically constitutes a threat to the security of the united states a particularly dangerous clever and wellresourced threat so what is he doing in glasgow hes spent the last five years setting up an operation that spans the whole damn world hes put together different elements in different countries like links in a chain until the chain reaches here let me guess this is only the second last link in the chain thats why youre here devereauxs grin widened he turned to ferguson you know you were right jock he is a smart cookie he turned back to me yeah your family came from here right i mean youre of scottish descent thats right my folks shipped out from port glasgow yeah along with hundreds of thousands millions of others russians jews germans poles they all came through this port along with the native scots who immigrated to canada and the us this is one of the big departure points lennox like marseille or naples or rotterdam not just for people largo has something he wants to get to the states and he has people in new york waiting for it to arrive people who have the infrastructure to make the most of largos commercial opportunity i sipped my whisky and nodded let me guess these people didnt leave for the us from glasgow more like palermo and naples like i say youre a smart cookie lennox i hope youre smart enough to see the bigger picture and its a very big picture how do i know that youve not been sent over here by our spaghettieating new americans i said devereaux gave a laugh that i didnt like detective ferguson can vouch for me and if thats not good enough for you you can call superintendent mcnab the city of glasgow police are being very supportive thats sure bighearted of them i said there was a pause more pregnant than a gorbals girl after a weekend in largs okay heres the thing i sighed and said in my best okayyougotmeimgoingtogiveyouthegoods tone my client is a public figure like i told jock im investigating a missing person and the person whos gone missing is a relative of my client a close relative i went around to his apartment and paul costello lets himself in with a key costello thinks im a cop when i tell him im not he asks me if largo sent me we end up having a bit of a heated discussion i ask him who largo is and he brushes me off says largos someone he owes money to thats it all of it then a few days later costellos pop calls me in and i go through everything ive just told you then he tells me pauls gone missing just like your clients relative jock ferguson took his first sip of whisky that doesnt mean its connected what about this bobby kirkcaldy asked devereaux jock here said youre involved in some kind of case with him and it was when you were asking him about kirkcaldy that you mentioned largo i waved my hand vaguely in the air no thats not connected in any way it was just while i was talking to jock that i thought id ask if hed heard of this largo by the way i have been asking all over town about largo no one has heard of him thats no surprise said devereaux like i told you largo works on a different level my point is could we be talking about two different largos like i said i didnt even have a first name for him until jock mentioned it maybe its not john largo at all it could be said devereaux but we know hes here in glasgow and your mention of him is the only lead weve had in months aw for gods sake lennox ferguson suddenly vented his frustration just tell us who your client is all we have to do is go around and talk to jimmy costello and hell tell us then youll have got it from him and not from me and i wouldnt be so sure about costello as a source of information i sighed look ive told you all i can which is about all there is to tell so why not end the mexican standoff and you tell me what you know about largo and what it is hes involved in and i tell you if it fits with anything else thats been happening devereaux stood up and put the straw trilby over his perfect level lawn of hair maybe we will thanks for your time lennox next time the drinks are on me he said with his customary goodnatured grin which was why i couldnt work out why it sounded to me like a threat ten minutes after they had left there was another knock on the door opening it revealed the figure of fiona white she was wearing a pale pink shirtwaister dress with capped sleeves she was also wearing a disapproving look it was an ensemble id become accustomed to please mrs white come in i offered knowing that she wouldnt she never did her pale green eyes glittered coldly but i noticed that shed put on fresh lipstick before coming up mr lennox ive told you how i feel about policemen coming to the door after the last time you were arrested i stopped her with a heldup palm as if i were halting traffic listen mrs white youre right that one of the gentlemen who called was indeed a policeman but im sure you noticed that one of them was american hes in the same line of business as i am i paused to let this impressive fact sink in i was operating on the international stage i looked at her face it had sunk without trace they didnt come here to arrest me or question me mrs white they came here as colleagues to ask my opinion on a case and as regards the last incident i thought we were clear on that a misunderstanding a misunderstanding that you yourself were instrumental in clearing up she looked at me coldly i really really wanted to warm her up to find the last faint ember of muliebrity and breathe on it until it caught fire again and i think she knew it well id be obliged if you did not conduct business from this house detective inspector ferguson is a friend of mine mrs white his visits to me are as much social as business and as you are aware i dont have a habit of having guests of any kind here it was the truth i never brought women there and i had done all i could to keep this place separate from everything else that went on in my life a refuge almost i sighed please come in and have a seat mrs white id like to talk to you about a couple of things oh something even colder and harder fell like a shutter across her eyes i seasoned my smile with a little impatience and indicated the sofa fiona white somehow managed to fill her acceptance brim full with resentment and marched past me she didnt sit on the sofa but in the armchair perched on its edge in a stiffshouldered posture that was no ease and all temporariness what is it you want to talk to me about ive lived here for two years mrs white and ive paid the rent regularly and without delay including the six months last year when i was out of the country i dont make noise i dont drink myself stupid and sing the ballads of ol ireland into the wee small hours i dont bring young ladies up to look at my etchings all in all i consider myself to be a pretty model tenant fiona white looked at me silently with the same flinty defiance if i had been expecting confirmation of my credentials as a tenant it was not forthcoming its just that i get the impression that i somehow disappoint you as a tenant i continued that you somehow wish that you hadnt accepted me for the tenancy if thats the case mrs white then tell me now and ill take it as notice to quit it is entirely up to you whether you stay or go mr lennox she said a hint of fire now behind the ice i really dont know what you expect me to say it sounds to me like its you who disapprove of me as a landlady i apologize if my manner offends you if that is the case by all means you are free to leave i dont want to go mrs white but i want to feel free to have the occasional caller or for you to take the odd telephone message for me without being made to feel that it is a huge imposition for you listen i understand that you would not have chosen to divide your house up and let in a lodger but you have and im here and if it wasnt me it would be someone else im not to blame for the circumstances that made this flat available i stood up and went over to the sideboard i took the same bottle of whisky and poured myself a glass there was a bottle of williams and humbert walnut brown sherry on the sideboard and without asking first i poured a glass for mrs white and handed it to her for a moment she looked as if she was going to shake her head instead she took the glass from me wordlessly if you want to stay then stay she said but dont expect me to issue you with a merit badge just because you fulfil your contractual obligations as a tenant she took a sip of the sherry i could have been imagining it but i thought i detected something easing in the rigid shoulders i like it here i said i told you that i also like being able to do anything i can for the girls i referred to fiona whites daughters we dont need charity mr lennox we dont need anything from you the thaw had been brief and false she put the sherry glass down on the table and stood up abruptly if thats everything mr lennox then id better get back to the girls what is it you resent about me mrs white i said is it that im a canadian is it my line of work or is it simply the fact that im here that did it we moved from a chill in the air to a positive ice age and just what is that meant to mean i mean that im here that i came back i survived and your husband didnt sometimes i think you resent me because i represent everyone who did come back from the war she turned and headed for the door i went over and placed my hand on the door handle i was going to open the door for her but she clearly misread my intent and pulled at my hand on the knob it was a tight grip warm slim fingers strong on my wrist she was close to me now her body inches from mine i could smell the sherry on her breath the scent of lavender on her neck we both froze for a moment our eyes locked she was breathing hard i wasnt breathing at all it was a second that seemed to last forever then she snatched open the door and stormed down the stairs goodnight mr lennox she said her back to me her voice unsteady mrs white fiona reaching the bottom of the stairs and without looking round she slammed the door of her flat behind her i went back into my flat and poured myself another whisky probably to celebrate my diplomatic skills and to commemorate the last time i had been in a situation so charged with sexual tension i idly wondered what had happened to maisie mackendrie with whom id danced at the saint john presbyterian church social when we were both fifteen but that wasnt all i reflected on i sipped at my whisky contemplatively i had a lot to contemplate dex devereaux for example and how it was mighty big of the city of glasgow police to be so cooperative to the point of subservience chapter nine some people relish the unpredictability of life the never really knowing whats ahead around the next corner you wake up in the morning and engage the day totally and blissfully blind to all of the things that may turn to crap within twentyfour hours when i woke up washed and shaved the next morning i didnt really get much of a chance to reflect on what was going on that was so big it commanded transatlantic interest other developments kind of took over my attention i got the news in the same way as any other glasgow citizen a headline in the glasgow herald suspect arrested for murder of glasgow bookmaker i had bought a copy on the way into the office and i stopped for a coffee at my usual place on argyle street to read it the article beneath the headline explained that tommy gun furie a smalltime boxer had been arrested for the murder of james macfarlane a leading glasgow turf accountant with suspected links to the glasgow underworld reading on i discovered that furie was one of the tinkers camped up at vinegarhill i read smalltime boxer as bareknuckle fighter and i thought of the edifying spectacle at sneddons barn hideaway furie the article said was an irish tinker a pikey as sneddon would have described him being an irish gypsy meant that furie stood a very good chance of getting a fair trial much in the same way that i stood a very good chance of marilyn monroe throwing over joe dimaggio to come to glasgow and live in squalid sin with me glasgow cid had told the reporter that although furie was helping them with their enquiries they would continue to explore all other avenues of investigation as i read that the image of marilyn washing my smalls in a glasgow tenement steamie leapt to mind that seemed to be that i wondered how lorna had reacted to the news and if the police had had the sense to let her know before she read it in the newspaper i finished my coffee and walked to my office glasgows weather had reverted fully to type and a greasy drizzle seeped from the steelgrey sky when i got into my office i phoned lornas number but it rang out putting the receiver down i decided to call in on her that evening it had been a few days since id seen her although id phoned every day each call seemed to elicit a cooler and cooler reception i felt bad that i hadnt been there more often but everything that had been going on had distracted me and i still couldnt give her what she wanted from me with the distraction of small changes murder out of the way i decided to drop the whole thing about what kind of deal he had had going with bobby kirkcaldy the main thing was to find out who was trying to put kirkcaldy off the fight i knew it wasnt anyone in the schmidtke camp they werent due in the country until the end of the week of course that didnt mean they hadnt recruited local talent but somehow it didnt seem feasible and my money was on finding out who had a bundle riding on kirkcaldy losing i spent the rest of the day going from one bookie shop to the next a tour of the public toilets of calcutta would have been more edifying lunchtime found me in the east end and i tried a cafe i hadnt been to before it turned out to specialize in viscosity the bacon sausage and fried bread i was served with were islands on a lipoid ocean i decided to spare my bowels the violence and stuck to the coffee afterwards i walked to a telephone kiosk and fed it copper and brass i tried lornas number again but it still rang out there was a telephone directory on the shelf and i went through it until i found the numbers of the three hotels within walking distance of st andrews square and in the kind of price range that the city of glasgow police would usually stretch to each time i asked to speak to mr dexter devereaux out of vermont usa three strikes i tried the central hotel and st enoch station hotel no american called devereaux it turned out that i should have worked alphabetically i tracked him down to the alpha hotel in buchanan street the reception told me that mr devereaux was out on business and was not expected back until the evening i said there was no message and i pushed the silvered buttons on the phone to break the connection i released them and dialled the number i had for sheila gainsboroughs glasgow apartment again nothing my next call was more successful if you can call having to talk to willie sneddon a success have you seen the news i asked i seen it sneddons voice was flat neutral fuckin pikeys cant turn your back on the bastards for a second tommy gun furie from what the papers said it sounds like he was a bareknuckle boy you ever come across him naw not that i know of maybes no names no pack drill and shite i dont stamp their fucking insurance cards anyways all that shite has got fuck all to do with fuck all you got anything on bobby kirkcaldy i took a moment to absorb the richness of english as it could only be spoken in the mother country no ive spent the day going round bookies trying to find out whos betting against him they fucking tell you that stuff asked sneddon ive been using your name in vain in vain no one seems to know of any big bets means fuck all said sneddon the really big stuff wont go through fucking street shops talk to tony the pole grabowski i asked but was prompted by the exchange to put more money in the pay phone it was a reminder to be careful what you said from a public callbox i fired a couple of brass threepenny bits in and hit the a button grabowski i asked again i thought tony had given up the gambling business as well as opening doors naw fuck knows hes made enough money to retire but hes still running the odd book if anybodys been touting a big bet around town then tony the pole will know about it ill check it out can i keep using twinkletoes for staking out the kirkcaldy place ive got my guy on it early evenings suppose that it there is something else i hadnt been sure if i was going to voice my suspicions but i reckoned that sneddon as my client had a right to know what was going through my head what this may or may not be something to worry about you know i asked you if you knew someone called john largo aye what about it well i asked one too many people about john largo and i got a visit from a police chum of mine last night he brought company a yank claiming to be a private detective from vermont and if he was a private detective then im grace kelly hes calling all the shots as far as the city of glasgow police are concerned whats it to me i dont know i dont know that its anything to anybody but it means two things some heavyweight american law enforcement is in town and whoever john largo is hes a big big fish and glasgows a small pond your pond i take your point ill ask around have you let cohen and murphy know yet no but i will and i wouldnt ask around too loudly thats what brought me to the attention of eliot ness after i hung up from sneddon i drove out of the east end across the river and south in the general direction of cathcart and newton mearns there was a lot about glasgow about scotland that itched at me like a nettle rash but there was also much about the scots i liked one of their most redeeming qualities was the way they accepted different shades of scottishness just as it was possible to call yourself an irishamerican there were identities within scotland that were unique but taken as part of the scottish identity italianscottish jewishscottish the variation that had given birth to a totally unique cultural phenomenon of the barmitzvah ceilidh where yarmulkes and kilts were required dress and since the end of the war there had been a new caledonian breed the polishscot tony the pole grabowski was one of the thousands of polish servicemen who had fought alongside the british army or in the skies above britain many had died defending an island they had only known for months the vast majority of the britishbased free polish army had been stationed in scotland i had a soft spot for the poles the polish first armoured division had been attached to the first canadian army and i had seen them in action and having seen them i had counted myself very lucky to have been on the same side as them after the war like so many of his countrymen tony the pole had decided he preferred the pattern on this side of the iron curtain and had become a resident alien then a naturalized british citizen he had married a scottish girl and had settled down in polmadie in the south of the city polmadie was about as picturesque as its name suggested a maze of tenements and s corporation semidetached houses mind you in a city with districts called auchenshuggle and roughmussel polmadie was positively lyrical and a semidetached was a palace compared to a gorbals slum tony the poles day job was as a greengrocer being polish he hadnt understood that fruit and veg unless they had been fried or were capable of being fried were always at the bottom of any glaswegian shopping list maybe that was why greengrocery had remained tonys day job it was his night job that had brought in the real cash tony the pole grabowski opened doors all right he had been without doubt the best peterman in scotland there had not been a safe he couldnt crack one way or another but the petermans life was a perilous one there was always the threat of the missed foothold the slip from a drainpipe the fall or the danger of silent alarms night watchmen or patrolling bobbies with a soft tread so tony when he had saved enough to keep his family comfortable and before he had been locked into a box himself had quit the peterman business and had resigned himself to a world of wilting cabbages and wrinkling tomatoes except every now and then tony would organize a card game or set up a book on a sporting event just to supplement the income from peas and sprouts i found tony the pole behind the counter of his shop on cathcart road he was a short squat man with a broad polish face and an even broader polish accent he was balding and had shaved off what had been left of his hair from the darkening rim that swept from temple to temple i guessed the time must have been nearer five oclock than i had thought hi tony whaddya say whaddya hear tony laughed at the movie line he actually giggled an action at odds with his squat powerful frame he was a james cagney fan and at our first meeting had been entranced by my american accent since then every time i met him i greeted him with the rocky sullivan line from angels with dirty faces i had once tried bogart from the treasure of the sierra madre on him but had withered under his disapproving gaze hey lennogs vad daya zay vad daya hear its been a vee vile neebour tonys party trick was made all the better because he didnt know that speaking in the glasgow vernacular and a thick polish accent simultaneously was a party trick anyone learning a new language tends to speak in the idiom they are exposed to as far as learning english had been concerned tony had been exposed to the linguistic equivalent of gamma radiation glaswegian english now tony bantered and pattered like a native glaswegian yet almost every initial consonant was substituted with v or z it was as hilarious as it was impenetrable and it cracked me up every time i heard him but i never let it show hi tony hows business ze ushual cannae complain widnae dae much use iv i did tony said the usual mix of will fyffe and akim tamiroff maybe a little bela lugosi thrown in vots occurin im looking for a bit of information vell youff come to ze right place i know my onions he laughed his girlish laugh and indicated his counter stock with an openarmed gesture we were interrupted by a small woman in a headscarf pinnie and faded tartan baffies as carpet slippers for some reason light years beyond my ken were known in glasgow she was somewhere between thirty and eighty glaswegians generally bypassed middle age taking the direct road from youth to decrepitude the indeterminately aged woman placed her order and tony snapped open a bag with the kind of theatricality that only greengrocers and stage conjurors seem to attach to paper bags he dropped the onions into it and with the same conjurers flourish spun the bag around to seal it zere you go hen tony beamed as he handed the bag to the woman in slippers she shuffled from the shop vad kind of invormation he asked after she was gone this is all very discreet tony just between you and me no one will know that you are my source i just need to know if anyones been trying to tout a big bet on the bobby kirkcaldyjan schmidtke fight i mean a serious wager i was relying on tonys good will no bribe or threat here it was always easier if your source was poor or yellow oh aye here vee vucking go between you and me my silesian arze youre vorking for one of ze zree vucking kings ill bet who zent you here villie zneddun said tony it was like having a conversation with count maccula i ignored the question thats not important tony has anybody been trying to lay over the odds on bobby kirkcaldy losing naw i vould have heard about it id have had to broker it wiz zome o ze bigger buoys the skin on his brow corrugated the limit of his frown indicating the ghost of a longdead hairline hold on zere vas something a couple of wee gobshites tony pronounced the insult ghubzhides zey vere in ze zaracens zord about zree veeks ago zey vere comin ze big bollogs i knew the saracens sword the

was playing with the light switch in that small dark room at the back of my brain i tried lorna again from a call box still no answer i was becoming seriously concerned and i decided that once id done all i had to do that day id take a drive down to pollokshields and see what as tony would have put it voz occurin i drove up into partick parked on thornwood drive and walked to craithie court there was a pleasant late afternoon light and i had that cloyingly melancholy feeling again the young womens hostel in craithie court was off thornwood at the top of a gentle hill and i had a view down the street a corridor of sandstone tenements to where the forest of cranes marked the edge of the clyde there were more cars parked in the streets here and cars were beginning to change the shape of the area for the last six years there had been plans to dig a tunnel under the clyde to make it easier to move from north to south whether the local inhabitants were keen that govan on the opposite bank of the clyde should have such ease of access to partick was something i couldnt comment on when i got to the hostel i knocked on the administrative office door difficult though it was to believe i did have some hard and fast moral codes and rules of behaviour one of which was that i would never hit a woman the matron who answered the door was one of the best arguments for my moral stance i had encountered burly isnt an adjective normally attached to women but it stuck to the hostel matron like crap to a shirttail and i would never have hit a woman like her for fear she might hit me back she was dressed in a dark grey suit of tweed so abrasive that i was sure some religious order somewhere must use it for mortification can i help you she asked i didnt answer right away mesmerized as i was by the way her eyebrows knitted themselves together above the bridge of her nose and by the rich baritone of her voice i explained that i was looking for claire skinner and that it was businessrelated then youll have to arrange to meet her somewhere else no male visitors here such steadfast but illplaced guardianship of virginity brought to mind empty stables with locked doors i brought all of my weapons to bear on hairy mary including my notinconsiderable homespun canadian charm none of them worked on her and she raised an eyebrow or more correctly one half of her cyclopean eyebrow in weary disdain i decided because i had a plan b up my sleeve to drop it for the moment i shrugged as if it had been no skin off my nose but big trouble for someone else and made to leave she let me shed seen that trick along with all the others before chapter ten i drove back into town and parked the atlantic in buchanan street where i could have a clear view of the alpha hotels main entrance it was sixish when i parked and it was another half hour before devereaux arrived back he was dropped off by a marked police wolseley if devereaux was a private detective and the city of glasgow police was extending him this kind of courtesy then i decided it would be a good idea for me to change my brand of cologne i certainly was doing something wrong devereaux got out of the car and trotted into the hotel i gave him a couple of minutes to get into his room then locked the atlantic crossed the street and walked into the lobby the desk clerk was a small dark man of about forty who smiled welcomingly at me despite the fact that he was small forty and a desk clerk can i help you sir he asked still smiling yeah you sure can i grinned back i hammed up my accent a bit generally brits couldnt tell me from an american providing i avoided diphthongs americans pronounced diphthongs flatly we positively yodelled them linguists called it canadian raising the americans just called it canuck im looking for a buddy of mine i said dodging diphthongs dex devereaux from vermont hes registered here i think yes sir do you want me to send a boy to his room to tell him youre here before we do that i just want to make sure i got the right dex devereaux if it is hell have been booked into the hotel from washington dc is that right the clerk continued to smile im sorry sir i cant give out that kind of information thats okay i said i quite understand i took three pound notes from my wallet and laid them on the reception desk my fingers pinning them to the mahogany i believe you are correct said the clerk still smiling and the notes were gone shall i send a message that wont be necessary said a voice from behind me i turned and saw devereaux standing behind me he must have been waiting in the lobby hey there johnny canuck your surveillance skills stink he said and looped a firm guiding arm through mine lets take a walk we headed out of the hotel and devereaux suggested we take my car as he did so he waved a hand vaguely in the atlantics direction my guess was that he had spotted it or me from the back of the police car that had dropped him off where do you want to go i asked somewhere quiet he replied without letting the smile drop from his face where we can talk ten minutes later we were parked beneath a sheltering arch of trees on kelvin way where it dissected kelvingrove park nice day for a walk said devereaux as he got out of the car i followed locking up the doors he led the way into the park and in the direction of the museum and art gallery until we found a treeshaded bench devereaux was in a suit of exactly the same style and cut as he had worn the night hed called at my flat with jock ferguson except this time it was blue several shades too light a blue for a local ever to have worn i imagined it would have looked okay in the swelter of a new york summer but amongst the muted tones of tweed and sergebound glasgow it was the sartorial equivalent of a screeching jazz trumpet played through a loudspeaker so you thought youd try to find out who booked my hotel room for me he said and placed the straw trilby on the bench next to him exposing the precision engineering of his flattop haircut he took a handkerchief from his pocket and drew it across his brow before putting the trilby back on this is all very graham greene i said parleys in parks that kind of thing did you think that was how to work out who had sent me here devereaux ignored my diversion my client your client it came out almost a snort if you have a client then their motto is fidelity bravery integrity devereaux laughed and eyed me as if appraising me there was a hint of respect in his gaze also a hint of the lion appraising the antelope yep jock ferguson was right said devereaux you are a smart cookie okay you got me so what do i call you i asked special agent devereaux dex will still do just fine and what we talked about the other night was all true so what in hells name is so important about john largo that the fbi send one of their finest on a tub all the way over to glasgow actually i flew to london i took the train up here and john largo is that important seeing as youre so allfired curious about me and seeing as you enjoy an interesting relationship with the local law enforcement i thought it would be good for you and me to have a talk without jock ferguson present devereaux stood up and we started to walk through the park you dont trust jock i asked im just cautious thats all yet youre prepared to trust me devereaux laughed now theres a question do you trust a man who doesnt really trust himself well let me tell you lennox youre an interesting kind of guy youll have guessed that ive been through everything thats on file about you war record post war record i know that you deal with crooks i know that youve done the odd crooked thing yourself and i know more than you might think i would know about everything that happened last year i said nothing he probably did know more than id like more than jock ferguson knew or was sure that he knew like i said i saw your war record i know what it was like to have your kind of war i was with the first ranger battalion thats one of the reasons i put myself forward to come over here i know scotland i trained here with the british commandos before omaha beach again i said nothing everybody had a war story i also know about the devereaux paused looking somewhere in the parks trees for the right word difficulties you got into towards the end of your war service the accusations about blackmarket dealing and i know all about your german associate ending up face down in hamburg harbour devereaux stopped in the path and turned to me do you know what i see lennox i see a man who can be trusted for the best reason of them all money i dont know what schemes ferguson has going maybe none but it looks to me like every second cop in this city is on the take id be pretty sure that largo has a couple in his pocket so heres the deal ill pay you for anything i can use to get largo you give me the goods that lead me to him and ill pay you a thousand dollars thats over and above anything you make on the side from the cases youre investigating it should also be enough to resolve any conflicts of interest should they arise thats an interesting offer dex all of a sudden i felt comfortable using his first name promises of large sums of money tended to make me more amenable to widening my social circle but to be honest a lot of people have been paying me to find people so far my batting average has been pretty lousy you dont need to find him lennox just get enough to point me in the right direction he led on and i followed a woman in a flared shirtwaister dress and winged sunglasses pushed a pram the size of a taxi past us devereaux lifted his hat to her and i followed suit we were pretty elegant for a couple of new world joes you still havent told me why he is so important i said what did he do steal george washingtons wooden teeth from the smithsonian when we met at your apartment the other night i told you how largo has built up a chain of supply across three continents its a very very impressive operation but whats even more impressive is the vision behind it you and i saw all kinds of hell in the war id say but john largo has a vision of the future that would give us new nightmares have you heard of a narcotic called heroin ive heard of it i said it was used in the war instead of morphine ive heard of people getting hooked on it but its less addictive than morphine i believe thats why they used it thats where youre wrong thats where everyone behind heroin got it wrong it was created as a less addictive alternative but it actually creates a higher dependency among those who use it thats not been a problem here in england its still legal and a prescribed medicine if your kid has a cough that wont go away the doctor will write you a script for a dose of heroin drops in fact the authorities here only started to keep a record of heroin addicts this year there are just short of four hundred recorded addicts in britain almost all are doctors or connected to the medical profession you dont have a problem here but in the states we do and its getting bigger heroin has been controlled since the harrison act and we made it completely illegal more than twenty years ago he paused as a couple of young men in shabby business suits walked past i work out of the bureaus new york office last year in harlem new york city we saw a rapid spread of the illegal supply of heroin this summer we have an epidemic on our hands an epidemic of negroes injecting themselves with this stuff so this is largos business hes the one whos supplying it to the blacks devereaux shook his head john largo is supplying the people who supply the negroes the syndicate but largos not the only one supplying the syndicate glasgow isnt the main supply port and largo isnt the only exporter whos the competition i asked corsicans between you and me theres a rumour that uncle sam did a deal with the corsican mafia to keep the commies out of marseille uncle sam in the form of the cia the flipside of the deal is that the same corsicans are running heroin from french indochina to turkey and into marseille and supplying the stuff to the new york syndicate the story is that largo uses a different route and the stuff ends up here in glasgow then its shipped to the states for a moment i considered what devereaux was saying i leaned back on the bench hooking my elbows over the back and tilting the brim of my borsalino to let the sun bathe my face so why are you here and not in marseille sounds to me like largo is small fry in comparison to these corsicans hes not anything but largo represents serious opposition and the corsicans dont take kindly to opposition trust me john largo has more to fear from his swarthy islander competitors than he does from law enforcement fact is the syndicate is largely made up of neapolitan and sicilian families theres some kind of animosity between the italians and corsicans the corsicans are the wrong type of guinea or something i guess and largo has been undercutting their prices so hes slowly been carving out a bigger share of the us market how did you find out about him a couple of young women walked past and we again raised our hats the girls laughed in a stupid way and walked on no class i thought the one nearest to me had on a white linen skirt so lightweight that the sun shone through outlining her thighs and hips no class but nice ass six months ago i got a lead said devereaux the italians dont talk because of their omerta but they have to work with others in the syndicate and out of it theyve been setting up a network of coloured middlemen throughout harlem one of them was a guy called jazzy johnson who also happened to be one of my snitches johnson wasnt able to pass on information of any quality because they never told him anything more than the barest minimum he needed to know but what made jazzy a good snitch was the way he was all ears and he told me everything he could pick up one of the things he overheard was a conversation about an overdue shipment that was coming from glasgow and the name john largo was mentioned devereaux shrugged thats it not much to go on but at least i was able to put the name to a figure we knew was operating in europe still not much information there except he was an exsoldier aint we all i interrupted sure but largo is supposed to be some kind of exprofessional you know careertype soldier which army dont know us canadian maybe even british the start of the supply chain has to be out in the far east and it could be that john largo started out in some brit colony like hong kong or fought the japs rather than the krauts wherever he did his fighting and whoever he did it for the rumours are that he is one deadly sonofagun theres been a lot of blood spilt across asia and europe just setting this thing up devereaux stopped again and looked around the park say do you think we could do this wet i looked at my watch the pubs are open i know a place near here there tends to be an architectural style or design vernacular that unites buildings used for a common specific purpose glasgow bars seemed to be themed eternal gloom where there were windows the glass was frosted or misted for the twin purposes of concealing the earnest business of scottish drinking from the outside world and to attenuate any sunlight into an insipid milkywhite bloom we didnt speak further about largo or the fbi all the way through the park and onto the main road instead we talked about vermont and new brunswick different sides of the border but pretty much the same way of life and pretty much the same way of looking at life a few heads had turned in our direction when we entered the gloom of the bar but we were ignored once we had ordered a couple of whiskies and sat over at a corner table away from the smattering of other customers so your informant cant he find out any more about largo he cant find out anything about anything any more i raised an eyebrow but devereaux shook his head bar fight the same old crap about a woman or a spilt drink or a remark he took a knife in the ribs oh i see i said and a fleeting thought that glasgow was maybe twinned with harlem fleeted and you have no other leads you got all i got it was the first time id seen devereaux close to gloomy but it might just have been the pub listen i said dont get me wrong im not haggling but a thousand dollars isnt much for the fbi to be offering for information leading them to someone as big and someone who you have so few leads on as john largo we have other priorities commies mainly between hoover and mccarthy weve spent the last five six years chasing red spectres and letting the syndicate get away with murder literally the other thing is my bosses dont put the same importance on largo as i do they see the french connection as they call it as the biggest threat and to be honest this problem isnt a problem as far as a lot of my superiors are concerned so long as its in harlem upper manhattan or nassau county and wed have a task force set up with a milliondollar budget but harlem its just niggers i took a breath and let it go slowly it all fitted you can keep the reward money i said if i find anything out about largo ill give it to you for free like i said ive got a lot of people paying for my time to find people i cant find devereaux stared at me as if he was unsure if i was serious why lennox you liked this coloured guy jazzy he was a cheap hoodlum you liked him though i guess the reason theres only a thousand up for this reward is because its your money isnt it no one else sees the big picture devereaux sighed these people are stuck in a shithole of a place and heroin gives them a holiday its supposed to be the most incredible feeling puts you in a different place a universe away from your troubles but it turns your brain to mush and makes you its slave for the rest of your life and that my friend means that it offers the criminal opportunity of the century theres no way that its going to stay in harlem or watts or englewood and even if it does i didnt join the fbi to watch people rot to death to make a buck for organized crime like i said everything i told you in your apartment was true my investigation here is private or semiprivate the bureau agreed to pay my transport and accommodation and give me some kind of official sanction as far as the city of glasgow police are concerned but if i dont come up with the goods literally come up with the goods then i have a long and happy career in filing and archiving to look forward to what do you mean literally come up with the goods the new york police department have had to deal with all of the consequences of whats happened in harlem over the last two summers consequences on the street it means that nypd beat cops have become our best source of information that information tells us that theres been a hiccup in supply about three weeks ago a shipment was supposed to arrive it didnt there are a lot of itchy customers on the street as a result and last i heard it still hadnt arrived which is why im here theres been some kind of wrinkle and i reckon that john largo is here in glasgow with iron in hand lets just hope its a big wrinkle and i have enough time to find him what about the movement of the stuff itself have you spoken to the port authority theres a chance youd be able to track any iffy shipments i have a contact devereaux held his hand up youve got this all wrong this isnt illegal gun shipments he shot me a meaningful look he really did know more than jock ferguson about what had happened last year what youve got to remember about this stuff is that you dont need a freighter to bring it over its small and it can be hidden anywhere and in anything a suitcase of this stuff in its pure form would be worth a hundred thousand dollars i thought about what he was saying for a moment does the city of glasgow police know any of this some theyre not that interested in the heroin theyre just very keen to be seen to help uncle sam devereaux smiled wryly we just saved the world you know that you did i said leaving the bitter scottish beer and sipping at the whisky chaser that you did i looked at my watch and suddenly had an idea do you have your fbi badge with you sure devereaux frowned i have it with me all the time why because you could make someones day for me i gave devereaux the lowdown on the way up to blanefield i told him about what had been happening with kirkcaldy and the forthcoming fight with the german title holder all of which was just background for why i had really brought him up there i really appreciate you doing this dex i said as we pulled up behind the bottlegreen rover sneddon was allowing it to be used as an almost permanent observation post davey wallace took the early evenings twinkletoes until one in the morning then sneddon would provide another thug to watch the place until daybreak davey still approached his duties with fierce dedication taking notes of absolutely anything and everything that happened he had looked more than a little intimidated by twinkletoes at their first meeting however twinkletoes had been positively avuncular with davey which had been even more scary i tapped on the window of the rover and davey swung open the door and stepped out i half expected him to stand to attention hows it going davey i asked fine mr lennox just fine he said he cast a glance across to devereaux who stood beside me im sorry but theres really nothing to report ive not taken my eyes off the place though you can trust me on that mr lennox i know that davey ive brought someone up to meet you ive been telling dex here about how you work for me parttime and what a great job youve been doing dex devereaux the american said earnestly almost sternly and before he shook daveys hand he reached into the inside pocket of his jacket and pulled out a leather wallet he flipped it open and gold flashed in the evening light special agent dex devereaux fbi it took all of my willpower but somehow i suppressed a smirk at daveys reaction he stared at devereauxs fbi shield eyes wide openmouthed mesmerized it seemed to take an eternity before he looked past the badge to devereauxs face devereaux pocketed the shield and shook daveys hand mr lennox has told me youre doing a darned fine job for him here darned fine its always good to meet a fellow investigator keep up the good work davey dex is over here carrying out an investigation for the fbi but thats strictly between us davey i said as gravely as i could manage oh yes i wouldnt say a thing mr devereaux davey spoke like a child giving his very best promise it was the childlikeness of it that troubled me he was only a kid i was pretty sure i had placed him in no danger but i couldnt be absolutely sure you can trust me not to say anything he said with the same boyish earnestness i know i can said devereaux we are colleagues after all im sure you have a lot of questions for dex i said offering them both a cigarette before lighting one for myself is bobby kirkcaldy in yes sir said davey he came back with his uncle from the gym about an hour and a half ago why dont you two have a chat while i go and see if theres anything else to report as i left them chatting i saw devereaux take his shield out again and hand it to davey at the same time i liked devereaux and resented him he reminded me of some of the men id met in the war men who saw all kinds of shit yet somehow managed to keep their humanity and sense of honour intact there hadnt been many of them and i hadnt been one the door was answered again by uncle bert soutar he was his usual charming self and after i said i wanted a word with kirkcaldy he turned his back on me and walked along the terracottatiled hallway bobby kirkcaldy wasnt in the lounge this time soutar led me further along the hall until there was no hall to lead me along he opened the door and a few steps took us down into what must have originally been intended as a builtin double garage and workshop instead it had been converted into a gymnasium three benches a rack of weights and some free dumbbells in one corner of the concrete floor a couple of heavy punch bags hung like giant pendulous sausages from robust ceiling chains and a speed ball on a wall bracket bobby kirkcaldy was in the centre of the gym dressed in what looked like longjohns with boxing trunks over them the air was filled with the sound of it being sliced repeatedly by kirkcaldys skipping rope his feet made only the smallest of movements but looked as if they were not actually in contact with the ground at any time he ignored me as i came down the steps finishing his set before wiping his face with the towel he had wrapped around his neck well he asked unceremoniously breathing hard i was surprised at how out of breath he was id seen him go the distance in the ring without breaking much of a sweat i would have been surprised if he had neglected his fitness this close to a fight i just wanted to check that everythings okay as you know weve got someone watching the house most of the kid it was soutar who interrupted me maybe that was how his face got the way it was interrupting people what the fuck is he going to do if someone starts any shite he looks about twelve oh no i said in an offended tone i dont hire anyone under thirteen unless its for chimney sweeping uncle bert took a step closer to me bert said kirkcaldy in a low tone causing soutar to check himself and allowing me once more to consider the ignominy of being beaten up by a pensioner kirkcaldy turned to me you can call him off nothings happened for weeks and im getting pissed off being under surveillance if i needed that idve gone to the police listen mr kirkcaldy im just doing my job mr sneddon has an interest in you and im just protecting that interest if you say theres been no more trouble then fine ill report back to sneddon and take instructions from him in the meantime its a free country and if mr sneddon wants to park his car outside on the street and have someone look after it then theres nothing anybody can do you done there was no aggression in kirkcaldys voice he was cool always that was what made him deadly in the ring not quite this is all very strange if you dont mind me saying so youve been getting warnings and threats and you dont tell anyone about it until your manager just happens along at the wrong time and sees it for himself and since i first got involved in this youve gone out of your way to make out that theres nothing going on theres not and i didnt mention it because it means fuck all it was obviously someone trying to put me off it didnt work it was never going to work and theyve given up what about you gramps i turned to soutar deep within the folds and creases and pads of puffed flesh his eyes glittered hard and black what do you think do you think its someone trying to spook mr kirkcaldy i mean im asking you for your expert opinion what the fuck is that meant to mean he asked nasally i mean fight fixing you know a thing or two about that i was talking to an old amigo of yours jimmy macsherry he was reminiscing about the old days do you have a point asked kirkcaldy just that uncle bert here has had a colourful past am i right in thinking that you were involved with a bookie rumours of fight fixing you should mind your own business soutar hid the threat in his tone with the subtlety of a turd hidden in a teacup but it is true isnt it i said pushing my luck you got involved with a kid on the make my guess is he became a bookie small change macfarlane what the fuck has that got to do with anything kirkcaldy moved closer it wasnt a threat he was preparing to stop old man soutar in his tracks if he moved to have a go at me i dont know i shrugged it was true maybe nothing macfarlanes dead and theyve got his killer but maybe something and if there is ill find out i left them in the gym and made sure that i let myself out there was something about the idea of taking the walk back along the hall with soutar behind me that gave me an itch between the shoulder blades i walked back up to where the cars were parked i could see devereaux was still holding court with davey who continued to hang on every word problem asked devereaux as i came up to them he obviously had a talent for reading faces or minds the fbi probably ran classes in it at quantico dissatisfied customer i would appear to be overdelivering my service we left davey buzzing and i drove devereaux back to his hotel thanks for doing that dex i said as devereaux got out of the car daveys got nothing hes stuck in a shitty home with a shitty job with shitty prospects youve made his year youre welcome lennox hes a good kid but now you owe me anything i hear you hear okay lennox look after yourself i watched devereaux a huge man in a loud suit and a straw trilby cross the street to the hotel whatever else the fbi taught its agents in quantico how not to be conspicuously american wasnt part of the curriculum after i dropped devereaux back at his buchanan street hotel i parked and walked a few blocks to the imperial hotel i wasnt after another drink may donaldson and i had an arrangement may was a divorcee glasgow was not new york or london high society and the glaswegian view of divorce was less than sophisticated it didnt matter that she had been blameless any divorce for any reason and in any class placed a woman well and truly on the outside of presbyterian respectability may and i had done a few rounds together it was true but i liked to think that i had never actually used her i also liked to think that santa claus really existed i found may where i knew she would be tending bar in the lounge of the imperial hotel may had a knockout figure but a forgettable face often wreathed with a kind of sadness or weariness when i walked into the bar she was wearing a conservative white blouse and black skirt the hotels required uniform the aim was to put the title waitress rather than barmaid in the minds of patrons may had poured me a bourbon before i reached the bar whats up lennox you got a job for me she asked with a smile that didnt reach her eyes yep but not the usual i said may did the odd job for me where she would turn up at a prearranged time and lie fully clothed beneath the covers in a hotel bedroom next to her would be a fully clothed middleaged male i would walk in with a member of the hotel staff and a couple of months later we would all speak of the event in a divorce courtroom as if it hadnt really been the pantomimed sham that everyone knew it was the british allowed divorce but in a british way bureaucratic longwinded and more than a little shoddy which suited me fine i had made a lot of money from staged infidelities to support divorce cases oh may looked at me with so much suspicion in her expression that she clearly thought i was going to offer to buy her mother for the white slave trade dont worry nothing dodgy im trying to contact a young woman who lives in one of the corporation hostels theres a matron there who wont let me in and i cant park myself outside until she shows may arched an already arched eyebrow its not what you think i said ive got a missing person case and this girl is maybe the last one to see my guy before he disappeared id like you to call on her and ask her to meet with me so i can ask her a few questions if she can tell you where to find the guy then thatll do just as well when when do you finish here my shift ends at nine i looked at my watch it was eightfifteen of course i could have stayed and drunk my bourbon and chatted to may until her shift ended but that would have been awkward for both of us okay ill pick you up then i drank half the bourbon for appearances sake paid for it and headed back to my car considering may and i had been intimate on a number of occasions i found something depressing about the sterile businesslike exchange id just had with her but then when i thought about it our intimacy had often been sterile and businesslike i tried lorna again from a callbox at the corner of bath street still nothing i looked at my watch again i had this business with may and sammys putative inamorata claire to sort out it would be ten before i could head out to lornas i killed the half hour and went back to pick up may she came out wearing a lightweight coat and smart black hat they looked new but id seen them on her more times than i could remember while the rest of society was coming out of austerity a divorcee in glasgow working behind a bar had to learn to stretch her wardrobe i put the radio on as we drove to partick mel torme was singing harlem nocturne and it made me think of everything devereaux had told me about his bosses who were convinced that devereauxs particular harlem nocturne wouldnt play in peoria they were wrong and devereaux was right the velvet fog sang and saved both of us the effort of conversation i dont know what it was that was going on between may and me but it was mutual it was as if we were both on the brink of becoming other people putting a past behind us and each represented an embarrassing reminder to the other of who they had been we were halfway to partick when may confirmed my thesis ive met someone lennox she said tentatively a widower hes older than me but hes a good man kind hes got two children does he come from glasgow i asked if she said no i would know that the chump was a ticket out of the city may had made it very clear in the past how much she hated glasgow in the past in the pluperfect and in the present perfect continuous no he has a farm in ayrshire you know that my exhusband was a farmer you mentioned it i said several drunken times i thought does he make you happy he stops me being unhappy thats enough for me we need each other i get on well with his kids and theyre at an age where they need a mother okay i smiled at her im happy for you may really i take it theres a reason youre telling me this i cant do any more work for you after tonight thats it george doesnt know that ive done these divorce cases with you and he cant find out were going to make a clean break get right away from the past to ayrshire i couldnt keep the puzzlement from my voice that is the past to be specific its the eighteenth century no she said coldly not ayrshire youll laugh at this okay try me canada were emigrating to canada theyre looking for farmers there i didnt laugh in fact i was surprised at my reaction something sharp and unpleasant bit me in the gut and i realized it was envy where in canada saskatchewan near regina we pulled up outside craithie court i switched torme off mid croon i really do wish you all the best the other thing lennox it would be best if you didnt call round to the flat any more i placed my hand on hers she stifled the instinctive recoil but not quickly enough for me not to sense the tensing of her fist to pull away its all right may i understand i really hope it works out for you well make this our last job okay i wont call round any more she smiled it would have been nice if her smile had been tinged with sadness but the idea of not seeing me again seemed to cheer her up no end i have that effect on some women i went over with her again what to say to claire skinner and gave her sammy pollocks name again she got out of the car and went into the hostel when she didnt come back immediately i took it as a good sign it was half an hour before she reemerged and got back into the car her face flushed and her expression dark drive around the corner she said without looking at me shes probably watching the car i did what may told me whats going on i asked when we were parked again i dont know lennox but whatever it is that girl in there is terrified she said she wouldnt come out to talk to you she says she knows nothing about where sammy pollock is and she wouldnt tell you if she did know its not that shes being tough about it its just that she is so terrified may frowned i dont know what youve got involved with lennox but you better be careful someone has that poor girl scared half to death okay i guess ill have to wait until she has a spot at the pacific club and have another go at her then youll be lucky i get the feeling shes keeping a low profile you okay may looked at me for a moment sighed then smiled im fine its just she was very agitated i thought she was going to go for me sorry i didnt think forget it it wasnt anything i couldnt handle suddenly mays attention was drawn to something through the windscreen look she said is that her i followed mays eyes to the junction about two hundred yards ahead to where a young woman in her early twenties was hurrying across the street coming from the direction of craithie court from this distance she appeared to be quite attractive my experience of glaswegian women was that they were usually only ever attractive from a distance or through bourbontinted glasses the woman up ahead was not quite slim with a slight heaviness around the waist and ankles she had a pale grey jacket draped over one bluebloused arm and everything about her movements suggested urgency you havent seen her before may seemed surprised yes thats her we watched as she made her way along the street towards the corner can you drive may i asked it was odd but it was one of the thousands of things about may that i didnt know she shook her head i took out my wallet and handed her everything i had in it apart from a couple of onepound notes it amounted to just over thirty pounds and i thrust it into her hands thats for helping me out tonight ive got to go after her so thats to cover your taxi fare home too thanks may thats far too much lennox consider it a wedding gift i said i got out of the car and may followed im sorry that you have to get a cab home thats okay she said i looked impatiently up the road to the corner around which claire skinner had just disappeared from view i turned back to may it was as if she was trying to frame a thought put something into words its okay may i said see you around she nodded in an odd way her eyes avoiding mine said thanks and bye turned abruptly and walked briskly back down thornwood road towards dumbarton road and out of my life i jumped back into the atlantic the chances were that claire skinner hadnt spotted my car outside the hostel and my face was totally unknown to her my fond farewell to may had cost me too much time to follow claire on foot i had too much distance to cover and once i had covered it things would get tricky its never easy to follow by car someone who is on foot without being detected but i guessed that claire would jump onto a bus or tram or hail a taxi i had no idea where she was going but i was pretty sure whom she was going to see i picked her up again when i turned the corner her trot had slowed to a brisk walk still a determined effort on a muggy summers evening in glasgow i saw her check her watch but i was pretty sure this was no prearranged appointment she had been spurred into action by mays unwelcome intervention i caught up with her and had to drive past her at normal speed i decided to pull over farther up the street dump the car and hoof it a car travelling at walking pace would be far too conspicuous i pulled over to the kerb and did a quick check of where i was fairlie park drive i was about to get out of my car when she walked briskly past without looking in my direction there was a telephone booth at the corner with crow road and claire stepped into it she made a short call before stepping back out and waiting outside the phone box i noticed her feet small beneath the slightly too thick ankles and doing a little side to side dance step i decided to sit tight the mountain was maybe on its way to mohammed after about ten minutes i saw her wave furiously at something a black taxi pulled over and she jumped in i waited until the cab passed me and put another car between us before i pulled out the taxi headed south out of the city we passed through pollokshields reminding me that id have to return there later then pollokshaws giffnock and newton mearns one of the things i could never get used to about glasgow was the way it was this concentrated dense knot of stone brick and steel factories and furnaces tenements and bristling cranes and then suddenly you were in open almost empty countryside we were on the main road south a greyblack scar on a wrinkled blanket of green that stretched as far as i could see on either side this was the main carlisle road and it meant i was able to conceal myself in traffic something that became more difficult when the taxi pulled off onto a broad another turn took the cab onto an even narrower country road this was a road to nowhere else and you needed a reason to have made that turning i held back allowing a gap to open up between the atlantic and the cab the road traced the edge of a flooded quarry that looked up at the sun like a mudbrown eye i had lost sight of the taxi around a bend it didnt concern me because there was nowhere for it to go a little bit of acceleration and i could bring it back into view but when i turned the bend i was suddenly faced with the rear of the cab pulled into a farm gate i drove on without looking in its direction and only once i was past did i see claire skinner disembark and hand some notes to the driver clearly not waiting for change she turned opened the gate and headed up what looked to me like a farm track bingo i continued along the road until i reached the next bend in my rearview mirror i saw the taxi struggle to make a threepoint turn and head back in the direction of the main road i drove around the next bend a sharp turn to the left a little further on there was a copse beside the road bumping the atlantic onto the grass verge the two drivers side wheels still on the tarmac i felt reasonably sure i had concealed my car from the farm track and presumably any buildings at the tracks end i made my way on foot through the clump of trees until i was at its edge and had a clear view across the fields the sun was low and rich in the evening sky softening edges and warming tones i spotted claires head for a second before it disappeared from view where the path dipped between its banks and i couldnt see her which meant she couldnt see me for how long i didnt know the path could soon incline back to become level with the surrounding fields i broke out from the cover of the trees and ran across the field angling my trajectory across the grass to aim for the fieldheight stretch of path behind the point at which i had last seen claire skinner the lush green grass in the field was ankle height but the ground beneath was reasonably firm having been dried out of its normal sodden state by the recent atypical spell of sunshine siberia has permafrost scotland has permasog my rush across the pasture was watched disinterestedly by a handful of blackfaced deadeyed sheep i wasnt hurrying in order to catch up with claire my guess was that there would be only one destination at the end of the lane but rather to keep out of her sight by getting to the path before she emerged from the hollow and had a view of the field vaulting over the drystone wall i dropped down onto the lane a thin grey ribbon of dusty earth between grassy banks there was something about the lane and the evening light that made me feel i should be in a collarless shirt sleeves rolled up and with a scythe over my shoulder but that wouldnt really be me as a character i always thought of myself as more leslie charteris than thomas hardy ruddycheeked farm girls and frothy ale werent my thing although id probably give the ruddycheeked farm girls a go i put these bucolic musings out of my head and made my way along the lane at a steady unhurried pace there was no sign of claire skinner until i came to a bend in the lane i could see her up ahead about a hundred yards distant i ducked behind the cover of the grassy bank and watched as she headed towards a farm cottage tucked into a tangle of bramble and bush scotlands latitude made for long summer evenings but the sun was low now and i would have expected to see a light from inside the cottage there was none claire knocked on the door and had to wait for a minute or so before someone unseen to me admitted her i watched the cottage for five full minutes just to make sure it wasnt going to be a flying visit seeing as claire had dismissed the taxi at the lanes end and the fact that we were in the middle of nowhere my guess was claire had no plans to make the return journey to glasgow that night i considered my options i would have a long loiter if i waited until it got truly dark before approaching the cottage but in any kind of light i would be visible on the path a hundred yards away time enough to put a party together and shout surprise when i came in through the front door i didnt know what i was dealing with and it would be best to check it out unseen first backtracking up the farm lane i climbed over another stone wall and took a long wide sweep around to the side and rear of the cottage where i was sure id be obscured by the bushes and brambles it was my only option but i felt exposed up on an elevated field and silhouetted against a shield of sunset sky it took me five minutes to get into position around the back of the cottage as i drew close i could see that this was a campout much of the glass in the windows was cracked or broken and what wasnt was fogged with grime what i guessed had been a small vegetable garden at the back was now waisthigh overgrown and i gently had to scythe my way through it pushing the vegetation as quietly as possible from my path by the time i reached the back door i could hear voices from inside this was not somewhere you would feel the need to whisper the voices were urgent two voices one male one female edging along the rough stone wall i reached one of the small grimy windows and peered in i snapped my head back immediately when i realized that claire skinner was sitting directly in front of the window with her back to it i wasnt able to see where the man was but i could hear him talking then i heard claire saying exactly what id been waiting for her to say since i had first started to follow her the name sammy chapter eleven they both turned abruptly when i entered claire stood up so suddenly that the old chair shed been sitting on crashed onto the grubby floor the young man stood up too i had been wrong about there being no light on a kerosene lamp sat on a table improvised from a crate but its wick was turned so low that its light was dim and weak bright enough though for me to see that this was the kind of place you could call a hovel if you raised the tone sufficiently a tumble of bedclothes and a large armystyle knapsack were piled onto a lowslung camp bed in one corner a primus stove sat next to a half dozen unopened cans on another crate empty cans and bottles lay piled in another corner you had to be really scared to hide out this much i barely recognized sammy pollock as the cocky smooth youth with the expensively barbered hair in the photograph sheila gainsborough had shown me his dark hair was now lank and greasy and his jaw hadnt seen a razor for several days he looked unwashed and tired there again the facilities here were not all they could be but there was something more to the tiredness that dulled his expression and draped itself around his frame it was the hightension electric exhaustion of a man on the run nice place youve got here i said fixerupper sammy slipped a hand into his jacket pocket did largo send you he asked largo i asked and smiled i leaned forward and turned the flame on the kerosene lamp up do you mind i asked im doing a piece for better hovels and gardens and id like to have a good look at the place as i did so i became aware that there were four of us in the room me claire sammy and a twoandahalffeethigh very green very oriental demon or dragon or devil whatever he was he was an ugly sonofagun for sure he grinned at me his long tongue lapping between jade fangs sammy saw me looking at it take it he said tell largo to leave me alone i wont go to the cops i wont do anything just take it and go thanks for the offer i said but it would clash with my colour scheme im not here about ornaments im here for you whatever it was he had in his jacket pocket he closed his hand around it i tutted and shook my head dont even think about it sammy youre a big boy but not big enough who are you asked claire staring at me with wide terrified eyes its okay claire im the guy who wanted to talk to you about sammy i was hired to find him by his sister sheila gainsborough shes been worried about him both their expressions changed and a sense of enormous relief filled the small filthy cottage the same kind of relief as if someone had found a whole bunch of lifeboats that no one had known about immediately after the titanic had hit the iceberg im sure paul costello has told you all about me i said paul and i had a little chat before he followed you out of the limelight where is costello by the way i got my answer someone was kind enough to switch out all of the lights so i could enjoy the firework display in my head better after the fireworks i went somewhere deep and dark and timeless i woke up in hell or at least that was the first thought i formed after my vision started to come together again the demon i was looking up at hadnt been carved out of jade it was made of much sterner tougher material what happened i asked even though i knew that singer was incapable of answering he helped me up to my feet i was still in the cottage sammy claire and the little green god werent instead twinkletoes mcbride stood hunched over because of the limited headroom he looked like he was holding the whole roof up which probably wouldnt have been a challenge willie sneddon was there too eyeing me maliciously and smoking a cigarette theres an ashtray somewhere i said as singer eased me down into a sitting position on the cratecumtable dont get ash on the carpet ive just done the spring cleaning you never tire of the wisecracks lennox asked sneddon i find them comforting in challenging times i held my head in my hands trying to keep it still and stop the pounding in my skull i gingerly felt the back of my head the skin hadnt been broken but there was half an egg tucked behind my ear and it hurt like hell id been sapped from behind the kind of blow with a sap that can kill a man i pictured the sap swinging through the air behind me and when i followed the imagined hand arm and shoulder behind it it led me to costellos face id catch up with young costello sooner or later then it would be party season i looked up at sneddon and frowned a thought suddenly hit me which was becoming a habit how did you find me singers been on your tail for a while quiet like said sneddon then with a malicious grin hes good at that quiet why dyou have singer tailing me lets call it insurance i get all worked up about you maybes experiencing a crisis of interests how did he he had someone with him tam always does he got tam to drive into the nearest village and phone me the rest he writes down for me he said two men and a tart came out of here like bats out of hell when singer and tam saw you didnt they came in and checked thought you was dead how long have i been out an hour weve just arrived we was looking for you anyway oh i said then i saw twinkletoes expression it worried me anything other than a smile on twinkletoes face worried me im sorry mr lennox said twinkletoes its davey davey wallace what about him someone gave him a doing said sneddon in an icouldntgiveashit tone a really good doing hes in the southern general mr lennox said twinkletoes in a doleful baritone its not right not right at all its egggreejus thats what it is fucking egggreejus is he going to be all right sneddon shrugged howd it happen i tried to shake some of the fog out of my head when i did i kept seeing daveys eager youthful face whatever had happened to him i was responsible i need to go i stood up but gravity objected ill drive you said twinkletoes as he caught my fall like i was a kid on skates for the first time my car i said weakly its around the corner of the road parked by some trees singer pointed silently to himself and held out his hand i handed over my car keys and nodded it could have been my imagination but these days there seemed to be less menace in his lurk by the time we reached the hospital the sky had turned a velvety purple at this time of year it never got truly dark glasgows southern general hospital had started off as cavalry barracks then became the govan poorhouse then a lunatic asylum before being converted for its current use it had somehow managed to maintain the charm of its previous incarnations and its jagged victorian architecture was as welcoming as castle frankenstein the linoleumfloored corridors we made our way along were quiet and i did not hear distant cries of its alive its alive echoing off the porcelain wall tiles the strictly observed visiting times were over and we were confronted by a matron only slightly less forbidding than the one i had encountered at craithie court she had the same singular eyebrow with the added twist of facial hair on her upper lip that was in danger of becoming a ronald colman moustache i wondered where they all came from and decided that perhaps baron frankenstein did have a parttime job here after all i anticipated another frosty rebuttal but sneddon gained our admittance by handing the matron our special pass a nice new crisp folding special pass with a picture of her majesty on it matron karloff tucked the twenty into her apron and bustled off down the corridor her ugly flat shoes squeaking on the linoleum davey was in a room on his own i assumed sneddon was behind that and i was grateful to him although i guessed that it had less to do with concern or feelings of responsibility towards davey and more to do with keeping me sweet so id deliver everything i could find out someone had done a real number on davey his head and jaw were bandaged framing his face like a mask and it was more like a grotesque mask than a recognizable face puffed and swollen until the eyes had become slits between thick pads of bruised flesh it looked like his nose had been broken but thankfully whoever had attended him in the hospital had made some effort to set it straight his lips were split and the lower lip had ballooned up like maurice chevaliers on a bad day there were stitches in his upper lip davey its lennox are you all right son davey turned his head to me his distended lips twitched and i realized he was trying to smile that simple act caused a tidal wave of rage to swell up inside me who did this davey im sorry mr lennox i let you down daveys voice was strained through clenched teeth and i realized that his jaw had been busted and wired shut you didnt let anyone down who did this i didnt see them they came up behind me and clobbered me when i was on the ground they gave me this kicking then i passed out thats all i remember mr lennox okay davey okay you take it easy anything else broken just my jaw and some cracked ribs the doc says i must have a steel skull he says he doesnt think there will be any permanent damage thats good davey well have you out of here and on your feet in no time i owe you a bonus you dont need to do that mr lennox just tell me that youll let me work for you again sure davey sure i will mr kirkcaldy came to see me bobby kirkcaldy aye it was him what found me he phoned for the ambulance and that i see did he see who attacked you no he only came along later i see i lost my book said davey through the wired cage of his teeth what book the one you gave me mr lennox my notebook that i wrote everything down in dont worry about it davey ill probably find it in the car or on the ground up there its not important im sorry now daveys voice sounded distant he made a soft detached groaning sound you rest davey ill be back to see you tomorrow promise he asked and sounded like a kid in that moment i remembered that he was alone in the world no parents no brothers or sisters that he knew about a barnardos kid out in the world on his own the thought restoked the fury in my gut a fury that was directed in equal shares at whoever had done this to davey and at myself for having put the kid in that position i promise davey ill see you tomorrow we left davey to sleep and outside in the corridor i had as coherent a conference with sneddon as i was capable of having i told him to put men on watch on the kirkcaldy house twentyfour hours a day i asked if they could look around for daveys notebook more to put the kids mind at rest than anything else given that singer had followed me all the way out into darkest renfrewshire without me spotting him on my tail i suggested he be put on following kirkcaldy i wanted whoever clobbered davey and sneddon was itchier than ever to find out what was going on with kirkcaldy he didnt care about people getting hurt he had invested in kirkcaldy and didnt want his money to get bruised we headed back along the gloomy porcelaintiled corridors towards the exit my head hurt like a bastard and the lurching in my gut was turning into determined heaving i stopped off in the washroom and only just made it to the cubicle before i vomited after i finished retching i went over to the washhand basins and splashed cold water on my face when i looked into the mirror i saw a wraith with deep blue shadows under its eyes set into a bleached face no wonder the ladies found me so damned attractive the harsh hospital lighting threw up the hard angles of my face the sharp high cheekbones and the arch of my brow the faint scars on my cheek the reminders of an encounter with a german hand grenade seemed more noticeable i smoothed my black hair back with the palms of my hands a plastic surgeon had had to do a bit of tidying up after my adventure with german munitions and it had left me with taut skin that accentuated my features one thing i got a lot especially from women was that they thought i looked a little like the actor jack palance women seemed to like my face id been told i had a handsome face but it had a touch of cruelty in it thats why they liked it and thats why i hated it you fucking coming sneddon was at the door of the washroom sure i said sniffing and drying my face with a paper hand towel im coming ive got work to do i took one more look at the face in the mirror it seemed to me it looked a little more cruel singer drove me back to my digs in the atlantic halfway there i had to get him to pull over to the kerb so i could throw up again i felt dizzy and sick and had that feeling of unreality that comes with concussion it wasnt the first time id been clobbered on the head and it probably wouldnt be the last despite a doctor warning me that my skull had had just about all the punishment it could take it was just before eleventhirty when singer parked outside my flat he helped me to the door i thanked him and he nodded we were bosom chums now he went back out onto the street and climbed into the green rover that twinkletoes had followed us in i didnt go up to my room right away there was silence from the whites flat so i was as quiet as i could be as i dialled lornas number i let it ring a long time still no answer i went up to my rooms and poured myself a whisky it was a mistake the first swallow made me retch i was getting too old for this kind of malarkey i decided that id probably have to have my head examined in the morning not an unusual state of affairs but this time not metaphorically before the war when id been a kid in new brunswick id been handy with a pencil or paint brush and had given serious thought to studying art at the college in halifax then the war had come along fact was that i was still handy with a pencil and before i did anything else i took a clean sheet of paper and a pencil from the sideboard drawer sat down and sketched out what i could remember of the jade figure i had seen in the farm cottage when i was finished my head hurt even more but i was satisfied with the image id drawn not exact but it was my memory rather than my abilities that let me down when i was finished i drank some water from the tap splashed my face again and pressed a damp towel against the egg behind my ear i needed to pull myself together i shaved and changed my clothes my suit bore the traces of country life and i needed to feel freshened up i drank some more water this time swallowing more than the recommended dosage of aspirin with it a stomach ulcer was the least of my worries at the moment i hit the street again just before midnight climbed wearily into the atlantic and drove down to pollokshields when i got to lornas house benny goodman was stompin at the savoy in fact he was stompin so hard i could hear him from the drive as i pulled up the front door was unlocked and i let myself in there was no sign of maggie jack collins or any other semidetached members of the macfarlane dynasty i found lorna in the living room dancing with the air along to the fullvolume benny goodman record in lornas case it should have been staggerin at the savoy and i hooked an arm around her waist and guided her over to the sofa i discovered she had been clutching a hidden dancing partner to her breast i pried the tumbler full of malt from her grasp and eased her down onto the chesterfield well hi handsome she breathed fumes that could have fuelled a jet into my face and smiled at me in an unfocussed cold sort of way it was a look i was used to in glasgow scottish truculence is a craftsmans work filtered through peat and sheep droppings and distilled till its a hundred proof long time no see i went over to the record player and tore the needle from its groove benny stopped stompin and i hoped the neighbours hadnt already phoned the police this doesnt help you know lorna i said placing the scotch on the side table and out of her reach nor do you you dont help much do you lennox she pushed at my chest as if ridding herself of a great annoyance so what do i owe the pleasure of your company i read the papers i wanted to see how you are well youve seen you may go she approximated a regal wave of dismissal not until youve sobered up lorna ill make some coffee fuck the coffee fuck you lennox it was the first time id heard lorna utter a profanity oh is that what you want you want me to fuck you lennox we have such a deep and meaningful relationship dont we sweetheart lorna be quiet ive been trying to get in touch with you all day i didnt realize you were working so hard on tomorrows hangover ill get you some water while the coffees on i went through to the kitchen filled the kettle and put it on the stove ditching the malt in the sink i rinsed the glass and brought it back to lorna filled with water lorna looked at it disdainfully but i sat next to her and waited until she had drunk it all down im sorry lorna i should have been here more often i said and meant it its just that ive been tied up with a few things including looking into some of the deals your father was into i thought that i might find out something about his death but that all seems redundant now have the police spoken to you about the arrest another dismissive wave less regal this time they showed me a photograph asked if id seen him before had you she shook her head sullenly some bloody gyppo he mustve followed dad home from shawfields a few times to learn his routine then waited for him is that what the police told you they told me nothing they talked to maggie for a while and then jack jack collins yes hes family she said with what i took as a bitter laugh there again everything about her was bitter the gyppo mustve broken in and waited until she started to cry daddy i put my arm around her and she pulled away have you eaten she shrugged i went through to the kitchen and made the coffee and some toast again i had to overcome her resistance before she drank the coffee and ate the toast i took some coffee too and managed to keep it down the aspirin was beginning to work on my headache like a butterfly trying to wear away a cannonball with its wing we sat for an hour saying nothing me topping her up with coffee eventually the inevitable happened and she had to run for the toilet when she came back her face was greywhite and the streaked makeup stood out like flaking paint we made a handsome couple i made her drink more coffee gradually her voice became less slurred and her hatred of me less intense why did they want to talk to jack collins i asked eventually about dads business if there could be a connection with his death he knew all kinds like you do i let the dig go do they suspect collins of being involved in any of this she shrugged a loose drunken shrug i dunno jack wouldnt have anything to do with anything like that jacks a good boy i wasnt going to get much sense out of her so i guided her upstairs to her bedroom i laid her down on the bed and she grabbed my jacket by the lapels pulling my face close to hers she reached her mouth to mine i gently eased her back onto the bed stay with me lennox sleep here tonight okay i said it was a reflex action like kicking your leg when a doctor hits your knee with that little rubber hammer it was maggie macfarlane who woke me up i looked up at her blinking there was just too much sun streaming into the room for my bruised noggin to cope with you look terrible she said no smile just a hard cold stare i eased myself up into a sitting position on the sofa we were in the living room that irritating chivalrous streak had shown itself again and id camped out on the sofa to get my gallantry into perspective i dont think either lorna or i had had it in us to perform a horizontal tango so here i was on the sofa cramped aching and in a foul mood i looked at my suit trousers they had more wrinkles than a nepalese octogenarian and i congratulated myself on the smart move of changing clothes before i came over where have you been i asked stretching what the hell is that to do with you i came over last night and found lorna completely plastered she could have done with a little stepmaternal support you know that theyve arrested a traveller for small changes murder of course maggie remained frosty which was far from her usual demeanour the police told me so it was robbery after all did anyone suggest it wasnt i asked i think i should go up and see lorna said maggie dodging the question ill go i said removing my restraining hand from her forearm when she looked at it as if i had been a leper with blackwater fever and a celtic supporter i promised id look after her walking to the door i added over my shoulder and how is your stepson or halfstepson i get confused what are you talking about it was there in her voice something tight and a little unsure of itself i turned to face her young jack collins the debonair gadabouttown im guessing thats who you were with last night i know hes small changes illegitimate son i think you should mind your own business and stay out of other peoples said maggie the words were hard but the tone was softening like an expert sailor changing tack she had worked out she needed to approach this breeze carefully listen jacks a good kid and he treated small change like a father i helped out well yes theres nothing improper going on if you say so i said i didnt have time for this i better see lorna it wasnt a pretty sight she had thrown up in her sleep onto the bed sheets and i had to help her to her feet and into the bathroom while i stripped the bed it took me an hour to get her straightened out before i could leave she cried a lot the shame of the unaccustomed drunk you didnt see it much in glasgow i got back to my digs about ten am the day was off to a great start as i walked up the path fiona white came out of the main door she eyed me up and down taking in my creased suit and probably sicklylooking face it would have done no good to explain that i was actually concussed rather than hung over and i raised my hat to her as she walked past without uttering a word once i was freshened up again i drove up to blanefield and knocked on kirkcaldys door there was no one home so i came back into town to the maryhill address i had for his gym it was in an old building in bantaskin street a much bigger less sophisticated and sweatier affair than the setup he had in the basement of his house old uncle bert was there too he showed a fidelity to his nephew that would have made blackfriars bobby look like a flybynight kirkcaldy was sparring with a paddedhelmeted partner in the ring bert came over to me and was the most amenable i had seen him which still was on the hostile side of chilly we saw what happened to yon laddie of yours he said through his nose that was bad bobbys upset that the boy was looking out for him when he got the beating i appreciate it i said and i appreciate bobby taking the time to call into the hospital to see him were you there when bobby found him aye we were both on the way back from here the lad was lying by the car all battered to fuck somebody must have belted his coupon from behind then kicked the shite out of him you reckon thats what it looked like poor kid you want to talk to bobby he cant really tell you any more than i can but youre welcome to wait i shook my head its okay tell him i called by to say thanks ill do that it was turning into an unproductive morning i called around at jimmy costellos his two goons skelly and young were sitting at the bar when i went in and eyed me contemptuously a look i was getting used to skelly was still wearing the marks of our recent tango i asked jimmy costello if he had heard from paul he told me he hadnt and i could see that he was telling the truth why you asking he said you got a lead no ive got a bump on the back of my head and im pretty sure it was your son who gave it to me i tracked down sammy pollock but left my rear exposed to coin an expression why would paul do that maybe hes not convinced that i really am just interested in tracking down sammy do you know anything about a stolen jade statuette of some kind of oriental dragon or demon no i guessed that this was costellos automatic response to being asked about stolen goods so i pushed him listen jimmy its important i think paul and sammy pollock have bitten off more than they can chew now do you really not know anything about a stolen jade figure i swear lennox if paul knows anything about it then hes never said fuck all to me not that that surprises me we dont talk much i talked to costello for another half hour and just went around in the same old circles as i was leaving i saw skelly shoot me another filthy look the bump on my head gave another bigger throb and it crossed my mind that it maybe hadnt been paul costello who had bushwhacked me i crossed the bar and pulled skelly clean off his stool his loyal pal backed away from me you got a problem with me shitface i chose the route of diplomacy im not the one with the problem said skelly pulling the tailoring from my grasp and i dont want any trouble so i have a problem is that what youre saying im not saying anything like i said i dont want any trouble then just watch your manners when youre around your betters sonny he turned a sullen back on me there was no fight in him but that didnt mean he wasnt handy enough with a sap in dim light and from behind i left him to his sulk and ignored jimmy costellos impatient glare i was pushing my luck i knew it but i had a sore head and was in a bad mood and everyone i dealt with seemed to be either lying to me or hiding something a promise is a promise i called in to see davey at the lunchtime visiting hour he was pleased to see me but i could tell he hurt like hell i wasnt far behind him we talked and i joked with him and all the time i felt that old dark fury kindle itself deep in my gut after i left the hospital i phoned sheila gainsborough and asked if i could meet her either at her apartment or my office it was important i told her and not something that could be discussed over the phone i got my message across and she agreed to meet at her apartment but i would have to give her an hour to sort things out she gave me the name of a cafe around the corner from her building and said we could meet there the decorum was unnecessary and illadvised but i was too beatup to argue i drove into the west end found the cafe in byres road and took a table by the window it was one of those italian places where they made an opera out of making a cup of coffee with a steamhissing machine that sounded like it should be pulling the elevenfifteen to london out of central station at least the coffee was good sheila gainsborough arrived five minutes late she looked flustered and apologized for the delay she took her scarf off and everyone in the cafe made a big show of not staring at her staring would have been much less obvious than the clumsily stolen glances a waiter who looked as if hed come straight off the boat from naples but sounded like hed come straight off the ferry from renfrew took her order for a coffee you have news she asked urgently her cheeks were flushed and despite my gloomy mood and aching head the thought of how nice it would be to make her cheeks flush crossed my mind like i said on the phone miss gainsborough i said quietly we should do this at your flat or my office like it or not youre a celebrity and every ear in this place is flapping you never know when someones a reporter or a copper she took the point and we drank our coffee in haste and silence afterwards we walked the few blocks to her apartment most of the dwellings in the area were tenements townhouses or the occasional villa sheila gainsboroughs place was a rupture in the grimy victorian and georgian facades an art deco block that would have been about thirty years old one of the interesting things about glasgow was the richness and variety of its architecture victorian slum art deco slum contemporary slum it was a classy place sheila led me into a huge bright foyer that made you feel youd stepped straight into the midtwenties a uniformed commissionaire who had an exmilitary bearing but was of a vintage to have fought kaiser rather than fuhrer saluted us and we took the elevator to the top floor you want a drink she asked as she dropped her bag and scarf onto a chair in the hall you look like you could do with one i could do with one but it would probably finish me off i moved into the lounge everything in the flat was clean and orderly the furniture like the architecture that housed it was art deco and was simple and tasteful in that subtle way that tells you simple and tasteful is more expensive there was a huge picture window unbroken except for a couple of widely spaced thin white mullions it gave a view over the city towards the university and kelvingrove please she said impatiently gesturing for me to sit i sat i think if sheila gainsborough had told me to jump out the window id have done it she remained standing clutching her hands in front of her is this about sammy she asked anxiously i held my hands up sammys okay i saw him last night thank god hes safe she almost gasped tears of relief glossed her eyes im sorry miss gainsborough but i dont think he is safe i saw him last night and he was all right but hes in trouble and hes very scared then why in gods name didnt you bring him with you because miss gainsborough someone smacked me over the back of the head and put my lights out sammy and his girlfriend and his handy associate scarpered while i was counting sheep her face fell i felt sorry for her but there wasnt a lot i could do to put a positive sheen on it im afraid that sammy has gotten involved in something heavy i said something out of his league you remember paul costello the guy who was wandering in and out of sammys apartment seemingly at will sheila nodded i rather suspect it was young mr costello who put my lights out theyre in this together whatever this is i knew sammy was getting in with the wrong sort she frowned her cute frown again where did you find him sleeping rough in a derelict farm cottage in the middle of nowheres back of beyond i only found him because i spooked a girl hes involved with claire skinner and was able to follow her sleeping rough her eyes glossed with tears again what do we do now i keep looking i think theres a chance hell get in touch with you he looked hungry and tired my guess is hell need money if he gets in touch i need you to let me know no matter what he says youve got to tell me got it ive got it when i was out at the cottage there was something odd a statuette of a dragon looked like it was made of jade chinese by the look of it mean anything to you she shook her head do you think they stole it im pretty sure they did i dont know if thats why they think the devil himself is after them or not i really dont know but it would be a good guess where on earth would they have stolen something like that from i dont know but i maybe know someone i can ask chapter twelve surprising though it might seem i was the bookish type i read a lot i would read almost anything by anyone on any subject i only really drew the line as i had pointed out to devereaux at hemingway glasgow was the kind of city that liked to make a show of its knowledge the university was a collection of grand and imposing victorian buildings but the most strident statement of the citys erudition came copperdomed the mitchell library sat imposingly right at the heart of the city and was all corinthian pillars the original design of the building hadnt included the st pauls style dome but the city corporation councillors had insisted on it now the mitchell library shouted to the rest of scotland and the world see we do have books i waited in the main hall of the library a smallish man with prematurely greying hair approached me hello lennox he said and pumphandled my arm ian mcclelland was an enthusiastic kind of person his easygoing exuberance cheered me up every time i met him despite his impeccably celtic name mcclelland was an englishman from wiltshire who had taken the usual uppermiddleclass route of top public schools and cambridge he was probably the only person i knew who had any idea how to hold a fish knife what the hell he was doing in glasgow was beyond me mcclelland was a political science lecturer and specialist on the far east and wed met at a university function i had been conjugating verbs with a young female french lecturer at the time the romance hadnt lasted but the friendship with mcclelland had he dressed like an academic but didnt for some reason look like one on more than one occasion i had had suspicions that mcclelland who had spent a lot of time out in the far east had been at one time or another and to one degree or another involved with the intelligence services hows it going ian i asked in library tones corrupted any young female students lately only their minds old boy only their minds you said on the phone this is about a jade figure we had attracted the frowning attention of a couple of academic types at one of the desks bent over their research mcclelland steered me to another desk where he had laid out several reference books yes i said once we were seated ugly as sin all fangs and big staring eyes i think it was a dragon it seemed to have cloven hooves like a goat it was maybe a demon here i pushed the sketch i had done into his hands the dragon is a major folkloric figure in china mcclelland frowned as he examined the picture but what youve drawn here isnt a dragon its a qilin the hooves give it away giraffes hooves you say this is made out of jade unless the chinese make their gods out of green bakelite i can understand you thinking it was a dragon there are a lot of jade dragons about how tall did you say it was about a couple of feet give or take then it could be worth a tidy sum how much its impossible to say without seeing it it depends on the quality of the jade and that varies enormously and of course it is frequently faked if its real solid jade then a thousand maybe two was it a deep emerald green the light wasnt good i saw more its shape than anything but it was green i set my head to working again on what i had seen but my head was still taking a teabreak no maybe not emerald green paler milkier why imperial jade has a wonderful translucence and a deep emerald green colour its rare and extremely valuable but the piece youve described could be anything maybe not even jade he caught my frown not what you thought fifteen hundred quid isnt enough for the kind of grief this thing seems to have caused he shrugged is it stolen lets just say im trying to return it to its rightful owner in the hope itll get someone off the hook a very big very sharp hook mcclelland asked me if he could keep the sketch for a few days and i said he could the mugginess in the air hit me when i stepped out of the stonecooled interior of the library i found a call box and phoned the hospital but the officious nurse on the other end of the line said she wouldnt give me any information because i wasnt a relative of daveys i spent the afternoon nursing my headache and pondered whether i really should get my head checked out a couple of hours rest seemed to help it though so i decided to skip it i called police headquarters and got put through to dex devereaux hey there johnny canuck how ydoin devereauxs american accent seemed amplified on the phone fine i wanted to ask you something how much is each shipment largos been sending to the states i mean size or weight were talking about forty pounds a shipment thats not a lot in cash terms it is heroin is worth a hundredandfifty bucks a gram that works out at nearly five hundred dollars per pound weight each fortypound shipment largo sends over is worth twenty thousand bucks i dont know what that is in limey money the exchange rate i got was two dollars eighty cents for a pound sterling so work it out yourself this stuff is literally worth twice or three times its weight in gold so it would be reasonably easy to hide it in other stuff and lose it in a ships cargo manifest i said imagining a small rank of ugly jade demons i told you that already its like the abomb small package but big punch when it hits the streets what you got lennox maybe nothing a hunch thats all at the moment but i think part of largos last shipment was stolen by some of the local boys amateurs who are scared out of their wits it means i might be able to give you largo and some of the dope lennox if youre sure about this im not dex im not sure of anything like i say a hunch and it would waste your time chasing it if it turns out to be worthwhile ill hand over everything to you and you can lead the local police by the hand to make the arrests but i need to get someone out of the picture first thanks for the gen dex ill be in touch i hung up before devereaux could pressure me any more i was putting a picture together in my head and i needed to concentrate i also needed time to follow up a few things there was one thing getting in the way of everything small change macfarlanes murder it nagged and nagged at me and i couldnt work out why i had all but accused maggie macfarlane of a bedclothes entanglement with jack collins but i had no reason to imagine it as anything more than that i somehow couldnt cast jack collins as a smitten walter neff and maggie although she was a satisfying piece of art was no barbara stanwyck i had asked lorna as subtly as i could about insurance policies and a will both maggie and to a much lesser extent collins would benefit right enough but the lions share went to lorna under scottish law maggie as the surviving widow would have a reasonable case in challenging macfarlanes provisions but according to lorna who certainly was not free from suspecting her stepmother maggie had made no suggestion that she would but it all still bothered me im paid to stick my nose in more often than not im paid to stick it in where noses arent welcome my most irritating habit was sticking my nose in where it wasnt welcome when i wasnt being paid for it when i walked into the vinegarhill camp my nose had never felt so shunned i was seriously concerned that it was going to be put out of joint i had performed an act of faith parking the car in molendinar street trying not to think what odds tony the pole would give me against it being in one piece or even being there when i got back to it the traveller camp was set up on a barren grubby walled square entered by a double iron gate permanently open next to the sugar works there were a handful of modern touring cardrawn caravans but the vast majority were the traditional vardo or burton wagons painted horsedrawn jobs with arched roofs that went handinhand with everybodys romantic image of gypsies the rough humps of bender tents domed between some of the wagons there was no enticing odour of simmering goulash or impassioned violinplaying to accompany my arrival these travellers did not hail from the hungarian plain or carpathian mountains unless the hungarian plain and the carpathian mountains had a view of galway bay and the most romantic thing i saw were two unleashed mongrels copulating over by the works wall a handful of kids without shoes rampaged about the camp and i was aware that a couple of young men had moved in behind me as soon as i had entered the yard that would normally be my cue to reach for my sap but in a place like this with people like these it would have been an inadvisable move a painfully inadvisable move instead i would have to talk my way out of here like the cavalry captain with the white flag sent into the indian encampment to parley i strode across to where an older man leaned against a wagon smoking a pipe as i did so i passed a vardo wagon with the shutters drawn and deep crimson ribbons wrapped around the shafts and tongue im looking for tommy furies father i said when i reached the old man could you tell me where i could find him the baro what do you want with him who the fuck are you the old man stopped leaning and took the pipe from his mouth he spat a greeny viscous glob which splashed close to my shoe jimmy stewart or randolph scott were never treated like this like i said i want to talk to him and im pretty sure hell be very keen to talk to me now do you know where i can find him or not i was aware that the two youths had positioned themselves behind me at either shoulder the old man jerked his head in the direction of one of the modernstyle caravans the largest on site i nodded and walked over to it leaving my honour guard behind sean furie was a big man in his fifties he was tall and had probably been heavily muscled when younger but had turned to fat his full head of jet black hair was without a trace of grey and was oiled and combed back from a huge face he and uncle bert soutar had obviously gone to the same place for their nose jobs the difference with furie was that the tip of his nose was swollen and red and rivermapped with purplish capillaries romany rosacea i decided to call it the effects of bare knuckle and bare alcohol i told him who i was and what i wanted to talk to him about i braced myself for his reaction but it took me off guard anyway furie was remarkably softspoken and politely asked me into his caravan there was a distinctive odour inside the caravan not dirty or unpleasant just distinctive the caravan seemed huge in comparison to the vardos id seen outside it was woodpanelled and had a small kitchen a lounge and a room closed off by a door i assumed the bedroom lay through there sitting at the far end on a builtin sofa was a large darkhaired dolefullooking woman in her forties we sat and without word or glance she stood up and left the wagon squeezing past me to reach the door it was an accustomed exit it was clear that when furie had business to do the womenfolk left he offered me a whisky and i took it i saw some ribbons tied onto one of the wagons as i came in red ribbons i decided to be conversational it often paid to ease into the main business is that a celebration thing you could say furie gave a bitter laugh well have the same on this wagon soon when they hang my boy oh i see it symbolizes death explained furie and mourning red and white are the romany colours for mourning who died i dont know its a nachin family i dont know nachin scottish gypsy were minceir from ireland the travellers from england are called romanichals and the ones from wales are called kale but everyone here is either minceir or nachin i see i said i lit a cigarette and offered him one which he took but tucked behind his ear theyre going to hang my boy for something he never done mr lennox furie said in his soft brogue its a fitup thats what it is then youll see the red ribbons on this caravan tommy hasnt even stood trial yet mr furie far less been found guilty and sentenced if he didnt do it then theyll find it difficult to prove he did i lied well he never done it but thats just what you expect me to say anyway isnt it he said you think that id deny it even if i knew he done it were all liars and thieves after all isnt that right i didnt say that but you was thinking it anyway wasnt you as a matter of fact i wasnt i dont know anything for sure but theres something bothering me about macfarlanes murder maybe your son is being framed for it but if he is who by and how hes a traveller thats all the reason they need with the greatest respect no it isnt theres much more to this than your son being the wrong type in the wrong place at the wrong time what do the police say happened furie ran through it all tommy furie had been one of the boxers whom small change macfarlane had been involved with developing reading between the lines small change had been organizing bareknuckle bouts and running a book on them and it struck me that there was maybe another reason behind sneddon wanting me to find any hidden log kept by the deceased bookie i wondered who had started the regular bouts out at sneddons recently acquired dunbartonshire farm sean furie explained that his son had started to work as a sparring partner at a couple of the gyms and that small change had gotten him a number of legitimate ring fights small change was notoriously tight with his cash and there had been a dispute over payment for a bout tommy furie had complained to small change several times and in front of witnesses he was at the gym that night that macfarlane was murdered said sean furie it was one of his regular nights he got a phone call at the gym telling him to go up to macfarlanes house to collect the money he was due for the fight macfarlane phoned him i asked no it was someone who worked for him or so he said tommy didnt get a name or cant remember tommys a good boy but not too clever i see i said trying to hide my surprise at the revelation tommy went up to the house hed never been there before but had the address like so he went up got the tram there and back he said no one answered when he knocked but the front door was open he went into the room and found macfarlane on the floor dead tommys not as tough as youd think and he panicked on the way out he knocked over a lamp and picked it up to put it back so the police have his fingerprints on the lamp aye they have what else do the coppers say theyve got on him the tram conductress remembered him on the way back all agitated like and theyve got his fingerprints at the house in the room where macfarlane was murdered thats it its enough said furie to convict a pikey no its not what does the lawyer say to plead guilty so he doesnt get hung brilliant i shook my head i suggest you get another lawyer with the kind of thing i had planned the kind of thing that could end you up on the wrong side of a set of sturdy bars preparation was everything i had a small black holdall which i brought through to the living room and placed on the table taking a double page out of the glasgow herald i laid it out next to the holdall i put a set of heavyduty wire cutters a pair of black leather gloves and a black turtleneck sweater into the holdall i had two corks saved from empty bottles taking one at a time i lit a match and set light to them allowing them to smoulder for a good while before blowing them out and setting them down to cool in the meantime i placed the rest of my toolkit in the holdall a pair of black plimsolls a bicycle lamp a short crowbarstyle tyre lever and both my saps once the charred corks had cooled i folded them neatly into the sheet of newspaper and placed them in the holdall i paused for a moment to reflect on my highly professional selection of equipment if i were to be stopped by a policeman curious enough to look in my bag there was enough in there to get me a threemonth stretch for intent i had deliberately chosen a darker suit which was probably too heavyweight for this time of year but appropriate for what i had planned for later i had a lot of time to kill before i could put my plan into action but i had to load the stuff into the car now rather than have fiona white hear me leave the house in the dead of night i dumped the bag in the trunk of the atlantic and drove to the macfarlane place in pollokshields picking lorna up about seven i took her to the odeon cinema in sauchiehall street where we watched gregory peck in the million pound note a trip to the pictures may have seemed inappropriate but i was trying to take her mind off her troubles if only for a couple of hours lorna didnt say much before during or after the picture and thanked me politely without inviting me in when i dropped her off as i was leaving i noticed jack collinss lanchester parked in the drive willie sneddon was a man of habit exact habit sometimes peculiar habit i had arranged to meet with him at the victoria baths where he regularly took a steam bath and swim the victoria baths was a temple of sandstone marble and porcelain in the west end of the city it had a swimming pool beneath an italianate cupola turkish baths steam room massage tables and a lounge it was a private club but members could sign in guests a lot of the guests who were signed in here were corporation councillors and officials senior cops and the odd mp most left with their pockets heavy there were allegedly more planning permissions and public house and club licences granted here than in the city chambers i waited for sneddon in the foyer i never swam in the baths myself and certainly never in any of the municipal pools ever since i discovered that swimming pool and urinal are synonyms in glaswegian at least i had company while i waited twinkletoes mcbride was already there intimidating the staff and passing bathers it was purely unintentional and passive he was intimidating sitting down hows it going mr lennox he asked cheerily when he looked up and saw me then with an alarmingly sudden change to grave asked any news about wee davey they wont tell me anything because im not a relative but i went in to see him today hes bearing up you find out who did that to wee davey and ill sort the fuckers out mr lennox big toes too and dont worry ill do it gracious im sorry gracious twinkle frowned no charge ah you mean gratis aye that they have it coming what they did to davey was reppyhenstable i formed the word reprehensible in my mouth but kept it there there was no point in correcting him further and as id already mentioned to sneddon i was rather attached to my toes i appreciate it twinkle i said and smiled my pleasure hows everything else going twinkletoes was leaning forward elbows on knees turning his smile to me it was a huge wide smile in a huge wide head between huge wide shoulders twinkletoes was friendly bulk that could be turned into unfriendly bulk at the flick of a switch i heard you was going around with a posh bit of skirt he said for a moment i thought he meant sheila gainsborough then i twigged oh yes lorna macfarlane small changes daughter she does have a bit of class unusual around here a bit of class and a little sophistication i go for that in a woman aye personally i go for big tits and a fanny tighter than a fifers fist i didnt get a chance to frame an answer before the victorian stainedglass panel doors that joined the foyer to the main part of the baths swung open and sneddon in an expensive wideshouldered camel sports coat tieless and with his shirts top button undone emerged pinkfaced and flanked by another of his heavies sorry am i interrupting something he asked facetiously noticing that i was somewhat lost for words no i was just getting a few romantic tips from charles boyer here sneddon went across to reception and scribbled into the log that lay open on the desk ive signed you in he said lets go and get a drink twinkle you and tam wait here i wont be long sneddon led me through into a large clubroom it was the kind of place where they could have cut down on the decorating costs by simply wallpapering it with fivepound notes if anything it was more overthetop than the merchants carvery the furniture was all polished hardwood and leather and the velvet drapes were a deep crimson the walls were dressed in flock wallpaper burgundy red fleurdelis against cream damask so thick you could vacuum it a vast onyxtype marble fireplace dominated one wall i imagined that this was what hell looked like if you had a firstclass ticket sneddon led the way to a corner at the far side and sat down on twoandahalf cows worth of red leather i sat across the coffee table from him on the rest of the herd there were deep red velvet drapes behind us and i felt as if we were in a crimson cave listen mr sneddon youve hired me to do a job but you cant ask me to do a job and then give me only half the story youre holding back vital information i understand that youve got your interests to protect and there are some things id probably be better off not knowing but in this case it means ive been up more blind alleys than a blythswood square floozy i paused while a burgundyjacketed waiter came over with two malt whiskies on a silver tray i waited until he had gone before continuing the police have got tommy gun furie for small changes murder and it looks to me like a setup more than that it looks to me like a very wellthoughtout setup timing was everything with this tommy furie was summoned to macfarlanes by someone calling the gym he trained in someone knew he was going to be in the gym at that time on that night and that they could get a message to him my guess is that small change was still alive when they made that phone call and they only killed him after they knew furie was on his way which means they were pretty confident that they could reschedule the whole thing if they had to that would suggest that they were very familiar with small changes routine so why does this mean that ive been holding back on you are you saying i had something to do with small change getting topped no but i am saying that this appointment book you asked me to look for has nothing to do with bareknuckle fights big money bareknuckle fights and if im right then you have more to worry about than whether the police put you in macfarlanes house for a meeting tommy gun furie was one of the fighters macfarlane lined up for you and right now his own lawyer is telling him hell be lucky not to take a short walk to a long drop through a trapdoor in barlinnie prison hes going to tell the coppers everything he can to try to save his neck literally and somewhere along the line your name is going to come up the only way out of it is for us to find out who really did kill macfarlane and why sneddon looked at me with a steady gaze the steady gaze of a crocodile looking at an antelope okay he said at last there was some stuff i was trying to keep to myself but it doesnt get the pikey out of the frame if anything it points to him having done it small change macfarlane and me were in business together we were fixing up fights but not what you saw out at the farm the usual bareknuckle shite with a couple of fucking pikeys slapping each other around although youre right that small change helped me organize those too we had something different going on what sneddon didnt answer for a moment instead seeming to look around to reappraise his surroundings ive seen the way people look at me in here sometimes even when im walking my dog in the street where i fucking live they look away avoid looking me in the fucking eye they think people like me cohen and murphy are the scum of the earth we scare them but ill tell you this its them that scare me he paused when the waiter returned to our crimson cave to replace our empty whisky glasses with full ones you should see the socalled ordinary man in the street when people like me serve them up with what they want said sneddon when the waiter was gone theyre the fucking monsters i have an interest in a whorehouse in pollokshields not far from macfarlanes house discreet one of the girls got beaten up so fucking bad we thought shed die cost me a fortune getting her treatment without it being official you should have seen the fucker that did it to her a wee bald fat cunt that looked like he wouldnt say boo to a goose but when he was in there with the girl he turned into some kind of fucking monster you turn him over to the police the question was out and stupid before i thought it through aye right thats just what we done what do you think we done twinkletoes sorted him out with some transport a fucking wheelchair whats this got to do with your deal with macfarlane like i said you have no fucking idea what ordinary people want the worse it is the more they want you to dish it up to them youre not going to believe this lennox but i read a lot history that sort of shite i shrugged it didnt surprise me since i first encountered sneddon i had sensed a hidden dark intelligence about him the smart king i read a lot about ancient rome there was no difference between the caesars and rome and the kings and glasgow they even had a triumvirate three kings you can learn a lot from history i dont know i said personally i think theres no future in it sneddon didnt laugh not at my joke and not ever that i could recall ive read a lot about the colosseum it used to be packed right to the top ordinary people turning out to watch blood and death the fucking crueller the better do you know they used to make fucking children fight with swords to the death or that the comedy turn was to put blind people into the ring theyd slash and hack each other to bits but it would take a fucking age for one or both to die because they couldnt see each other and the public fucking loved it he paused to sip his whisky silversuited and manicured against the crimson of the booth he looked like a clubbable satan nothings changed he continued we started to draw in big money from the bareknuckle fights the more brutal the fight the bigger the crowd the next week so we started to put on special fights at special prices only regulars were invited to buy a ticket what made these fights special i asked though some horrible ideas had already flashed across the screen of my imagination they was noholdsbarred no weapons but apart from that everything was allowed kicking choking gouging biting it started off small then just got bigger and bigger the more blood the bigger the crowds and the higher the ticket price okay i said lets have it what happened someone got killed sneddon shrugged as if a human beings death was an inconsequence a pikey something happened in his head and there was fucking blood everywhere from his nose his ears even his fucking eyes let me guess he ended up catching a train i shook my head it had been there in front of me all the time sneddon made his usual crooked mouth shape to approximate a smile youre a smart fucking cookie arent you lennox you make all of the connections yeah he was the pikey that got mashed by the train so no ones the wiser thats where youre wrong i put my glass down and leaned forward theres a keenasmustard new pathologist on the job very keen on what they call forensic science he worked out that your pikey fighter wasnt some drunk caught on the rails even proved that hed been in a fight before he died so fucking what so youve got a problem or another problem the city of glasgow police are treating it as murder believe me theyd much rather have chalked it up as an accident but because of this sharp new pathologist they cant fuck sneddons face hardened which was surprising because there wasnt much scope for further hardening i knew we should have minced the bastard but i didnt want murphy knowing nothing about this i nodded hammer murphy one of the other three kings owned a meatprocessing plant in rutherglen it was well known that several bodies had been disposed of through the plants mincer the three kings had an agreement whereby murphy for a fee provided the same service for sneddon and cohen not for the first time i considered vegetarianism you should have told me all of this at the start i said it would have made things easier murder fuck and for once it wasnt sneddon shook his head selfcritically it was like watching a golfer who had missed what should have been an easy putt the thought flashed through my head that murderers maybe have a handicap system too you say he was a traveller i asked a pikey aye what about it well that means theres maybe no official records of his existence no birth certificate no war record no national insurance number no paperwork means he didnt exist officially and that makes it more difficult to tie him in with anything i think you sit this one out what about his family asked sneddon glumly theyre not going to go to the police id say it looks to me like theyve already said their goodbyes how the fuck do you know that asked sneddon you dont even know who they are when i called in at the vinegarhill site there was a vardo you know a gypsy caravan all dressed up with red ribbons deep red thats their colour for mourning not black of course it doesnt mean its your boy what was his name gypsy rose lee how the fuck would i know he was just a pikey go back to the fights what was small change macfarlanes involvement in them he set them up and ran the book on them for me he took a percentage of the winnings and i provided the venue and the muscle to collect unpaid bets he supplied the fighters aye kind of he arranged for them to be supplied the deal was he paid for that out of his cut sneddon sighed wearily it was bert soutar who found them for small change soutar for a second i was deafened by the sound of pennies dropping oh i see so bobby kirkcaldy had a stake in this too in the background aye kirkcaldys a good fighter and hell batter this kraut on saturday but when me and cohen put money into him we said he was to get checked out by an independent doctor turns out his hearts fucked arrhythmia they call it two three more big fights and then hell have to give the fight game up the board of control know fuckall about it like theyre not exactly on the ball but kirkcaldy likes having money so wherever theres a pie he has his finger in it so thats why he was so out of breath i said more to myself than sneddon remembering the toll kirkcaldys skipping workout had taking on him in his basement gym that would be why he had been doing so much training there instead of in the city gym no one to see him struggle for breath then kirkcaldy or bert soutar will have a name for the dead traveller i asked maybes maybes not i leaned back into the plush red upholstery and sipped at the whisky it all made sense so it didnt occur to you at all that it was the tailers who were making all of these symbolic threats pikeys because of the one that got killed no it didnt it didnt even cross my mind i find that very difficult to believe sneddon leaned forward as if about to share a great confidence with me id be very careful before you call me a liar lennox very fucking careful i said nothing for a moment doing the discretionvalour equation in my head so soutar supplied fighters for these contests and small change organized them and ran your book what about jack collins he was the real fight arranger as far as small change was concerned naw we did have dealings with collins but that was for proper boxing matches what i told you that night i hired you was true we was putting together proper bouts and running a few halfdecent fighters that was what collins managed and that pikey kid whos supposed to have done small change in he was moving up out of bareknuckle and was turning into a tasty boxer all thats fucked now anyway do you still have singer on bobby kirkcaldys tail i drained my whisky and stood up aye good he needs to be watched like a hawk where are you going ive got paperwork to do finding a place to park out of sight of the main road under a dank railway arch i sat for half an hour smoking and listening to the steel sounds of the clyde it was quieter and cooler during the night but the shipyards and repair docks never really slept this was no mans land between the tenements and the docks no one would come down here unless they had a reason that was both good and bad for what i had planned there would be very few people to spot my car tucked away from view but those few people would either be up to no good like me or trying to catch the uptonogood the last thing i needed was a patrolling bobby to happen across the atlantic a train thundered over the rails above me and its rattles echoed damply in the arch i put out my cigarette and took my stuff out of the trunk taking my suit jacket off i pulled the turtleneck jumper over my shirt and i changed my shoes for the plimsolls i unwrapped the charred corks from the newspaper and rubbed them all over my face if that patrolling bobby were to catch me now id have to convince him i was auditioning for a blackface minstrel show or face those three months in barlinnie locking up the car i pulled on my leather gloves and made my way out from under the arch i ducked behind a bush and watched while an elderly dockworker cycled along the cobbled road that lay between me and the bonded dockside area he pedalled so slowly that i wondered how he could remain upright with so little momentum carrying him forward after what seemed an age he disappeared from sight around the distant corner the streetlamps threw meagre pools of light onto the cobbles and i ran between them bent over across the road and down into the ditch on the far side i was about three hundred yards away from the gates and the watchmans shed when i took the wire cutters from the bag and snipped at the steel wire fence folding it back like curtains and crawling through hidden by the long uncut grass i made my way along the inside of the fence still keeping low because i would still be visible from the road until i reached the area where i remembered the nissen huts to be there was only one lamppost and the nissens loomed darkly with little to distinguish one from another i didnt want to use the bicycle lamp out in the open and it took me five minutes to find the sign barnier and clement the front door was reasonably solid but this was an office rather than a store and the padlock that secured the door fell away with a sniff of the crowbar i caught the padlock before it hit the ground and let myself into the nissen normally i would have switched the lights on a fully illuminated room attracts less attention than a torch flashing around but out here in the dark of the warehouse area switching the lights on would have been as inconspicuous as a lighthouse on a clear night the offices seemed pretty much as i had seen them when i had called and asked to see barnier i went over to the filing cabinets and was soon saying a little appreciative prayer for miss minto her filing was meticulous and easy to follow it took me only twenty minutes to find what i was looking for a ships manifest order and duplicates of a ships insurers claim form with a lloyds register stamp on it i smiled the last thing barnier would have wanted was for an insurance claim to be put in but this had to be seen as a scrupulously legitimate business i laid the manifest on the desk and shone the bicycle lamp on it running my finger down the list of items there it was as bold and innocent as could be item a viet kylan nephrite jade figurines crated destination santorno antiques and curios greenwich new york new york except there were only eleven now kylan when i had first turned up without an appointment miss minto had thought i was there about the key lan and they werent chinese they were kylan not chinese qilin they were viet from french indochina alain barnier was an established importer from the far east exactly the kind of link that john largo needed in his supply chain except now barnier was a weak link taking notepad and pencil from my bag i wrote down the details of the shipment put all the paperwork back in the files and the files back in the cabinet i heard a sound outside i killed the light from the bicycle lamp and crouched down grabbing my sap from the bag i scuttled under the lidded reception counter to the door there was a small window next to it and pressing myself against the wall i stole a peek through the window i saw the watchmans back as he walked through the pool of light from the lamppost and out of sight i waited for several minutes straining my neck to watch through the window before deciding it was safe to put my sap back in the bag go back to the files and switch the lamp back on barnier was my way to largo if i kept tabs on the frenchman there was a chance he would lead me to largo or at least take me a step closer i needed an address again i blessed homely unfriendly miss minto who had channelled all of the sexual and social frustration of the spinster into a fanatical efficiency her address book was not tabulated or indeed a proper address book instead it was a hardcovered notebook into which she had written all of the companys most important contacts it was impressively obsessive not a name was out of perfect alphabetical order barnier lived some distance out of town on the greenock road in langbank he was on the telephone and i noted both address and phone number i found myself wondering about the mysterious m clement and after i got the address of the barnier et clement french office in cours lieutaud marseille i looked up and found the name clement claude clement lived somewhere called allauch i wrote down both addresses and put my notebook back in the bag a worthwhile nights work it was just as i had put everything back in my bag that i heard the footsteps outside the door chapter thirteen i had already switched off the bicycle lamp and put it back in my bag i dropped down behind miss mintos desk and tucked myself into the kneehole there was no point in trying to go out through the door whoever it was i had heard was out there again i played out all my options in my head it could simply have been the watchman again making a second round of this part of the bonded area or it could have been that the watchman had noticed the missing padlock and twisted bar on the door and had called the police i slowly unzipped my holdall just enough to put my hand in and rummage around until i found my sap this was potentially a situation where i couldnt win if it was the elderly watchman id have to use my sap judiciously too hard a blow and id end up facing a murder charge added to which although i had an unpleasant propensity towards violence i avoided using it against the totally innocent if it turned out to be a copper then id have to hit him hard and run for it hitting a city of glasgow copper usually turned out to be a much more painful experience for the attacker the boys in blue liked to hold a little reception for you in the station allegedly it normally involved being stripped naked and wrapped in a soaking wet blanket for some physiological reason beyond my ken the wet blanket stopped bruising when twenty or so highland lads set in about you with their boots and truncheons the second painful element came judicially police assault usually combined a prison sentence with corporal punishment the birch you would be tied to a table and thrashed with some dried foliage quaintly traditional but incredibly painful i considered my options and huddled beneath the desk i heard the door opening a torch probed the recesses of the nissen hut for a moment it switched off and the neon strip light above me fizzed and crackled into life you was right billy the voice had a highland lilt to it a copper option two i guessed billy was the elderly night watchman someones broken the lock a pause i remained absolutely still beneath the desk controlling my breathing ignoring the thunder of my heartbeat in my ears all my time in glasgow i had avoided being charged with a criminal offence i would do time for this unless i dealt with the copper and the night watchman all right the unseen highlander called out into the nissen hut this is the police i know that youre in here no you dont i thought i could tell from the tone of his voice show yourself now and dont make any bother silence i sat tight and silent the sap was gripped so tight in my hand that i could feel the heartbeat in my fingers keeping time with the pulse in my ears come on now lets not be having any silliness again the voice had the sound of someone who thought they were speaking to an empty room i heard wood on wood the lid on the reception counter folding over he would be stepping through it his baton drawn scottish police batons were made of caribbean lignum vitae one of the densest and strongest woods on the planet bonecrackingly and muscledeadeningly hard whatever i did i was going to have to avoid a blow to the head i heard his boots now he was at the desk in front of mine he moved forward one step two his breathing slow and deliberate not frightened he moved something around a chair or something three four he was next to my desk but couldnt see me yet nothing looks like its been disturbed he said maybe you frightened them off billy dont look like theres anyone here now his boots ground grittily on the floor he was looking around himself dont look under the desk i beamed the thought to him whatever you do you big teuchter bastard dont look under the desk billy you go and telephone the number youve got for the proprietor he lilted ill stay here until he arrives all right iain ill do that an older voice eager acquiescent to authority good i thought one less to worry about but id have to make a break for it past the copper i heard the night watchman close the door as he left the copper was still standing there only inches away from me my mind sped through the options open to me barnier would take at least half an hour to get here but there was no guarantee that another copper wouldnt arrive in the meantime suddenly the desk above me creaked i almost bolted from my hiding place but kept calm he was sitting on the edge of the desk there was the sound of a match being struck then the smell of cigarette smoke i heard a muted ping a telephone being picked up dialling the unseen policeman asked to speak to the duty sergeant and told him that he was attending an attempted breakin and gave the address an attempted breakin the idiot hadnt searched the place properly but had decided there was no one on the premises i silently offered heartfelt thanks to the city of glasgow police for recruiting from the highlands my heart picked up a pace i knew that i had to act as soon as he put the receiver down he didnt think there was anybody here and i could catch him off guard but i was in the worst possible position from which to launch an attack i hung onto every word he said into the telephone all right sergeant he said i heard the bakelite clunk of the receiver in its cradle i was about to make my move when i heard the sound of pencils hitting the floor there was a creak as the cop stood up from the edge of the desk i guessed he had knocked the pencils off the table instead of rushing i eased myself out from under the desk making no sound i turned and straightened myself up slowly he was a uniform all right and he was bent over cursing poetically as only highlanders can gathering up the pencils he stood up again and turned towards me he didnt even have the time for surprise or shock to register on his face i fetched him a blow across his left temple with my sap and he dropped to the floor there was more calculation in that blow than einstein had put into the theory of relativity if i killed a copper then id hang and if they couldnt trace me some other mug would swing for it justice had to be seen to be done by the same token i needed him incapacitated long enough for me to make a getaway looking down i saw that he was stunned rather than out cold perfect i grabbed my bag vaulted over him and out of the door switching off the lights as i did anything to confuse my dazed sheepbotherer i saw billy the flatcapped night watchman illuminated by the single lamppost about a hundred and fifty yards off he froze when he caught sight of me i turned in the other direction and shouted to an imaginary associate already out of sight run jimmy its the watchy i yelled doing my best glaswegian impersonation i raced off towards where id cut the hole in the fence i lobbed my bag over and commandocrawled through the gap i had cut i checked behind me there was no sign of the constable and the elderly watchman would not risk chasing after two drumchapel desperadoes i sprinted along the cobbled road and dived behind the bushes next to the railway alcove one more check backwards nothing i took off the sweater and wiped my face with it getting as much burnt cork off as possible i threw my burglar kit into the boot of the car put on my suit jacket and jumped in behind the drivers seat keeping my lights switched off i reversed out onto the main road i drove slowly with the lights still off until i reached the end of south street only then did i pick up speed and switch the lights on i drove into the countryside and out of the city of glasgow police jurisdiction ironically i took the greenock road and passed only one car travelling in the opposite direction at that time of night it was no surprise that the roads were dead and i wondered if the car id passed had been barnier on his way in from his home in langbank an idea flashed through my head i would be passing langbank and it was the one time i knew for sure that barnier would not be at home and i did have all of my housebreaking kit with me i shook the idea from my head i had no idea if barnier lived alone or not added to which i had had quite enough jolly japes for one night i drove past langbank and turned south onto a single track road that led through woods and fields i found myself on the edge of a reservoir its silky still water reflecting the velvet clouds there was a farmhouse at the head of the reservoir and i drove along the waters edge until i was at the opposite end parking the car under some trees i made a pillow out of the sweater i had worn despite the discomfort and the adrenalin still pumping through my system i was asleep within minutes when i woke up i badtemperedly tried to plunge back into sleep and recapture the dream id had something about me and fiona white and a new life in canada or had it been me and sheila gainsborough the aches in my neck and the insistent jabbing of the handbrake in my side forbade my return to my dream i creakingly unfolded myself looking in the mirror in the too bright morning light i could see the burnt cork still ingrained in the creases and lines of my face i looked like i was wearing donald wolfits stage makeup rolling up my shirt sleeves i walked across the road to the reservoirs edge i scooped up some water and rubbed vigorously at my face and neck once i was sure i was clear of all traces of my nocturnal adventures i drove back into town as i did so i was pretty smug with myself it was no small thing to have clobbered a copper but i was convinced that by now billy the elderly night watchman would have sworn on his mothers grave that he had seen two burglars and one had been called jimmy the bobby i had tapped would only have gotten a fleeting glance of my corkblackened face and i was sure he would be only too willing to swear that there must have been two of them to take him down obfuscation could be such a satisfying pastime but the smug smile was wiped off my face as i passed my digs in great western road there was an immaculately polished black wolseley parked outside gleaming in the morning light i was particularly impressed by the super sheen the garage had managed to get on the rectangular plate across the cars radiator silver letters against a dark blue background spelling out the word police i drove on and around the corner until i reached the newsagents where i bought a copy of that mornings paper before driving back parking just around the corner i dumped my jacket in the car took off my tie and rolled my sleeves up i ambled towards my flat trying to look as casual as i could it was probably the innocent act that the coppers had seen a thousand and one times but i needed to make it look as if i had been at home all night and had just taken a morning stroll to pick up the paper it all fell down of course if the police car had been there for anything more than half an hour as i drew near both rear doors of the police car swung open superintendent willie mcnab emerged from one side jock ferguson from the other i put my best surprised face on which was probably as convincing as the last time i had used it when on my birthday my mother had presented me with the sweater id seen her knitting for three weeks gentlemen what can i do for you youre an early riser lennox said mcnab sourly you know what they say birds and worms and that sort of thing get in the car lennox mcnab stood to one side and held the door open i imagined it would be the first of many doors that would be closing behind me my mouth was dry and my heart pumped madly but i kept as much of an outer cool as i could can i get my jacket i jerked a thumb in the direction of my lodgings as i did so i could see fiona whites face at the window of her flat go with him mcnab said to ferguson who shrugged and followed me in whats this all about i took the opportunity of having ferguson on his own as we climbed the stairs youll see he said and i knew i would we didnt head towards police headquarters in st andrews square instead as i sat crushed between mcnab and ferguson in the back seat of the police car we headed out towards the river and the bonded warehouses where are we going i asked as if i had no idea we took a turn down onto the cobbled road and past the railway arch where id hidden the atlantic we didnt stop instead we drove on until we saw a uniformed constable with zebrastriped traffic cuffs over his tunic he seemed to be standing on an unbroken piece of grass verge but as we drew nearer he signalled us to turn in the barely discernible mouth of a largely overgrown cobbled access road just wide enough for the wolseley opened up for us and we bumped our way down to the shore the lane widened into an open area as we reached the water this had obviously been a working quay but the luftwaffe had made a good job of making it inoperable for the rest of the century vast concrete blocks like broken teeth thrust out of the overgrown grass rusting metal cable projecting twisted from their broken ends at one corner of the site an earthmover sat its shovel resting heavily on the ground on what looked like it had originally been the quays loading area four police cars and an ambulance which must have struggled to negotiate the lane huddled close to the water whatever this was it didnt look like it was about my breakin to barniers office mcnab and ferguson led me over to where the other vehicles were parked he was found here this morning by workers clearing the site for more bonded warehouses said ferguson we reckon hes been dead a day at least who whats this got to do with me i asked genuinely confused i saw that the rear of the ambulance was open and there was a body inside covered with a grey blanket lying on the ambulance stretcher whats it got to do with you mcnab sneered at me thats what i want to know according to our leads youve been looking for this fellah for the last week or so now he turns up dead my gut gave a lurch i did a little time travelling into the future and imagined myself in front of sheila gainsborough trying to find the words to tell her that id found her brother all right dead so john largo was no spook no shadowy figure without substance and he had caught up with sammy pollock at last mcnab pulled back the blanket you know him i take it you take it right i said with quiet resignation as i looked down at the body the quiet resignation was to disguise my surprise and my relief thats paul costello costellos eyes were wide open there were grains of dust and dirt on them and looking at them made me want to blink his face was bleached of colour and his hair dishevelled the paleness of his skin was in stark contrast to the vividness of the gaping wound that arched like a clowns smile across his throat he was very very dead why were you looking for costello asked mcnab he snapped the blanket back over the dead face his father jimmy asked me to i answered honestly if not wholly paul costello went missing a few days ago without warning and more importantly without cash aye said mcnab his voice loaded with suspicion inspector ferguson here said you told him that when he came up to see you with that yank devereaux thats right and that was because you were bandying the name largo about so tell me is this largos work dyou think i looked at the blanketdraped corpse i honestly dont know but if largo is as big and as dangerous a crook as dex devereaux seems to think then my guess would be yes aye well thanks for your valuable insight lennox next question who the fuck is this celebrity client of yours the relative of the other missing person i sighed like i told inspector ferguson i cant compromise client confidentiality client confidentiality my arse mcnab took a step closer to me i didnt need to look to know his hands had already balled into fists whatever happened here would be only the beginning if i tell you will you keep her out of it unless theres a direct involvement i mean mcnab laughed an ugly mocking laugh do you think that i have to negotiate with the likes of you lennox ill do whatever the fuck i want talk to whoever the fuck i want this is a murder enquiry you clown and then some lets face it superintendent someone is playing a very big game in this town bigger than anything the local talent is capable of putting on now you can walk all over me and feel like the big bollocks and ill do exactly what you want and walk away from the whole thing no skin off my nose but if we work together you could end up getting the credit for breaking the biggest case this citys seen in years remember that dex devereaux cant make the arrest here i looked meaningfully at ferguson yes jock i know devereauxs fbi i knew the moment you brought him into my place i turned back to mcnab im not being funny but this case involves things you dont understand you dont understand them because this kind of crap has never washed up in glasgow before okay here it is my client is sheila gainsborough the singer now you can let me deal with this side of it or you can dirty her carpet with your size tens but if you do then count me out im a policeman lennox mcnab looked at me as if inspecting something noxious that hed just scraped from his shoe doesnt that mean anything to you i dont have to wheel and deal with the likes of you ive got hundreds of officers i can rely on real policemen not canadian gobshites okay i said and shrugged your call just a minute jock ferguson stepped between us lennox has got a point sir and we dont have someone like him we can call on he works for fucking crooks for gods sake man how do we know that hes not delivering information to them instead of us i am working for one of the three kings i admitted but not on this on something else and the job im doing for him is legitimate private investigation work i know you have a low opinion of me superintendent i dont blame you sometimes i share it but im not a crook anyone who hires me knows i wont break the law for them i stopped it was a pretty speech i particularly liked the bit where id sworn my adherence to the law apart from the laws pertaining to breaking and entering and police assault that was sheila gainsborough mcnab asked how the hell did you get a client like that i move in the best circles mr mcnab now can i deal with the sammy pollocksheila gainsborough side of things mcnab examined me long and hard for the meantime lennox but just remember this is a murder investigation now i looked back at paul costellos body so i wouldnt be getting even with him after all im not likely to forget i said mcnab remained at the scene while jock ferguson and i got back into the polished wolseley squad car ill take you back he said ive got a stop to make on the way if thats okay im glad of the lift i said i didnt remain glad for long we only drove a little way along south street before turning into the gates that led to the nissen hut offices of various importers this wont take long said ferguson as we pulled up outside the office of barnier and clement import agents some stupid breakin i wouldnt be involved if it werent for the fact that some stupid flatfoot got himself clobbered no rush i smiled which was an impressive achievement because a small elderly man in a worn tweed jacket and a flat cap was looking at me through the rear window of the police car billy the night watchman stood rolling a scrap of tobacco in a cigarette paper even though i hadnt seen him close up i recognized his stooped frame and wide scruffy flat cap i hoped he wasnt about to return the compliment i was sitting in the back of the car with the uniformed driver in front it made me look like an arrested suspect i had been sure billy wouldnt identify me he had only seen me from a distance but with the visual clue of me seemingly in custody he might make the connection i think ill stretch my legs i said to the driver and stepped out of the car lighting a cigarette as i did so billy seemed to peer at me as if examining me more closely he walked across to me a little uncertainly the meagre rollup unlit between his lips at least he wasnt shouting for help from the police his eyes were narrowed under the brim of his scruffy flat cap excuse me officer he said would you spare me a light sure i said suddenly explicably cheerful i struck a match for him lots of excitement today aye he said with a bright mournfulness too much excitement for me what the breakin i asked aye those hooligans really clobbered yon young polisman did you see them aye but not good to tell the truth i forgot my spectacles brand new ones and all off the national health two pairs i got and the one night something happens that i need to see i leave the bastards at home he shook his head and i resisted the impulse to kiss him but i seen them all right running away two of them he leaned forward conspiratorially teddy boys them teddy boys is nothing but trouble them two was lucky i didnt catch up with them i smiled this time it was a genuine smile a heartfelt thankful joyous smile it had been one hell of a morning so far a rollercoaster of emotions everything that could have come along to shake me up had all i needed now was the copper i had sapped to turn up the blow to the head id given him somehow bestowing a photographic memory there again he was a highland copper a photographic memory is no good if theres no film in the camera but he wasnt going to turn up unfortunately as i looked over the cap of my new best night watchman friend i saw the next best thing arrive striding with resolute purpose up from the main gates and heading towards the offices a small but sturdily built woman with her hair in what could only be described as an aggressive permanent miss minto i could see her taking in the police cars and guessing that something had happened that threatened her little but jealously guarded realm of absolute order the last thing i needed was for her to spot me or casually ask in front of jock ferguson what i was doing there excuse me i said to billy turning my back to the approaching miss minto and ambling as casually as i could between the nissen huts as if i had been going around the back to check for damage i heard her determined steps behind me on the gravel then on the wooden steps into the office doing a swift about turn i flicked my cigarette away and headed back to the car it was now the best place for me to keep out of sight i just hoped that miss minto did not reemerge from the office and spot me in the police car leaning forward between the seats i rested my elbows on the seat backs and supported my head in my right hand hopefully concealing my face from the office doorway as an excuse for invading his territory i engaged the police driver in small talk it was an effort he was only marginally more chatty than sneddons mute bodyguard singer after what seemed an age jock ferguson came out of the office and over to the car sorry about that he said ill give you that lift now no problem i said cheerily i would have thought that by now you would be above investigating simple breakins jock ferguson shrugged the bastards clobbered a cop that changes everything no one puts one of ours in the infirmary and gets away with it quite right i said and tried to think ahead but not too far ahead chapter fourteen it took me a little while and another conversation with her supercilious agent before i finally arranged a meeting with sheila gainsborough telling her that the person her missing brother had gone missing with had turned up dead was the kind of thing you had to do face to face i met her again at her apartment she took it well or at least as well as it could be taken and much better than i had anticipated i suspected there was an element of blind wishful thinking on her part or maybe it simply didnt occur to her that her brother might be just as dead as paul costello but no one had found the body yet it was a thought that was never far from the front of my mind for my part i played it all down as much as you can play down a sliced throat it also didnt occur to her that eventually the police would want to talk to sammy it was only a matter of time and lack of results before they would start to look around for the most convenient possible suspect thats when sammys name would be pulled out of mcnabs hat and i would be elbowed out of the way i had things to do and places to be but i could see that sheila gainsborough was in a fragile state so i gave her all kinds of assurances that i would double my efforts now that the stakes were higher and that i would definitely bring sammy back in one piece making promises to women was something i did all the time especially ones like that where there was every chance i wasnt going to be able to deliver on it after i left sheila i went to a telephone kiosk and rang ian mcclelland at the university we did the usual banter thing and then i got down to business ian could you tell me what a baro is in a gypsy or tinker context gosh lennox its not really my field but i could check it out what was the context i was meeting with someone a gypsy and another gypsy referred to him as the baro okay i know someone i can ask said mcclelland could you ask the same people what significance a wooden box with pieces of wood and red and white wool might have as well about nine inches square id say i described the box lorna told me had been delivered to her father shortly before his death the wool was rolled up into a ball certainly old man in fact im just along the corridor from the very person can i call you back in ten minutes sure i said what about the description and drawing of the dragon i gave you as i thought its a chinese qilin actually youre wrong i sounded rather smug not a qilin its a vietnamese kylan if my informations correct probably is said mcclelland if he was impressed with my knowledge of the finer points of oriental mythology he hid it well it is a sinovietnamese character it looks fierce but its one of the good guys it brings you luck and wealth and looks after the good and the honourable i can tell i said my lucks been just dandy since i first saw him as good as his word ian mcclelland called back ten minutes later a baro is a clan chieftain he explained a real bigwig in romany circles and i hope you didnt find that box you were talking about the one with the wool in it no i didnt why its a bitchapen its a kind of gift but not the kind you want to get everyone in the gypsy tribe touches it and passes on everything ill or evil into it it rids them of illfortune but whoever finds the bitchapen gets the lot thanks ian i said that makes a lot of sense i met up with dex devereaux for a drink in the bar of the alpha hotel i told him about sammy paul costello claire skinner their little jade demon friend and the charming country retreat they all shared but for the moment i kept my suspicions about alain barnier and his possible connection to john largo quiet i had one very good reason to keep quiet the big american was a good guy but at the end of the day he was a copper the last thing i needed was the city of glasgow police connecting me with barnier they may not have been the brains trust but it wouldnt take much thinking to place me at the barnier and clement office on the night of the breakin with a sap in my hand and a semiconscious highlander at my feet maybe they would pick up billy the night watchmans glasses for him the city of glasgow cid must have had a leading neurologist working for them they had a remarkable record of suddenly curing witnesses of bad vision and unreliable memory after i said goodbye to devereaux i drove up to see lorna and check how she was again she responded as passionately as a bank manager and maggie macfarlane was positively frosty there was no sign of jack collins when i called lorna made some tea and we sat in the lounge drinking it me doing my best to say the right solicitous things and lorna remaining sullen and unresponsive her expression one of barely concealed resentment she knew i was going through the motions and would have given anything for a way out and we both knew that if the roles had been reversed she would have been the same neither of us had signed up for emotional involvement i spent the next two days keeping tabs on alain barnier because i had so many other things to juggle including squeezing in a daily visit to davey it was an inter alia kind of surveillance and therefore pretty hit or miss what made following the frenchman especially difficult was that he was hardly a creature of habit on average he would only spend two or three hours of each day in the office and not always the same two or three hours the rest of the time he spent doing his rounds of clients mainly hotels and restaurants wines and spirits were not his sole stock in trade he also did a fair amount of visiting antique dealers a handful in glasgow and several more in edinburgh following barnier was timeconsuming and seemed largely pointless but there was always the chance that he would lead me somewhere that would be one step closer to john largo although as barnier went about his mundane daily business i found myself doubting that this debonair cultured and educated frenchman could have anything to do with an international peddler of narcotics i was maybe getting cocky but i actually took to parking the atlantic under the same railway arch that i had used on the night of the breakin from there i could see the gates into the bonded area and pick up barniers simca whenever he left his office he emerged at threethirty in the afternoon leaving early was something he did quite often squeezing in a few client calls before driving home to langbank it may have seemed like a pointless exercise but i followed him anyway an ugly jade demon and a dead gangsters son were pointing me in that direction and then there was the gut feeling i had about the frenchman too i liked the guy but every time i thought of him it was like someone prodding something that had been curled up for a nap in a room somewhere at the back of my brain one afternoon i waited outside the bonded docks until about six when barniers simca pulled out through the gates i followed when he drove west towards greenock i guessed we were heading straight to his home in langbank i had to hold back as far as i could without losing him the road ribboned along the side of the clyde and despite this being the main road that connected glasgow with its satellite town greenock there were practically no other cars in either direction we passed the point where i had turned south and camped out in my car by the reservoir then surprisingly the simca drove past langbank and out towards the west i couldnt imagine what business an importer of fine wines and oriental curios could possibly have in greenock he drove towards the town and i lost him where the coast takes a sudden sweep southwards i accelerated a little and nearly missed his turning port glasgow had a vast sugar works and the hill above it had been named lyle hill why tate didnt deserve recognition was something i didnt know driving up the sweep of lyle hill i passed barniers parked simca i drove on not even slowing down until i was around the bend in lyle road out of sight of where he had parked i pulled over and took a set of binoculars out of the glove compartment i had to scrabble up the hillside to get a vantage point from which i could watch barnier the leather soles of my gibsons slipped on slimy grass and i came down onto my knees several times cursing the damp dark staining on my suit trousers glasgow was a city with a heavyindustrial attitude to everything and i had found out to my cost that laundries in the city approached the drycleaning of my best suits with a delicacy that make steelsmelting look like needlepoint i made it to the top of the hill and seemed to be on the edge of a golf course there was brush and some meagre trees to give me shelter and i looked down at where the road swept around the edge of lyle hill the view was breathtaking out across the clyde to the mountains of the cowal peninsula immediately below was greenock on one side and gourock on the other and further out the tail of the bank this had been the departure point for my parents when they took me as a baby to start a new life in canada but what struck me most about what i was looking at was the fact that barnier had stopped at the monument that commanded the best of the view the memorial was in the form of a vast white ships anchor the shaft of which thrust dramatically up into the sky but instead of having the usual rodeeye at the top the anchor shaft had two beams cross it one shorter than the other a cross of lorraine as a piece of civic sculpture it could not have been more dramatic and i knew something about what it commemorated i watched barnier it was difficult to tell if he was waiting for someone or if the monument had some particular significance for him he stood as if reading the inscription on the base then he turned and leaned against the border rail with his back to me and seemed to be gazing out over the firth of clyde he stood there for a good ten minutes before turning and heading back towards his car i cursed inwardly i had been sure he was going to meet someone and the monument seemed an ideal place for a rendezvous but i had probably just watched too many orson welles movies i scrabbled down the side of the hill as fast as i could to get back to the atlantic if barnier turned back down the hill then i would have to hurry or lose him as i scrambled fingers of tree branch snagged at my suit to impede my descent my hat came off a couple of times and it was only by some nifty goalkeeping that i saved my borsalino from the mud i burst out from the green web of bushes and onto the road a few feet from where i had parked the atlantic you see it all the time in westerns the settlers look up from the pass and spot the menacingly still and silent silhouettes of mounted apaches or banditos up on the hillside looking down on them the badlands port glasgow was scotlands equivalent of the painted desert and when i came out onto the road again there were three teddy boy comancheros waiting by my car my gut feeling was that there was nothing professional or organized about this encounter it had nothing to do with my tailing of barnier and was just your runofthemill scottish smallindustrialtown thuggery i reckoned that they were all about nineteen they clearly identified themselves with the emerging teddy boy fashion but none of them had been able to put together a complete assembly instead one wore the thighlength jacket one had drainpipe trousers and the jacketless third thug had had to settle for a bootlace tie between them they had enough oil in their hair to lubricate a battle ship and an array of skin conditions impressive enough to keep a dermatologist on a stipend this your car pal the youth with the teddy boy jacket asked he was clearly the leader maybe that was why hed got the jacket he was leaning against the wing of the atlantic and looked relaxed a bad sign confidence in any kind of physical encounter is half the battle the other two just looked at me with a dulleyed lack of interest as if this was something they did every day which it probably was yeah this is my car i sighed brushing the worst of the leaves and mud from my suit trousers weve been looking after it for you said one of the others i had to concentrate hard i hadnt brought my greenock phrasebook with me it had taken me years to understand the glasgow accent but greenock was beyond the pale i appreciate that i said with a smile i took my keys out of my pocket and headed to the door no rush now i was going to have to let barnier get away i had more immediate problems the leader in the edwardian jacket slid along the wing and positioned himself in front of the door well its like this you couldve come back here and found your tyres all flat and fuck knows what else but we was here to make sure nobody touched it so we think that you should maybes give us a couple of quid like his two mates took up position on either side of me squaring their shoulders not much to square yeah i said very enterprising of you but the trick is to ask for the money first einstein he furrowed his brow not anger just uncertainty about the insult i realized he didnt have a clue who einstein was i was going to have to learn to keep my references simple i sighed and reached into my pocket and the frown on his pimply brow eased it shouldnt have they were just kids i knew that and i didnt want trouble but i knew they would have beaten the crap out of me so they could empty my pockets and probably steal the car given half the chance in the army i learned that if theres a threat you have to neutralize it and id done more than my fair share of neutralizing so i decided to feel sorry for them later i drew the sap out of my inside pocket and again in a single continuous movement backhanded the lead teddy across the temple with it the youth on my right lunged forward and i jabbed out the hand i held my car keys in the key split his cheek and chipped against his teeth he screamed and staggered back clutching his bleeding face the third thug reached into his pocket and started to pull out a razor i swung the sap at him not taking time to aim properly by luck it caught him on the side of his weak chin and he dropped stoneout the first guy started to ease himself up from the ground and i dissuaded him with the heel of my gibson across his mouth the thug with the keyhole in his cheek was running back down the hill still clutching his face and crying pulling the lead hooligan out of my way i got into the atlantic and headed back down lyle hill halfway down i passed the running crying youth i rolled down my window and beaming a smile at him asked him if he needed a lift i guessed he preferred to walk because he just stared at me wildly turned on his heel and started running in the opposite direction back up the hill i pulled over to where barnier had parked the monument was set in a rectangle edged with railings and a gate repeating the cross of lorraine motif i got out and stood taking in the view for a moment before reading the inscription on the base of the monument this monument is dedicated to the memory of the sailors of the free french naval forces who sailed from greenock in the years and gave their lives in the battle of the atlantic for the liberation of france and the success of the allied cause on the other panels specific free french vessels were mentioned the submarine surcouf the corvettes alysse and mimosa but as everyone knew while the monument may have been officially dedicated to all of the free french sailors who had been based in scotland during the war it had a very special significance for a particular group of frenchmen and related to a particular event something that had happened before the free french forces were officially formed something that happened right here within sight of the spot where the monument now stood and alain barnier seemed to be connected to it i didnt see the road as i drove back to glasgow and i didnt think much about what had brought me to greenock someone was poking away again at that curledup sleeping thing and had switched on the light in the room at the back of my brain i saw a name maillebreze but the ghosts of dead french seamen werent the only things that were nagging at me i should have been happy that i had stopped beating on the three thugs as soon as they no longer represented a threat to me that i had displayed an element of restraint even a few months earlier once i had the advantage i would have given them a serious hiding a hospital hiding i should have been happy but i wasnt the truth was that i had still enjoyed it chapter fifteen it was a good seat it wasnt ringside it wasnt two three or even four rows from ringside but as i sat there in my black tie and tux i had a pretty good view of the fight even if i had an even better view of the back of willie sneddons head as he sat ringside with his guest a glasgow corporation councillor and head honcho of the planning department the only thing that impeded my view was the curtain of tobacco smoke that hung in the air it hung more heavily over the front two rows the cigar class rows i sat next to my dates sneddon had been able to swing an extra couple of tickets for me and i had done my own little bit of suborning hospitality jock ferguson was the kind of copper usually immune to inducement but he had leapt at the chance to see the title fight and it would do me no harm to patch up the bridge between us a little everyone knew because the movies told us so that the fbi was incorruptible and anyway dex devereaux was not officially a peace officer while on this side of the atlantic so he had nothing to lose by accepting my invitation it had been remarkably easy to get the tickets from sneddon as soon as i told him i wanted to sweeten a couple of coppers he handed over the tickets without a word of complaint i sat there and watched as the fighters schmidtke first then challenger kirkcaldy made their way into the ring schmidtke was a german and there remained a huge antigerman sentiment throughout britain but despite all of the problems of poverty sectarianism violence and drink that afflicted them glaswegians were a warm bunch i had been brought up in atlantic canada amongst open friendly people maybe thats why i liked it here in any case there was no booing or jeering when schmidtke entered the ring just a polite restrained applause there was an explosion of cheering and whistling as soon as kirkcaldy entered the ring there is no greater passion in glasgow than pride and kirkcaldy was their boy as the bout began i felt strange sitting there with the knowledge that only i sneddon and bert soutar had that kirkcaldy was stepping into the ring with a time bomb ticking away in his chest i watched him move fluidly and without effort just as he had the last twice i had seen him fight without a hint of any deficit of stamina it was not the most exhilarating of fights schmidtke seemed to be pacing himself and both boxers were outfighting each keeping his opponent at a distance and weighing up any potential strategic weakness it was not schmidtkes usual style and the second round was as uninspiring as the first both fighters seemed overcautious and unwilling to open up when the third round went the same way i could sense my fellow spectators becoming restless i could understand why kirkcaldy was circumspect about launching any kind of energysapping onslaught but i couldnt see why schmidtke was holding back unless schmidtkes thinking was that if it ended up going the distance there was always the tendency for a split decision to go the titleholders way but there again there was always the chance that kirkcaldy had come to an arrangement that would allow him to end his career with a championship belt it was in the eighth round that i guessed i had been wrong the german came out of his corner with the same tentativeness as in the previous rounds his head low and defence tight it was the simplest of errors kirkcaldy swung an uncharacteristically loose right it wasnt so much that kirkcaldy telegraphed the hook as announced it with a goldedged invitation complete with the times for carriages the german answered the rsvp with an arcing hook that hurt me just to watch it connect it lifted kirkcaldy off his feet and he shoulderslammed the canvas half of the spectators including jock ferguson leapt to their feet and there was a deafening explosion of shouts the referee backed the german towards his corner with a hand to the chest and started counting out kirkcaldy the scotsman shook the crap out of his head and stood up swiftly bouncing on the balls of his feet and nodding to the ref once youd kissed canvas if you wanted to avoid a technical knockout you had instantly to convince the referee that you were okay usually with an overdone display of bright athleticism the ref backed kirkcaldy into a neutral corner and checked his eyes before retaking the centre of the ring and indicating with a gesture like drawing curtains for the fighters to come together and recommence the match the germans massive shoulders dipped and rose as he came out of his corner there was a new energy in them kirkcaldy tried to outflank every new attack but the german just kept driving him into the ropes raining in vicious hooks i could see it now kirkcaldys face was pale almost white the lividity of the bruises around his eyes stark against his whiter skin he launched an attack to drive schmidtke back but the german stood planted rooted to the canvas his bulky arms working like pistons driving one blow after another into kirkcaldys body again it was clumsy schmidtke caught kirkcaldy a legal hairs breadth above the belt kirkcaldy dropped his elbows bringing his guard down two successive jabs to his face followed by a vicious ugly bolo punch stunned the scotsman then schmidtke made his delivery the dazed kirkcaldy was probably the only person in the auditorium who didnt see it coming every single ounce of schmidtkes weight behind a roundhouse right that seemed to take an age to connect but it did right on the side of kirkcaldys jaw and the scotsman went limp and crashed into the canvas the german had his hands above his head grinning a gumshield grin and jumping on the spot before the referee had finished his count everybody was on their feet shouting cheering and some booing now less with hurt nationalistic pride and more with suspicion that they had just been witness to amateur dramatics instead of professional boxing i stood too but i wasnt applauding i was watching the referee uncle bert soutar and a fat middleaged man in a dinner suit and with a leather gladstone bag crouched over kirkcaldy even the german had stopped his triumphal dance the noise of the crowd was still deafening but i felt as if a curtain had been pulled between me and them as if i was the only person really seeing what was happening in the ring christ hes dead i said my voice so drowned out by the crowd that i barely heard it myself waddya say dex devereaux shouted still clapping leaning in towards me i still watched the scene in the ring bert soutar and the doctor were now helping kirkcaldy to his feet kirkcaldy nodded vaguely to them and schmidtke with a relief i could feel four rows back embraced his defeated opponent kirkcaldy was helped from the ring to the cheers and jeers of the spectators after the fight dex devereaux jock ferguson and i made our way to the exits i had hoped to talk to willie sneddon but id lost sight of him my guess was that he would not be a happy bunny no matter what other schemes kirkcaldy had come up with and cooperated with he had cost sneddon money costing sneddon money was not something it was advisable for anyone to do i did see tony the pole though i excused myself from ferguson and devereaux for a moment whaddya say whaddya hear tony i said smiling tony didnt smile back iz a fugging dizgraze lennogs he said gloomily ignoring our traditional greeting a load ov fugging bollogs whit vaz zat like not a good night for you tony ziz fuggin carryon haz cost me a fugging vortune i suppose none of the local bookies will be happy with this result naw youd be zurprized lennogs not everythink iz vat it zeems zeres at leazd vone baztart iz goin home happy what do you mean i asked almost yelling to be heard but tony the pole had been collared by a punter energetically waving a betting slip azk jack collins aboot zat aye you go an azk jack collins tony called before turning his attention back to his punter i left him to it and rejoined my guests i took ferguson and devereaux to the horsehead bar it was well past closing time and ferguson made a point of finding interesting something far off and down the street while i gave my coded knock there were as many as twenty regulars inside the pub big bob was on the bar were not looking for waiters lennox he said grinning inanely and taking in our dinner suits and black ties whatll you be having then you know inspector ferguson dont you bob i asked bob eyed ferguson and sighed on the house obviously i indicated a quiet table in the corner for ferguson and devereaux to take their drinks over for fucks sake lennox said bob when they were out of earshot who the fuck you going to bring next the chief constable i wouldnt do that bob i always take him to the saracens sword classier joint anyway i thought this was the nightshift canteen for the city of glasgow police aye a dozen or so bluebottles who think their uniform entitles them to limitless free fucking beer if i start on the management ranks itll be handouts as well and ill be truly fucked dont worry bob i said ferguson is a straight copper aye theyre the ones youve got to watch aint that the truth i thought as i took my drink and joined devereaux and ferguson in the corner so said devereaux what did you think of the fight i really thought our boy would have given that kraut bastard a run for his money said ferguson but it was a bit of a walkover in the end you devereaux nodded in my direction what did you think lennox i shrugged you never can tell with these things really said devereaux i think someone could tell the way that fight was going to turn out a fix ferguson looked up from his beer you think it was rigged four five rounds of dancing around each other then the doors left open for a couple of killer punches you bet it was rigged said devereaux but kirkcaldys on his way to the top everyone thought he had a good chance of picking up the european belt tonight why would he throw a fight devereaux shrugged maybe theres something we dont know about him maybe he owes money maybe he hasnt got the future everyone thinks he has devereaux seemed to examine me for a moment youre not saying much me nothing much to say dex im a bit pissed off that the fight was such a disappointment thats all after a while we got off the subject of the fight which i was thankful for that little nugget of exclusive knowledge about kirkcaldys heart condition kept rolling to the front of my mind and from the front of my mind to the tip of my tongue was a short trip especially when id tied on a few i wasnt thankful for long devereaux leaned forward and spoke to me in low tones when ferguson had gone to the toilets jock told me that theyre giving you quite a bit of licence with this costello killing said devereaux how much do they know about it being tied in to john largo nothing i dont know for sure that it is it was the worst kind of lie an obvious one and devereaux gave me a look i sighed okay it could be that largo killed costello or had him killed but i want to get my clients brother out of this like i said then ill give you largo on a plate once i have sammy ill get him to talk hes my our best hope of getting largo okay lennox anything you say whats that meant to mean it means youre holding out on me am i what alain barnier that stopped me in my tracks thankfully it was at that point that jock ferguson reemerged from the toilets we ready he asked devereaux drained his whisky were ready it had been raining while we had been in the horsehead the stonework and the cobbles on the street outside were the oilsleek black of a glasgow night i had arranged to give jock ferguson a lift home ill drop you off at your hotel first i said to devereaux its okay he said squeezing his considerable bulk into the confines of the atlantics back seats ill come along for the ride see a little more of glasgow by night it was a fait that could not have been more accompli i shrugged and dropped in behind the wheel jock ferguson normally on the lugubrious side of funereal was positively chipper on the journey back the evening and the drink had combined to open a door in his personality i wondered if that was who ferguson had really been before the war and i wished i could find as easy a way back to my prewar self there again the bottle was the key most men used after we dropped ferguson outside his anonymous semi dex devereaux swapped seats and took the front passenger seat okay johnny canuck lets go for a drive he said cheerlessly the rain started again intermittent thick greasy globs on the windscreen the streets were empty of cars and our only obstacle on the way back to his hotel was a drunk in the middle of the road one foot anchored as if glued to the asphalt i gave him a blast of my horn but he waved his arm vaguely and cursed incomprehensibly at me i swerved around him and drove on this town sure has an interesting relationship with booze said devereaux then he sighed i suppose if most of the crime you deal with is related to drunks then it doesnt stretch the grey matter and these guys here i mean the city of glasgow police and no offence to jock ferguson but these guys arent the brightest of cookies ive made the same observation myself in the past i said keeping my eyes on the road why dont you say what it is you want to say dex okay like i say these guys arent big thinkers if they were i reckon youd be in a lot of trouble by now and why would that be come on lennox devereaux laughed paul costellos body is found half a mile away from a breakin and they dont even think to see if its connected do you know the kind of beating youd get if these guys found out you tapped that uniform if youre so convinced i did why dont you tell them listen lennox if you get antsy with me i might do just that but im not interested in giving them you im interested in you giving me largo i dont have him to give i said we were on a quiet street and i pulled over to the kerb yet said devereaux yet i sighed and rested my wrists in the basin of the steering wheel but youre getting close and you should have told me about barnier you seem pretty well informed without my help ferguson told me about the breakin actually he was being a gripey pain in the ass about it he said it was a french importer with an office in marseille who got broken into you see its difficult for these guys to hold two thoughts in their head concurrently they need a liedown if they hold them consecutively i said well the only thing theyve got stuck in their heads is that a uniformed cop got cracked across the head this town isnt so different to the states theres a blood price to be paid if a cop gets hurt but like i say they cant see past that no one is asking why the hell someone would break into an importers office where theres nothing to steal except paperwork in the middle of a bonded warehouse area filled with whisky luxury goods cars and god knows what else maybe theyd run out of paper clips and the stationers was closed cut the crap lennox or i might just begin to feel the need to pay some professional courtesy to my glasgow colleagues what have you got on alain barnier i think hes a front for your boy or at the very least hes behind the murder of paul costello directly or indirectly costello and sammy pollock have stolen at least one of a consignment of twelve jade statuettes my guess is that each statuette is packed with happy snow for your harlem negroes how did you find out about the statuettes i told devereaux about my trip to the disused farm cottage the jade demon and somebody probably the recently deceased paul costello putting the lights out for me thats why i turned over barniers office and i was right i found the manifest for twelve vietnamese jade demons vietnamese devereaux turned in his seat pivoting his shoulders around yeah so what indochina is the source of the heroin thats turning up on the streets it could be that your frog barnier doesnt know what hes shipping its likely the heroins been packed into statuettes at source maybe barnier has just been asked to ship these things not knowing whats inside them id like to think that i said but for a wine merchantcumcurio importer alain barnier is pretty handy in a fight i told devereaux about what had happened outside the merchants carvery ive been following him for the last day or two and and nothing the only thing remotely illicit ive caught him doing is visiting a married woman in bearsden while her husbands at work devereaux sat quietly for a moment you say he has a history of importing from indochina as far as i know yes then he must have strong connections and contacts there the place is a mess the french have fucked up good dien bien phu has been a disaster a turning point the french are going to clear on out of it you know i guess and when they do the commies will take over the french are going to leave the back door wide open for them its a long way away dex i said its a french colonial problem not now now its our problem theres going to be another korea out there take my word for it in the meantime its chaos and chaos is the best environment for someone like john largo to operate in but you dont think barniers directly involved i didnt say that it could be that he doesnt know what hes shipping or it could be that for all we know alain barnier is john largo its unlikely i said barnier is established here the other thing is he looks too much like an international criminal mastermind the sharp clothes the french accent and the goatee beard i think john largo would keep a lower profile so dont i said devereaux then grinned at my puzzled expression youll have to learn vermontese its what we say when we mean so do i you know the other thing it could be maybe john largo is like robin hood a kind of composite character maybe john largo is more an organization than a criminal maybe barnier is part of john largo he has a partner a guy called claude clement here i took my notebook from the side pocket of my dinner jacket and copied the addresses onto a blank page tore it out and handed it to devereaux i found that when i was stealing paper clips maybe barnier and clement are in this together so what now ill get onto washington see if weve got anything on barnier or this other guy in the meantime i suggest you keep tabs on him i also suggest you give me everything you get as soon as you get it otherwise i might just offer mcnab or ferguson my professional insight into who clobbered their beat boy and remember ive still got a thousand dollars if you lead me to largo dont hold out on me again lennox there is one more thing i said i had just remembered it myself taking out my notebook again i scribbled a second note and handed it to devereaux thats the address in new york the jade demons are being sent santorno antiques and curios thanks he took the note and put it in his pocket without looking at it we didnt talk much after that i drove him back to his hotel and waited to make sure he got in it was three in the morning and it took an age before an elderly night porter opened up for him devereaux turned and gave me a half wave half salute and disappeared into the hotel i sat for a moment staring at the closed oak door i had given devereaux everything almost everything i hadnt mentioned the visit to the free french naval monument it probably wasnt anything but i needed to check it out for myself first i was deep tired tired to the bone there were so many thoughts buzzing about my head but my brain had pulled the shutters down and turned the sign around on the door thinking would have to wait until morning chapter sixteen first thing the next morning i made another trip to the mitchell library this time it wasnt to meet with anyone i was looking for a very specific piece of information i was aided in my search by a rather accommodating librarian who fell for my helpless hunk act she was a brunette about thirty and was dressed in a vaguely bohemian way or as bohemian as the formality of the city library would allow with her dark hair loose i had spotted her from across the main library she had been supporting an impressive array of heavy reference books in her arms and in turn supporting an equally impressive bust on the books she looked to me like a freethinking type i found an openminded attitude an asset in a woman we hit it off right away it could of course have been our shared bibliophilia but my guess was it was more likely to be my very obvious and profound appreciation of her best assets in any case her cooperation made my search faster and more efficient than if id stumbled around myself it took me fortyfive minutes to compile the newspaper articles service reports and casualty lists that i needed of course there were details that i couldnt get to britain was a secretive state and nearly ten years after the end of the war there were details of the conflict that remained locked away in whitehall basements where they would remain for another eighty years at least but i found enough to be getting along with i also managed to get the home address of my brunette research partner as well as very specific times i could call along with the vaguely bohemian dress she wore a wedding band on her left hand i guessed her husband was neither bohemian nor openminded she left me at one of the desks with all of my research materials i was focussed on one event and i spent two hours going through newspaper accounts and official reports on the disaster but it was the casualty lists and service lists that interested me most finally i found what i was looking for alain barnier had been a junior officer on the maillebreze it would explain the frenchmans attachment to this part of the world it would also explain his visits to the memorial on lyle hill but as i looked at barniers name on the page it left more unexplained than explained i read through back issues of the greenock telegraph covering the earlier years of the war there had been a lot of french sailors stationed in the area during the war and i scanned every mention of the french forces they were mainly the usual flagwaving forgetnapoleonwereallpalsnow pieces the scots had a very different relationship with the french than the english had there had been the auld alliance the francoscottishnorwegian treaty that had preceded the british act of union and to which the scots romantically attached great importance the relationship between the french sailors and the locals had been generally positive there was certainly not going to be anything negative said about it in the wartime press but i did find something significant in the court records three greenock dockyard workers exempt from military service because of their reserved occupation had appeared in the towns sheriff court charged with breach of the peace assault and police assault apparently the three locals had been involved in a melee in the town the local police and provosts of the gendarmerie maritime had had to break up a major brawl that had spilled out of a greenock bar and into the streets the date was significant july two days after the british royal navy had attacked the french fleet at merselkebir to stop the ships falling into german hands ten ships had been sunk and nearly french sailors killed it had been a diplomatic disaster and had left the french asking with friends like these it didnt take massive skills of deduction to work out that tensions had been high and some loudmouth must have said something to get a fight started between the french sailors and the locals of course it didnt need to be that in the west of scotland you didnt need much of a reason for a fight and seeing as many of the local girls had earned with much enthusiasm the epithet of matelots mattresses the good old standards of sexual jealousy and booze were always available for the potentially pugnacious i was about to move on when a statement by one of the witnesses drew me back into the report a group of french sailors had found themselves surrounded by a mob of locals they were rescued by a group of local police and french naval provosts made up of naval gendarmes and fusiliers marins the witnesss statement described how some of the french provosts had used some kind of fancy footfighting to drive back the crowd i asked my librarian if she could photostat the report for me and after a little gentle persuasion and much lennox charm she agreed but i would have to pay for the materials and call back for the prints it was nearly lunchtime and i made my daily trip to see davey at the hospital his face was becoming slightly more recognizable but if anything he seemed less chipper than he had been right after the attack after youve taken a beating it takes a while for the pain to settle itself in to find the little corners it wants to occupy to soak itself deep into your muscle and bone usually it invites shock and depression as roommates it was clear that young davey wallaces broken body was now fully let it suddenly occurred to me that i had been so obsessed with what had happened immediately before the attack on him that i hadnt asked davey if anything unusual had happened earlier in the day during his watch did you find my notebook mr lennox davey asked through his cage of wiredshut teeth that was another thing to dampen your spirit a week or so after a beating having to be fed through a tube because your teeth are wired shut whoever had done this to davey had opened an account with me and i was due them a lot of interest no davey i said there was no sign of it where the car was parked ive been thinking about that notebook mr lennox i have a lot of time to think here i dont lose things im very careful that way even with what happened to me in all of that confusion that notebook was in my jacket pocket it should still be there and its gone now whoever duffed me up took it i think i saw something or someone that i didnt take seriously and they thought id made a note of it what ive been racking my brains about it its been doing my head in davey paused to wince some pain somewhere inside had moved about a bit just to remind him of its tenancy like i said ive had lots of time to think about it but nothing special happened that day the only thing that came to me was the car that i saw someone who went into kirkcaldys place i asked i lit a cigarette and held it to his lips no two people in the car but i didnt really get a look at them just a glimpse of the driver as he passed i thought they were going to park and go into mr kirkcaldys house but the car drove on by i know its daft like but i got the idea that they maybes saw me parked and watching the house and decided not to stop its not daft davey its instinct if dex devereaux was here he would tell you that every detective every fbi man needs it did you see what make of car it was i dont know much about cars said davey melancholically again as if he had let me down makes and that but thats why i was asking about the notebook i wrote down the registration number it was a big car but fancy like what colour was the car red said davey deep red a sort of winey colour burgundy sorry i dont know is that winey colour do you know what a lanchester looks like or a daimler conquest sorry mr lennox like i said i dont really know anything about cars thats okay davey youve done fine just fine i have a hunch about who it might have been in the car and it is important thanks youve been a big help i left davey his mood lightened by my praise i dialled lorna from a pay phone in the hospital her tone remained distant and cool but i tried to sound as chatty and informal as possible hiding the real reason for my call a casual question camouflaged in the deep foliage of small talk no she said in reply jack isnt here at the moment he doesnt spend all his time here you know have you any idea where he might be i dont know at work probably he has an office above the boxing gym in maryhill why whats the sudden interest in jack nothing i bluffed i wondered for a second how many boxing gyms there could be in maryhill i just wanted to talk to him about the fight last night i moved the conversation on to how she was and if she wanted me to come up to see her that night she said she was having an early night the doctor had given her something to help her sleep maybe that explained i thought why lorna had begun to sound so distant but her coolness was more than pharmaceutical maybe i was losing my touch how women once exposed to my charms could then go on to resist them had always dumbfounded me but somehow they seemed to manage just fine its odd how things just seem to come together red ribbons tied to a gypsy vardo wagon an offthecuff remark made by tony the pole the colour of a car remembered by davey wallace a reference to a fusiliers marins officer in a greenock court report a guardedness in lornas answer i was spreading myself too thin working two cases at the same time both of which had grown into something much bigger than it had first appeared to start with i had thought that finding sammy pollock was going to be a straightforward job and not interfere with my getting to the bottom of the bobby kirkcaldy thing but i should have known that nothing in this life is straightforward the truth was that i had suspected for a while that there had been some kind of connection between them there was an oddly coincidental chronology here sammy pollocks disappearance had been coincidental with two things the theft of one or more of alain barniers jade kylan demons and the untimely demise of small change macfarlane willie sneddon was the kind of man my dad would have described as so crooked theyll dig his grave with a corkscrew and i still had reason to doubt that sneddon had told me all there was to tell about his involvement with bobby kirkcaldy but i had no reason to doubt the truth of what he had told me and that included the fact that somebody or something had terrified small change macfarlane immediately before sneddon had met with him that day now for me a coincidence was kind of like socialism a nice idea looks good from a distance but when you get up good and close you cant really bring yourself to believe in it i was pretty convinced that macfarlanes murder was connected to at least one of the cases macfarlane was a backroom player a money man with his finger in almost as many pies as sneddon but unlike sneddon macfarlane could get his fingers burned there was a picture coming together in my head like a picasso it was pretty ugly jumbled and didnt make any sense to me my immediate and main problem was how to keep tabs on two pilgrims at the same time alain barnier and jack collins then i had an idea but first i needed to speak to collins it was basically two small offices on the upper floor of a twostorey building the lower floor devoted to a boxing gym it was an older building that was crumbling a bit around the edges i passed the door to the gym and climbed the stairs to the offices when i walked in i was greeted by a secretary who i guessed hadnt been hired for her shorthand skills her hair was the kind of blonde that comes out of a bottle and her figure was the kind that comes out of a teenagers wet dream she parted crimson lips and flashed white teeth at me and showed me into the inner office jack collins sat behind a desk and a dense screen of bluegrey cigarette haze when i went in he had been running a finger down a ledger column and yanking at the crank handle of an adding machine he was in shirtsleeves his cuffs kept clear of ink and paper by arm garters positioned above his elbows and just beneath his biceps seeing jack collins close confirmed my first impression of him he was smooth expensively tailored and groomed to an exceptional degree for a city where panache was defined by beating the coal dust from your flat cap before you took a girl up a darkened alley he was a lean man his face long and his features elegant if a little too fine his thick black hair was immaculately combed back from a broad tanned brow and he sported a pencil moustache that was so neat that he must have trimmed it on the hour someone to see you jacky said the blonde secretary over my shoulder senga he said wearily looking past me how many times have i told you to get their names first im lennox i said helpfully i know he replied looking back to senga and making an impatient gesture of dismissal its okay you go back to whatever it is you have to do close the door behind you sorry about that he said im training her up at the moment i can imagine that would be taxing i said and sat down opposite him he stubbed out a cigarette and lit another immediately sorry he said and pushed the packet towards me help yourself no thanks i said and took my cigarette case out and lit one of my own i dont smoke filters theyre french arent they i nodded to the ashtray bristling with filter stubs each had two bands of gold around them yes montpelliers i dont usually smoke them but i got a job lot from an importer friend of mine youre the chap whos been seeing lorna arent you your halfsister yes he stared evenly at me cool and unruffled you know about that that youre small change macfarlanes son im sorry but its not the big secret you think it is half of glasgow knows i see what can i do for you mr lennox still relaxed collins was either extremely cool or he had been expecting my visit ive been looking into a few things concerning bobby kirkcaldy i thought you might be able to cast some light on them really why me you know something jack do you mind if i call you jack you know something jack im quite a philosophical cove i reflect on the nature of things one of the things ive been reflecting on is the nature of coincidences oh he put on an unimpressed act or maybe it wasnt an act yeah just like nature abhors a vacuum i abhor a coincidence i said what kind of coincidence do you have in mind well for a start you are the semisecret and completely illegitimate son of small change macfarlane the population of this city is over two million yet your fathers murderer just happens to train in the gym downstairs in fact his defence is based on the claim that he got an anonymous telephone call to the only place with a phone where he could be reached in the gym downstairs and then theres bobby kirkcaldy whos famous for his rigorous training regimen and where does he train in the gym downstairs then of course theres the fact that every bookie in town is smarting because bobby kirkcaldy folded in the middle of a fight that he was expected to win easily every bookie that is except you im not a bookmaker not officially but you and small change had a real macfarlane and son thing going im guessing that youve taken over his book thats why there was no paperwork worth a damn for the police to find my god you must have moved quickly and i have to say your grief over your father didnt impede your business acumen did it youre becoming very offensive mr lennox and what makes you think that i didnt lose out everybody expected bobby kirkcaldy to walk that fight a friend of mine seemed to think that there was someone in the know someone who didnt so much hedge his bets as get capability brown to landscape them you shouldnt believe everything tony the pole tells you said collins with a sneer he was a bright boy right enough i dont understand everything that tony the pole tells me and before you go pointing fingers i did a lot of asking about and everyone says it was you who scooped on the fight there are a lot of fingers pointing at you what is it you want from me lennox he leaned back in the chair elbows resting on the arms slender fingers interlocked beneath his chin a pose of contrived concentration what i want is to know what exactly you small change and bobby kirkcaldy have gotten yourselves involved in i was hired by willie sneddon to find out who was trying to intimidate kirkcaldy and to look after his investment now after that sham last night it looks to me like whoever it was succeeded and sneddons investment has gone down the pan either that or a deal of some kind has been done to get you all off the hook what i want to know is with whom collins watched me as i talked still cool and unflustered i had to resist the temptation to walk around the desk and kick the chair from under him if what youre saying is true whats it to you why should you care youve run your errand for sneddon fights over the outcome is what it is whether sneddon likes it or not well first of all i have a funny feeling that it wasnt some disenchanted gypsy brawler who killed small change secondly even though you seem to be taking it remarkably well the bottom has fallen out of lornas world and i feel i owe her something and thirdly i stood up and leaned knuckles on his desk pushing my face towards him and this is the thing that really riles me theres a kid lying in the southern general taking his lunches through a straw all because there was a chance he saw you arrive to talk with bobby kirkcaldy and thats where it gets puzzling it was no secret that kirkcaldy and small change did business and you were small changes partner in at least one enterprise so what im wondering is who was in the car with you and why he didnt want to be seen arriving that night listen lennox if youre really interested in clearing up jimmys death like you say you are then im grateful for it though it looks pretty much to me like the police have got their man but putting that aside do you think i would really have anything to do with killing jimmy like you said he was my father whether it was public knowledge or not and he looked after me there were lots of things we were going to do together he had big plans for me why would i have anything to do with his death i dont think you did i dont think you were responsible for his death and i dont think you wanted his death but i do think youre scared and i know small change was scared witless before he died whoever had him scared has got you toeing the line for fear of getting the same treatment this is shite lennox god knows where youre getting this stuff i wasnt anywhere near kirkcaldys house that day or any other what day i didnt say when it was and i didnt say whether it was day or night collins gave a small laugh look youre not tricking me into saying anything because theres nothing for me to say youre barking up the wrong tree really i think different but like you say ive got nothing to back it up yet when i do it will be interesting to see who your biggest problem is the police or willie sneddon but in the meantime you think things over if you decide you need my help to get yourself out of whatever it is youve gotten into give me a call i pointedly tossed my card onto his desk he pointedly didnt pick it up chapter seventeen bantaskin street maryhill was hardly sunset strip hollywood and observing a building from a car is less than inconspicuous when yours is one of only three cars in the street it meant i had to park around the corner some distance from the gym leave the atlantic and carry out my surveillance from a tenement corner i hadnt really expected to get anything worthwhile out of collins the whole exchange with him hadnt been to find out what he knew rather to hint at what i knew which was less than met the eye if my hunch was right it would take collins only the time it takes to make a phone call and arrange a meet before hed come hustling out of the side door of the gym id guessed ten but in fact it was nearer twenty minutes before he emerged and crossed the street to where he had parked his lanchesterdaimler i sprinted back to the atlantic and came around the corner just in time to see the tail of his car as it took the junction into cowan street i had hoped for a car to intervene between me and collinss lanchester but maryhill road was pretty much empty of anything but trams and buses i had to hold back collins would have checked the street before he got into his car satisfying himself that i had gone but that didnt mean he wouldnt be checking his rearview mirror a little more frequently than usual thankfully his burgundy lanchester was the kind of colour you couldnt miss and i reckoned i could keep tabs on it from a distance collins led me up maryhill road and through milngavie i smiled smugly for no ones benefit but my own we were heading for bobby kirkcaldys place in blanefield but we didnt instead we passed through strathblane and blanefield and headed further north and into stirlingshire i couldnt complain about my work not being varied over the last two weeks i had seen more scottish countryside than a bluebell tours bus driver we were the only cars on the road now and i held right back allowing myself to be guided by the blood fleck on the horizon that was collinss lanchester as it breached a hill or took a corner there was nowhere for him to go which made me feel relaxed about following him but perplexed about where he might lead me we were now out into that part of scotland that was gently scenic rather than dramatic but the mountains ahead reminded me that we were becoming ever more remote when i turned the next corner i found that i had lost sight of collins completely so i gunned the atlantic a little until i reached the next bend still nothing i stopped reflecting on the view dropped a crunching gear and floored the accelerator i took the next bend a little too fast and the rear tyres protested still no collins i took the next stretch as fast as the last braking hard at the corner this time there was a long open expanse ahead of me where the road dipped between trees and rose gradually again stretching out towards the mountains i slowed down no collins and there was no way he could have cleared that stretch before i made the corner it took me a while to find a place where i could get turned around the atlantic objected a little as i floored the accelerator again heading back up the hill and around the bend slowing up on the straight i checked every farm gate and track peering through the dense clumps of trees i passed what looked like the entrance to a house but couldnt see the building itself because of the trees and bushes that lined the road just a sweep of dirt and gravel driveway i drove on for another five hundred or so yards checking for signs where collins could have turned off nothing it had to be the entry into the house i found a layby of sorts and parked so i could steal up the driveway on foot and have a noseyaround this was becoming a bit of a habit and i was becoming more gumboot than gumshoe as i headed along the road to the entrance to the driveway i wondered if i should trade in the atlantic for a tractor it was a long driveway treelined and curving so you couldnt get a glimpse of the house till you were nearly on it it turned out to be a big georgian type bigger and classier even than sneddons newly acquired country retreat and fight venue but when i drew closer i could see that most of the windows were shuttered and a door to the side was boarded up another empty house but not another derelict this had all the look of a home boarded up while the owners were away or one that was between owners the driveway opened out into a huge semicircle in front of the house no bloodred lanchester in fact no cars at all i could have saved myself some time and driven up to check it out there was clearly no one here least of all collins id lost him but it still made sense for me to check the house out and it still made sense for me to be cautious as i did so i decided to get off the drive the gravel was crunching under every footfall and everything else around here seemed to have taken a trappist vow i walked across a broad triangle of lawn that was yearning for a longlost mower and around the side of the house the first couple of windows i found the usual tall elegant georgian jobs had the internal shutters closed over but when i got around to the back i found an unshuttered window its glass as black as obsidian i peered in through it pressing my face to the glass and shielding my eyes with my hands but it was no good the interior was so dark i could see nothing i straightened up there reflected in the dark glass was a face next to mine standing behind me a battered indeterminately old face that looked like it had been used as a punch bag for decades the name uncle bert formed itself in my head and i started to turn but something that felt like steel slammed into my back right above the pelvis the pain exploded through my gut and i felt as if my kidney had exploded the punch had caught me exactly where i was still tender from my encounter with costellos goons outside the carvery i spun around and swung wildly at the old man he blocked my punch with his forearm and his fist still feeling like steel instead of muscle and bone rammed into my solar plexus every bit of air pulsed out of my lungs i stopped defending myself i stopped thinking once more all of my being was concentrated on the simple effort of breathing he pushed me back and to the side so i collided with the wall uncle bert took his time holding me in place with one hand and pulling his other fist back to deliver a right that we both knew would send me sleepybyebyes he had braced his legs to deliver the maximum power and i swung my foot up as hard and as swiftly as i could manage my foot went through between his legs but my shin slammed into his groin he doubled over and i grabbed his ears hoisted him up and smashed my forehead into his face the good old glasgow kiss i pushed him away from me blood was pouring from his nose and i fully expected him to crumble but uncle bert was an old pro and came straight back at me i scrabbled in my pocket for my sap and swung it at him catching him on the temple it sent him sideways but again amazingly his feet remained planted and he didnt go down i backhanded him with the sap he went down on one knee and i kicked him in the face he fell backwards onto his back i staggered forward pulling air into my empty lungs and bent from the pain in my kidney all the hate and the rage was back i stood to one side of him and raised my foot aiming to smash my heel into his ugly old battered face there was a shot i staggered back chapter eighteen i looked down at my body then down at bert soutar sprawled on the ground at my feet neither of us was hit when i looked up i saw bobby kirkcaldy his face carrying the evidence of his defeat the night before standing with a browning in his hand hed obviously fired a shot into the air but i now found myself looking at the business end of the automatic against the wall lennox he said his voice still disconcertingly calm gentle uncle bert you okay soutar got to his feet slowly eyeing me with malice i knew what was coming and so clearly did kirkcaldy leave it bert he said well do this in the garage like we said soutar grabbed me by the collar of my suit jacket and pulled me from the wall he took up position behind me and guided me with vicious shoves around to the back of the house the drive arced round the far side of the house to a whitewashed outbuilding it looked like it had at one time been a stables but had since been converted into a garage there was a dormer window above it suggesting that the attic had been the chauffeurs accommodation there were two huge double doors and i reckoned you could easily have parked four cars inside it i studied the structure carefully for two reasons the curiosity of the condemned man about his place of execution and because i wanted to work out any possible escape routes well in advance soutar kept the shoves going and i considered dancing with him again he was a tough old bird all right but id do my best to snap his neck before his nephew got one off i could always hope that kirkcaldy was a worse shot than he was a boxer all of this because you fixed a fight i called over my shoulder ive got to give it to you kirkcaldy you take your petty larceny very seriously shut up and walk uncle bert gave me another shove it was beginning to become rude weve got a friend waiting for you said kirkcaldy and laughed in a dark vicious way he went ahead of us and opened one of the doors into the garage just as i had expected there were two cars in the garage the sleek carmine droplet of collinss lanchester and bobby kirkcaldys opentop sunbeamtalbot sports what a chump i thought bitterly to myself there i was thinking i was all smart and devious stirring up collins so he would lead me to mr big yep i had had it all down pat except that the delay in collins leaving his office had been to give kirkcaldy time to make the fifteenminute drive from strathblane to this place and get himself settled in all collins had had to do after that was lead me by the nose it served me right i was beginning to believe my own advertising the garage was even bigger inside than i had guessed the two cars took up less than half of the space jack collins stood in the middle of the free area of floor i told you hed follow me he said with a contempt i could have found hurtful okay so youre pissed off that im doing my job but like i said outside this doesnt smell right to me youre going to too much trouble just to cover up a fixed fight why the artillery i asked nodding to the browning in kirkcaldys hand maybe youre right lennox kirkcaldy said maybe theres more going on than you can understand try me i said im an understanding type but first of all indulge my curiosity as a fan why throw the fight last night what makes you think i threw it oh come on i was there and ive seen you fight several times before if you could flatten mcquillan the way you did then jan schmidtke should have been a walkover you threw the fight all right is your heart really as bad as that as a matter of fact it is said kirkcaldy in a matteroffact way congenital defect ive had it since birth but didnt know about it its only over the last six months that ive had problems with it the quack says ive to take it easy take the stress out of my life maybe i should start with you huh lennox so im guessing you made a killing on the fight i asked jack here arranged it all for us it actually started off as small changes idea no really big bets nothing that would get noticed too much but lots of them spread out across all the bookies and each bet placed by a third party who couldnt be connected to collins far less me very sweet i said but you werent the only ones in the know two young flash harrys tried to broker a big bet against you winning through tony the pole thats something i dont know about said kirkcaldy as casually as he could manage if he had been as poor at throwing a feint in the ring then his prematurely terminated career would have terminated even more prematurely who were they i pushed my luck seeing as i was at gunpoint in an outbuilding in the middle of nowhere where a shot would go unheard far less unnoticed i felt i was just as well pushing it i told you i dont know anything about them or anybody else laying bets i decided to move on before kirkcaldys pants caught fire im sure your little scheme will have raked in a lot of cash but not that much not enough for this kind of grief and it doesnt add up to something worth killing small change for small changes death has got nothing to do with us nothing at all and its got nothing to do with the fight scam either no i believe you didnt kill small change but the fight scam does have something to do with his death maybe small change came up with the idea of you throwing the fight to start with but when he did it was simply to get you out of the fight game with a little pension you must have told him about your heart condition but the real reason you needed to pull it off was because you needed to pay someone off quick someone who was going to give you the same treatment that small change got kirkcaldy didnt say anything but exchanged a look with uncle bert you see bobby im a studious sort i spend a lot of time up at the mitchell library expanding my mind one direction ive expanded in is the traditions and customs of our travelling cousins take the ones up at vinegarhill now to start with i thought they were just irish travellers but it turns out theyre minceir proper romanies from ireland the real gypsy mccoy you could say kirkcaldy said nothing theyve had a long and difficult history gypsies i continued theyve been in britain for centuries you know did you know that we actually sold them to louisiana to work as slaves for freed blacks who had their own small plantations or that we used to hang them just for being gypsies its made them an unforgiving bunch theyre big on vengeance and blood feud whats that got to do with anything kirkcaldy said but again i could see behind the expression i dont know what you did thats the one piece thats missing for me you see like i said ive been reading up on gypsy customs and i met sean furie whose son is up for small changes murder now to start with i thought furie was more blackrock than bulgaria but it would seem hes the real thing he and his mob follow gypsy customs and law furie himself is a baro thats a kind of clan chieftain the kingpin gypsy and as a baro furie will also sit as a judge on the kris the halfarsed court arrangement they have going one of the things the kris does is sit in judgement on fellow gypsies or even on gaje as they call nongypsies very fucking interesting said bert soutar consider my horizons expanded now get over against the wall i decided to stay where i was for the moment it is interesting you see one of the things the kris sits in judgement on is if one of their own is killed by someone else murder say or a careless accident then they can issue a sentence on the accused and the only way he can get out of it is to pay a glaba blood money i paused for a moment less for dramatic effect and more to check my surroundings again there were a couple of small grimy windows over by the rear wall a clutch of old and rusting garden tools including a small hand scythe mottled with reddishbrown flecks a shadow fell across the grimedimmed window and passed on there was someone else here outside anyway i continued heres the way i see it you good old uncle bert and young collins here are all under sentence of death and death though its bad enough isnt as scary as the kind of death youll have at the hands of the gypsies now i dont know if furies son carried out sentence on small change or not but you fellas have a pretty good idea whats ahead of you unless of course you hand over a large glaba ransom so what are we supposed to have done asked kirkcaldy well its pretty obvious at first sight uncle bert here supplied that young pikey fighter for the bareknuckle fight then he dies so soutar small change and collins are held responsible small change meets a sticky end by having his skull pulped with a statue of his favourite greyhound and you start getting traditional gypsy symbols of death dropped on your doorstep i was supposed to work it all out well i have but what i dont get is why the gypsy boy went into the fight of his own free will knowing the risks and took his chances so why does his clan hold you responsible youre not as smart as you think you are lennox sneered jack collins his face was white and drawn the coolness had gone he was afraid it was either what i had been saying or he knew he was about to witness something unpleasant i did my best to believe it was the power of my oratory shut up collins said kirkcaldy against the wall lennox and keep your hands where i can see them so this is it i asked i noticed i wasnt breathing hard and i didnt feel my heart pounding that was what happened i guessed when youd thought you were going to die so many times before when youd seen so many others go before you so youre going to kill me over a gypsy curse and an amateurishly fixed fight no this doesnt make sense im missing something here who was it in collinss car outside your house and why are the gyppos really after you my back was to the wall now but as id backed up id angled my steps so i ended up next to the scythe a rusty garden implement against a gun and two experienced fist fighters they dont stand a chance i thought to myself show him kirkcaldy barked the order at collins and indicated his car with a jerk of his head collins went over to the car and opened the trunk lifting out something wrapped in a blanket he carried it in his arms like it was a baby he laid it on the floor and unwrapped it for me to see it was the kylan demon statuette it had been broken into two pieces the fake jade was less than an inch thick the contents spilled from the broken sculpture tightly wrapped waxed paper bricks i sighed as something tied itself into a knot in my gut i knew what kirkcaldy having it meant sammy pollock kirkcaldy smiled and it reminded me of the way sneddon smiled just like everything else in glasgow lennox the clyde is unpredictable you dump two bodies at the same time in the same place and one washes up and the other sinks without trace he didnt deserve that kirkcaldy he was just a kid i thought about how sheila gainsborough would take the news i hadnt earned my fee on that one that was for sure but there again it wouldnt be me whod be breaking the news to her i gave a bitter laugh whats so fucking funny asked kirkcaldy just that i was working two cases that i never connected im not as smart as i thought i was youre smart lennox too smart but you should know by now that nothing happens in this city without it being tied into everything else and before you get all huffy about pollock remember that he brought it on himself he wanted to play with the big boys he ended up way out of his depth i dont think youre far behind him you having that stuff means you dont just have a bunch of irate gypsies after you have you heard of john largo ive heard and i know this is his stuff but hes still looking for pollock and costello we happened on this by chance were in the clear not that in the clear i found you no you didnt all that you said to collins here was smoke and mirrors you were grousebeating except now its the grouse with the gun on you anyway youre not going to be telling anyone anything thats that then i thought if there was one thing you couldnt accuse kirkcaldy of it was ambiguity how did costello and pollock get their hands on the jade demon there was no way they could have known what was in it thats where youre wrong young master pollock was a young man of cosmopolitan tastes bohemian you might say he was a bit of a hashish smoker and had experimented with opium no other bastard in this city would have realized the value of refined heroin but pollock knew all right but that was as smart as he got he was no master criminal and he thought he was dealing with al capone when he got in tow with paul costello but costello was a wanker and as much out of his depth as pollock was so how did they get their hands on this i asked the three of them soutar collins and kirkcaldy were all facing me now with their backs to the doors kirkcaldy had left the door open a few inches and i could have sworn that i had seen it move my shadow at the window was maybe not another accomplice after all i pinned my hopes on a guardian angel paul costello was always looking for a score kirkcaldy continued and i made a gargantuan effort not to cast a glance at the garage doors behind him i think he was trying to prove he could be a real player like his da fuck all chance of that he didnt have the brains to blow his hat off sammy pollock was supposed to be the thinker talk about the blind leading the blind anyway they did a couple of nighttime jobs they got two other guys in with them their first score was a warehouse with cigarettes french shit they didnt have a clue how to move the stuff on other than going round the clubs and pubs themselves complete amateurs you dont pull a job unless youve done a deal in advance with a fence wholl move the stuff on not only did these wankers have no deal they didnt even know a fence so they went to small change it was all fitting now aye he took the stuff off them for peanuts now small change was no fagin but he did handle the odd dirty merchandise now and again especially if there was decent money to be made but only if it was something special and there was a high brokering margin to be made it still doesnt explain how pollock knew to steal the jade dragon pollock and costello had help on their jobs two guys who worked for costellos da and a pikey who provided extra muscle said kirkcaldy again something fell into place for me the five of them did the cigarette job kirkcaldy went on all the stuff came from the warehouse used by that frog barnier before they get to the cigarettes they have to open a few crates to check before they hit the jackpot with the fags the genius pikey cracks open a jade statue by accident and sees its full of packets he tells pollock and pollock jumps to the conclusion that its hashish so they take the statue as well and get away scotfree but when pollock gets home and opens one of the packets he realizes theyre all in the deepest shite he realizes its not hashish but heroin and pretty high grade he takes a sample from one brick puts the brick back and glues the statue back together he takes the sample straight to small change small change doesnt know the slightest thing about narcotics so he comes straight to yours truly so these two guys you said were working for costello i said im guessing that they did a deal with you and small change and then delivered up sammy pollock and paul costello so what went wrong i kept my eyes fixed on kirkcaldys and ignored the figure i saw on the edge of my vision slipping in through the doors and edging crouched down along the wall and behind the cars the pikey works out theres something more to the job and starts asking for more money or hell talk except he doesnt know that im involved now he also happens to be a bareknuckle fighter who uncle bert has fixed up with a few fights at sneddons place and he just happens to die during the fight aye funny that kirkcaldy smiled coldly quite a coincidence particularly as uncle bert gave him some special medicine before the fight told him it would make him fight better and not feel the other blokes punches the last bit was right the stupid pikey bastard took it the other fighter was able to beat the shite out of him and then he started bleeding like fuck from the beating or the drugs i dont know and your problems solved i tried to stay relaxed and natural when all the time i was mentally measuring the distance to the rusting scythe and waiting for the figure hidden behind the cars to make his move naw thats when our problems just began turns out that the pikey is sean furies son the brother of the one up for small changes murder so thats the glaba you have to pay i said a baro s son wont come cheap it takes more than a bunch of pigarsed irish gyppos to scare me its a nuisance that i dont need at the moment i cant sell the heroin yet and i needed to raise money to buy the knackers off he jerked his chin in the direction of the broken statuette this is the biggest business opportunity ive ever had this stuffs going to be big here have you seen glasgow on a saturday night half the city gets totally fucking stocious thousands of men out of their skulls on booze no one drinks for the taste and christ knows they dont drink for the social fucking aspect do you know what they want they want a holiday they drink because for a few hours they can step outside their lives if cheap whisky or red biddy gives them a day trip to largs this stuff is two weeks in fucking monte carlo this he bounced the package in his hand as if assessing its worth this is the future lennox this is glasgows future we wont be able to get enough of this stuff to keep up with demand im fucking telling you this stuff was made for glasgow because this stuff makes glasgow go away anyway talking about making things go away enough chat kirkcaldy pulled the carriage back on the browning the three of them faced me collins looked even paler he had known from the moment he left his office to lead me up here that this was what was going to happen bert soutar twisted his thin lips underneath his bustedup nose he was going to enjoy this for some reason that i couldnt fathom fiona whites face came to my mind maybe it was the fact that she was about to have a vacancy to let there was a terrible grace to it i had guessed it would be singer who was behind the car after all it had been me who had suggested he was put onto tailing kirkcaldy he moved out from behind the car without a sound it was collinss startled cry that caused kirkcaldy and soutar to spin round i saw singers hand move swiftly up and make a short arc in the air collins made a gurgling sound and blood started to pulse from his neck where singers razor had slashed him i lunged for the scythe kirkcaldy heard the rasp as i tore it from the wall and he spun back swinging the gun around the scythe sliced into his wrist and the gun fell to the floor i rushed forward and swung the scythe again this time its tip sank into kirkcaldys back and he screamed in a way that didnt sound human i saw that singer and soutar were now desperately wrestling with each other soutars iron grasp on singers wrist stopping him from bringing the razor down to his throat i threw down the scythe and snatched up the automatic kirkcaldy had dropped i didnt even think about it i put two rounds into the side of soutars head and he went down lifeless his dead grip pulling singer down on top of him the whole thing would only have lasted four or five seconds but now soutar lay dead collins was on his back shivering and twitching the last of his life away kirkcaldy was on his knees clutching his hackedopen wrist thanks singer i said if you hadnt come along id be dead singer straightened himself up and nodded he was out of breath but i thought i detected a hint of a smile in the corners of his mouth we left the bodies in the garage i wrapped a handkerchief around kirkcaldys hand and we put him in the passenger seat of his sunbeamtalbot sports tucking the browning into the waistband of my trousers i gathered up the jade demon wrapped it back into its blanket and put it into the boot of my car i knew kirkcaldy wouldnt give me any more trouble so i told singer to follow me in my austin atlantic we stopped at a telephone box by the side of the road and singer watched kirkcaldy as i phoned willie sneddon i gave him a brief outline of what had happened and told him there were a couple of consignments of meat for hammer murphys mincer and where to find them we drove back into glasgow all the way kirkcaldy trying to do a deal with me offering all kinds of riches if i helped him get out of this mess as i drove along the clyde and into the gallowgate i promised i would that i knew people who would sort him out singer parked outside and waited for me i drove into the enclosure at vinegarhill the old guy id seen before ran across to sean furies caravan and hammered on the door furie nodded to me and i nodded back neither of us paid any heed to kirkcaldys begging i threw the keys of his car onto the ground and he fell out of the car and started to scrabble in the dust for them but they were too far away and the ring of gypsies that had formed was already closing on him when i dropped singer off at sneddons place i thanked him again he nodded once more and got out i was tired and i was aching but i had three phone calls to make it was getting dark darker than it had been for weeks and there was something in the late evening air that spoke of a colder season on its way i parked by the side of the clyde and took the shattered jade demon out of the trunk and carried it down to the waters edge i took a couple of the waxedpaper bricks out and held them one in each hand i was always looking for a way of making a buck here in my hands i had an entire retirement fund i guessed i would even get a tidy finders fee if i returned the narcotics to largo i also knew that it was only a matter of time before kirkcaldys predictions came true and the streets of glasgow would be awash with the stuff but there was some money that was just too dirty even for me i took my lockknife from my pocket and one by one cut open the bricks and shook out great clouds of white powder i watched the clouds of white powder drift away on the evening breeze and the wrappers as they drifted away on the dark sinewy surface of the water i made my calls from a telephone box on the corner of buchanan street the first was to someone everybody seemed to think of as a phantom i told john largo that he had an hour before i told dex devereaux where to find him without going into the specifics i told him that all accounts had been set straight and he had no scores left to settle in glasgow i recommended an immediate change of climate probably somewhere sunny the second call was to jock ferguson at home i told him to meet dex devereaux at his hotel in half an hour and that it would mean he would get the john largo collar my third call was brief and to the point i tried ringing jimmy costello at the empire bar he wasnt there but i got him at the riviera club he asked me impatiently what i wanted i understood his impatience he had asked me to find his son for him and he had turned up dead i was making a habit of it are skelly and young there i asked aye so fucking what theyre there right now aye his impatience grew im looking right at them then youre looking right at the men who killed paul or at least giftwrapped him for someone else to kill and dont worry all other accounts have been settled if youre fucking lying im not skelly and young stitched up paul and sammy pollock for money thats a fact what you do with that fact is up to you there was a pause at the other end of the line i could hear a band in the background the meltedtogether sounds of many people talking and drinking ill deal with it said costello and i knew that he would lennox yeah thanks i was as good as my word to largo and stood outside the alpha hotel for half an hour before i went in and asked for dex devereaux the night porter had been very reluctant to let me in and even more reluctant to disturb mr devereaux its very important i said and pushed a couple of pound notes into the pocket of his waistcoat tell him i have the address hes been looking for mr largos address i sat down and waited it took less than ten minutes for a dishevelled dex devereaux to appear in the lobby dishevelled except his flattop haircut which looked as precisionengineered as ever i handed him the note with the address you sure about this he held up the note thats him thats his address i left devereaux passing a flustered jock ferguson as the night porter let me out and him in dexll explain i said elliptically i was in an elliptical frame of mind i had another call to make the one i dreaded most i got back in the atlantic and drove out to the west end to sheila gainsboroughs apartment it was two weeks later that i met john largo dex devereaux had been as good as his word and had paid me the thousand dollars for the information but when they had arrived at largos place he had flown the coop he must have been warned off jock ferguson had said to me without a hint of suspicion largo was waiting for me hanging back in the shadows as i came out of the horsehead bar he kept his hand in the patch pocket of his suit jacket and i suspected he was holding something more than his change that was okay i understood his caution i wanted to thank you he said what for turning you in for giving me a chance how did you find me i took out my cigarette case and offered him one he took it with his left hand keeping his right in his pocket youre too sentimental i said i followed you to the lyle hill monument i guessed there was some connection to the maillebreze so i did some checking as i had explained to devereaux in the lobby of his hotel the maillebreze had been a french navy destroyer it had been anchored at the berthing point at the tail of the bank at the mouth of the clyde estuary and beneath the spot where the free french monument now stood the tail of the bank had been the gathering point for the atlantic convoys a bustling knot of merchant vessels and their heavily armed escorts and it had also been where the maillebreze had been berthed in april the french destroyer had only just set out to sea when two torpedoes were accidentally launched onto the ships own deck the torpedoes had exploded midships with a force that had shattered windows in port glasgow and the broken vessel had blazed and smoked with many of its crew trapped in the forward mess hall despite the efforts of the port glasgow fire brigade when the maillebreze eventually sank to the bottom of the firth it took sixtyeight of the twohundredstrong crew with it i had never met anyone connected to the disaster until now i found your name all right i said i mean i found the name alain barnier but it was amongst the list of missing i had no list of survivors to check alain was a friend of mine largo smiled his face looked completely different without the goatee beard and his hair was now as dark as mine in a way it was my way of commemorating him keeping his name alive but how did you trace my name remember the fight in port glasgow a couple of nights after the french fleet was sunk at merselkebir ah he nodded of course when i first came to your offices miss minto corrected me when i said the name clement the english way there are a lot of names that are spelt the same in french and pronounced differently and of course he concluded the thought for me there are many words that are spelt differently but sound the same dex devereaux had an informant who heard mention of your name he just reported it how he heard it john largo but when i was going through the court records i found the statement given by capitaine jean largeau of the fusiliers marins after that i guessed your career must have become so colourful that you adopted the name alain barnier it was prudent at the time i have another name now and another port you have succeeded in making glasgow he struggled for the right word untenable for me i cant say im sorry about that i dont approve of your business jean largeau shrugged the same gallic shrug that he had as alain barnier america is corrupt my friend i did not create the corruption i merely profit from it and i do not force these blacks to use my goods i supply a need theyre going to hang the gypsy boy you know i said changing the subject the boxer tommy gun furie largeau made an expression of incomprehension for small change macfarlanes murder he pled guilty on his lawyers advice but theyre going to hang him anyway which is a shame because i dont think he killed small change ah largeau shook his head slowly im afraid im not familiar with the case but with these itinerant people they are normally guilty of something we talked for a few more minutes two men standing chatting outside a glasgow bar we wished each other well and he took his hand from his pocket to shake mine i left him standing there and drove off when i looked in my rearview mirror he was gone i dont know why i didnt turn largeau in to the police or at least why i gave him a chance of getting away before i did i think it was probably one of those there but for the grace moments the war had done things to us both and i had very nearly turned out the same way but i hadnt epilogue maggie macfarlane the merry widow of pollokshields took the disappearance of jack collins with the same stoicism as she had her husbands demise i guessed i would never know just how much she knew about or was involved with his business dealings jack collins wasnt mentioned once when i called up to see lorna and there seemed to be some kind of peace between the two macfarlane women i reckoned it had about the same chance of lasting as the new armistice in indochina i told lorna that if she needed anything i was there for her it was goodbye and we both knew it she was a big girl and could look after herself one of the things that had brought us together was that we had both been carved from the same wood but i was beginning to question how i handled women willie sneddon coughed up my fee in full i had gone up to see him with singer and we had told him the whole story or i told him the whole story and singer backed me up with nods every time sneddon looked to him for confirmation sneddon took his losses on the chin but made his displeasure clear when i told him what we had done with kirkcaldy instead of handing the boxer over to him but sneddon was better off out of it a few days later the papers were full of the discovery of bobby kirkcaldys body which they reported had been subjected to a protracted and brutal assault i braced myself for a visit from jock ferguson or worse still superintendent willie mcnab there was a sudden outbreak of infectious amnesia in glasgow the witnesses who could place tommy gun furie near small change macfarlanes place on the night of the murder recanted the charges against furie were dropped i found myself wondering how many of the witnesses had been getting doorstep deliveries against her injunction i called around to may donaldsons later that week i waited outside until she got home from work and i was sure she was alone her face darkened when she opened the door to me lennox i told you dont worry may i said im not staying i just came to give you this i handed her a white vellum envelope it was a nice envelope classylooking her eyes grew wide when she opened it whats this its five hundred pounds consider it a wedding present another wedding present you deserve a good start i cant accept this lennox you know i cant she held the envelope out to me but i pushed it back yes you can its something i earned and im not happy about what i did to earn it dont worry i said reading her look its not dirty money in fact i was paid from the coffers of global law enforcement still i really cant take it she protested but with significantly less enthusiasm how do i explain this to george tell him youve inherited something from a relative you didnt know about ill send you a letter with my official heading on it if you like she looked at the envelope with the bulge of money pushing it wide it looked like some splitopen vegetable a cash crop lennox okay i said there is something id like you to do for me maybe i should come in and explain i was waiting when davey wallace got out of hospital the swelling had gone down but his face was still a dark spectrum of bruises he walked slowly but gingerly as if treading on hot coals i guessed that anything but the gentlest footfall would jar through his cracked ribs somehow he managed to grin his usual grin at me that hurt more than if hed swung a punch at me i held open the car door for him he got in and we drove across the city davey told me that he didnt want me to worry about him and that he would be ready to do work for me again in a couple of weeks and he would have plenty of time he told me hed been laid off from the yard i didnt say anything instead i drove down to the river and parked on a scruffy patch of cleared bombsite i helped davey to the waters edge and we sat on a wall beneath the bristling black branches of shipyard cranes a puffer belched blackly as it drifted past us we sat there for more than an hour while i talked without a break i talked about my home in canada and about the war i talked about when id been daveys age and everything i thought the world had held for me i talked about things that i hadnt talked about to anybody before and i told davey that i talked about sicily and aachen about the friends id seen die and the enemies id killed about the bad things id done because you had to do bad things in war and the bad things id done even when i didnt have to do them i laid out my life for him and for me when i finished i handed him an envelope the same classy vellum type i had given may i told davey about saskatchewan about open prairies and hot summers and snow as deep as your chin in winter i told him he should quit watching gangster movies and watch more westerns two friends of mine are moving out there may and george theyve got a huge farm out there and theyll need someone to help out theres a ticket in there for you to travel with them and five hundred pounds in sterling that goes a long way in canadian dollars davey why are you doing this mr lennox because youre a good kid davey and i was a good kid once or i like to pretend to myself that i was a good kid once you deserve something better than this i gestured to the black oily clyde to the cranes around us to the dark city behind us ive put a letter in there as well it gives my folks address and details in new brunswick i wired my dad and he said hell stand as sponsor for you if immigration need it i put my hand on his shoulder but you wont canada wants good kids like you i dont know what to say mr lennox if theres anything i can ever do what i want you to do is have a good life marry one of those strong pretty ukrainiancanadian girls with skyblue eyes rosy cheeks and buttercoloured hair theyve got in saskatchewan and have a dozen blond kids davey sat silently in the car on the way back the white envelope on his lap he didnt speak until i pulled up outside his digs ill never forget this mr lennox never his face was determined almost grim good i grinned i dont expect you to maybe one day ill come out and visit after i left davey i drove back to great western road something churned in my gut and i knew it was because out there by the river i had faced things with davey that i hadnt faced since the war it had liberated me and burdened me all at the same time but at least for once i knew for sure what my next move was going to be i parked the atlantic outside my digs walked up to the door unlocked it and stepped into the hallway but i didnt go up to my flat instead without hesitating i knocked firmly on fiona whites door
