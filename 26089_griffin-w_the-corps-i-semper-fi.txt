w e b griffin the corps i semper fi semper fi preface in with the approval of the dowager empress of china a chinese militia the i ho chuan or righteous harmony fists hence boxer began under the motto protect the country destroy the foreigner to kill both westerners and chinese christians the german ambassador in peking was murdered as were thousands of chinese christians throughout china and the boxers laid siege to the legation quarter at peking the ninetyday siege of peking was relieved on august by an international force made up of russian french italian german english and american troops the imperial court fled to sian although war had not been declared against china the foreign powers nevertheless demanded a formal settlement the protocol of provided among other things for the punishment of those responsible for the boxer rebellion the fortification of the legation quarter at peking to be manned by powers troops and the maintenance by foreign troops of communication between peking and the sea as far as the americans were concerned this initially meant the stationing of us army troops and us marines in shanghai peking and elsewhere and the formation of the us navy yangtze river patrol the navy acquired shallow draft steamers armed them designated them gun boats and ran them up and down the yangtze river the russians following their resounding defeat in the russianjapanese war of had for all practical purposes turned over their interests in china to japan furthermore the versailles treaty which had set the terms of the peace between the western allies and the germans and austrohungarians at the end of the world war of had also given the japanese rights over the shantung province of china the reality of the situation in china in was that the lines had already been drawn for world war ii it was no secret that japans ultimate ambition was to take as much of china as it could into the greater japanese coprosperity sphere it was also no secret that they intended to expel the british the french and the americans when the time was ripe and they most likely wanted the italians out too although the italians and the japanese were on much better terms than either was with the french the english or the americans the official hypocrisy was that all were still allies in very much the same way they had been since the boxer rebellion in it had been agreed then when the international military force was formed to relieve peking that they were not waging war upon china but rather simply suppressing the boxers and protecting their own nationals from the savagery of the chinese thus the japanese view in which no one challenged was that their actions in china were nothing but extensions of what the allies started in the japanese were prepared to protect all foreigners from chinese savagery and they expected the french the italians and the americans to do likewise but because the imperial japanese armys tanks and artillery were doing nothing more than protecting their own and other foreign nationals they could logically raise no objection to the americans or others protecting their nationals with token military forces the japanese carefully restrained themselves with several notable exceptions from becoming involved in incidents involving an exchange of gunfire between themselves and troops of the neutral powers they still paid lip service to international convention because international convention condoned their occupation of shantung province if an incident came before the league of nations it was likely to go off at a tangent into such things as the behavior of the imperial japanese army everyone understood that the japanese prefer not to openly tell the league of nations to go to hell if necessary of course they would but as long as they could avoid doing so they would in january the american military presence in china consisted of the us navy yangtze river patrol the us navy submarine force china and the thregiment usmc both based in shanghai and the us marine detachment peking chapter one one company d th marines shanghai china january pfc kenneth j mccoy usmc stood with his hands on his hips staring at the footlocker at the end of his bed hed been that way for quite some time he was trying to make up his mind mccoy was twentyone years old five feet ten and onehalf inches tall and he weighed pounds he was well built but lithe rather than muscular he had even features and fair skin and wore his light brown hair in a crew cut his eyes were hazel and bright and when he was thinking hard as he was now one eyebrow lifted and his lip curled as if the problem he faced amused him he had once been an altar boy at saint rose of lima church in norristown pennsylvania and there were traces of that still in him there was now as then a suggestion that just beneath the cleancut innocent surface was an alter ego with horns itching for the chance to jump out and do something forbidden it was the day after new years and pfc mccoy had liberty and it was two days after payday and he had his new gambling money in his pocket so he wanted to go try his luck but what he couldnt quite make up his mind about was whether or not he should leave the compound armed and if so how what had happened was that on christmas eve at a dance hall called the little club there had been a not entirely unexpected altercation between united states marines and marines assigned to the international military force in shanghai by his majesty victor emmanuel iii king of the italians it wasnt the first time the americans and the italians had gotten into it but this time it had gotten out of hand mccoy had heard that as many as eighteen italians were dead and there were eight marines in sick bay two of them in very serious condition rumor had itand mccoy tended to believe itthat there were bands of italian marines roaming town looking for us marines the officers certainly didnt doubt it theyd granted permission for marines to wear cartridge belts with firstaid pouches and bayonets a sheathed bayonet made a pretty good club a drawn bayonet was an even better personal defense weapon but sending the men out with bayonets sheathed or unsheathed was far short of sending them out with rifles loaded or otherwise mccoy had not been at the little club on christmas eve partly because a marine who wanted to celebrate christmas eve by getting drunk had offered him three dollars mccoy had negotiated the offer upward to five to take the duty but even without the offer mccoy wouldnt have gone to the little club on christmas eve he had known from experience that the place would either be depressing as hell andor that there would be a fight between the marines and the italians or between the marines and the seaforth highlanders or between the marines and the french foreign legion getting into a brawl on christmas eve was not mccoys idea of good clean fun and getting into any kind of a brawl right now was worse than a bad idea mccoys blue marine blouse had two new adornments the single chevron of a private first class and a diagonal stripe above the cuff signifying the completion of four years honorable service he had just shipped over for another four years with the understanding that once he had shipped over he would be promoted to pfc with the promotion came the right to take the examination for corporal it had also been understood unofficially that he would get a high rating when he went before the promotion board for the oral examination they were willing to give him that he knew because no one thought he would stand a chance first time out of getting a score on the written exam that would be anywhere close to the kind of score needed to actually get promoted well they were wrong about that he wanted to be a corporal very much and he had prepared for the examination the tough part of it was military engineering which mostly meant math questions he had a flair for math and he thought it was likely that he hadnt missed a single question but mccoy had more going for him when the promotion board sat down at marine barracks in washington to establish the corporals promotion list they paid special attention to something called additional qualifications mccoy had found out by carefully reading the regulations that there was more to this than the sort of skills you might expect skills like making expert with the and the springfield you got points for that of course and he would get them because he was a pretty good shot but you also got points if you could type sixty words per minute or better when he took the test he had been rated at seventyfive words a minute he had kept that ability a secret before reenlisting because he hadnt joined the marine corps to be a clerk but even that wasnt his real ace in the hole what that was was foreign language skills foreign language skills he was convinced was going to make him a corporal long before anyone else in the th marines thought he had a chance his mother had been french and hed learned that from her as a baby then hed taken latin at saint rose of lima high school because they made him and french because he thought that would be easy when hed come to shanghai he had not been surprised that he could talk french with the french foreign legionnaires but he had been surprised that he could also make himself understood in italian and that he could read italian documents and even newspapers and that still wasnt all of it like every other marine who came to the th he had soon found himself exchanging half his pay for a small apartment and a chinese girl to share the bed do the laundry and otherwise make herself useful mai sing could also read and write which wasnt always the case with chinese girls before he had decided that he really didnt want a wife just yetnot even a temporary oneand sent mai sing back wherever the hell she had come from with two hundred dollars tobuy herself a husband she had taught him not only to speak the shanghai version of cantonese but how to read and write a fair amount of the ideograms as well there was a standard us government language exam and hed gone to the us consulate and taken it so far as the us government was concerned he was completely fluent in spoken and written french which was as high a rating as they gave nearly fluent in spoken and written italian nearly fluent in spoken cantonese and had a grade in written cantonese which meant that he could read seventyfive percent of the ideograms on the exam and could come up with the ideogram for a specific word more than half the time the guy at the consulate had been so impressed with mccoys chinese that he tried to talk him into taking a job with the marine guard detachment he could get him transferred the guy said and he wouldnt have to pull guard once he got to the consulate they always needed clerks who could read and write chinese mccoy had turned that down too he hadnt joined the corps to be a clerk in a consulate either the promotion list would be out any day now he was sure that his name was going to be near the top of it and he didnt want anything to fuck that up like getting in a brawl with a bunch of italian marines would fuck it up they wouldnt make him a corporal if he was dead either and the way this brawl was going getting meaner and meaner by the day that was a real possibility there were two things wrong with going out wearing a cartridge belt and bayonet he decided in the end for one thing he would look pretty silly walking into the poker game at the cathay mansions hotel with that shit and if he did run into some italian marines they would take his possession of a bayonet as a sure sign he was looking for a fight mccoy finally bent over the footlocker and took his baby fairbairn from beneath a stack of neatly folded skivvy shirts he had won it from a shanghai municipal cop after a poker game hed bet a hundred yuan against it one cut of the deck there was an officer named bruce fairbairn on the shanghai municipal police and he had invented a really terrific knife sort of a dagger and was trying to get everybody to buy them he had made quite a sales pitch to general smedley butler who commanded all the marines in china and butler so the story went had wanted to buy enough to issue them but the marine corps wouldnt give him the money mccoys knife was made exactly like the original fairbairn except that it wasnt quite as long or quite as big it was just long enough to be concealed in the sleeve with the tip of the scabbard up against the joint of the elbow and the handle just inside the cuff mccoy took off his blouse strapped the baby fairbairn to his left arm put the blouse back on over it looked at himself in the fulllength mirror mounted on the door and left his room their billets had once been twostory brick civilian houses that the th marines had bought when they came to china way back in blocks of them enough houses to hold a battalion cyclone fences had been erected around these blocks and the fences were topped with coils of barbed wire called concertina at the gate was a sandbagged guardhouse manned around the clock by a twoman guard detail as mccoy walked through the pfc on guard told him he had heard that the wops had ganged up on some marines and put another two guys in the hospital if he were mccoy he went on he would go back and get his bayonet im not going anywhere near the little club mccoy said and im not looking for a fight the faster of two rickshaw boys near the gate trotted up and lowered the poles take me to the cathay mansions hotel mccoy ordered in chinese as he climbed onto the rickshaw the guard understood cathay mansions hotel what the fuck are you going to do there mccoy he asked theyre having a tea dance mccoy said as the rickshaw boy picked up the poles and started to trot down ferry road in the direction of the bund as they approached the hotel mccoy called out to the rickshaw boy to pull to the curb at the corner he paid him and then walked down the sidewalk past the marquee and then into an alley which led to the rear of the building he went down a flight of stairs to a steel basement door and knocked on it a small window opened in the door and chinese eyes became visible mccoy was examined and then the door opened he walked down a long corridor ducking his head from time to time to miss water and sewer pipes until he came to another steel door this one identified as store room b he knocked and it opened for him united states marines were not welcome upstairs in the deeply carpeted finely paneled lobby and corridors of the cathay mansions hotel the oftenexpressed gratitude of the europeans of the international settlement for the protection offered by the united states marines against both the japanese and chiang kaisheks kuomintang did not go quite as far as accepting enlisted marines as social equals pfc ken mccoy was welcome here however in a basement storeroom that had been taken over with the tacit permission of sir victor sassoon owner of the hotel by its doorman a sixfootsix white russian the storeroom was equipped with an octagonal green baizecovered table and chairs a rather ornate light fixture had been carefully hung so as to bathe the table in a light that made the cards and the hands that manipulated them fully visible without causing undue glare mccoy was welcome because he always brought to the table fifty dollars americansometimes a good deal more which he was prepared to lose with a certain grace and without whining in the nearly four years that he had been in china mccoy had evolved a gambling system that had resulted in a balance of nearly two thousand dollars at barclays bank he thought of this as his retirement program he began each months gambling with fifty dollars twentyfive of which came from his pay by the time they had made the deductions this now came to about fortynine dollars and twentyfive of which came from the retirement fund in barclays bank he played until he either went broke or felt like quitting if he was ahead of his original fifty dollars when he quit he put exactly half of the excess over fifty dollars away to be deposited to his account at barclays the rest was his stash for the next game almost always he went broke sometime during the month and he never played again until after the next payday but again he had almost always put a lot more into barclays bank during the month than the twentyfive dollars he would take out after the next payday and sometimesnot often the cards went well and postgame deposits were sixty seventy dollars once there had been a postgame deposit of as he approached the group the bright light illuminating the table made everything but the lower arms and hands of the players seem to disappear for a moment into the darkness but gradually his eyes became adjusted and he could see faces to go with the hands the white russian who claimed to have been a colonel of cavalry in his imperial majestys th petrograd cavalry was at the table piotr petrovich muller he had a german surname he once told mccoy because he was a descendant of the viennese who had been imported into moscow to build the kremlin was a very large man with a very closely shaven face he bowed his head solemnly when he saw mccoy and then gestured for him to take an empty chair there was another russian who had found postrevolution employment with the french foreign legion and a sikh a uniformed sergeant of the shanghai municipal police there was also detective sergeant lester chatworth of the shanghai municipal police who looked up at mccoy and spoke i thought youd be out bashing eyetalians except for a thick perfectly trimmed mustache chatworth looked not unlike mccoy but he spoke with the flat nasal accent of liverpool i thought id rather come here and take your money mccoy said why not everybody else is detective sergeant chatworth said grinning the men at the table had nothing at all in common except that they met piotr mullers rigid standard of a decent poker player each could play the game well enough and each at one time or another had lost a good deal of money gracefully pfc kenneth mccoy was younger than any of them by at least a decade and a quarter of a century younger than muller neither he nor any of the others associated when they were not playing cards nor were they friendly with any of the perhaps forty other more or less temporary residents of shanghai who were welcome at mullers table in the basement of the cathay mansions there were no raised eyebrows when mccoy took off his blue blouse and revealed the baby fairbairn strapped to his arm it was prudent if technically illegal to arm oneself when going out for a night on the town in shanghai mccoy hung his blouse on the back of his chair unstrapped the knife and tucked it in a pocket of the blouse then sat down and laid his gambling money on the table fifty dollars american that month had converted to just over four hundred yuan he had before him four onehundredyuan notes which were printed lavender and white in england and were each the size of a british fivepound banknote he also had some change including an american dollar bill he made himself comfortable in the chair and then watched as the hand in play was completed when it was over muller nodded at him and he reached for a fresh deck of cards broke the seal and went through them finding and discarding the extra jokers he then spread the cards out for the others to examine afterward he gathered the cards together shuffled announced straight poker and dealt three hours later there were twentyodd lavenderandwhite onehundredyuan notes in front of mccoy the sikh and the foreign legionnaire had gone bust and it was between mccoy piotr petrovich muller and detective sergeant chatworth a half hour after that muller examined the two cards he had drawn threw his hand on the table and pushed himself away from it that left only mccoy and detective sergeant chatworth i dont play twohanded poker mccoy announced im willing to quit chatworth said and tossed the justcollected deck into the wastebasket where it joined a dozen other decks of cards stiff from three hours of little movement mccoy stood up and stretched his arms over his head he then strapped the baby fairbairn to his left arm put his blouse on and followed the others out of the storeroom when he was back out on the street mccoy considered having his ashes hauled it had been about a week and it was time to take care of the urge but he decided against it for one thing he had too much money with him he hadnt counted it out to the last yuan but hed won a bunchsay at twelve dollars to the hundredyuan note a little better than that was too much money to have in your pocket when visiting a whorehouse even if the italian marines werent on the warpath the smart thing to do was go back to the billet he put his hand up and flagged a rickshaw and told the driver to take him down ferry road three blocks from the compound he saw the italian marines hiding in an alley there were four of them in uniform the uniforms were a mixture of army and navyarmy breeches and navy middie blouses i am minding my own business mccoy told himself and i am not carrying a bayonet and i was not at the little club when this whole business started with a little bit of luck they will let me pass they didnt say anything to him as the rickshaw pulled past the alley and there could no longer be any question that the rickshaw passenger was a marine so for a moment he thought theyd decided to wait for marines who were looking for a fight and then the rickshaw was turned over on its side the rickshaw boy started to howl with fear and rage even before mccoy hit the ground striking the elbow of his blouse on the filth of the street mccoy sat up and looked around to see if there was someplace he could run but the italian marines had picked their spot well there was no place to run to maybe i can talk to them mccoy thought tell them the fucking truth i wasnt at the little club i have no quarrel with them then he saw the italian marine advancing on him with a length of bicycle chain swinging in his hand mccoy felt a little faint and then tasted something foul in the back of his mouth i dont know who youre looking for he said in italian but it isnt me the italian marine replied that his mother fucked pigs and that he was going to mash his balls the bicycle chain missed mccoys leg but before it struck the pavement with a frightening whistle it came close enough to catch his trousers leg and leave the imprint of the chain there mccoy quickly slid sideward taking the baby fairbairn from his sleeve as he got to his feet the italian marine told him his sister sucked greek cocks and that he was going to take the knife away and stick it up his ass mccoy sensed rather than saw that two other italian marines were making their way behind him the idea was that the two would grab him and hold him while the other one used the bicycle chain the thing to do was to get past the italian marine with the bicycle chain he made a feinting motion with the knife and the italian marine backed up it looked like it might work and there was nothing else to do he made another feinting move a savage leap accompanied by as ferocious a roar as he could muster at the exact moment that the italian marine lunged at where mccoys baby fairbairn had been the tip of the baby fairbairn punctured the italian marines chest at the lower extremity of the ribs mccoy felt it grate over a bone and then immediately sink to the handguard the knife was snatched from his hand as the italian marine continued his plunge the man grunted fell dropped the bicycle chain rolled over sat up and started to pull the baby fairbairn from his abdomen he gave it a hearty tug and it came out a moment later a stream of bright red blood as thick as the handle of a baseball bat erupted from his mouth the italian marine looked puzzled for a moment and then fell to one side jesus christ i killed him one of the three remaining italian marines crossed himself and ran away the other two advanced on mccoy one of them frantically trying to work the action of a tiny automatic pistol i cant run from that mccoy picked up the baby fairbairn and advanced on the two italian marines he made it to the one with the gun and started to try to take it away from him or at least to knock it out of his hand the other one tried to help his friend mccoy lashed out with the baby fairbairn again the blade slashed the italians face but that didnt discourage him he got his arms around mccoys arms and held him in a bear hug the other one managed to work the action of his tiny pistol mccoy remembered hearing that a or a will kill you just as dead as a it just takes a little longersay a weekto do it with a strength that surprised him he got his right arm free and swung it backward at the man who had been holding him he felt it cut and strike something something not anywhere as hard as the ribcage but something and it went in far enough so that he couldnt hang on to it when the man fell down then free he jumped at the man with the pistol the pistol went off with a sharp crack and he felt something strike his leg hard like a kick from a very hard boot and then he knocked the pistol from the italian marines hand and when it clattered onto the cobblestones dived after it he picked it up and aimed it at the italian marine then he followed his eyes what he had done when he had swung his knife hand backward was stick it in the mans groin the man was now holding his groin with both hands the handle of the baby fairbairn was sticking out between his fingers the man was whimpering and tears were on his face down the street mccoy could hear the growl of the handcranked siren at the compound this is going to fuck up my promotion he thought goddamn these italians two captain edward j banning usmc was s the staff intelligence officer of the th marines he was thirtysix years old tall thin and starting to bald and he had been a marine since his graduation from the citadel the military college of south carolina a second lieutenant for three years a first lieutenant for eight years and hed worn the twin silver railroad tracks of a captain for four years there were four staff officers the s personnel and s supply were majors the s plans and training was a lieutenant colonel as a captain banning was the junior staff officer but he was a staff officer and as such normally excused from most of the duties assigned to nonstaff officers he took his turn of course as officer of the day but that was about it he was for instance never assigned as inventory officer to audit the accounts of the officers or nco clubs or as investigating officer when there was an allegation of misbehavior involving the possibility of a courtmartial of one of the enlisted men or any other detail of that sort he was the s and the colonel was very much aware that taking him from that duty to do something else did not make very good sense so banning had been surprised at first when he was summoned by the colonel and told that he would serve as defense counsel in the case of the united states of america versus pfc kenneth j mccoy usmc but he was a marine officer and when marine officers are given an assignment they say aye aye sir and set about doing what they have been ordered to do this one cant be swept under the table banning the colonel said its gone too far for that it has to go by the book with every t crossed and every y dotted i understand sir major delaney will prosecute i have ordered him to do his best to secure a conviction i am now ordering you to do your best to secure an acquittal the italian consul general has told us that he and colonel maggiani of the italian marines will attend the courtmartial do you get the picture yes sir the picture banning got was that he was going to have to spend christ alone knew how many hours preparing for this courtmartial participating in the courtmartial itself and then christ alone knew how many hours after the trial going through the appeal process about half of the total would have to come from the time banning would have normally spent with his hobby his hobby was ludmilla zhivkov whom he called milla milla was twentyseven ravenhaired longlegged and a white russian and he had recently begun to consider the possibility that he was in love with her banning was a marine officereven worse a marine intelligence officerand marine intelligence officers were not supposed to become emotionally involved with white russian women it had not been his intention to become emotionally involved with her he had met her more or less on duty there had been an advertisement in the shanghai post russian lady offers instruction in russian conversation it had coincided with an unexpected bonus in his operating funds two hundred dollars for foreign language training there were supposed to be fifteen thousand white russian refugee women in shanghai they made their living as best they could some successfully and some reduced to making it on their backs he had somewhat cynically suspected that the russian lady offering russian conversation was doing so only because she was too old or too ugly to make it on her back milla had surprised him she was a real beauty and she was the first white russian hed met who was not at least a duchess she was also devoutly religious which meant that she was not going to become a whore unless it got down to that milla told him her father had operated of all things the victor phonograph store in st petersburg they had come from russia in with some american dollars and it had been enough with what jobs he had been able to find to keep them while they waited for their names to work their way up the immigration waiting list for the united states and then he had died and she hadnt been able to make as much money as she had hoped even working as a billing clerk in the cathay mansions hotel and teaching russian conversation when he met her she was down to living in one room the next step was to become somebodys mistress after that shed have to turn into a whore becoming a whore would keep her from going to the states the first thing banning had done was pay her the whole two hundred dollars up front then one thing had led to another and they had gone to bed soon he had helped her get a larger place to live but the ground rules established between them were clear it was a friendly business relationship and never could be anything more when he went home that would be the end of it she understood that she had lived up to her end of the bargain and she would he believed stick to it her powerful character he sometimes thought was one of the reasons he was afraid he was in love with her and sometimes he wondered if she wasnt playing him like a fish she was also the most intelligent woman he had ever known and nobly living up to her end of the bargain because she had figured that was the one way to get him to break it but what he nevertheless knew for sure was that if he married her he could kiss his marine career goodbye and that he could not imagine life outside the corps and that he could not imagine life without milla for the first time in his life ed banning did not know what the hell to do banning went by the orderly room of d company first battalion and read through pfc kenneth j mccoys records slowly and thoroughly he talked to his company commander his platoon leader his platoon sergeant his section leader and his bunk mate the picture they painted of mccoy was the one reflected by his records he had joined the corps right out of high school in fact several months before his high school diploma had come to him while he was at parris island and was entered into his record then had served for three months with the fleet marine force at san diego and then been shipped to the th marines in shanghai where theyd made him an assistant gunner on a watercooledcaliber browning machine gun he had by and large kept out of trouble since arriving in china and he got along all right with his corporal and his sergeant who both described him as a good man but there were several things out of the ordinary he didnt have a chinese girl for one thing but he had had a chinese girl so there didnt seem to be reason to suspect he was queer he didnt have a buddy either which was unusual but some men were by nature loners himself included and this mccoy seemed to be another of them there was nothing wrong with that it was just a little unusual what was most unusual though was his skill as a typist and his language ability banning was a little chagrined to discover that dog company had a natural linguist who could type seventyfive words a minute assigned to a machine gun if he had known that pfc mccoy would have found himself assigned to headquarters company skilled typists were in short supply but not nearly as short supply as people who could read and write french and italian and chinese banning decided that mccoy more than likely with the connivance of his first and gunnery sergeants had wanted these skills kept a secret gunnery sergeants were concerned with having good men on the machine guns and cared very little for the personnel problems of the chairwarmers at regimental headquarters and mccoy himself was probably one of those kids who did not want to be a clerk when he was convinced he had learned all he could about pfc kenneth j mccoy from his service records and those around him captain banning went to the infirmary to see the accused facetoface mccoys medical records showed that he had been admitted to the dispensary at hours january suffering cuts and abrasions and a penetrating wound of the upper right thigh possibly caused by a smallcaliber bullet a surgical procedure at hours january had removed a leadandbrass object tentatively identified as acaliber bullet from the thigh the prognosis was complete recovery with return to full duty status in ten to fifteen days captain banning found pfc mccoy in a twobed infirmary room he was sitting in a chair by the window using the windowsill as a desk while he worked the crossword puzzle in the shanghai post an issue cane was hanging from the windowsill as you were banning barked when mccoy saw him and started to rise keep your seat banning could not remember ever having seen mccoy before which was not that unusual there were a number of young privates and pfcs in the th marines who looked very much like pfc mccoy captain banning introduced himself and told mccoy he had been appointed his defense counsel then he made sure that mccoy understood his predicament he told it as he saw it that he didnt think there was any chance that mccoy would be found guilty of firstdegree murder which required serious elements such as previous intent but that it was very likely that he would be found guilty of what was known as a lesser included offense there was no question that there were two dead italian marines or that mccoy had killed them neither was there any question that they had been killed with his knife banning then explained that while authority mightand didlook away at the illegal carrying of a concealed deadly weapon so long as nothing happened when something did happen the offense could no longer be ignored there were two lesser included offenses banning continued manslaughter which was the illegal taking of human life and negligent homicide which meant killing somebody by carelessness i havent discussed this with major delaney who will serve as prosecutor mccoy captain banning said because i wanted to talk to you first but this possibility exists when you come to trial you have the option of pleading guilty to a lesser included offense i feel reasonably sure that major delaney would have no objection if you pleaded guilty to manslaughter and perhaps i could persuade him to accept a plea of guilty to involuntary manslaughter pfc mccoy did not respond if you did plead guilty to either of the lesser included offenses banning said the courtmartial board would then decide on the punishment no matter what they decided the sentence would be reviewed both by the colonel and by general butler both of whom have the authority to reduce it sir it was selfdefense mccoy said let me try to explain this to you banning said you would be better off if you had knifed two american marines but you killed two italian marines and they have to do something about it the italian consul general and the italian marine colonel are going to be at your courtmartial they want to be able to report that the us marine who killed two of their marines was found guilty and will be punished am i getting through to you sir it was selfdefense mccoy repeated doggedly you dont have any witnesses banning said there was the rickshaw boy and twenty thirty chinese that saw it how do you plan to find them banning asked mccoy shrugged his shoulders ask around i suppose there was no sense arguing with him banning decided he just didnt understand the situation let me tell you what i think is going to happen he said i think i can get major delaney to accept a plea of guilty to a charge of manslaughter you will be sentenced and you might as well understand this the sentence will be stiff maybe twenty years to life jesus christ mccoy said that will satisfy the italians banning said you understand thats necessary mccoy gave him a cold look but said nothing the sentence is then subject to review by the colonel banning said he will take his time reviewing it i think to let things cool off a little then he will decide that youre not really guilty of manslaughter but of the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter and he will reduce the punishment accordingly to what to what sir banning corrected him to what sir mccoy repeated dutifully the maximum punishment for involuntary manslaughter is five years ive heard about mare island and portsmouth mccoy said grim faced he had not appended sir as military courtesy required but banning did not correct him it was bannings personal opinion that the naval prisons at mare island california and portsmouth new hampshire where the brutality under marine guards was legendary were a disgrace to the marine corps the next step in the process banning went on is the review of the sentence by general butler i think its very possible that general butler would reduce the sentence even further say to one years confinement and then by the time you got to the states the navy department would review the sentence still again and im sure that they would pay attention both to your previous service and to the letters recommending clemency that your company and battalion commanders tell me they will write in your behalf your sentence could then be reduced again to time already served in other words sir mccoy said with a sir that bordered on silent insubordination i could count on being a busted marine looking for a new home for christs sake mccoy you killed two people you cant expect to get off scotfree sir pfc mccoy said no disrespect intended but they gave me the courtmartial manual to read and in there it says i can have the defense counsel of my choice banning felt his temper rise the sonofabitch was a guardhouse lawyer on top of everything else that is your right he said stiffly who would you like to have defend you my company commander sir you cant have him because he is your company commander neither can you have your platoon leader then lieutenant kaye sir the assistant supply officer with a massive effort captain banning kept his temper under control mccoy he said im going to give you twentyfour hours to think this over i want you to carefully consider your position yes sir pfc mccoy said three on the way to his office from the infirmary captain bannings anger rose among other things he was going to look like a goddamned fool in front of the colonel when he had to go to him and tell him this knifewielding pfc had refused his services as defense counsel it was of course the kids right but banning could not remember ever hearing of anything like this happening and pfc mccoy was not doing himself any good if he went to trial and pleaded not guilty he was digging his own grave he was not being tried for stabbing the two italians but to make the point to the other marines that they couldnt go around killing people if he went along with that in three months he would be a free man at san diego or quantico with only the loss of a stripe to show for having killed two men if he annoyed the courtmartial board they would very likely conclude that he was somebody who needed to be taught a lesson and sock him with a heavy sentence if the colonel was annoyed he would find nothing wrong with the sentence when it was reviewed and if general butler smelled that mccoy was a troublemaker he wouldnt find anything wrong with the sentence either pfc mccoy stood a very good chance of finding himself locked up in the portsmouth naval prison for thirty years to life captain bannings rage lasted through lunch and then he considered the situation from mccoys point of view the kid actually believedsince it was the truththat he had acted in selfdefense it was therefore his own duty banning decided to at least pursue that as far as it would go to prove selfdefense he would need witnesses the only witnesses right now were two italian marines they were prepared to testify that they were minding their own business when mccoy drew a knife on them whereupon one of their number drew a pistol in selfdefense when he went back to his office after lunch banning told his clerk to see if he could get a car from the motor pool he had to go into town banning hoped to find bruce fairbairn at the headquarters of the shanghai municipal police he knew him and could explain the problem to him but when he got to police headquarters fairbairn was not available and neither was chief inspector thwaite who was the only other shanghai police officer he knew well enough to speak to with complete frankness he wound up talking to a detective sergeant chatworth chat worth sat at an old wooden desk covered with papers as banning approached he shuffled angrily through them searching for something he had apparently mislaid banning introduced himself and told him what he had come for right chatworth said looking at banning with a screwedup face he seemed surprised to hear bannings story you yanks always seem to have to wear white he said after a moment while searching through his pocket for a nearempty package of vile chinese cigarettes fag he offered holding one out thanks no banning said i mean christ he went on lighting up dont you have any loyalty towards your own for the sake of italians really he inhaled deep savoring it then blew out and besides i know the boy mccoy is a good one protect him you dont find his class all that often that may be banning shrugged stiffening he did not like chatworth very much but italian pride has been badly hurt theyve gone to the foreign service boys at the consulate one thing has led to the other and the consequence is that there is nothing we can do but courtmartial pfc mccoy and then on top of that banning continued mccoy is being difficult he thinks he did it all in selfdefense and he simply refuses to understand that without witnesses he cant possibly get away with that plea so chatworth said beginning to understand and so sergeant im desperate could you people possibly help us and see if you can find some chinese who a saw the fight and b would be willing to testify in mccoys behalf at his courtmartial rather abruptly detective sergeant chatworth turned his attention back to his papers ill look into the matter he said dropping the nowdead cigarette on the floor and snuffing it out with his heel and ill be in touch with you in due course banning saw that chatworth did not like him any more than he liked chatworth and banning also realized that chatworth knew even better than he did that there was virtually no chance of finding a chinese who would be willing to testify that he had seen the fight between the big noses and it would matter to the chinese not at all that the us marine big nose had clearly been the aggrieved party detective sergeant chatworth had abruptly dismissed him because he was wasting detective sergeant chatworths valuable time banning did not go back to the office he went to the apartment mil la was there giving a chinese woman hell because she had not ironed several of bannings shirts to what milla thought were marine sartorial standards she was acting wifely and that upset him too and he got drunk and he told milla about mccoy she was sympathetic to him she felt sorry for him that he had a problem with mccoy later she consoled him in bed which was usually enough to make him happy as hell but not this time as he watched her get dressed to go to work he tormented himself with fantasies of other men watching her naked as she was now and touching her naked flesh as he had just done which was sure as hell going to happen if he didnt marry her and get himself booted out of the corps after she left he hit the whiskey again and ended up with some drunken ideas he could go to trial and try to play on the sympathy of the courtmartial board paint pfc mccoy as a saint in uniform who was the innocent party in this whole mess he could try to convince the courtmartial that the reason pfc mccoy went around with a fairbairn dagger in his sleeve was that he collected butterflies hed throw the fucking knife at them andpin their wings the poor fucking wops had fallen onto the blade of the knife when they slipped on a banana peel four at eight fifteen the next morning as captain banning drank his third cocacola of the day in a vain attempt to extinguish the fire in his stomach his clerk came into his office with the first batch of the days official correspondence from the message center among the items which required his initials was a communication from headquarters united states marine corps a promotion board having been convened to consider candidates for promotion to the grade of corporal had reached the end of its deliberations there were thirty names on the list and there were twelve vacancies within the marine corps for corporals therefore commanding officers of the first twelve names on the list were herewith directed to issue promotion orders for the individuals concerned as additional vacancies occurred authority would be granted to promote individuals on the list numbers through the second name on the list was pfc kenneth j mccoy company d th marines the navy and thus the marine corps was governed by common law of the united states and a pillar of that code of justice was that an accused was presumed innocent until proven guilty the colonel had just been directed by hq usmc to promote pfc mccoy to corporal mccoy an action that would be very difficult to explain to the colonel commanding the italian marines and to the consul general of the king of italy at shanghai it would look as if the punishment for stabbing to death two italians was promotion to corporal captain banning wondered whether it was his duty to bring the problem to the colonels attention himself or whether the sl would consider it part of his duty as personnel officer most likely the problem would skip the gls attention banning decided the colonel was going to be furious when he found out about this and the sl knew it too he was still considering the problem and half expecting his telephone to ring with a call from either the sl or the colonels sergeantmajor when his clerk knocked at the door put his head in and announced that detective sergeant chatworth and two chinese were in the outer office as incredible as it sounded had chatworth turned up two witnesses in so short a time ask him to come in please banning said chatworth came in with two coolies bannings heart sank again the courtmartial would not take the word of two coolies over that of two italian marines good morning captain detective sergeant chatworth said may i present constable hang chee and senior patrolman kin tong the two coolies bowed their heads constable hang and patrolman kin were fortunately in a position to see the mccoy incident from start to finish tell the captain what you saw hang constable hang spoke english very softly but well he reported that pfc mccoy had just stepped out of his rickshaw near the compound gate when he was beset by the five italians and had no choice but to defend himself he was three blocks from the compound banning said when four italian marines overturned the rickshaw now that you mention it constable hang said thats right there were four italian marines and the assault took place several blocks from the compound entrance it was clear to banning that they had no more seen the fight than he had whats going on sergeant chatworth banning asked you wanted witnesses i found them chatworth said will a sworn statement suffice do you think or will these officers have to testify in court i dont want mccoy to go to portsmouth either but i am a marine officer and i cant close my eyes and pretend i believe chatworths chinese i could not put these men on the stand banning said disliking chatworth more than ever i think you misunderstood the purpose of my visit yesterday youre a bloody fool then banning chatworth said coldly good day sergeant chatworth banning said ill send the report of these officers concerning the incident they witnessed to you via the british consulate chatworth said itll take two three days to get here id suppose i told you as much as i might personally like to i cant put these men on the stand why not chatworth asked being very blunt im not sure i believe your men goddamn it i know i dont believe them thats not really for you to decide is it chatworth said and if you dont let these men testify wouldnt that be suppression of evidence why the hell are you doing this banning asked were just doing our duty as we see it chatworth said sarcastically i can only hope that youre not one of those bloody fools who doesnt know hes in shanghai and thinks he can go by the bloody book how dare you talk to me that way banning flared what are you going to do about it chatworth asked calmly i tell you now sergeant chatworth that i intend to discuss this with captain fairbairn odd that you should mention his name chatworth said constable wang and patrolman kin are members of captain fairbairns flying squad bannings temper flared he reached for the telephone actually intending to call fairbairn but reason prevailed he instead had the operator connect him with the colonel sir he said there has been a rather startling development when pfc mccoy was attacked by the italian marines the whole incident was witnessed by two chinese police officers of captain fairbairns flying squad they are prepared to testify that it was clearly a case of selfdefense thats bloody well more like it detective sergeant chatworth said chapter one th marine infirmary shanghai china january pfc kenneth j mccoy wearing issue pajamas and a bathrobe was stretched out on his bed working at a crossword puzzle in the shanghai post when captain banning walked into his room banning saw that they had brought him his breakfast on a tray and that he had eaten little of it as you were banning said as mccoy started to swing his legs out of the bed mccoy looked at him warily i want a straight answer to this question mccoy banning began how well do you know a sergeant chatworth of the shanghai municipal police mccoy banning noticed with annoyance debated answering the question before replying i know him sir good friend of yours is he banning pursued i wouldnt say that sir mccoy said i know him sergeant chatworth has come up with two witnesses to support your allegation of selfdefense banning said they saw the six italians attack you when you got out of the rickshaw at the compound gate mccoys eyebrows went up but he said nothing this is a very bright young man banning thought bright and tough who knows when to keep his mouth shut the two witnesses were chinese police officers of captain fairbairns flying squad banning went on they have appeared before the adjutant and made sworn statements the statements bring the number of italian marines down to four and say that your rickshaw was turned over where you said it was mccoy looked at captain banning without expression the statements are so much bullshit of course banning said and you know it sir so were the statements of the italians the first thing i thought mccoy was that you and chatworth were involved in something dishonest and it was a case of one crook helping another but i just came from seeing captain fairbairn and he tells me that chatworth is a good man off the record he told me that if chatworth was getting you out of the mess youre in that speaks highly for you because he doesnt normally do things like that i dont know sir what you expect me to say mccoy said you think im a sonofabitch dont you mccoy his face expressionless met bannings eyes but he said nothing if i were in your shoes and the officer appointed to defend me against a charge i was innocent of tried to talk me into pleading guilty id think he was a sonofabitch banning said youre an officer sir mccoy said the implication of that banning thought is that all officers are sonsofbitches do all the enlisted men think that way or only the ones smart enough like this one to know when somebodys been trying to fuck them and in this case i was a sonofabitch banning said im going to give you that mccoy its the truth i am not exactly proud of the way i handled this its pretty goddamned shaming to put a point on it for me to admit that it took an english policeman to remind me that a marine officers first duty is to his men id like to apologize yes sir mccoy said does that mean you accept my apology or that youre just saying yes sir banning asked its important that i know i would like a straight answer man to man i didnt expect anything else mccoy said and ive never had an officer apologize to me before i guess what im really asking banning said is whether you do accept my apology or whether youre just going to bide your time waiting for an opportunity to stick it in me am i carrying a grudge you mean no sir i really hope you mean that mccoy because you are going to be in a position to stick it in me banning said sir when your friend chatworth came up with witnesses to your innocence the colonel decided that there was no reason to go ahead with your courtmartial it would have been a waste of time and money in light of the new evidence all charges against you have been dropped as soon as the surgeon clears you youll go back to duty aye aye sir mccoy said thank you sir but not to dog company banning said the colonel has given you to me youre being transferred to headquarters company i dont understand mccoy said the colonel said that a man with your many talents mccoy banning said dryly the typing and the languages not to mention your ability to make friends in the international communitywas wasting his time and the corps time and money on a machine gun a man like you mccoy the colonel said should work somewhere where his talents could be better utilized like s i dont want to be a clerk mccoy said what you want mccoy is not up for debate captain banning said but for your general information i dont have any more choice in the matter than you do what went unsaid i think was that the colonel wants me to make sure you dont stick that knife of yours in anyone else aye aye sir theres more as soon as you feel up to making the trip youre going to peking for a while a month six weeks get me out of shanghai mccoy asked but it was more thinking out loud than a question banning nodded youre a problem mccoy banning said the italians want you punished now that we cant do that we want to get you out of sight for a while captain mccoy said the surgeon told me that if there was going to be infection i would have it by now theres no reason for me to be in here do you feel up to going that far in a truck banning asked i thought we moved people by water between here and tientsin mccoy said from time to time we send a truck convoy up there banning said one is leaving on thursday didnt you hear that the word is mccoy said that what the convoys really do is spy on the japs and that would bother you no sir mccoy said that sounds interesting i asked my gunny gunnery sergeant a senior noncommissioned officer how i could get to go and he told me to mind my own business military intelligence isnt what you might think it is from watching errol flynn or robert taylor in the movies banning said i didnt think it was mccoy said evenly are you familiar with the term order of battle banning asked no sir it is the composition of forces banning said what units are where and in what condition by that i mean how they are armed equipped fed whether or net theyre up to strength whether or not there are any signs of an impending move you understand yes sir one of my responsibilities is to keep up to date on the japanese order of battle banning said one of the ways i do that is give the officer in charge of the tientsinpeking convoys a list of things to look for that does not mean i should add breaking into a japanese headquarters in the middle of the night to steal secret plans the way errol flynn operates in the movies my instructions to the officer are that his first duty is to not get caught being nosey i guess the japanese watch him pretty closely of course they do banning said theyd be less likely to pay attention to a pfc mccoy said they judge our pfcs by the way they treat their own and their pfcs cant spit without orders the low regard the japanese have for their own enlisted men works both ways banning said they would shoot one of our pfcs they caught snooping around and then be genuinely surprised that we would be upset about it then the thing for our pfcs to do is not get caught mccoy said didnt you ever hear that the smart thing to do is never volunteer for anything banning asked theres always an exception to that mccoy said like when you think it might do you some good to volunteer go on banning said i think im going to be on the corporals promotion list mccoy said i also think what i did is liable to fuck me up with getting promoted maybe i could get off the shitlist by doing something like snooping around the japs youre on the corporals list banning said the promotion orders will be cut today a separate order by the way hoping the italians wont find out about it and think that were promoting you for cutting up their marines you will be a very young corporal mccoy then maybe if i volunteer for this and do it right mccoy said i can get to be a very young sergeant and maybe youd fuck up and embarrass the colonel and give him an excuse to bust you banning said i dont think busting you would make him unhappy and maybe i wouldnt mccoy said ill take that chance right now mccoy and understand me good all you are to do when you go on the convoy is sit beside the driver i dont want you snooping around the japanese unless and until i tell you what to look for do you understand that aye aye sir mccoy said im not going to charge around like a headless chicken and get you in trouble captain as long as we both understand that banning said yes sir mccoy said unless you have any questions then that seems to be about it i want you to stay in here until wednesday when you can go to your billet and pack your gear for the trip you are not to leave the compound and i think it would be a good idea if you didnt sew on your corporals chevrons until you are out of shanghai aye aye sir mccoy said any questions do i get my knife back so you can slice somebody else up banning flared i wasnt looking for trouble with the italians mccoy said but when it found me it was a damned good thing i had that knife tell me something mccoy banning said does it bother you at all to have killed those two men straight answer banning nodded ive been wondering if somethings wrong with me mccoy said im sorry i had to kill them but youre supposed to be all upset when you kill somebody and i just dont feel that way i mean im not having nightmares about it or anything like that the way i hear other people do it says in the bible thou shalt not kill banning said and it also says an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth mccoy said and that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword banning looked at him for a long moment before he spoke im not absolutely sure about this he said finally your knife was evidence in a courtmartial but now that theres not going to be a courtmartial maybe i can get it back for you thank you mccoy said id hate to have to buy another one two on the way back to his office captain banning wondered why in their meeting pfccorporal mccoy had not said yes sir as often as he was expected tousing the phrase as sort of military verbal punctuation and he wondered why he himself except that once hadnt called him on it the fact he concluded after a while was that mccoy was neither intentionally discourteous nor insolent and that the discussion had been between them as men not officer and pfc in other words the kid had understood either from instinct or from smarts what was the correct tone to take with him the more he saw of mccoy the more he learned about him the more impressed he became both with his intelligence his score on the written promotion examination should have prepared him for that but it hadnt and with his toughness he was a very tough young man but not entirely within there was a soft center of young boy who wished to sneak off and be a spyfor the pure glamour of it and the romance he could not of course permit him to snoop around the japanese both because he would get caught doing it always an embarrassment with the japanese and because it was very likely that the japanese would in fact accidentally kill him or if they wanted to send a message to the americans behead him with a sword and then arrange for his head to be delivered in a box before the convoy left for tientsin and peking banning took mccoy aside and made it as clear as he could that he was to leave what espionage there was to lieutenant john macklin who was the officer charged with conducting it he was to go nowhere and do nothing that the other enlisted men on the convoy did not do mccoy said aye aye sir banning felt a little sorry for him when he saw him climb into the cab of a studebaker truck while it was true that the danger of infection of the small caliber wound was over it was also true that the little slug had caused some muscle damage and the operation to remove the slug much more what muscle fibers werent torn were severely bruised it was going to be a very painful trip over a long and bumpy road almost a month to the day later the convoy returned two days later lieutenant macklin furnished banning with a neatly typedup reporta report that exceedingly dissatisfied him because he had acted with much too much caution macklin had not found out what banning had told him to find out and he had for all his caution been caught snooping by the japanese they hadnt actually caught macklin in a situation where they could credibly claim espionage they just found him somewhere that the officer in charge of a supply convoy should not have been there were a number of legalities and unwritten laws involving the relationship between the japanese imperial army in china and the military forces of the french the italians the english and the americans captain banning had come to china briefed on many of them and his years in china had taught him much more he had a pretty good sense by now of the rules of the game what the japanese had done when they caught macklin was what they had done before they had as brother officers courteously invited him to visit their headquarters they then took him on an exhausting inspection of the area with particular emphasis on the garbage dumps rifle ranges and other fascinating aspects of their operation then they brought him to the mess where several profusely apologetic japanese officers spilled their drinks on him while they got him drunk at dinner they managed to spill in his lap a large vessel of something greasy sticky and absolutely impervious to cleaning the idea was to make him lose face as usual they succeeded corporal kenneth j mccoy came to the s office just after noon the day banning received macklins report he apologized for taking so long but he explained that his gunnery sergeant had run him over to s to take care of the paperwork that went with his promotion to corporal this had not been taken care of when he had been shipped off to peking hows your leg banning asked bother you on the trip he didnt seem bothered by mccoys delay in reporting to himor else he didnt believe the kid would have anything worth reporting it was rough on the way up sir mccoy said all right now though yes sir mccoy said well whether or not you like it mccoy banning said im going to have to use you as a clerk i thought that was probably going to happen mccoy said im sorry youre not pleased banning said but thats the way its going to have to be captain ive got something to say and i dont know how to go about saying it spit it out banning said the th and th regiments of the nd infantry division are going to be moved from sьchow to nantung where they are going to be mobilized mobilized banning asked confused i mean theyre going to get trucks to replace their horses you mean motorized banning corrected chuckling yeah motorized mccoy said sorry sir and then he went on the th regiment is going to stay at sьchow reinforced by a regiment i dont know which one of st division then when the th and th come back the thll go to nantung and get their trucks and the other regiment will go back where it came from when the whole division has trucks theyre going to move to tsinan youre sure of this banning said sarcastically a couple of whores told me mccoy said and i checked it out now corporal mccoy why do you suppose lieutenant macklins report doesnt mention this as he spoke banning almost kicked himself for coming to macklins defense and yet he knew he couldnt really help himself macklin was an officer and officers do not admit to enlisted men that any other officer is less than an officer should be but more important there was bad chemistry between himself and macklin and banning felt guilty about it guilty enough to protect the lieutenant when he really shouldnt be protected banning just did not like macklin he was a tall darkhaired finefeatured man who fairly could be called handsome and whose face seemed as bright and intelligent as it was handsome the problem was that he was not nearly as bright as he lookedmuch less than he thought he was the first time banning had laid eye on him he had pegged him as the sort of man who substituted charm for substance someone who spoke very carefully never causing offense never in a position he couldnt escape from by claiming misunderstanding well i told you i didnt know how to say it mccoy said i told him what i heard and he laughed at me but hes wrong whores know the truth was banning knew that whores did indeed know you said you checked it out banning said yes sir how i checked it out sir mccoy replied you said that and i asked you how sir you told me not to go snooping around the japs and im afraid youre going to think i did anyhow why would i think that banning asked well mccoy said uneasily i got pretty close to them he paused and then blurted i went to nantung captain youre telling me you went to nantung without orders there was a texaco truck going in mccoy said with a load of kerosene i gave the driver fifty yuan to take me with him and then bring me back and what did you do corporal mccoy when you were in nantung banning asked the question seemed to surprise mccoy i told you he said i went to a whorehouse one that the jap officers go to and there were japanese officers in this brothel yes sir and what did the japanese officers think when they found a marine corps corporal in their whorehouse banning asked but before mccoy could reply he went on they obviously did not see you or you wouldnt be here did it occur to you mccoy that if they did see you and they didnt slice your head off at the adams apple i would have your ass if and when you came back they saw me mccoy said they thought i was an italian that works for texaco one of them had been in rome and thought he talked italian goddamn you mccoy banning said you were ordered to leave the snooping to lieutenant macklin you said not to go near them mccoy said i thought you meant i wasnt to get near the compound i didnt i went o a whorehouse and you made it sound like finding out about the trucks was important and youre sure they didnt suspect you were a marine banning asked dumb fucking question banning if they suspected he was a marine he wouldnt be here they thought i was angelo salini from napoli mccoy said both matteroffactly and a little smugly i went to high school with a guy with that name and they told you about the trucks banning asked no sir mccoy said we just had a couple of drinks and messed around with the whores the whores told me about the trucks do i bring him up on charges for disobeying what was a direct order or do i commend him for his initiative and did the ladies tell you what kind of trucks banning said or how many just army trucks mccoy said and since i couldnt go near the compound i couldnt find out mccoy said why should i believe this whorehouse scuttlebutt banning asked i dont know if you should or not captain mccoy said but thats what i found out and since lieutenant macklin wasnt going to report it i figured i should which means of course that he first told this to macklin which means that macklin knew mccoy had done something he wasnt supposed to do and which macklin should have reported to me but if macklin did report him his own failure would be even more conspicuous sonofabitch and did your lady friends tell you when all this is going to happen mccoy nodded by the time the next convoy goes through sьchow one or the other of the regiments will probably be gone mccoy said maybe on the way back one of them will already be back and you could count the trucks if you were on the next convoy do you suppose you could count the trucks banning asked yes sir im going to rephrase the question banning said being fully aware of the risks involvedwhich means that if the japanese catch you they will more than likely break every bone in your body with clubs and then behead youwould you be willing to try to get some photographs of the trucks of their motorpool photographs close enough up so that the bumper markings could be read i dont have a camera captain ill get you a camera mccoy banning said then yes sir mccoy said the cold blooded decision banning realized was whether or not it was worth it to determine if the japanese were motorizing one of their divisions it would be more than embarrassing if the japanese caught this corporal what hed told mccoy would happen to him if he were caught was not hyperbole take the rest of the day off mccoy banning said i want to have another talk with lieutenant macklin and i want to think about this hes liable to be pissed i went over his head mccoy said dont worry about that banning said youre assigned to s you work for me thank you sir mccoy said the moment mccoy walked out of his office banning had further thoughts about what he had just said there was no question in his mind that the japanese knew his name as well as the names of everybody who worked closely with s if it came to their attention that a corporal of his was making another trip on the tientsinpeking run they were liable to drag him out of a truck on general principles but he realized theyd believe they had an officer in a corporals uniform japanese corporals were not dispatched on missions of espionage and therefore they could not imagine that americans would do it either he realized he had already decided to send mccoy back to peking on the next convoy very early the next morning banning was summoned to the colonels office the colonel was in a nearrage are you aware banning that there was a welcome home killer mccoy party at the club last night complete with a banner saying exactly that the club was called the milliondollar club because it had allegedly cost that much to build fourteen years earlier before the th marines had come to china it was on bubbling well road on the way to shanghais elegant race track no sir banning said i was not what it looks like to the italians is that we promoted him for stabbing those people the colonel said if they havent heard about it yet the italians soon will were going to have to get that kid out of shanghai again and quickly id planned to send him back to peking with the next convoy sir banning said when does it go on thursday sir is there any way it can leave sooner say tomorrow ill have to check with the s sir to be absolutely sure but offhand i cant think of any reason it cant check with him if theres any problem let me know aye aye sir what about the last trip the colonel asked anything interesting i have some fairly reliable information sir say seven on a scale of one to ten that the nd infantry at sьchow is being motorized that is interesting the colonel said wonder what the hell thats all about do they have that many trucks ill be able to make a better guess when i have more information sir im going to try to get some photographs make sure whoever you send is a good man the colonel said aye aye sir banning said i think he is and get that damned killer mccoy out of here as soon as possible i dont want him waved like a red flag in front of the italians aye aye sir three headquarters th regiment usmc shanghai china may when his sergeant opened the office door to tell him that lieutenant sessions had arrived captain edward j banning usmc was looking out the window of his office at the trees just coming into bloom he had been thinking about milla if it wasnt for this character sessions he was waiting for he could be with her in the apartment he had forced the image of milla in her underwear out of his mind by reminding himself that the price they were going to have to pay for the beauty of spring would be the smell that would shortly come from shanghais infamous sewers ask him to come in please sergeant banning said he turned and hoisted himself onto the window ledge he was high enough off the floor for his feet to dangle lieutenant edward sessions usmc marched into the office he was wearing civilian clothing a seersucker suit and a straw hat with a stiff brim he looked banning decided like another macklin another handsome sonofabitch with a full head of hair and nice white teeth and lieutenant sessions was clearly a little surprised to find on this momentous occasion the intelligence staff officer of the th marines sitting with his feet dangling like a small boy rather than solemnly behind a desk sessions was not only fresh off the boat from the states but he was fresh from headquarters usmc and he was on a secret mission all of these banning decided had perhaps naturally made him just a little bit impressed with his own role in the scheme of things fuck him captain banning was not awed by lieutenant sessions whom he now remembered having once met years ago at quantico nor by the fact that he was fresh from hq usmc nor by his secret mission and he believed in fact that the secret mission itself was a little insulting to him personally not only had he been in china four years and earned he thought a reputation for doing his duty the way it should be done but his own man had been the reason why this whole secretmission business had started killer mccoy not only returned undetected from his second trip by motor convoy to peking but he came back with six rolls of mm film the japanese nd division had then been in the process of exchanging its horsedrawn transport for three kinds of trucksa small truck smaller even than an american pickup truck a japanese copy of a ford tonandahalf stakebody truck and a larger mitsubishi twoton which was capable of towing both field pieces and ammunition trailers banning had had the film processed and then sent the negatives and a set of prints by the fastest means available via the president wilson of us lines to manila where it had been loaded aboard one of pan american airways sikorsky seaplanes bound for hawaii and san francisco to headquarters usmc the first response to that had been a cryptic radio message hq usmc washington dc via mackay radio for commanding officer th marines shanghai for banning reference photos well done stop the more the merrier stop more follows courier stop forrest brig gen usmc brigadier general horace w t forrest assistant chief of staff intelligence headquarters usmc was not only so pleased with killer mccoys photographs that he wanted more but he was sending additional information which he was reluctant to send via mackay radio by courier that communication had taken nine days to arrive there are several possible ramifications to the japanese motorization of divisionalstrength units which should be selfevident to you among these is the possibility that considering the road network of china it is the intention of the japanese to employ these units elsewhere it is therefore considered of the greatest importance that you continue to furnish this headquarters with the latest information available concerning actual or projected motorization of japanese formations additionally intelligence gathered in this area will serve to reflect the japanese industrial capability it has been learned from other sources that germany will furnish to the japanese an unknown quantity of so far unidentified field artillery it is considered of the highest importance that information regarding the specific type of such german field artillery the quantity of such artillery and ammunition stocks and the identity of troop units to which such german artillery has been assigned be developed as soon as possible lieutenant edward sessions has been detached from hq usmc to assist in the gathering of this intelligence he will be traveling to and within china bearing a passport identifying him as a missionary of the christian missionary alliance he will bring with him an encryption code which after the intelligence he develops concerning german artillery in japanese hands is compiled with information you will have generated concerning japanese motorization of tactical and logistical units you will use to transmit refined intelligence data to this headquarters this encryption code will be used for no other purpose and you will continue to transmit data you generate as in the past you will furnish to lieutenant sessions such support as is within your capability disbursal of confidential funds in this connection is authorized although lieutenant sessions will be functioning as a staff officer of this headquarters he will be under your orders while in china why it was considered necessary for them to send an officer to china to see if any german artillery pieces were in japanese hands was interesting finding out what equipment the japanese had was something that banning had been doing all along so sessionss arrival meant one of two things either they didnt like the way he was handling things or lieutenant sessions had friends in high places and a secret mission to china would look good on his record when the next promotion board sat when lieutenant sessions walked into the office captain banning was not surprised to see on his finger the ring signifying graduation from the united states naval academy at annapolis the conclusion to be drawn was that sessions indeed was well connected politically lieutenant sessions sir sessions said standing to attention banning pushed himself off the windowsill and offered his hand we met i think at quantico in thirtyfive he said nice to see you again sessions nice voyage yes sir sessions said i remember meeting the captain and the trip was first class long but with firstclass food and service to make it bearable i came out here on the shaumont banning said and i have good reason to believe that shell be back here just in time to take me home sessions was sure there was more to that statement than was on the surface it was a dig at him for being ordered to china on a passenger ship rather than on the shaumont one of the two navy transports the other was the henderson that cruised around the world stopping at every naval base or port with a sizable navy or marine detachment from portsmouth new hampshire to shanghai if i were in his shoes sessions thought i would be more than a little pissedoff myself if i were the s and they sent a major to help do what i am supposed to it would be insulting and im a lieutenant the president madison was part of the plan sir sessions said so that no questions would be raised if i suddenly joined the christian missionary alliance people here i thought it might be something like that banning said dryly there are seven christian missionary alliance missions in china sessions explained six of them are located between here and peking they are regularly resupplied twice a year with both stores and personnel that will be the cover for this operation we will visit each of the six missions on the route well drop off supplies and replacement personnel and pick up some missionaries who are due for a vacation in the united states it is believed that i can simply blend in with the other missionaries and not attract japanese attention well you could pass for a missionary ill say that banning said sir do i detect some sarcasm the people in washington who dreamed up this operation banning thought have apparently spent a lot of time watching humphrey bogart and robert taylor spy movies the people who dreamed up this idea sessions banning said left one important factor out of the equation sir with your passport and in civilian clothing i have no doubt that the japanese will indeed believe you are an american missionary banning said the trouble with that is that so far as the japanese are concerned all americans including missionaries are spies i dont know what to say sir sessions said in my judgment lieutenant sessions banning went on this brilliant washington scheme is tantamount to hanging a sign from both sides of the missionaries trucks caution spies at work he gave sessions a moment to let that sink in and then went on but you and i are marine officers lieutenant he said and when we are given an order we carry it out aye aye sir sessions said uncomfortably there is one small loophole in the japanese perception of americans banning said that i have had some success in exploiting the japanese believeand im not sure if this is their code of bushido or whether they picked it up from the britishthat enlisted men come from the peasant class and therefore can be presumed to be too stupid to have anything to do with intelligence im not sure i follow you sir sessions said bear with me banning replied what im going to do is inform major akkaido who is the japanese liaison officer that i have been directed by higher authority to provide an escort for the christian missionary alliance vehicles i am going to try very hard to convince major akkaido as one soldier to another that i am annoyed by this and that whether or not it is convenient for the missionaries i am going to send the missionaries along with one of our regular peking truck convoys i think im beginning to see sessions said the regular supply convoy consists of four studebaker trucks and a gmc pickup that weve rigged up as sort of a halfassed wrecker it can drag a brokendown truck presuming it hasnt lost a wheel or broken an axle if the motor officer can spare another studebaker well send that too empty to take the load if one of the other trucks breaks down presumably there will be mechanics along sessions asked each truck carries two people banning said one of whom is allegedly a mechanic they give the trucks a pretty good goingover before they leave but most of the difficulty we experience is with tires theres nothing that can be done about them until they go flat or blow out we carry spare tires and wheels as well as an air pump on the pickup and hope they will cover whatever trouble we have on the road youre thinking the japanese will pay less attention to the missionary vehicles and me if we are part of a regular convoy sessions asked the picture i hope to paint for the japanese banning said one i devoutly hope they buy is that the regular routine nolongerveryauspicious supply convoy is carrying with it this time a handful of missionaries and their supplies i think thats a good idea sessions said the convoy is under the command of an officer these we rotate both to give them a chance to see the landscape between here and peking and to keep the japanese from becoming suspicious of any particular man i understand sessions said and whoever this officer is you intend to make him aware of the mission no i dont think that will be necessary banning said but i will tell him what im now going to tell you there will be a corporal mccoy along on the convoy they call him killer and killer mccoy works for me and when killer mccoy makes a suggestion about what route the convoy is to take or not to take or what the personnel on the convoy are or are not to do that suggestion is to be interpreted as being an order from me killer mccoy why do they call him killer they call him killer banning said matteroffactly because four italian marines attacked him he killed two of them with a baby fairbairn excuse me with a what theres a rather interesting englishman captain bruce fairbairn on the shanghai municipal police banning explained he knows more about handtohand combat jujitsu and the other martial disciplines than anybody else he invented a knife a long narrow sharpasarazor dagger which incidentally general butler tried to get the corps to buy and issue anyway there is a smaller more concealable version the big knife is called the fairbairn and the smaller one the baby fairbairn and your noncom killed two people with it two italian marines banning said and there was no courtmartial sessions asked banning shook his head no he knifed two people to death and thats it it was selfdefense banning said there were witnesses two plainclothes chinese policemen that was the end of it the italians are stillthis happened right after the new year pretty upset about it and mccoy is something of a celebrity among the troops including the japanese who admire that sort of thing the japanese dont know that he works for me of course only a few people do on paper hes assigned to the motor pool i can hardly wait to meet this man sessions said i think lieutenant sessions that you will find corporal mccoy very interesting and perhaps even educational banning said he speaks chinese and japanese and even reads a little bit of it and hes been making this run twice a month for six months hes a good man he uncovered the whole motorization business and he took the photographs i presume youve seen ive seen the photographs sessions said im a little worried about the reaction of the missionaries to corporal mccoy banning said why do you say that as a general rule of thumb lieutenant sessions banning said i have found that most missionaries consider the marines the tools of satan our enlisted men fornicate with chinese women and our officers support the sinful repression of the natives now the japanese enlisted men rape the chinese women and japanese officers order the heads sliced from chinese they judge unenthusiastic about the greater japanese coprosperity sphere but that doesnt bother the missionaries for the japanese are heathens and that sort of thing is to be expected of them the reverend feller does not quite fit that picture captain lieutenant sessions said he really hates the japanese oh during his previous service here he saw enough of the japanese to see them for what they are he was present at the rape of nanking for example and believes that the promise of china can only be realized after the japanese are expelled he recognizes that can only happen with our assistance i presume he knows that were neutral in this war banning asked dryly apparently he believes were going to get in it sooner or later sessions said and in the meantime is anxious to help even when that means a personal sacrifice what does that mean it would have been far more convenient for him to remain in the united states and simply send for mrs feller i have no idea what youre talking about banning said the reverend feller was summoned home for conferences with his superiors while he was there his church decided that he would not be returning to china you mean he got fired no he was given a bigger job his wife remained in china when he went to the united states she could have returned to the united states by herself which would have been far more convenient for all concerned but he elected instead to make the voyage over here to settle his replacement in his job to help me in my mission and to take mrs feller back with him this was all really unnecessary but he did it anyway a real selfsacrificing patriot huh banning said wondering what the reverends real purpose was there were stories of missionaries accumulating chests of valuable chinese antiques so many stories that all of them could not be discounted and what better way to carry valuable antiques out of china than under protection of the us marine corps i dont think thats quite fair sir sessions said banning didnt want to get into a discussion of missionary antiques and changed the subject christ i hope both the reverend and you are wrong about us getting into a war with the japs he said sessions looked at him in surprise it was not the sort of remark he expected from a marine officer lieutenant banning said patiently certainly you can understand what a logistic horror it would be to attempt to field one division over here this isnt nicaragua china could swallow the entire world war i american expeditionary force without a burp ive thought about that sir sessions said banning looked at sessions with annoyance another alwaysagreewiththesuperiorofficer asskisser like macklin then he changed his mind sessions was just saying what he was really thinking have you banning asked eventually we may have to face that logistic horror sessions said i really thought we were going to take action when the japanese sank the panay the uss panay a gunboat of the yangtze river patrol was attacked and sunk with many americans killed and wounded by japanese aircraft in tell me more about the reverend feller banning said there was no point in discussing whether a force large enough to do any good could be deployed in china with an officer who had just gotten off the boat he is willing to help us in any way he can sessions said consistent of course with his religious principles banning thought but did not say that there was very little then that the good reverend would be able to do the principles of religion seemed to disagree almost entirely with the principles and practice of gathering intelligence the more he thought about it the more he thought it was likely that the reverend fellers motive in returning to china had less to do with patriotism than it did with transporting a case or cases of chinese antiques back to the states as a practical matter lieutenant banning said i am more concerned with the reverend fellers reaction to corporal mccoy i dont think i follow you for one thing on the way back and forth to peking mccoy spends a lot of time drunk usually in brothels i dont want the reverend or anyone else interfering with that or anything else that mccoy might do i understand sir sessions said immediately banning looked at him and was somewhat surprised to see that he did in fact understand why mccoy spent a lot of time in brothels did the missionaries weather the trip well banning asked how soon can they be ready to start theyre in the hotel metropole sessions said they can leave just as soon as their vehicles have been serviced ill send mccoy over to the hotel in the morning banning said the japanese will hear of it immediately of course but they wont think anything about it after i tell them that he will be taking your missionaries with him to peking what hell do at the hotel is what he would be expected to do which is get the missionary vehicles in condition to roll tell the reverend feller that it will be his responsibility to bring his vehicles here to be examined and to provide two extra wheels and four extra tires and tubes for each of them that sort of thing where is feller going to get wheels and tires you can buy anything you want in shanghai banning said wouldnt it make more sense to have corporal mccoy get the wheels and tires for him i have some funds the only reason a corporal of marines would go shopping for a missionary banning said would be if he were ordered to and the japanese would then wonder why the marines were going out of their way to be nice to a couple of missionarieswhy these missionaries were different from any of the others sessions winced and exhaled audibly ive got a lot to learn dont i im sure that corporal mccoy will be happy to point out the more significant rocks and shoals to you banning said the most dangerous shoal would be getting caught in a compromising position sessions said what would happen if the japanese detain or arrest me and charge me with espionage the thing to do of course is not get yourself arrested and the way to do that is to listen to killer mccoy if he says dont go somewhere dont go somewhere chapter three one the metropole hotel shanghai china may none of his peers was surprised when corporal kenneth j killer mccoy usmc took an offthecompound apartment immediately after his return from the first get him out of sight trip to peking he was now a corporal and most of the noncommissioned officers of the th regiment of marines in shanghai had both a billet and a place where they actually lived mccoys billet appropriate to a corporal was half of a small room not unlike a cell in one of the twostory brick buildings that served the headquarters company first battalion as barracks it was furnished with a steel cot on which rested a mattress two blankets two sheets a pillow and a pillow case a wall locker and a footlocker filled with the uniforms and accoutrements prescribed for a corporal of marines with the exception of an issue mirror mounted to the door that was all there was not even a folding chair mccoy shared his billet with a staff sergeant assigned to the office of the battalion s officer supply the two of them split the cost of a chinese room boy actually a thirtyfiveyearold man who daily visited the room polished the floor washed the windows tightened the blankets on the bunks touched up the gloss of the boots and shoes polished the brass saw that the uniforms and accoutrements were shipshape and in every way kept things shipshape before inspections that corporal mccoy and staff sergeant patrick odell were obliged to attend and there was at least one such scheduled inspection every month on payday chong lee the room boy would remove from the wall locker and the footlocker those items of uniform and accoutrements that were required by marine regulation and lay them out on the bunks precisely in the prescribed manner to prepare for the monthly inspection of personnel in billets it was only necessary for staff sergeant odell and corporal mccoy to go to the arms room and draw their springfield model rifles and the bayonets for them ensure they were clean and proceed to their billet the gunnery sergeant of headquarters company first battalion th marines was a salty old sonofabitch who drew the line at some fucking chink having access to the weapons his men would fucking well clean their own pieces the assignment of staff sergeant odell and corporal mccoy to the same room was a matter of convenience they did not like each other and sometimes the only time they spoke was when they met once a month for the scheduled inspection the only thing they had in common was that neither of them had responsibility for the company supervision of subordinates the six other enlisted men assigned to battalion s were supervised outside the office by the assistant s corporal corporal williamson after his promotion and return from the first get him out of sight trip to peking corporal mccoy had been officially transferred from dog company to headquarters company and assigned to the motor pool whether as some reasonedit had been decided to continue to keep him out of sight of the italians or whetheras others reasonedthat to get right down to it mccoy didnt know his ass from left field about being a motor pool corporal he had been given the more or less permanent assignment of riding the supply convoys to peking that kept him out of town more than he was in shanghai the result was that since he didnt have a shack job and since he was gone so often the first sergeant and the gunny had decided there was no sense in putting him on duty rosters if more often than not he wouldnt be around when the duty came up and then after sometimes three or four weeks spent bouncing his ass around in the cab of a studebaker truck it seemed only fair to give him liberty when he was in shanghai for all practical purposes then he didnt have any company duties when he wasnt off with one of the supply convoys and it was understandable that he didnt want to hang around the billet waiting for some odd job to come up when he was in shanghai he stood the reveille formation after that nobody saw him until reveille the next morning he needed an apartment you couldnt spend all day in bars and whorehouses most of his peers found nothing wrong with the way mccoy was playing the game most of them had themselves made one or more trips away from shanghai in truck convoys for the first couple of hours maybe even the first couple of days it was okay but then it became nothing but a bumpy road going on for fucking ever broken only by meals and piss calls and the meals were either cold canned rations or something chink like fried chunks of fucking dog meat but there were a fewgenerally lowerranking noncommissioned officers with eight or more years of servicewho held contrary opinions the goddamned corps was obviously going to hell in a handbasket if a candyass sonofabitch with parris island sand still in his boots gets to be a corporal just starting his second fucking hitch for christs sake instead of having his ass shipped in irons to portsmouth for cutting up them italian marines what his peers did not knowand what mccoy was under orders not to tell themwas that not only did he have an apartment with a telephone but that the corps was paying for it the less the other enlisted men knew about the real nature of mccoys s duty the better getting him out of the billets would help and there was another secret from the troops shared only by the colonel who had to sign the authorizations captain banning and the finance sergeant mccoy had been given a onetime cash grant of for the purchase of suitable civilian clothing necessary in the performance of his military duty and was drawing rations and quarters allowance corporal kenneth j mccoys apartment was on the top floor of a threestory building in putung it was not at all elaborate and it was small one large room with a bed in a curtained alcove and a tiny bathroom shower no tub in another there was no kitchen but he had installed an electric hot plate so that he could make coffee and he had an icebox to cool his beer but there was a tiny balcony shielded from view large enough for just one chair on which he could sit when he had the time and watch the boat traffic on soochow creek there was a restaurant in the adjacent building if he wanted something to eat all he had to do was put his head out the window and yell at the cook and food would be delivered to him he often got breakfast like that yelling down for a couple of threeminute eggs and a pot of tea and sometimes late at night when he was hungry hed call down for some kind of chinese version of a western omelet eggs scrambled with onions bits of ham and sweet pepper he rarely ate in the nco mess of the th marines although the chow there was good it was just that there were so many places in shanghai to eat well and so cheaply that unless he just happened to be near the mess at chow time it didnt seem worth the effort to take a meal there the building on the other side was a brothel the golden dragon club where he had run an account for nearly as long as hed been stationed in shanghai it was through his friend piotr petrovich muller he had found the apartment piotr had known the proprietor of the golden dragon in the good old days back in holy mother russia the man had an unpronounceable name but that didnt matter because he liked to be called general he claimed mccoy was sure he was lying that he had been a general in the army of the czar when he had first moved into the apartment mccoy had played vingtetun with the general long enough for the both of them to recognize the other was not a pigeon to be plucked they had become more or less friends afterwards despite the differences in their age and rank most of the items on the monthly bill the general rendered were for services not connected with the twentyodd girls in the generals employ the generals people cleaned mccoys apartment and did his laundry and then there were bar charges and food charges the girls themselves were more than okay mostly they were chinese who ranged from very pretty to very elegant no peasant wenches in the generals establishment but there were a few indochinese and two white russians as well mccoy actually believed that the general who exhibited a certain officertype arrogance had most probably been an officer if not officially a general in the czarist army something like captain or maybe major was what he probably had been when like so many other white russian generals he had come penniless and stateless to shanghai twenty years before mccoy didnt like to think how the general had survived at firstprobably as a pimp possibly by strongarm robberybut he was now inarguably a success he had an elegant apartment in one of the newer buildings to which he sometimes invited mccoy for a russian dinner he drove a new american buick and he had a number of successful business interests now some of them perfectly legal in addition to the golden dragon there were eight sets of khakis hanging in the wardrobe when mccoy naked and still dripping from his shower walked across the room and opened it they were not issue his issue khakis hung in his wall locker at the barracks these uniforms were tailormade the shirts had cost him sixty cents american and the trousers ninety the field scarves neckties had been a nickel and the belt stitched layers of khaki a dime the belt was not regulation regulation was web but mccoy knew that the only time anything would ever be said about it was at a formal inspection and he hardly ever stood one of those anymore neither were his chevrons regulation regulation chevrons were embroidered onto a piece of khaki and then sewn onto the shirt mccoys chevrons and those of the gunnery sergeant had been embroidered directly onto their shirts if it was good enough for the gunny mccoy had reasoned it was good enough for him and now that he had made corporal he knew that the shirts would be worn out long before he would make sergeant the shirt and trousers were stiffly starched they would not stay that way long it was already getting humid shanghai was as far south as new orleans and every bit as muggy before long the starch would wilt and it was more than likely that he would have to change uniforms when he went to the compound which is where he had to go after he introduced himself to the reverend feller who was staying at the hotel metropole he did not wish to give the assholes in motor transport any opportunity to spread it around that killer mccoy had shown up in a sweaty uniform looking like a fucking chinaman when he was dressed with his field scarf held in place with the prescribed usmc tie clasp there was no longer any question that he would need another uniform before the day was over he decided that it made more sense to take one with him than to use one of the issue uniforms in his billet he could change in the motor pool head and avoid going to the barracks at all carrying an extra uniform on a hanger he left the apartment and trotted down the stairs he did not lock the apartment the way that worked was that there were some westerners whose apartments were robbable and some whose apartments were not it had nothing to do with locks on doors and bars over windows the trick was to get yourself on the list of those whose apartments were safe one way to do this was to have it known that you were friendly with a shanghai policeman and the other was to be friendly with the chief of the tong whom the association had granted burglary privileges in your area mccoys apartment was twice safe when he was in town he continued to gamble regularly with both detective sergeant lester chatworth of the shanghai police and not at the same time of course but when the local celebrity honored the golden dragon with his presence with lon ciiang head of the poti tong on the crowded street he stopped first to buy a rice cake and then flagged down a rickshaw he told the boy a wiry leatherskinned man of maybe twentyfive to please take him to the hotel metropole and the boy swung around to look at him in unabashed curiosity it always shocked the chinese to encounter a white face who spoke their language when the rickshaw delivered him in front of the hotel metropole there were several europeans in shanghai that included americans among them a quartet of british officers standing on the sidewalk there the civilians looked at him with distaste the officers with curiosity when mccoy saluted crisply one of the officers as he returned the salute with a casual wave of his swagger stick gave him a faint smile he is giving me the benefit of the doubt mccoy thought deciding that i wouldnt be coming here unless i were on duty the civilians just dont like a place like this under any circumstances fouled by the presence of a marine enlisted man he went to the desk and asked for the room number of the reverend mr feller captain banning had been specific on the telephone about that the missionary named sessions was really a marine lieutenant but mccoy was to deal with a reverend feller and not the lieutenant as he crossed the lobby to the elevators one of the bellboys offered to relieve him of the spare uniform but mccoy waved him away the elevators were contained within an ornate metal framework and the cage itself was glassed in as it rose it gave mccoy a view of the entire lobby the potted palms the leather couches and chairs the hotel guests the men already in linen and seersucker suits and the women in their summer dresses he could see the outlines of underwear beneath some of the dresses and in the right light some of the womenthe younger ones mostlyshowed ghostly lovely legs mccoy saw few european women he hadnt he thought spoken to a european woman in over six months the only exceptions being the generals two russian whores and they didnt really count he walked down the wide carpeted corridor to and knocked at the door who is it an american female voice called after a moment corporal mccoy maam he called out of the fourth marines im here to see reverend feller oh my she said he heard in the tone of her voice either displeasure or fright that he was here he wondered what the hell that was all about the door opened im mrs moore she said please come in ill have to fetch the reverend hes with mr sessions she was a large woman big boned just on the wrong side of fat she was mccoy judged maybe forty with the wellscrubbed makeupfree face of a woman who took religion seriously she had light brown hair braided and pinned to the side of her head and she wore a cotton dress with long sleeves and buttons fastened up to the throat hanging from her neck was a fourinch christian cross made of wood thank you mccoy said are you the man who was originally supposed to come she asked i dont think i understand you mccoy said it doesnt matter she said ill go fetch the reverend feller she added smiling uneasily at him she slid past him to the door as if she were afraid he would pick her up carry her into the adjacent bedroom throw her on the bed and work his sinful ways on her the thought amused him and he smiled which discomfited her further he decided hed have a word with the people in the convoy to watch what they said and did with her around if somebody said fuck she would faint then her husband would bitch to the lieutenant in civilian clothes and he would make trouble a minute later the reverend glen t feller entered the room he wore a broad toothy smile and his hand was extended farther than mccoy believed was anatomically possible he was of average height slim with dark hair plastered carefully to his skull and a pencilline mustache he was immaculately shaven and mccoy could smell his aftershave cologne im the reverend feller he said im happy to meet you corporal and im sorry i wasnt here when you came no problem sir mccoy said the reverend fellers hand was soft clammy and limp mccoy was a little repelled but not surprised it was the sort of hand he expected to find on a missionary mrs moore moved around them so as to stand behind the reverend and put him between herself and mccoy there was a rap at the door and then mr sessions entered the room even in the civilian clothes mccoy decided this guy looks like hes an officer but like a regular platoon leader not a hotshot intelligence officer from headquarters usmc in washington youre corporal mccoy sessions asked surprised the one they call killer some people have called me that mccoy said uncomfortably youre not quite what i expected corporal from the way captain banning spoke of you sessions said well shit lieutenant neither are you well im mccoy he said he was aware that mrs moore was looking at him very strangely he decided she had heard all about the italian marines how long have you been in the corps corporal lieutenant sessions asked about four years mccoy said there arent very many men who make corporal in four years sessions said or as young as you are mccoy looked at him but said nothing how old are you corporal twenty one sir corporal killer mccoy said presuming captain banning was not pulling your leg ed the reverend feller said laughing we must presume the killers bite is considerably worse than his bark i dont like this sonofabitch mccoy thought killer the reverend feller said we place ourselves in your capable hands i said some people call me that reverend mccoy said i didnt mean you could well im very sorry corporal the reverend feller said he looked at sessions as if waiting for him to remind corporal mccoy that he was speaking to a highranking missionary when sessions was silent feller said i dont want us to get off on the wrong foot no hard feelings no mccoy said two motor pool first bn th marines shanghai china may the christian missionary alliance vehicles had been taken from the docks to the motor pool of the first battalion th marines where they were carefully examined by sergeant ernst zimmerman who was the assistant motor transport supervisor and would be the ncoic noncommissioned officer in charge of the peking convoy the vehicles were greased and their oil was changed and just to be on the safe side ernie zimmerman changed the points and condensors and cleaned and gapped the spark plugs zimmerman at twentysix was already on his third hitch and had been in china since he was a phlegmatic man stocky tightly muscled with short stubby fingers on hands that were surprisingly immaculate considering that he spent most of his duty time bent over the fender of one vehicle or another doing himself what he did not tryst the private and pfc mechanics to do he lived with a slight chinese woman who had born him three children she and the children had learned to speak german though he understood much more chinese than he let on zimmerman spoke little more than he had the day hed carried his sea bag down the gangway of the naval transport uss henderson more than six years before at hours two hours before the convoy was to get underway a meeting was held in the motor pool office a small wooden building at the entrance to the motor pool the motor pool itself was a barbedwirefenced enclosure within the first battalion compound present were lieutenant john macklin who would again be the officer in charge of the convoy sergeant zimmerman corporal mccoy and the eight other enlisted men of the convoy detail they had just spread maps out on the dispatchers table when they were joined by captain edward banning the usual route the convoy traveled could not be followed on this trip because of the necessity to stop at the six christian missionary alliance missions the first deviation would be to nanking normally they turned off the shanghainanking highway onto a dirt road just past wuhsi fifty miles down that road was the ferry across the yangtze river between chiangyin and chenchiang it would now be necessary to enter nanking drop off supplies for the christian missionary alliance there and pick up the reverend fellers wife her luggage and their household goods it was a hundred miles from where they normally turned off a twohundredmile round trip because it still made good sense to cross the yangtze between chiangyin and chenchiang it has been suggested sir lieutenant macklin said to captain banning that at the turnoff point for chiangyin we detach from the convoy one of the studebaker automobiles the wrecker and the missionary truck with the nanking supplies the rest of the convoy would go onto chiangyin and wait for the others to return from nanking there that would mean spending the night in nanking there was no question in sergeant ernst zimmermans mind who had made the suggestion and he was not at all surprised when captain banning said that seems to make more sense than having the whole convoy make the round trip banning continued why dont you have mccoy drive the civilian car that would make sort of a marine detachment with the wrecker to accompany the missionary vehicles aye aye sir lieutenant macklin said there was therefore sergeant ernie zimmerman concluded some reason for mccoy to go to nanking as there was obviously some reason why mccoy had been given the convoy as kind of a primary duty he had not been told what that reason was and he had no intention of asking if they wanted him to know they would have told him he believed the key to a successful career in the corps was to do what you were told to do as well as you could and ask no questions and to keep your eyes open so that you noticed strange little things like the fact the regimental s paid a lot of attention to a truck convoy that was really none of an intelligence officers business and that the real man in charge of the convoys was not whichever officer happened to be sent along but corporal killer mccoy it took about an hour to decideand mark on the three maps they would take with themwhere the convoy would leave their normal route to visit the other five missions where they would be stopping then lieutenant macklin sent the enlisted men to the arms room to draw their weapons each marine drew a colt model a acp pistol with three charged magazines two pfcs drew browning automatic rifles caliber together with five charged twentyround magazines sergeant zimmerman and corporal mccoy drew thompson submachine guns caliber acp with two fiftyround drum magazines everybody else took their assigned springfield model rifles from the arms room there was also a prepacked ammo load sealed cases of ammunition for all the weapons plus a sealed case of fragmentation grenades there never had been any trouble on the peking convoys sergeant zimmerman unaware that he was in complete agreement with the colonel believed this was because the convoy detail was heavily armed there were nine vehicles in the convoy when it rolled out of the first battalion compound four marine corps studebaker tonandahalf trucks with canvas roofs suspended over the beds on wooden bows two christian missionary alliance trucks also studebakers differing from the marine trucks only in that they did not have a steel protective grill mounted to the frame two gray studebaker captain sedans with the christian missionary alliance insignia a burning cross and a legend in chinese ideograms painted on their doors and bringing up the rear was the homemade pickupwrecker stacked high with spare tires and wheels sergeant zimmerman drove the wrecker he usually rode in it as a passenger but its normal driver was at the wheel of one of the missionary trucks the second missionary truck was driven by a marine who ordinarily would have been assistant driver on one of the trucks lieutenant macklin drove one of the missionary studebakers and corporal mccoy the other as the trucks made their way through heavy traffic toward the nanking highway the passenger cars left the convoy and went to the hotel metropole to pick up the missionaries zimmerman was not surprised when they had to wait by the side of the nanking highway for more than an hour for the missionaries missionaries were fucking civilians and fucking civilians were always late the first hundred miles went quickly the japanese army kept the nanking highway and the rail line that ran parallel to it in good shape every twenty miles or so near intersections there were japanese checkpoints two or three soldiers under a corporal but they just waved the convoy through long lines of chinese however were backed up at every checkpoint it was less a search for contraband mccoy thought than a reminder of japanese authority just past wuhsi two and a half hours into the journey the convoy rolled through another japanese checkpoint then turned off the highway onto a gravel road which led fifty miles away to the ferry between chiangyin and chenchiang once they had reached the ferry the reverend feller mr sessions and mrs moore got in the back seat of the studebaker mccoy was driving and trailed by one of the missionary trucks headed down the highway for nanking the rest of the convoy led by lieutenant macklin in the other missionary studebaker started off toward chiangyin it was the rainy season and predictably it began to rain buckets the road turned slick and treacherous and it took them nearly as long to make that fifty miles as it had to come from shanghai to wuhsi three christian missionary alliance mission nanking china hours may nanking was a curious mixture of east and west ancient and modern the tallest building in the city for instance was not a modern skyscraper but the porcelain tower an octagon of white glazed bricks feet tall built five hundred years before by the emperor yung lo to memorialize the virtues of his mother recently from until nanking had been the capital of the republic of china but in the japanese had captured it in a vicious battle followed by bloody carnage their victory was soon known as the rape of nanking there had nevertheless still been time for chiang kaisheks kuomintang government to make their modern mark on it outside of town was the sun yatsen mausoleum honoring the founder of the chinese republic and within the city half a dozen large westernstyle office buildings were built on wide avenues to house governmental ministries there was also a modern railroad station and a large airport after the rape of nanking in the correct belief that representatives of the foreign press whom they could not bar from china would all immediately head for nanking the japanese had made a point of keeping nanking peaceful only a handful of military units were stationed there and they were on their good behavior when in the interests of furthering the greater japanese asian coprosperity sphere it became necessary to slice off some heads the persons designated were first removed from nanking the christian missionary alliance mission was in an ancient part of town close to the yangtze and within sight of the cranes on the docks the mission covered a little more than two acres which were enclosed by walls directly across from the gate a fourhundredyearold graniteblock building had been converted to a chapel a wooden goldpainted cross sat atop it there were two large wooden crates in the courtyard of the mission obviously the household goods of the fellers captain banning had told mccoy of his suspicions about their contents and now he wondered idly if the captain was right then more practically he wondered how they were going to load the crates onto the trucks the damn things probably weighed a ton a woman who was almost certainly mrs feller appeared in the courtyard as the truck and car drove through the gate she was more or less what mccoy expected a somewhat thinner somewhat younger copy of mrs moorea wellscrubbed makeupfree dogooder she even wore her hair the same way braided and then pinned to the sides of her head but unlike mrs moore mccoy noticed she had goodlooking legs trim hips and an interesting set of knockers she kissed her husband like a nun kisses a relative on the cheek as if a little uncomfortable with that little bit of passion when the reverend feller marched her over to the car and introduced her mccoy was surprised that her hand was warm he had expected it to be sort of clammy like her husbands she had a boy show mccoy and pfc everly the tall gangly hillbilly driving the missionary truck where they were to sleep except for a bible on a bedside table and a brightly colored framed lithograph of jesus christ gathering children around his knee it was very much like mccoys billet in the first battalion compound in shanghai a steel cot bedclothes a chair and nothing else sessions came to the room shortly after the mission boy left them there could i have a word with you corporal mccoy he asked take a walk why dont you everly mccoy ordered where am i supposed to go see if you can scout up a decentlooking place for us to eat come back in fifteen minutes when he was gone sessions said mrs feller has asked you to supper mccoy everly and i will get something mccoy said she meant the both of you of course sessions said youre welcome you understand shes really a very nice person lieutenant i didnt come here to eat supper with missionaries mccoy said im going out on the town in the line of duty of course sessions said sarcastically the corpss paying for it mccoy said why not yes of course sessions said is there anything of interest here that i could credibly have a look at theres kempeitai the japanese security police watching this place theyre not going to think much if two marines leave here to get their ashes hauled they might get very curious if a newly arrived missionary did the same thing i wasnt thinking of going to a brothel sessions replied chuckling i was suggesting that it would be credible if the fellers while i was here showed me the sights and that while so doing i might come across something of interest if the japs have german artillery its not going to be here in nanking mccoy said flatly and i think the less attention you call to yourself the better it would be mccoy i am simply trying to do my job sessions said annoyed at what he considered mccoys condescension he wondered what captain banning had told mccoy about him thats all im trying to do lieutenant mccoy said captain banning said i was to do what i could for you and thats what im trying to do as the whores later confirmed nothing was happening in nanking so at half past ten mccoy decided that there wasnt anything more to be gained from spending the night in the whorehouse he put on his clothes paid off his girl and went to the room everly had taken im heading back in he told everly who was standing there in the doorway a little dazzled by the interruption he had wrapped a towel around his middle it threatened to fall do i have to he said just be at the mission at five oclock mccoy said after a moment everly was a fucker not a fighter and he didnt drink dangerously there was little chance that he would get in trouble on the other hand if he spent the night in the whorehouse it would give the kempeitai agents who had trailed them something to do and the report they would write would state that a marine had hired a whore for the night and stayed with her he returned to the mission and searched in vain through the small mission library for something that had nothing to do with christianity then disappointed he retreated to his room undressed to his skivvies and took from his musette bag one of the copies of the shanghai post that had accumulated during his last trip to shanghai after hed read it he started in on the crossword puzzle someone knocked at the door certain that it was the boy he called permission to enter in chinese it was mrs feller a very different mrs feller from the tightassed lady he had met that afternoon she was wearing a cotton bathrobe over a silk gown and her hair was free now hanging halfway down her back it was glossy and soft as though she had just brushed it then he noticedmore than noticedthe unrestrained breasts under her thin night clothes the reverend was about to get a little after what presumably was a long dry spell do you speak chinese she asked in chinese some mccoy said in english i just wanted to see if you or the other gentleman needed anything she said no maam mccoy said chuckling were fine thank you why are you chuckling she asked smiling hearing you call everly the other gentleman mccoy said where is he she asked when mccoy didnt reply her face flushed mrs moore told me an incredible story about you she said i cant believe its true what did she tell you now im sorry i brought this up she said i shouldnt have he nodded his acceptance of that but do they call you killer or were they just teasing my husband and mr sessions some people call me that mccoy said i dont like it much but youre just a boy she said after deciding that the rest of the story was also probablyif incrediblytrue i dont like to be called a boy either mccoy said im a corporal in the marine corps im really sorry i brought the whole thing up she said mccoy nodded breakfast will be at sixthirty she said my husband wants to get on the way early is that all right with you yes maam he said well be there thank you then ill say good night she said he thought that he would really have liked to get a look at her teats chinese women by and large didnt have very big teats and it had been a long time since he had seen an american womans teats come to think of it he had seen very few american womens teats before he had come to china it had been a really big deal to get a look at a set of teatsnot to mention actually getting laid but getting laid in china was about as outoftheordinary as blowing your nose and in fact he had come to see there was no big difference between chinese women and american the story that their pussies ran sideward had turned out to be so much bullshit but it would still be kind of nice to make it with a real american he would come to think of it really like to jump mrs feller though he immediately recognized that dream as the same kind of fantasy as wishing he would make sergeant next week out of the goddamned question for two hundred different reasons he turned his attention back to the crossword puzzle four the christian missionary alliance mission nanking china hours may the christians of the mission put on a little farewell ceremony for mrs feller after maybe fifty chinese had manhandled the wooden crates onto the bed of the studebaker they went to one side of the courtyard and stood in some kind of a formation mccoy settled into the front seat of the car and watched next came maybe fifty little chinese kids dressed in middieblouse uniforms which reminded mccoy of the uniform of the italian marines they lined up in four ranks finally the missionary equivalent of the officers appearedall the white christians and half a dozen suitwearing chinese christians they sat down on a row of chairs set up on a sort of platform against a wall one of them rose and said a prayer then the chinese kids sang a hymn in chinese mccoy recognized the melody but could not recall the words one of the chinese christians gave mrs feller a present she thanked him and they sang another hymn this time in english the reverend feller then gave what was either a sermon or a very long prayer then came another hymn all this time mccoy was looking up mrs fellers dress he hadnt started out to do that but the way she was sitting up on the platform and the way he was looking out the studebaker window thats where his eyes naturally fell and then it got worse he was originally looking at a lot of white thigh but then she had uncrossed her knees and put her feet flat on the little platform just far enough apart to show all the way up and she wasnt wearing any pants he didnt believe what he saw at first ladies didnt go around without their underpants and she was not only a lady she was a lady missionary but there was no question about it she was sitting there with everything showing and then lieutenant sessions came over and sat beside mccoy the minute he did mrs feller crossed her legs did she suddenly remember how she was sitting or didnt it matter since only an enlisted man was getting an eyeful or was she playing the cockteaser with me and stopped only because sessions showed up when the ceremony was finally over and the officertype christians walked with mrs feller to the studebaker mccoy did not get out from behind the wheel to open the door he had a hardon misterlieutenant sessions obviously anxious to get the show on the road again opened the door and motioned for mrs feller to get in if you dont mind mr sessions mrs feller said ill sit with corporal mccoy i get woozy if i ride in backseats she got in beside mccoy and smiled at him im sorry you had to wait she said no sweat mccoy said devoting all of his attention to starting the engine i always wondered how you did that she said did what he asked in spite of his misgivings curiosity forced him to look at her she was holding up his hat press a device that keeps the brim of the felt campaign hat from curling he had put his campaign hat in it when hed got in the car it was the rainy season and humidity was hell on fur felt hats oh mccoy said that she put the hat press back where it had been very clever she said okay to go mccoy asked get the show on the road mccoy sessions said mrs feller waved to the christians and blew several of them a kiss for somebody who got screwed as much as she probably got screwed last night having been away from the reverend all that time mccoy thought she dont look all that worn out then he realized he was wrong about that the reason she was going around without any underpants was that she and the reverend had screwed it sore she half turned on the seat pulling her dress above her knees in the process and started talking to sessions where are you from and where is your wife from and how much do you like the marine corps that sort of thing mccoy kept his eyes off her knees as much as he could he had it made now he told himself it would be real dumb fucking that up by doing something dumb with this missionary woman he had probably the best duty of any corporal in the corps for all practical purposes he didnt have anybody telling him what to do and the corps was paying all his expenses even what he spent getting laid and it was even better than that when he filled out the report of expenses captain banning made him do about once a month he put down on it usually twice sometimes three times what it really cost him he wasnt greedy and captain banning probably thought he was getting a bargain but the prices mccoy listed on the report were what marines would be expected to pay for a room a meal a whore or whatever marines who spoke chinese didnt pay half what marines who didnt speak chinese did not a month had passed since hed gone to work for banning that he hadnt been able to add a hundred dollars to his retirementfund account at barclays bank and that didnt include his gambling money they always spent two days in the marine compound at tientsin on the way to peking then two days in peking and then another day at tientsin on the way back to shanghai as regular as clockwork hed been taking ten fifteen dollars a night from the tientsin and peking marines he hadnt been greedy which wasnt easy because there were tientsin and peking marines who played poker so bad it was sometimes hard not to clean them out it was hard to believe how much money he had in barclays bank and he could fuck the whole thing up by doing something stupid with this missionary who went around without her underpants when they were out of nanking the humidity started to close in so bad that the outside of the windshield kept clouding over and he had to run the wipers every once in a while it would be better whenever it started to rain he wished it would start soon mrs feller glanced at mccoy to make sure he had his eyes on the road then she took a little bottle of perfume or cologne from her purse and shook a tiny dab of it on a handkerchief she touched her temples with it and her ears and her forehead and then quickly opened a couple of buttons on her dress and rubbed a little in the crack between her breasts mccoys erection was painful he was sure to make it worse that she had seen him looking goddamn these missionaries anyway if the corps had wanted to find out if the th jap division had german artillery pieces i could have found out without dragging a bunch of fucking missionaries around with me it finally started to rain a steady soft rain that meant it would probably go on forever and now the inside of the windshield started to steam up mrs feller trying to be helpful kept wiping it with a handkerchief sometimes when she leaned over to wipe his window her hand rested on his knee and every time he could see her boobs straining against her brassiere and the thin cotton of her dress it was still raining when they reached the yangtze ferry at chiangyin mccoy was not pleased with what he found not only was one of the two ferries that normally worked the crossing tied up at a wharf and out of service but none of the other vehicles in the convoy had crossed over several hundred chinese were milling around a few drove trucks and half a dozen had oxcarts but mostly there were handpulled carts and people carrying huge bundles on their backs that meant that they would have to post a guard on every truck otherwise if they blinked they would have an empty truck zimmerman told mccoy that when he tried to load the vehicles the night before lieutenant macklin wouldnt let him macklin thought it would be better to wait on this side of the yangtze for the car and truck from nanking officer type thinking mccoy decided you had to keep your eyes on the bastards all the time or they would think of something smart like this the remaining ferry was going to require three trips to transport all of the vehicles so it was going to be at least an hour probably closer to an hour and a half before they were all across the river which was at least four miles across at that point mccoy went to lieutenant macklin and told him he thought it would probably be a good idea if he took one of the cars two marine trucks and one missionary truck on the first trip two of the three remaining trucks could cross on the second trip and the remaining truck the pickupwrecker and the other car could cross on the third if that was all right with lieutenant macklin there was a nice little restaurant in chenchiang on the far shore and mccoy could see no reason to remain on the near shore hungry while there was a commissioned officer and gentleman two if you counted sessions available to supervise the loading of the rear echelon and if he was just a little lucky hed be able to overhear a conversation or perhaps even join in one in the restaurant that might tell him something about japanese activity farther up the road lieutenant macklin thought that was as good a way to do it as any sergeant zimmerman can handle it by himself sir mccoy said if youd rather cross with the first load ill bring up the rear mccoy lieutenant macklin said as mccoy had been eighty percent sure he would you and sergeant zimmerman go over and see what you can do to get the men something to eat aye aye sir might as well let zimmerman feed his face first too mccoy liked zimmerman he was a placid quiet german who had found a home in the corps started a family with a chinese girl and did not resent mccoys unofficialif unmistakableauthority on the convoys the way some other senior noncoms did ernie had some kind of rice bowl going on the peking trips mccoy was sure but whatever it was he did it quietly and he didnt get falldown drunk in a whorehouse as soon as there was the chance ernie understood chinese too although for some strange reason he pretended he didnt he was also faster on the pickup than youd expect for instance he caught on right away to what mccoy wanted when mccoy suggested that he eat at a different restaurant from the big one mccoy was going to ernie would pick up whatever he could learn about any japanese activity farther up the road while he sipped slowly on a beer too bad lieutenant macklin wasnt as sharp mccoy thought the other two drivers mccoy took on the first ferry were pfcs and they were on their best behavior because making the trips got them out from under the harassment of the motor pool mccoy gave them his ritual one beer no more or ill have your ass speech confident that hed be obeyed when ernie came into the big restaurant six tables plus a low counter mccoy was gnawing on a nearly crystallized piece of duck skin ernie took off his widebrimmed campaign hat gave it several violent shakes to knock the water loose from the rain cover and then looked for and found mccoy ernie was a man of few words the other studebaker cars on the ferry mccoy nodded and ernie left mccoy shoved the rest of the crisp duck skin in his mouth daintily dipped his fingers into a bowl of warm water dried them and reached for his hat he put it on at the prescribed angle twisted his head around to seat the leather strap against the back of his head and started out of the restaurant then he changed his mind fuck him so macklin andor sessions sees me eating and having a beer so what he gave the proprietor a large bill and told him he would be back for his change after hed returned the empty beer bottle and the napkin he was taking with him then he walked quickly to the ferry keeping himself more importantly the campaign hat out of the rain as much as possible he didnt know why lieutenant macklin had decided to come in the second car rather than the third ferry trip but it didnt matter it was a tobeexpected thing for an officer any officerto do no matter what an enlisted man decided it could be improved upon by any officer thats why they were officers mccoy paid little attention to the studebaker until it was off the ferry and with its wheels slipping and skidding had made it up the road from the ferry slip then he stepped out from beneath the overhang of a building where he had been sheltered from the rain went into the middle of the road and made more or the less official corps hand signals to tell lieutenant macklin where the car should be parked but macklin wasnt driving the studebaker the lady missionary ol no underpants perfume on the teats herself was at the wheel and she was alone what the hells going on mccoy reclaimed the beer bottle he had been prepared to discard for either of the officers and walked nimblyavoiding puddles where possibleto where ol no underpants had parked she saw him coming and opened the door for him as he approached the way she leaned over the seat to reach the door he could see down her dress down where shed wiped perfume between her teats i hope im not interfering with anything corporal mccoy she said lieutenant macklin said it would be all right if i came now yes maam mccoy said i also thought she said that since there was no restaurant on that side maybe there would be one on this one im hungry yes maam mccoy said theres a restaurant here could you take me there yes maam ive got an umbrella she said and reached into the backseat for it he noticed that her breasts got in the way when she had it she handed it to him no maam mccoy said thank you just the same you mean youd get wet i mean that marines dont use umbrellas mccoy said its against the rules you mean yes maam dont you ever break the rules corporal she asked sometimes he said everybody breaks them sometime she said and this seems to be a good time for you to break this one he thought that sounded a little strange coming from a missionary but decided to share the umbrella with her there was no one here to see him who counted and it was raining steadily accepting the umbrella from her mccoy got out of the car opened the umbrella and walked around to the drivers side she slid out of the studebaker stepped under the umbrella closed the door and then took his arm her arm pressed against his and he could feel the heaviness of her breast he marched with her back to the restaurant shifting course to avoid the larger puddles the eyes of the proprietor widened without embarrassment when he saw the woman blond hair simply fascinated orientals he came to the table for their order what do you recommend she asked i had the duck mccoy said almost blurted the way they fix it in peking i dont like the duck much but the skins first rate then ill have that she said are you going to have anything ive had mine thank you mccoy said not even another beer i told the men they could have one beer mccoy said it wouldnt be right if i had two im sorry to hear that she said why he asked surprised because i would like a beer she said but i cant have one my husband doesnt like me to drink what you mean is you could have had a sip of mine she nodded her head conspiratorially there was something perversely pleasant in frustrating the morality of a missionary mccoy thought he told the proprietor to put a bottle of beer in a tea pot and to bring the lady a cup to go with it when it was delivered she said i thought that you were telling him something like this you did he asked your eyes lit up like a naughty boys she said he didnt know what to make of this missionary lady she was being much too friendly and he was well aware of the kind of relationship possible between american women and marines in china none american women probably because there were so few of them were on a sort of pedestal they were presumed to be ladies they wore gloves and hats and did no work and they did not speak to enlisted marines who were at the opposite end of the american social structureonly a half step above the chinese most american women in china pretended that marines were invisible they did not walk arm in arm with them under umbrellas or sit at tables with them in restaurants or look directlyalmost provocativelyinto their eyes he could only come up with two explanations for mrs reverend fellers behavior she could simply be acting according to her private idea of what it meant to be christian in other words treating him as a social equal out of some strange notion that everybody was really equal in the sight of god or else maybe she was in fact flirting with him or at least pretending to there were a couple of reasons that she might be doing just that one was that she had caught him looking at her when she was putting perfume on her teats and thought it was funny if that was the way it was then she knew she could tease him and have her fun in perfect safety because she knew that only a goddamned fool of a marine would make a pass at an american lady missionary and might even be hoping that he would say or do something out of line so that she could run and tell the reverend about it hed heard about that happening not with a missionary lady but with the wives of american businessmen theyd catch their husband with a chinese girl and decide to make it look like they were paying him back by getting some marine to start hanging around and panting with his tongue hanging out they had no intention of giving the poor fucker any they just wanted to let their old man know there was a marine with the hots for them and then if the old man went to the colonel and the marine wound up on the shit list that was his problem whatever mrs reverend feller was up toeven if she was just being christianit made him uncomfortable and he wanted nothing to do with it he changed the subject theres one good thing about the bad road mccoy said we can stay at chiehshom tonight its going to be too dark to go any farther today whats at chiehshom she asked looking at him over the edge of her teacup of beer a nice hotel he said built by a german the plumbing works in other words and the kitchens clean its on a hill over the lake you always stay there she asked normally we get a lot farther than this he said when you dont have to carry missionaries with you you mean i didnt say that mccoy said no but thats what you meant she said mccoy stood up and put his campaign hat on ill go down to the ferry and see whats up he said you can stay here youll be all right chapter four one chen chiang china hours may while the reverend feller lieutenant macklin and mr sessions ate in the big restaurant and the marine drivers at one of the tiny stalls ernie zimmerman took the opportunity once again to carefully check the vehicles paying particular attention to the tires changing a tire on a muddy road was bad enough but changing one in the rain at night was a royal fucking pain in the ass zimmerman found a couple of tires that looked as if they might blow one on a truck the other on one of the studebaker sedans and ordered them changed mccoy and zimmerman were watching a pfc remove the wheel of the car when lieutenant macklin and sessions walked up to them we about ready to roll sergeant lieutenant macklin asked aye aye sir zimmerman said well get everyone loaded up please macklin said wed like a word with corporal mccoy aye aye sir zimmerman said and walked off toward the food stalls where the drivers were eating macklin and sessions walked out of earshot of the driver changing the tire and mccoy followed them under the circumstances mccoy sessions said i decided that it was necessary to make lieutenant macklin aware of my real purpose in being here yes sir mccoy said he was not annoyed but neither was he surprised sessions was more than a little pissed about their conversation in nanking and it was clear that sessions was about to put him in his place as missionaries have no authority to order marine corporals around it was necessary to let macklin know who he actually was he had thus told macklin that he was an officer on a secret mission and now they were both thrilled about their importance in the scheme of thingsand prepared to deal with a lowly corporal who was standing in the way of their doing their duty captain banning had warned him this was likely to happen and weve been looking at the map sessions said lieutenant macklin thinks we can make it to chiehshom before it gets dark do you agree with that yes sir mccoy said its a good place to spend the night theres a good hotel there so lieutenant macklin tells me sessions said more importantly mccoy its not too far from yenchieng is it mccoys eyebrows went up as he looked at him the japanese th infantry division was at yenchieng no sir he said its not have you ever been to yenchieng mccoy sessions asked yes sir mccoy said do you know how the divisional artillery of the th japanese infantry is equipped yes sir mccoy said theyve got four batteries they call it a regiment of model s thats a mm antitank cannon but the japs use it as regular artillery because they can throw so much fire and the chinese have damned little to use for counterfire i want to check that out mccoy lieutenant sessions said sir i want to find out if the th division has been equipped with german pak panzerabwehrkanone caliber cm model cannon they havent mccoy said what theyve got lieutenant is maybe thirtyfive model s eight to a battery plus spares you seem very sure of that mccoy lieutenant macklin said yes sir i am you know the difference between the two cannon macklin pursued more than a little sarcastic the pak is bigger with a larger shield and larger wheels than the model mccoy said on the edge of insolence lieutenant macklin thought and it has a muzzle brake theyre not hard to tell apart and youre absolutely sure the th division doesnt have any of those cannon sessions asked i took some pictures of their artillery park a couple of weeks ago mccoy said thats what theyve got lieutenant thirty maybe thirtyfive s captain banning sent the pictures to washington but we have no way of knowing do we corporal mccoy whether or not the japanese have received german cannon since your last visit without having another look macklin asked sarcastically we have people watching the docks and the railroad and the roads if the th division had gotten any new artillery wed have heard about it we macklin asked sarcastically captain banning mccoy said accepting the rebuke has people watching the docks and the railroads and the roads under the circumstancesand after all we are so closeim afraid i cant just accept that lieutenant sessions said how long would you say it is by car from chiehshom to yenchieng if you drive down there lieutenant mccoy said theyre going to catch you and youll find yourself being entertained by the japs for a couple of days what do you mean by entertained theyll take you on maneuvers mccoy said walk you around in the swamps all night feed you raw fish that sort of thing he stopped and then his mouth ran away with him some of them have got a pretty good sense of humor they had lieutenant macklin three days one time thats quite enough mccoy macklin flared well then well just have to make sure they dont catch us wont we lieutenant sessions said lieutenant im not going to yenchieng with you mccoy said im sorry how long did you say it will take us to drive from chiehshom to yenchieng corporal sessions asked its about a twohour drive maybe two and a half with the roads like this and you presumably can manage the road at night sir im sorry but im not going to yenchieng with you mccoy said i didnt ask you if you had volunteered corporal lieutenant sessions said reasonably the decision to go has been made by lieutenant macklin and myself your presence will lend your knowledge of the terrain to our enterprise i dont have to remind you do i that despite your special relationship with captain banning you still remain subject to the orders of your superiors lieutenant mccoy said youre putting me on a spot the only spot youll be on macklin flared is if you persist in your defiance mccoy looked at him shrugged and took an envelope from his hip pocket he extended it toward sessions i think you better take a look at this lieutenant he said what is that sessions asked my orders sir in writing mccoy said captain banning said i wasnt to give them to you unless i had to i think i have to sessions took the envelope tore it open and unfolded the sheet of paper inside he glanced at the sheet and then shook his head what is it lieutenant macklin asked its a set of letter orders sessions said and then read it aloud headquarters th marines shanghai may subject letter orders to corporal kenneth j mccoy headquarters company first battalion th marines your confidential orders concerning the period may to june have been issued to you verbally by captain edward banning usmc you are reminded herewith that no officer or noncommissioned officer assigned or attached to the th regiment usmc is authorized to amend or countermand your orders in any way sessions looked at macklin corporal mccoys letter orders are signed by the colonel well ill be damned macklin said i never heard of such a thing lieutenant mccoy said to macklin i wish youd read those orders just what the hell do you mean by that macklin snapped with respect sir mccoy said id like to burn them go ahead and burn them macklin said coldly sessions handed the orders back to mccoy who ripped the single sheet of paper into long strips which he then carefully burned one at a time letting the wind blow the ashes and unburned stub from his fingers i presume your confidential verbal orders forbid you to go to yenchieng macklin asked when he had finished no sir except that captain banning said i was to use my own judgment if you wanted me to do something like that then you have not been forbidden to go to yenchieng youve taken that decision yourself sessions asked thats about the size of it sir mccoy said a very selfconfident young man sessions thought highly intelligent he almost certainly believes in what hes doing so where does that leave us i presume you have considered corporal macklin said icily that lieutenant sessionss interest in the cannon of the th division is not idle curiosity that he has been sent here by headquarters usmc yes sir mccoy said captain banning told me all about that and you are apparently unimpressed by my decision that knowing that for sure is worth whatever risk is entailed in going to yenchieng macklin asked coldly furious im convinced theres no way you could go there without getting caught mccoy said you have to go by road the first checkpoint you pass theyll phone ahead to the kempeitai and that will be it there are ways of getting around checkposts and the kempeitai macklin said you have done so that was different mccoy said that was different sir macklin corrected him that was different sir mccoy parroted well then perhaps youd be good enough to tell mr sessions and myself how you would go to yenchieng if i told you that it would look like i thought you could get away with it lieutenant mccoy said so you refuse even to help us macklin said incredulously mccoy pretended he hadnt heard the question and i dont see any point in taking the risk of going myself he said if they had any german cannon id know about it corporal lieutenant macklin said icily sarcastic i stand in awe of your selfconfidence yes sir mccoy said you will i hope tell us what you can about the location of the artillery park lieutenant sessions asked conversationally how we can find it aye aye sir mccoy said i hope youll make it clear to captain banning sir that i told you youre going to get caught oh yes corporal mccoy lieutenant macklin said you can count on our relating this incident to captain banning in detail two chiehshom shantung province china may the three classes of accommodation at the hotel am see at chiehshom had in descending order been originally intended for europeans european servants and chinese servants on mccoys first couple of trips to and from peking all the enlisted marines had been put up in the rooms set aside for european servants but on the last couple of trips like this one the management had made quite a show of giving the noncoms european roomssmall ones to be surein the main wing of the hotel mccoy realized that the proprietor had figured out that the sergeant rather than the officerincharge was the man who really decided by speeding up or slowing down where the convoy and its tenman detail would stop for the night that meant the sale of ten beds and twenty meals plus whatever they all had to drink there wasnt all that much business anyway mccoy really liked to stay at the hotel am see the food was good and the place was spotless and even the small rooms they gave the noncoms had enormous bathtubs with apparently limitless clean hot water he would take a bath at night a long soak and then a shower in the morning it was the only shower hed had in china that made his skin sting with the pressure all the others were like being rained on after settling into his room mccoy had hoped to have dinner with ernie zimmerman and be gone from the dining room before the officers and the fellers came down for dinner that would give him a chance both to avoid lieutenants macklin and sessions and to steel himself for another meeting with them that was scheduled for after dinner they wanted him to go over their route to and from yenchieng as pissed as the both of them were with him that was going to be bad enough without having dinner in the same room where they didnt think enlisted marines had any right to be anyway with them but ernie zimmerman got hung up somehow getting the other marines bedded down and was ten minutes late zimmerman and mccoy had no sooner sat down in the dining room when the officers and the fellers showed up mrs feller said something to the reverend and he came over and insisted that they all have dinner together mccoy thought the officers would be pissed eating in the same room with enlisted marines was bad enough but not as bad as having to share a table with them but they werent they were playing spy again mccoy saw and the dinner table gave them a stage for the playacting they thought was necessary mr sessions announced that he had asked lieutenant macklin if it would be all right if they spent two nights in chiehshom instead of the one originally planned the christian missionary alliance was considering opening another mission in yenchieng and they wanted to take advantage of being close to it to have a good look at it hes a goddamned fool mccoy thought theyre all goddamned fools they think they will look more innocent brazening it out two missionaries and a marine officer in full uniform simply out for a ride looking for a new place to save souls it will take the japs about ten minutes to learn theyve left here and there will be a greeting party waiting for them long before they get anywhere near yenchieng the only thing more dangerous than an officer convinced hes doing what duty requires is two officers doing the same thing two officers and a missionary they would be back in chiehshom by nightfall sessions said and spending the extra day would give sergeant zimmerman and his men the chance to go over the vehicles and make sure everything was shipshape youre not going with them corporal mccoy mrs feller asked to drive the car no maam mccoy said im not going along ernie zimmerman uncomfortable in the presence of the officers and fully aware there was some friction between them and mccoy bolted down his food and pushed himself wordlessly away from the table mccoy went after him ernie jack up one of the trucks and drop the drive shaft mccoy said what the hell for zimmerman demanded just do it ernie please mccoy said what are they up to zimmerman asked you heard it mccoy said what was that bullshit anyway just get somebody to drop a drive shaft ernie and make sure one of the cars is gassed and ready to go mccoy said then he went to his room to mark the route the damned fools should take to yenchieng when mccoy met with the three of them in sessionss room they made no further attempt to get him to take them to yenchieng this surprised him until he realized theyd concluded that their brilliant inspiration of brazening it out was going to work and they didnt need him after they came back from successfully spying on the japs theyd be in a position to rack his ass with banning for refusing to go with them they would have been right all along and he would have been nothing but an insolent enlisted man with the gall to challenge the wise judgment of his betters there was nothing he could do to stop them of course and except for having one of the missionary trucks jacked up and the drive shaft dropped so that it might fool the kempeitai watching the hotel there was nothing he could do to help them either but he set his portable alarm clock for halfpast four and went down to the courtyard to see them off mrs feller was there too the nipples of her teats sticking up under her bathrobe and her blond hair now unbraided hanging down her back jesus christ without her hair glued to her head shes a hell of a goodlooking woman i would give my left nut to get in the sack with her the officers and the missionary were a little carried away with the situation they saw themselves mccoy thought contemptuously as patriots about to embark on a great espionage mission mccoy had to temper his scorn however when sessions took him aside and told him dead serious that no matter what happened today he wanted him to understand that he understood his position this is one of those situations corporal where we both must do what we believe is right and i want you to know that i believe you thought long and hard about your obligations before you decided you couldnt go with me hes not so much of a prick as a virgin good luck lieutenant mccoy said and offered his hand what the hell it didnt cost anything to say that and if sessions means what he said then on the off chance they dont get bagged and macklin tries to get me in trouble maybe itll help as they walked back to the hotel mrs fellers leg kept coming out of the flap of her bathrobe and she kept trying to hold the robe closed he remembered that all through dinner she had kept bumping her knee accidentally against his mccoy was now convinced she was just fucking around with him getting some kind of sick kick out of trying to make him uncomfortable the way some people get a sick kick out of teasing a dog he intended to stay as far away from her as he could is there any interesting way you can think of to kill the time until they get back she asked when they were inside the hotel she goddamned well knows there are two or three meanings i could put on that until it starts to rain which should be about noon you could fish i suppose mccoy said theyve got tackle ive got to work on the trucks that doesnt sound very exciting she said i guess not he said turning and walking away from her down the corridor to his room he didnt see her at breakfast and he ate with the marines at lunch they asked him where the officers and the christer had gone and how long that would keep them all in chiehshom zimmerman had already told them he didnt know they said or else he wouldnt tell them mccoy told them he didnt know either at half past three a boy came to his room and told him that sergeant zimmerman wanted to see him in the lobby when mccoy went down there were two japanese soldiers with zimmerman a sergeant and a corporal they were both large for japanese and they were wearing leather jackets and puttees goggles hung loosely from leather helmets motorcycle messengers they bowed to mccoy and then saluted and he bowed back and returned the salute then zimmerman gave him two envelopes one addressed to him and the other to mrs feller this is addressed to you mccoy said i can read zimmerman said and they want me to sign for it i thought i better ask you one of the japanese soldiers then handed mccoy some kind of a form to sign he saw that it was just a message receipt form sign it he said to zimmerman what is it a confession that you eat babies for breakfast mccoy said zimmerman with obvious reluctance carefully wrote his name on the form he gave it to the japanese sergeant who bowed and saluted again then marched out of the lobby with the other japanese hopping along after him as he tore open the envelope and took out the message mccoy heard their motorcycle engines start from what his note said lieutenant macklin had obviously decided that the japanese were going to read it before they delivered it yenchieng sergeant zimmerman the reverend mr feller mr sessions and i have accepted the kind invitation of the commanding general of the th division of the imperial japanese army to inspect the division i will send further orders as necessary rb macklin lt usmc mccoy realized there was absolutely no i told you so pleasure in his reaction he felt sorry for them and he felt a little sorry for himself sooner if he could get through on the telephone now or later captain banning was going to eat his ass out for letting them get their asses in a crack well what the hell does it say zimmerman asked mccoy handed him the note i figured it was something like that zimmerman said how come you didnt go you knew they was going to get caught mccoy shrugged you figure the japsll find out sessions is an officer what makes you think hes an officer come on mccoy zimmerman said christ for his sake i hope not what do we do now we wait twentyfour maybe fortyeight hours to see what the japs do then what then i dont know mccoy said theres reason the guys have to hang around here but i dont want them getting shitfaced in case we need them okay zimmerman said he walked out of the hotel lobby and mccoy went up the wide stairs to the second floor and knocked on mrs fellers door when she opened it her hair was up in braids again and she was wearing a pale yellow dress just about covered with tiny little holes he handed her the letter addressed to her she raised her eyebrows questioningly and then tore open the envelope even with her hair up again she still looks pretty good and christ what teats when she had read the letter she raised her eyes and looked at him obviously expecting some comment from him nothing to be worried about he said theyll show them marching troops and barracks and feed them food they know they wont like and tonight theyll probably try hard to get them drunk but theres no danger or anything like that if there was they wouldnt have let them send the letters my husband doesnt drink she said he probably will tonight mccoy said she seemed to find that amusing he saw his letter says that you will look after me she said are you going to look after me yes maam he said starting at dinner i missed you at lunch i had something to do over lunch he said and im afraid ill be busy for dinner too if youd like i can ask sergeant zimmerman to have dinner with you that wont be necessary she said coldly fuck you too lady are you going to do anything about this she asked notify someone whats happened if i can get through on the phone mccoy said it turned out he couldnt get through to captain banning in shanghai which didnt surprise himand was actually a relief getting your ass chewed out was one of those things the longer you put off the better and then he realized there was a way he could avoid it entirely he thought it over a minute and went looking for ernie zimmerman three the hotel am see chiehshom shantung province hours may mccoy had just finished a hard day and night in the country and was now lowering himself all the way into a full tub hot clean water when there was a knock at his door come back later he yelled in chinese its ellen feller she said im in the bathtub her response to this was a heavy angrysounding pounding on the door wait a minute wait a minute he called im coming mccoy hoisted himself out of the tub wrapped a towel around his waist and walked dripping to the door the moment it was opened a crack she pushed past him into the room she was wearing her robe and her hair was again unbraided and hanging nearly to her waist when he came back she must have seen him from her window talking to ernie zimmerman in the courtyard he decided she walked to his small window turned and glared at him close the door or someone will see us in here she ordered in his junior year in st rose of lima high there had been a course in musical appreciation they had studied die walkure then that was what mrs ellen feller looked like now mccoy thought smiling obviously pissed off she stood stiff and stridentlooking with her long hair flowing her cheeks red and her teats awesome even under her bathrobea goddamned valkyrie what are you smiling about she demanded furiously then without waiting demanded even more angrily and where have you been i dont think thats any of your business mccoy said youve been laying up with some almondeyed whore in the village she accused furiously youve been gone all night dont hand me any of your missionary crap mccoy said angrily where i have been all night is none of your goddamned business what did you do come looking for me he could tell from the look in her eyes that she had indeed come to his room looking for him why he asked whats happened she shook her head nothing she said i just wondered where you were she added awkwardly mccoy was still angry so you could start playing games with me again he asked i dont know what youre talking about she said automatically you know goddamned well what im talking about he said so thats what you thought she said after a moment go find some clown in the mission he said warming to his subject if you get your kicks that way just leave people like me out of it how can you be so sure it was a game she asked huh mccoy snorted righteously maybe you should have considered the possibility that it wasnt a game and that you didnt have to go buy a woman she said maybe what you need corporal killer mccoy is a little more selfconfidence jesus christ he said whats your given name she asked ken kenneth he said without thinking then why because if im going to get in that bathtub with you and scrub the smell of your whore off you i thought it would be nice to know your name there was no whore he said she looked intently at him and almost visibly decided he was telling the truth she nodded her head then the bath can wait till later she said lock the door four room the hotel am see chiehshom shantung province hours may this is very nice ellen feller said picking the camera up from the chest of drawers and turning to look at him she was naked very expensive that was a question its a leica he said it belongs to the corps she held it up and pretended to aim it pity we cant use it she said i would like to have a memento of this of us for your husband to find he said she laughed and put the camera down it had been practically nonstop screwing with breaks only for meals and trips to make sure none of the marines had gone off on a drunk someplace but this was the first time either of them had mentioned her husband its possible he could walk in any minute mccoy said and catch us like this you dont have to worry about him she said but i wouldnt want to get you in trouble with your officers are they really likely to come back soon cant tell why wouldnt i have to worry about him you mean you couldnt tell not even from the way he looked at you what are you saying that hes a fairy she shrugged then why do you stay married to him he asked why did you marry him in the first place thats none of your business she said she leaned against the chest of drawers and arched her back she inhaled and ran her fingers across the flat of her belly and then she told him when i was fourteen my father had a religious experience she said do you know what that means no he admitted he accepted the lord jesus christ as his personal saviour ellen feller said evenly and brought his family my mother and me into the fold with him she didnt mind i dont suppose although i suspect shes a little uncomfortable with some of the brothers and sisters of the christian missionary alliance and i just went along girls at that age are a little frightened of life anyway and when the hellfire of eternity is presented as a reality its not hard to accept the notion of being washed in the blood of the lamb jesus christ mccoy said yes ellen said wryly jesus christ she pushed herself off the chest of drawers and walked to the bed then she leaned over him and ran the balls of her fingers over his chest so i passed through my high school years convinced that when i had nice thoughts about boys it was satan at work trying to get my soul i was a catholic mccoy said they tried to tell us the same thing did you believe it she asked i wasnt sure he said i was she said and i went through college that way it wasnt hard i was surrounded with them whenever anyone confessed any doubts the others closed ranks around her or him we prayed a lot and avoided temptation no drinking no dancing no smoking no touching she moved her hand to his groin and repeated no touching so how come you married him where did you meet him i was a senior in college she said the christian missionary alliance is as you can imagine big on missionaries and he came looking for missionary recruits came from here i mean with slides of china and ail the souls the alliance was saving for jesus he told us all about the heathens and how they hungered for the lord very impressive stuff and then that summer right after i graduated he came to our church in baltimore im from baltimore to give his report to our church my father is a pillar of our church and he was important to my husband because my father is pretty well off he stayed with us while he was in baltimore and made a play for you mccoy said jesus that feels good she chuckled deep in her throat and bent over him and nipped his nipple with her teeth he put his hand on her breast and dragged her down on top of him do you want to hear this or not she asked yeah he said its all right with me if you dont she said finish it he said what i thought i was getting was a life toiling in the lords vineyard ellen went on with a man of god saving the heathen chinese from eternal damnation what he knew he was getting was a wife and a wife who would not only put to rest unpleasant suspicions that had begun to crop up but a wife whose father would more than likely be very generous to his mission he had the mission in wangtua then but probably to him personally when did you find out he was a faggot mccoy asked we were married at nine oclock in the morning she said at noon we took the train to new york and then from new york we took the train to san francisco i decided that it was wrong of me to think that anything would happen on a railroad train and we boarded the president jefferson for tientsin the same day we arrived in san francisco and nothing happened on the ship something happened on the ship ellen said i was not surprised that i didnt like it very much and that it didnt happen very often then he can get it up mccoy asked not like this she said squeezing him so hard that he yelped but he can yes i suspect he closes his eyes and pretends im a boy so why the hell did you stay married to him you just dont understand i just didnt know i was innocent ignorant he snorted meaning im not innocent now she asked no complaints mccoy said there was somebody else obviously who none of your business she said but then she told him a newly ordained bachelor missionary with whom shed been left alone a good deal when the reverend feller had been promoted to assistant district superintendent they had been caught together they had begged forgiveness after prayerful consideration the reverend feller had decided the way to handle the situation was to send the young missionary home as unsuited for missionary service which happened often a church would be found for him at home as a guarantee of impeccable christian behavior in the future there was a written confession of his sinful misbehavior left behind in the reverend fellers safe mccoy was sure thered been more than one somebody else she had done things to him he hadnt thought american women even knew about things that one missionary minister wouldnt have taught her but he could hardly expect her to provide him with a list of the guys she had screwed she wasnt like that he was somewhat surprised to realize that he had come to like ellen feller after that ellen went on he never came near me i thought he was either disgusted with me or was punishing me you still didnt know he was queer i didnt find out about that believe it or not until just before the alliance called him home for consultation that was the reason i didnt go home with him howd you find out i walked in on him she said matteroffactly he was aware that shed stopped manipulating him and he had gone down she still had her hand on him though possessively and he liked that what did he say mccoy asked nothing she said he didnt even stop so i just closed the door and left very civilized why didnt you leave him mccoy asked its not that simple my darling ellen said mccoy liked when she called him my darling even though it embarrassed him a little he couldnt remember anyone ever saying that to him before it was a lot different from a whore calling him honey or sweetheart or big boy why not he asked well theres jerrys detailed written confession for one thing she said as if explaining something that should have been selfevident so what he would show it to my father so what tell your father hes queer i wouldnt be believed she said hes a man of god my father is very impressed with him he would think i made the accusation in desperation to excuse my own behavior then fuck your father mccoy said her eyebrows went up i know how you meant that she said jesus he said im thirty years old she said i have no money i can play every hymn in the hymnal from memory on the piano i speak chinese unless i could find a job as a chinesespeaking piano player i dont know how i could support myself thirty years old at first i thought she was older than that then i thought she was younger thirty is too old for me what the hell am i thinking about in a week shell get on a ship and that will be the last ill ever see her can you type mccoy asked she nodded then get a job as a typist for christs sake for my own sake you mean she said then she added mysteriously i have something else that might turn out i wont know until i get to the states like a couple of thousandyearold vases for example mccoy asked or some jade her face clouded and she took her hand from his crotch and covered her mouth with it what did you do look in the crates no a stab in the dark mccoy said my god does anybody else know my officer thinks thats the real reason your husband came back to china mccoy said he doesnt believe the selfless patriot business i have three ming dynasty vases and some jade my husband doesnt know about ellen said i thought i could sell them and use the money to get a start you probably can if you can get them through customs mccoy said your officer isnt going to say anything its none of his business he said and the other officers do they know youve just seen how smart they are mccoy said it left us alone my darling she said i like it when you say that mccoy said she looked into his eyes and it made him uncomfortable and i like it when you put your hand on my balls she stiffened she didnt like him to talk that way he thought but she shifted on the bed and cupped her hand on him again i would like it too if you said that to me she whispered said what my darling my darling mccoy said and flushed it made him uncomfortable and i like to suck your teats he added almost defiantly she stiffened again and he wondered why he said that knowing it would piss her off i like the thought but not the vocabulary she sighed cows have teats ladies have breasts pardon me mccoy said youre forgiven she said move closer so i can play with them mccoy said why you wicked little boy you she said but she pushed herself closer to him so that his hands and his mouth could reach her breast the my darling business was over mccoy realized first with relief then with sadness she took her nipple from his mouth a moment later and kissed him lasciviously then moved her head down his body she was just straddling him when there was a knock at the door come back later mccoy called in chinese its lieutenant sessions mccoy open the door breathing heavily ellen reluctantly hauled herself off him and scurried around the room picking up her clothing mccoy watched her moveslovely and graceful she was the bestlooking piece of ass hed ever had he had realized sometime during the last twentyfour hours and the best he wondered how she was going to handle sessions she was not going to be able to holler rape which was what usually happened when an american woman got caught fucking a marine not only wouldnt she be able to get away with it how could she explain being in his room but she had called him my darling and he knew somehow that she meant it he meant more to her than a stiff prick she was not going to cause him any trouble and he knew he didnt want to cause her any come on corporal i have business with you sessions called mccoy waited until shed gone into the bathroom then pushed himself out of the bed and went to the door pulling on his shorts en route lieutenant sessions wore two days growth of beard and his seersucker suit was badly soiled the japanese knew that it embarrassed americans not to be cleanshaven so razors were not made available and there was evidence of an accident at a meal mccoy was amused at the japanese skill in embarrassing their unwanted guests and so was captain banning but it was apparent that lieutenant sessions was not sergeant zimmerman said he had no idea where you were sessions accused as he pushed past mccoy into the room mccoy didnt reply i presume that you have reported our detention by the japanese to shanghai sessions asked no sir mccoy said why not corporal sessions asked angrily i thought id wait to see what the japs decided to do mccoy said you thought youd wait sessions quoted incredulously good god and its pretty clear isnt it how you passed your time while you were waiting what the hell have you been doing in here mccoy conducting an orgy mccoy didnt reply a round theclock orgy sessions went on looking at the debris food trays bottles of beer and towels on the floor he sniffed the air it smells like a whorehouse in here is she still here for christs sake mccoy nodded goddamn it corporal in my absence you were supposed to take charge not conduct yourself like a pfc on payday you are prepared to offer no excuse at all for not getting in touch with shanghai and reporting what had happened to us i was trying not to make waves mccoy said and what the hell is that supposed to mean the bathroom door opened and ellen feller came into the room she was in her bathrobe and her hair fanned down her shoulders she looked directly at lieutenant sessions as she walked through the room and out the door well that really does it sessions said coldly almost calmly when she had gone instead of doing your duty jesus christ im going to have your stripes for this mccoy id like to have you courtmartialed mccoy walked across the room to the chest of drawers and picked up the leica camera goddamnit corporal dont you turn your back on me when im talking to you sessions said furiously mccoy rewound the film opened the camera and slipped the film out he held the small can of film between his thumb and index finger and turned to face lieutenant sessions i hope you didnt lose your temper like that in yenchieng mccoy said so far as the japs are concerned you lose a lot of face when you lose your temper how dare you talk to me that way sessions barked both incredulous and furious lieutenant as i see it you have two choices mccoy said you can make a bythebook report of what happened that against my advice you went to yenchieng and got yourself caught and that when you came back here you found out that i hadnt even reported that the japs had you had completely abandoned your obvious obligations would be a better way to put it sessions interrupted and had completely abandoned my obvious obligations mccoy parroted thats silent insolence prior to the universal code of military justice included the offense silent insolence among the offenses therein embraced was a mocking attitude to military superiors on top of everything else sessions snapped and that you found mrs feller in my room mccoy said what the hell were you thinking about in that connection sessions fumed good god man her husband is a missionary who will say that his wife was in here reading the bible to me mccoy said calmly hes a faggot surprise flashed over sessionss face she is a married woman and you damned well knew she was sessions said somewhat lamely this confrontation was not going at all the way he had expected it would the other choice you and lieutenant macklin have mccoy said is to report that you have proof the japs dont have any german pak mm cannons at least not in the th division that caught sessions by surprise what are you talking about he asked what proof if they had german cannon they would have turned in their model s mccoy said they didnt he held up the can of film i took these at first light yesterday morning he said i was lucky the japs were up before daylight lining them up and taking the covers off probably weekly maintenance something like that it took sessions a moment to frame his thoughts so you went yourself and of course didnt get caught that was very resourceful of you mccoy he said mccoy shrugged how the hell did you do it sessions asked the germans got a truck he said german oh you mean the man who owns the hotel mccoy nodded you just borrowed his truck and drove into yenchieng thats it not exactly mccoy said i went into yenchieng last night on a bicycle i told the boy who drives the germans truck there was a hundred yuan in it for him if he picked me up at a certain place on the road at halfpast six yesterday morning and then he just brought you back no we had to go into town first he picks up stuff vegetables mostly sometimes a pig and chickens i had to go in with him how did you keep from being seen i didnt mccoy said when im around the japs i play like im an italian how do you do that do you speak italian mccoy nodded christ youre amazing mccoy sessions said it was stupid me going in there like that mccoy said i should have known better why did you go sessions asked you acted like it was important mccoy said anyway its done and if you were to tell captain banning that you and macklin and the reverend were making a diversion that you knew i was going to yenchieng i wouldnt say anything mccoy said youre not i hope suggesting mccoy that i submit a patently dishonest report sessions said rule one doing what were doing mccoy said is dont make waves either with the corps or with the people youre watching you tell them what really happened youre going to look like a the next word in that sentence was clearly going be horses ass sessions thought he stopped himself just in time from saying how dare you talk to me that way a small voice in the back of his skull told him quietly but surely that he had indeed made a horses ass of himself alreadyin china ten days and already grabbed by the japanese doing something he had been told not to do and digging himself in still deeper every time he opened his mouth he had been a marine eleven years never before had an enlisted mannot even a master gunnery sergeant when he had been a wetbehindtheears shavetailtalked to him the way this twentyoneyearold corporal was talking to him now and the small voice in the back of his skull told him mccoy was not insolent inferiors are insolent to superiors mccoy was tolerantly contemptuous as superiors are to inferiors and the painful truth seemed to be that he had given him every right to do so he had been informedand had pretended to understand that he would have to learn to expect the unexpected and he hadnt because he was a thirtytwoyearold officer he had presumed that he knew more than a twentyoneyearold enlisted man if he followed the bookthe code of conduct expected of an officer and a gentleman especially one who wore an annapolis ringhe would immediately grab a telephone and formally report to captain banning thatagainst mccoys advicehe had taken the reverend feller and lieutenant macklin to yenchieng been detained by the japanese had a pot of some greasy rice substance dumped in his lap and then had returned to find that not only was corporal mccoy fornicating with the missionarys wife conduct prejudicial to good military order and discipline but was silently insolent to boot and that he just incidentally happened to have a roll of mm film of the th japanese divisions artillery park i need a bath a shave and a clean uniform corporal lieutenant sessions said well settle this later aye aye sir id like to get started again first thing in the morning sessions went on will there be any problems about that no sir mccoy said now that youre back we can move anytime you want to sessions realized he was still making an ass of himself and that he had to do something about it what i intend to do when we get somewhere with secure communications corporal mccoy he said is advise captain banning that i went to yenchieng against your advice and was detained by the japanese i will tell him of your commendable initiative in getting the film of the japanese artillery park i can see no point in discussing your personal life i would be grateful when you make your own report if you would go easy on how i stormed in here and showed my ass i hadnt planned to say anything about that sir mccoy said and im sure sessions said searching for some clever way to phrase it that you will not permit your romantic affairs to in any way cast a shadow on the corps wellknown reputation for chastity outside marriage no sir mccoy said chuckling ill be very careful about that sir and then he added id be grateful if you didnt tell lieutenant macklin about mrs feller sessions nodded thank you mccoy he said then turned and walked out of the room chapter five one the hotel am see chiehshom china hours may mccoy could not sleep the smell of ellen was inescapably on the sheets and her image was no less indelibly printed on his mind earlier he found himself next to her at dinner the moment he sat down her knee moved against his there wasnt anything particularly sexy about her touch and she didnt try to feel him up under the tableor he heror anything like that she just wanted to touch him she didnt say two words to him either except please pass the salt but she didnt take her knee away once all too soon the reverend feller announced well we have a long day ahead of us ellen rose after him and followed him out leaving mccoy with a terrible feeling of loss later mccoy and zimmerman went to the european servants quarters to make sure none of the drivers had shacked up in town afterward zimmerman asked matteroffactly sessions find out youre fucking the missionary lady he had not been fucking the missionary lady it had started out that way but it wasnt that way now mccoy couldnt bring himself to admit he was in love but it was more than an unexpected piece of ass more than fucking the missionary lady and she had called him my darling and had meant it and he had meant it too when she made him say it back yeah mccoy said and and what whats he going to do about it hes not going to do anything about it mccoy said hes all right youre lucky zimmerman said if that bastard macklin finds out mccoy you re going to find yourself up on charges one good way for him to find out ernie is for you to keep talking about it you better watch your ass mccoy zimmerman said yeah mccoy said i will jesus christ what a fucking mess he turned the light back on and reached for the crossword puzzles from the shanghai post he did three of them before he fell asleep sitting up then carefully so as not to rouse himself fully he turned the light off slipped under the sheet and felt himself drifting off again when he felt her mouth on him he thought he was having a wet dreamand that surprised him considering all the fucking they had done and then he realized that he wasnt dreaming i thought that might wake you up my darling ellen feller said softly what about your husband what about him as you so obscenely put it she said fuck him you mean he knows i mean he sleeps in a separate bed and when i left him he was asleep i had a hard time getting to sleep mccoy said thinking about you im glad she said she moved up next to him and put her face in his neck i would have come sooner she said but he insisted on talking about what that his being detained by the japanese was a good thing that it will probably make it easier to get the crates on the ship without having them inspected i mean the thought saddened him in nine days she would leave and that would be the last he would ever see of her youd better set your alarm clock she said practically i dont want to fall asleep in here he set the alarm clock but it was unnecessary they were wide awake at halfpast four neither of them had slept for more than twenty minutes all through the night two huimin shantung province may it took them another nine days to reach huimin nine days without an opportunity for mccoy and ellen to be together the days on the way to huimin were pretty much alike they would start out early and drive slowly and steadily until they found a place where they could buy lunch failing that they stopped by the side of the road and picnicked on rice balls egg rolls and fried chicken from the hoods and running boards of the trucks and cars the road meandered around endless rice paddies the inclines and declines were shallow but the curves were often sharp thus making more than twenty miles an hour impossible sometimes there was nothing at all on the road to the horizon and sometimes the road was packed with chinese walking alone or with their families or behind oxdrawn carts the chinese were usually deaf to the sound of a horn so when the road was narrow as it most often was it was necessary to crawl along in low gear until the road widened enough to let them pass the oxcarts but sometimes at the blast of the horn the slowly plodding pedestrians would jump to the side of the road and glower as the convoy passed when they had to picnic by the side of the road mccoy tried to stop when there was no one else on the road but most of the time in spite of mccoys intentions they were surrounded by hordes of chinese within five minutes some stared in frank curiosity and others begged for the scraps or for rides and that was impossible of course if they allowed chinese in the backs of the trucks the beds would be stripped bare within a mile at ssuyango tancheng and weifang mccoy spent the hours of darkness trying to find out whether various japanese units had indeed received german field artillery pieces and at tancheng he somewhat reluctantly took lieutenant sessions with him sessions skillfully sandbagged him into that he came to mccoys room after supper while mccoy was dressing black cotton peasant shirt trousers and rubber shoes and a black handkerchief over his head it was less a disguise than a solution to the problem of crawling through fecesfertilized rice paddies a complete suit cost less than a dollar he wore one and carried two more tightly rolled and tied with string that he looped and fastened around his neck when he came out of a rice paddy smelling like the bottom of a latrine pit he would strip and put on a fresh costume it didnt help much but it was better than running around soaked in shit during the stopover at ssuyango mccoy made a deal with a merchant five gallons of gasoline for eight sets of cotton jackets and trousers when sessions came to his room at tancheng he still had three left not counting the one he was wearing sessions was politely curious about exactly what mccoy intended to do and mccoy told him it wasnt that much of a big deal all he was going to do was make his way down the dikes between the rice paddies until he was close to the japanese compound then he would slip into the water and make his way close enough to the compound to photograph the artillery park and motor pool then he would make his way out of the rice paddie change clothes and come back how do you keep the camera dry sessions asked wrap it in a couple of rubbers mccoy said sessions laughed appreciatively do you go armed i have a knife i take with me mccoy told him but the worst thing i could do is kill a jap sessions nodded his understanding then he said tell me the truth mccoy theres no reason i couldnt go is there if you were willing to take me i mean christ lieutenant you dont want to go yes i do mccoy sessions had said if youll take me ill go then he walked to the bed and picked up the peasant suit id like to have a picture of me in one of these he said it would impress the hell out of my wife he looked at mccoy and smiled i really would like to go with you mccoy he said it was still a request officers are supposed to be in charge mccoy said that wouldnt work you dont have to worry about that sessions said youre the expert and i know it its your show id just like to tag along once you get your shoes in a rice paddy theyll be ruined mccoy said it was his last argument okay sessions said so i wear old shoes so he took sessions with him it went as he thought it would and the only trouble they had was close to the jap compound sessions panicked a little when he hadnt heard mccoy for a couple of minutes and came looking for him calling his name in a stage whisper they didnt find any german paks but neither did they get caught and mccoy was by then convinced that the paks existed only in the imagination of chairwarming sonsofbitches in washington bastards who didnt have to crawl around through rice paddies or fields fertilized with human shit sessions was so excited by his adventure that when they got back to the christian missionary alliance mission he insisted on talking about it until it was way too late to even think of getting together with ellen for a quickie before breakfast after it was light they killed the roll of film in the camera by taking pictures of each other dressed up like chinamen mccoy hoped that the pictures of sessions dressed up that way might get the guy off the hook in washington they might decide to forget that the japs had caught him if they saw that he had at least tried to do what theyd sent him to do the next night however mccoy refused to take sessions with him when he went to see what he could find near the mission at weifang it was a different setup there the japs ran perimeter patrols and he didnt want to run the risk of the both of them getting caught sessions didnt argue which made mccoy feel a little guilty because the real reason he didnt want to take sessions along was that he slowed mccoy down if sessions wasnt along maybe he could get back to the mission in time for ellen to come to his room that hadnt done any good when he got back sessions was waiting for him sessions kept him talking even though there hadnt been any german cannon at weifang either until it was too late to do anything with ellen it was really a royal pain in the ass doing nothing with her during the day but hold hands on the front seat for a moment or touch legs under a table or something like that or he would catch her looking at him he decided to take sessions with him to look at a motorized infantry regiment the rd near huimin because it was the last chance they would have on this trip if there were some of these german cannons at huimin sessions might as well be able to say he found them otherwisehaving gotten himself caught by the japanesehe was going to come off this bigtime secret mission looking like an asshole the pictures of him dressed up like a chinaman werent going to impress the big shots as much as his report that he had been caught mccoy was beginning to see that sessions wasnt that much of your typical headquarters usmc sonofabitch what was really wrong with him was that he didnt know what he was doing and he could hardly be blamed for that they didnt teach how to spy on the japs at the officer school in quantico it was a really dumb fucking thing for the corps to do sending him over here the way they had but to be fair that was the corps fault not his and at huimin they found paks the rd motorized infantry regiment separate of his imperial majestys imperial fucking army had eight of them and the eight had the wrong canvas covers so theyd taken covers from the model s and put them over the paks they didnt fit the muzzle of the paks with its distinctive and unmistakable muzzle brake stuck three feet outside the two small canvas covers and with the model s parked right beside themlooking very small compared to the paksthere was absolutely no question about what they were mccoy shot two thirtysixexposure rolls of mm black and white film in the leica and then a twentyexposure roll of kodacolor although he suspected that one wouldnt turn out kodacolor had a tendency to fuck up when you used it at first lightmccoy had no idea why sessions was naturally all excited and had a hard time keeping himself under control but he didnt order mccoy he asked him whether it would be a good idea to send somebodymaybe him maybe zimmermanright off to tientsin with the film or to take the whole convoy to tientsin instead of making the other stops and sessions just accepted it when mccoy told him that if he or zimmerman took off alone with the film the kempeitai who had been following them around since they crossed the yangtze river would figure there was something special up and that would be the last time he or zimmerman would ever be seen chinese bandits lieutenant mccoy said since there really arent any the japs have organized their own and similarly taking the whole convoy to tientsin right away would make them think something was out of the ordinary yes it would mccoy said they probably would leave the whole thing alone but you couldnt be sure if we do what we told them were going to do that would be best obviously sessions concluded the sentence for him aye aye sir and it will give us another night on the road maybe more if i get lucky and one of the trucks breaks down and maybe that will mean maybe more than one other night with ellen christ knows ive done all the crawling through rice paddies im going to do on this trip he had no such luck they spent the next night in a christian missionary alliance mission where he was given a small room to share with sergeant zimmerman since he was in a different building from the officers and missionaries there was just nothing he could do about getting together with ellen he wondered if he might get lucky in tientsin he hoped so it would probably be the last time in his life he would ever have a woman like that it was about two hundred miles from huimin to tientsin about halfway there there was another ferry this one crossed a branch of the yun ho river it wasnt much of a river maybe two hundred yards across and the ferry was built to fit he thought for a minute that he and ellen were going to get to cross first which meant they would be alone for a little while there probably was no place where they could screw except maybe the backseat of the studebaker but he would have willingly settled for that at the last minute though sessions decided to go too and climbed in the backseat and then as mccoy was about to drive down the bank onto the ferry sessions had another officer inspiration sergeant zimmerman he called would you come with us please a moment later he leaned forward i dont think its a good idea for us to be all alone over there he said significantly do you no sir mccoy said i guess not what does he think is going to happen over there i shouldnt have told him about the chinesejapanese bandits if i hadnt he would have stayed behind and i could have had fifteen twenty minutes alone with ellen when ellen turned to smile at ernie zimmerman as he moved into the back beside sessions she caught mccoys hand in both of hers and held it for a moment in her lap he could feel the heat of her belly on the other side of the river he drove the studebaker far enough up the road to make room for the convoy to reform behind it as they came off the ferry and then lieutenant sessions did something very nice mccoy you stay here in the car with mrs feller sergeant zimmerman and i will walk back to the river to wait for the others aye aye sir mccoy said he took ellens hand as soon as they were out of the car she held it in both of hers and drew it against her breast mccoy watched the rearview mirror very carefully until sessions and zimmerman had disappeared around a bend then he turned to her and put his arms around her what are we going to do ellen asked against his ear i dont know he said at least i got to put my arms around you she kissed him first tenderly then lasciviously and then she put her mouth to his ear as she applied her fingers to the buttons of his fly i know what to do she said just make sure they dont suddenly come walking back after a moment she sat up to let him reach down and open her dress then he slipped his hand behind her unclasped her brassiere and freed her breasts and then all of a sudden the hair on the back of his neck began to curl and he felt a really weird sensationof chill and excitement at once he was being a goddamned fool he told himself he was just scared that the two of them would be caught together doing what they were doing and with a strange certainty he knew that wasnt it at all he lifted himself high enough on the seat to look in the backseat zimmermans thompson was on the floorboard that left zimmerman and sessions with nothing but zimmermans pistol what are you doing ellen asked taking her mouth off him theres a thompson in the backseat mccoy said you grab it and run after me he pushed his thing back in his pants and took his thompson from the floorboard whats the matter ellen asked goddamnit just do what i tell you he snapped and sprang out of the car as he trotted down the road he chambered a cartridge in the thompson im going to race the hell down there and find the two of them sitting on a bench waiting for the ferry and they are both going to think ive lost my fucking mind but they werent sitting on a bench when he trotted around the bend they were up against a steep bank and there were twenty twentyfive chinese dressed as coolies crowding them the convoy would be broken in pieces in only one place between huimin and tientsin the only place therefore where it could credibly be reported that chinese bandits had attacked it and the japanese had damned well figured that out and they had handed the japs the opportunity on a silver platter sessions and zimmerman were isolated and practically unarmed after the bandits finished with them they would have come to the car zimmerman had the flap on his holster open but hadnt drawn it take the fucking thing out for christs sake mccoy called out the chinese looked over their shoulders at him several of them took several steps in his direction several others moved toward zimmerman and sessions mccoy was holding the thompson by the pistol grip the butt resting against the pit of his elbow the muzzle elevated he realized that he was reluctant to aim it at the mob goddamnit im scared if i aim it at them the shit will hit the fan he pulled the trigger the submachine gun slammed against his arm three four five times as if somebody was punching him he could smell the burned powder and he saw the flashes coming from the slits in the cutts compensator on the muzzle everybody froze for a moment and then the chinese who had been advancing on zimmerman and sessions started to run toward them after that the shit did hit the fan pistols were drawn from wherever they had been concealed mccoy saw that at least two of the pistols were broomhandled model mausers which fire mm cartridges full automatic mccoy put the thompson to his shoulder aimed very carefully and tapped the trigger the thompson fired three times and one of the chinese with a broomhandle mauser went down with a look of surprise on his face mccoy found another chinese with a broomhandle and touched the trigger again this time the thompson barked only twice a dull blamblam and the second chinese dropped like someone whod been slugged in the stomach with a baseball bat as he methodically took two more chinese down with twoand threeround bursts from the thompson he saw zimmerman finally get around to drawing his pistol and working the action a movement beside him startled him frightened him he twisted and saw that ellen was standing a foot behind him everything seemed to be in slow motion he had time to notice that she had her breasts back inside her brassiere but that there was something wrong with her dress then he figured out that she hadnt gotten the right button in the right hole she had zimmermans thompson in her hands holding it as if she was afraid of it and around her shoulder was zimmermans musette bag the bulges told him there were two spare drum magazines in it her eyes were wide with horror he returned his attention to the mob and fired again shoot for christs sake mccoy shouted zimmerman looked baffled sessions finally did something he snatched the colt from zimmermans hand holding it with both hands he aimed at the ground in front of the chinese he fired and then fired again mccoy heard a slug richochet over his head that dumb sonofabitch is actually trying to wound them in the legs he put the thompson back to his shoulder and emptied the magazine in four and fiveshot bursts into the mob of chinese there was no longer time to aim he sprayed the mob aware that most of his shots were going wild and then when he tugged at the trigger nothing was happening the fiftyround drum was empty conditioned by parris island drill instructors to treat any weapon with something approaching reverenceabuse was the unpardonable sinhe very carefully laid the empty thompson on the ground and only then took zimmermans thompson from ellen when he had raised it to his shoulder he saw that the mob had broken and was running toward the ferry slip for some reason that produced rage not relief telling himself to take it easy to get a decent sight picture before pulling the trigger he fired at individual members of the nowfleeing mob he was too excited to properly control the sensitive trigger and the thompson fired in four five and sixshot bursts until the magazine was empty by then there were five more chinese down some of them sprawled flat on their faces one of them on his knees and another crawling for safety like a worm his hands on the gaping wound in his leg mccoy ejected the magazine and went for the spares in the musette bag around ellens shoulders he snared one on the first grab but as he did so he dislodged the top cartridge from its proper position in the magazine he put the magazine to his mouth and yanked the cartridge out with his teeth then he jammed the magazine into the thompson and put it back in his shoulder two chinese were rushing toward him one with a knife the other with what looked like a boat pole he took both of them down with two bursts one of the grain slugs caught the second one in the face and blew blood and brains all over the road and then it was all over no chinese were on their feet and when he trained the thompson on the ground the ones down there seemed to be dead except one who was doggedly trying to unjam his broomhandle mauser mccoy took a good sight on him and put two rounds in his head there were more than a dozen dead and wounded chinese on the ground some were screaming in agony lieutenant sessions ran over to mccoy looking as if he was trying to find something to say but nothing came out of his mouth for several moments my god he whispered finally mccoy felt faint and nauseous but forced it down then ellen slumped to her knees and threw up that made mccoy do the same thing what the hell was that all about sessions finally asked shit mccoy said ellen looked at him whitefaced and he thought he saw disgust in her eyes i guess the japs decided youre not really a christer lieutenant mccoy said jesus christ the film sessions said where is it goddamn it mccoy said and started to run back to the car he was halfway to the car when he heard shots and then a scream he spun around zimmerman had finally got his shit together he had put a fresh magazine in mccoys thompson and was walking among the downed chinese methodically firing a couple of rounds into each of them to make sure they were dead ellen was doing the screaming while lieutenant sessions held her staring horrified at what zimmerman was doing and mccoy saw the cavalry finally galloping to the rescue the ferry was in midstream lieutenant macklin who had found his steel helmet somewhere stood at the bow with his pistol in his hand and a whistle in his mouth behind him were the two bar men and behind them the rest of the drivers armed with springfields mccoy did not see the reverend mr feller he ran the rest of the way to the car the film was where he had left it in the crown of his campaign hat concealed there by a skivvy shirt he got behind the wheel and backed up to where ellen stood with lieutenant sessions sessions opened the back door and she got in and slumped against the seat whitefaced and whiteeyed the ferry finally touched the near shore and lieutenant macklin furiously blowing his whistle led the cavalry up the road to them three lieutenant sessions learned quick mccoy decided you had to give him that he took charge the way an officer was expected to lieutenant macklin was running around like a fucking chicken with his head cut off the first thing he was worried about was that the chinese would counterattack they were a bunch of fucking bandits more than half of them were dead military units counterattacked what was left of the chinese were still running the second thing that worried macklin was what the colonel would think his orders were to avoid a confrontation at all costs there had obviously been a confrontation theres sure to be an official inquiry macklin said were going to have to explain all these bodies god there must be a dozen of them how are we going to explain all these dead chinese theres eighteen mccoy said helpfully i counted them i guess were just going to have to say we shot them both sessions and macklin gave him dirty looks sessions still didnt like it that mccoy was contemptuous of macklin who was after all an officer and macklin thought that killer mccoy was not only an insolent enlisted man but was more than likely responsible for what had happened what bothered macklin mccoy understood was not that they had almost gotten themselves killed but that he himself was somehow going to be embarrassed before the colonel he was when it came down to it the officer in command corporal macklin snapped i dont expect you to understand this but what we have here is an international incident you werent even involved lieutenant mccoy said you were on the other side of the river by the time you got here it was all over thats enough mccoy sessions snapped im the officer in charge macklin flared of course im involved aye aye sir mccoy said macklin sucked in his breath in preparation mccoy sensed to really putting him in his place sessions stopped him by speaking first the important thing macklin he said while lieutenant macklin paused to draw in a breath is to place the rolls of film mccoy took into the proper hands at tientsin thats the primary objective of this whole operation yes of course macklin said impatiently itching to launch into mccoy but sessions cut him off again next in importance is the physical safety of the reverend and mrs feller yes of course macklin repeated and as you point out there is the problem of the bodies sessions said obviously macklin said mccoys latest contribution to the death rate in china sessions smiled at that we cant just drive off and leave eighteen bodies in the road sessions said and i think mccoy and i should separate in case something should happen to one or the other of us now macklin interrupted him you do think theres a chance of a counterattack then i think its very unlikely sessions said but not impossible hes humoring the sonofabitch mccoy thought as i was saying sessions went on i think we should do whatever we have to to make sure that either mccoy or i make it to tientsin to be a witness to the fact that there are german paks in japanese hands i take your point macklin said solemnly what do you propose just as solemnly sessions proposed that mccoy two marine trucks and all the extra drivers be left behind in a detachment commanded by lieutenant macklin while he and sergeant zimmerman and everybody and everything else immediately left for tientsin i think thats the thing to do macklin solemnly judged mccoy was almost positive the japanese would not try anything else they would think the americans had something else in mindlike an ambushwhen they stayed behind with the bodies the japanese would have left the bodies where they fell he knew unless they felt ambitious enough to throw them into the river but just to be sure he set up as good a perimeter guard as he could with the few men he had meanwhile lieutenant macklin relieved him of the thompson submachine gun he kept it with him where he spent the night in the cab of one of the trucks early the next morning a mixed detachment of french foreign legionnaires italian marines and tientsin marines showed up mccoy was a little uncomfortable when he saw the italians but if they knew who he was there was no sign somewhat reluctantly they set about loading the bodies on the trucks they had brought with them it was dark before they got to the international settlement in tientsin and there was no way mccoy could get away to try to go see ellen feller in the christian missionary alliance mission the tientsin officers kept him up all night writing down what had happened at the ferry some of their questions made him more than uncomfortable first they went out of their way to persuade him to admit that he had been more than a little excited if he hadnt been a little excited were not suggesting you were afraid mccoy nobodys saying that but werent you really nervous the confrontation could have been avoided sir there was no way what happened could have been avoided i was scared and excited but that had nothing to do with what happened when they realized they werent going to get him to acknowledgeeven obliquelythat the incident was his fault they dropped another more uncomfortable accusation on him mrs feller tells us that you and sergeant zimmerman went around shooting the wounded mccoy one of them asked was that necessary mccoy had been around officers long enough to know when they were up to something they were trying to stick it in zimmerman zimmerman had a chinese wife and kids he couldnt afford to be busted nobody shot any wounded captain not the way you make it sound then why do you suppose both mrs feller and lieutenant macklin both say thats what happened i dont know mccoy said lieutenant macklin didnt even show up there until it was all over so far as i know sergeant zimmerman didnt fire his weapon lieutenant sessions and i had to shoot a couple of them after they were down why did you feel you had to do that because there was three of us and fifty of them and the rest of the convoy was still across the river those guys that were down were still trying to fire their weapons you dont say sir very often do you corporal sir no disrespect intended sir mccoy said you say both you and lieutenant sessions found it necessary to shoot wounded men again yes sir mrs feller obviously confused you with sergeant zimmerman the officer said and mccoy knew that was the last anybody was going to hear about making sure the chinese were really dead the next morning a runner came after him while he was having breakfast in the mess lieutenant sessions was waiting for him in the orderly room sessions told him there that since the japanese would by now suspect he was not a missionary he had decided there was no point to his staying in china for the several months he had originally planned so he was now going to take the president wilson home with the fellers id like to say goodbye to her lieutenant mccoy said im not sure thats wise sessions said then but in the end sessions changed his mind and decided to be a good guy and told the tientsin officers he wanted to speak to mccoy aboard the ship before he left on the way he handed mccoy a thick envelope this is for captain banning he said i want you to deliver it personally aye aye sir mccoy said wondering why he hadnt given whatever it was to macklin to deliveruntil he realized that whatever it was sessions didnt want macklin to see it its a report of everything that happened on the trip mccoy sessions said when he saw mccoys eyebrows go up he chuckled and added everything of a duty as opposed to social nature that is thank you sir mccoy said i was up all night writing it sessions said there just wasnt time for the other letter i want to write but thats probably just as well ill have time to write it on the ship and it would probably be better coming from someone more important than me i dont know what youre talking about lieutenant mccoy said youre going to get an official letter of commendation mccoy sessions said for your record jacket im going to write it and im going to try to get someone senior to sign it if i cant ill sign it myself thank you mccoy said no thanks are necessary sessions said you performed superbly under stress and that should be recorded in your official records what sessions meant mccoy knew was that without the sixth senseor whatever the hell it wasthat something was wrong he wouldnt have shown up when he had and sessions would probably be going back to the states in a coffin in the reefer compartment of the president wilson sessions meant well mccoy decided but he doubted if there would be a letter of commendation even if sessions really remembered to write one he doubted if headquarters usmc would let him make it official from the way the officers here were acting and the higherranking the officer the worse it was what had happened at the ferry was his fault in their view he had overreacted to a situation which a more senior and experienced noncom would have handled without loss of life the letter report he was carrying to captain banning was nevertheless important he trusted sessions now the report would tell it like it happened and banning would understand why he had done what he had at the gangplank of the president wilson sessions got him a visitors boarding pass and then asked the steward at the gangplank for the number of the fellers cabin when they reached the corridor leading to the fellers cabin sessions offered his hand ill say goodbye here mccoy he said i want to thank you for everything and to say i think youre one hell of a marine thank you lieutenant mccoy said he was more than a little embarrassed well run into each other again im sure sessions said sooner or later good luck mccoy good luck to you too sir mccoy said as he looked for the feller cabin he felt pretty good he was beginning to believe now that there might be a letter of commendation it would be nice to have something like that in the official records when his name came up before the sergeants promotion board the good feeling vanished the moment ellen answered his knock at her cabin door the look on her face instantly showed shed hoped shed seen the last of him being the fucking fool he was though he didnt want to believe what he saw on her face and in her eyes he told himself that what it was was surprise he started out by asking her if maybe she would write him maybe you never can tell well be able to see each other again sometime he ended up telling her he loved her i think its still possible for me to buy my way out of the corps he went on ill look into it i have the money and i do really love you she got stiff when he started talking the way she did when he talked crude to her and by the time he was telling her he loved her her face was rigid and her eyes cold how dare you talk to me like that she said when he had finished with a voice like a dagger so what she wanted after all was nothing but the stiff prick her fairy husband couldnt give her the funny thing about it was that he wasnt mad he was damned close to crying he turned and walked out of her cabin vowing that he would never make a fucking mistake like that again hed never mistake some old bitch with hot pants for the real thing he didnt give a shit if she fucked lieutenant sessions eight time a day all the way across the pacific if she couldnt get sessions shed grab some other dumb fucker and failing that shed get herself a broomhandle four headquarters th marines shanghai china june once given permission to enter the office of captain edward banning lieutenant john macklin marched in erectly came to attention before bannings desk and said reporting as directed sir the formalities over he stepped to the chair in front of bannings desk sat down in it and crossed his legs getting hot already isnt it he asked i dont recall giving you permission to sit down lieutenant captain banning said almost conversationally but with a touch of anger in his voice macklin surprised took a quick look at bannings face and then scrambled to his feet when he was again at the position of attention he said i beg your pardon captain lieutenant banning said i have carefully read your report of the tientsinpeking trip paying particular attention to those parts dealing with your detention at yenchieng and the incident at the ferry yes sir i have read with equal care the report lieutenant sessions wrote on the same subjects banning said sir macklin asked there was a caveat in lieutenant sessionss report banning said he wrote that he was writing in the small hours of the morning because he hoped to finish it before he went home thus he was afraid there would be some small errors in it because of his haste i wasnt aware that lieutenant sessions had made a report sir lieutenant macklin said may i suggest that it might be a good idea if i had a look at it with a view to perhaps revising my own report bannings temper flared again when he recalled macklins report it boggled his mind to think that the man blamed the detention at yenchieng on mccoys cowardly refusal to do what duty clearly required and that the tragic events at the river crossing could have been avoided if only lieutenant sessions had heeded his warning that corporal mccoy clearly manifested paranoid tendencies of a homicidal nature and had to be carefully watched and then in the presumption that sessions was on the high seas and safely removed from rebuttal hed even gone after him the possibility cannot be dismissed that lieutenant sessions acquiesced if he did not actually participate in the brutal slaughter of the wounded chinese civilians banning waited a moment for his temper to subside you are a slimy creature arent you macklin banning asked calmly how the hell have you managed to stay in the corps this long i dont know what you mean sir macklin said you know what a slimy creature is macklin in the marine corps a slimy creature is an officer who tries to pass the blame for his own failures onto the shoulders of a brother officer i dont know of a phrase obscene enough to describe an officer who tries to cover his own ass by trying to blame his failures on an enlisted man and you probably would have gotten away with it you slimy sonofabitch if sessions hadnt spotted you for what you are and sent his report back with mccoy there may be captain some minor differences of judgment between the two reports but nothing of magnitude that would justify these insulting accusations shut your face lieutenant banning shouted it was the first time he had raised his voice and his loss of temper embarrassed him glaring contemptuously at macklin he took time to regain control before he went on if i had my druthers lieutenant banning said id bring charges against you for conduct unbecoming an officer or for knowingly uttering a false official statement but i cant if i brought you before a courtmartial we would have to get into security matters and we cant do that what i can do what i will do is see that your next efficiency report contains a number of phrases which will suggest to the captains promotion board that you should not be entrusted with a machinegun crew much less with command of a company it will be a very long time before you are promoted lieutenant youre a smart fellow perhaps you will conclude that it would be best if you resigned from the marine corps captain banning macklin said after a moment there is obviously a misunderstanding between us theres no misunderstanding macklin banning said almost sadly whats happened here is that you have proved youre unfit to be a marine officer its as simple as that the one thing a marine officer has to have going for him is integrity and you just dont have any im sure ill be able to explain this misunderstanding to the colonel macklin said and that is my intention sir banning looked at him for a moment and then picked up his telephone and dialed a number captain banning sir he said i have macklin in here i have just informed him of the contempt in which i hold him he tells me that he believes he can explain the misunderstanding to you there was a hesitation before the colonel replied i suppose he is entitled to hear it from me the colonel said send him over aye aye sir banning said and replaced the telephone in its cradle youre dismissed macklin banning said the colonel will see you if you wish macklin did an aboutface and marched out of his office banning knew what sort of a reception macklin was going to get from the colonel he had had to argue at length with him to talk him out of a courtmartial it was only bannings invocation of the good of the corps that finally persuaded the colonel to reluctantly agree that the only way to deal with the problem was to immediately relieve macklin of duty until such time as he could be sent home five headquarters first battalion th marines shanghai china june the first sergeant sent a runner into town to mccoys apartment by rickshaw liberty or no liberty the first sergeant wanted to see

adjutant what the hell is all this i guess the corps wants to get you out of china killer before they run out of people for you to cut up or shoot the first sergeant said jesus christ mccoy said the first available vessel in the service of the us the first sergeant quoted is the whaley the uss charles e whaley was a fleet oiler that regularly called at shanghai to replenish the fuel supplies of the vessels of the yangtze river patrol and the half dozen small pigboats of subforchina us navy submarine force china she sails friday morning you will be aboard you know the whaley mccoy i know the whaley mccoy said fucking grease bucket its going to pearl harbor not the states the first sergeant said theyll put you aboard something else at pearl with a little bit of luck you could spend two three weeks in pearl the first sergeant said top i dont want to go home mccoy said the first sergeants reaction to that was predictable you dont want to go home you know what i mean top mccoy said i just shipped over to stay in china mccoy i dont know how you got to be a corporal without figuring this out for yourself i dont know come to think of it how you got be a corporal period but this is the marine corps in the marine corps the way it works is the marine corps tells you where you go and when there really wasnt any point in arguing with the first sergeant and mccoy knew it but he did so anyway thinking that maybe he could get an extra few days an extra two weeks if he had that much time maybe he could think of something for christs sake top i got stuff to sell ill have to give it away if i have to get rid of everything by friday how about letting me miss the whaley and catch whatever is next like what for instance do you have to get rid of cheap im always on the lookout for a bargain come on top you could fix it if you wanted to fuck you mccoy the first sergeant said a little time on a tankerll be good for you can i tell captain banning about this mccoy asked you go tell him if you think itll do you any good the first sergeant said and then get your ass back here and start packing when the gunny tells me your gear is shipshape then maybe ill think about letting you go into town and see about selling your stuff captain banning waved him into his inner office as soon as he saw him coming through the door i guess youve just got the word from your first sergeant he asked yes sir before you start wasting your breath mccoy let me tell you that not only is the colonel overjoyed at your departure but he has told me to make sure personally that you get on the whaley im on his shit list am i let us say that you have been the subject of considerable cable traffic between here and headquarters marine corps following the shootout at the ok corral if you plan to make a career of the marine corps killer youre going to have to restrain your urge to cut people up and shoot them thats unfair captain mccoy said yeah captain banning said i know it is mccoy you didnt start that fight and according to sessions you handled yourself damned well once it started for what its worth i argued with the colonel until he told me to shut my face but hes still getting crap from the italians and the consul generals been all over his ass about you i was there when he asked whether you were just a homicidal maniac or whether you were trying to start world war ii all by yourself so for doing what i was told to do keep sessions and macklin alive i get my ass shipped home in disgrace thats about the sum of it banning said but you dont have everything straight first of all the colonels not shipping you home in disgrace or otherwise i think underneath he sort of admires you you were ordered home by the corps i suspect that the consul general had something to do with itraised hell about you through the state department or something like thatbut the colonel didnt do it and youre not going home in disgrace not only do you get to keep your stripes but your company commander is going to give you an efficiency report that makes you sound like lou diamond jr master gunnery sergeant diamond was a corpswide marine legend the perfect marine i know because i wrote it mccoy was obviously puzzled by that and it showed on his face it doesnt say anything about your working for me mccoy banning said you understand that you cant talk to anybody in or out of the corps about that aye aye sir but it should impress the hell out of your new commanding officer banning said im going to a truck company mccoy said a goddamned truck company im a machinegunner im going home in a couple of months myself banning said you keep your nose clean in the truck company and when i get settled ill see what i can do for you either working for me or doing something else interesting or if you really want to getting you back in a heavyweapons company thank you mccoy said what are you going to do about the stuff in the apartment as soon as my gunny decides my gear is shipshape the first sergeant said i could go into town ill call your first sergeant and tell him im sending you into town banning said take whatever time you need to do what you have to do and then go back to your company i want to put you aboard the whaley first thing friday morning if youre not on her mccoy the colonel will have my ass ill be aboard her sir mccoy said chapter six one us marine corps base san diego california july the uss charles e whaley was as miserable a pile of rust and rivets as mccoy expected it would be since she was not a manofwar there was no marine detachment aboard which translated to mean that he had hardly anybody to talk to sailors dont like marines anyway and there were six pigboat swab jockeys from subforchina being shipped to pearl harbor and they really hated china marines the only swabbie who gave him the time of day was a bald hairy machinists mate second class who quickly let him know that he didnt mind spending a lot of time at sea far from women reeking of diesel fuel riding light in the water the whaley took seventeen days to make pearl harborswaying and pitching even in calm seas there was plenty of time to think things over and conclude that hed been handed the shitty end of the stick again like always starting with ellen goddamnthebitch feller and getting sent home from china was also getting the shitty end of the stick too christ hed practically given away the furniture in the apartment and despite the efficiency report that was supposed to make him sound like lou diamond even a bunch of dumb fuckers in a fucking truck company would smell a rat about somebody who was sent home from china just after he shipped over for the th marines and got promoted and the new assignment stank too a goddamned truck company at the navy yard in philly philly was the last tucking place he wanted to go it was too close to norristown and he never wanted to go there again period and there was no question in his mind that he was going to walk into this tucking truck company in philly and immediately be on everybodys shit list there werent that many corporals billets in a motor transport platoon and sure as christ made little apples the people in philly had planned to give this billet to some deserving asshole of a pfc with hash marks oblong bars one for each four years of satisfactory service worn on the lower sleeve of outer garments halfway to his elbow mccoy had been in the corps long enough to know that stateside marines didnt like china marines the tales amplified in the retelling of houseboys to clean billets of custom made uniforms of exotic women available for the price of a beer of extra retirement credit et cetera tended to cause some resentment toward china marines among their stateside peers and here would be a china marine a corporal three months into his second hitch showing up to fuck good ol pfc whatsisname out of his promotion when the uss charles e whaley finally tied up at pearl harbor there was a master at arms and two shore patrol guys waiting for him at the foot of the gangplank he wasnt under arrest or anything the master at arms told him although he really should write him up for his illegal embroidered to the sleeves chevrons it was just that the uss fenton was about to sail for diego and they didnt want him to miss it the uss fenton turned out to be an old fourstacker destroyer that was tied up the other side of pearl ten minutes after he was shown his bunk in the focsle a loudspeaker six inches from where he was supposed to sleep came to life now hear this now hear this offduty watch stand to in undress whites to man the rail that fucking loudspeaker went off on the average of once every ten minutes all the way across the pacific to diego the only kind thing mccoy could think of to say about the uss fenton dd was that it made san diego six days out of pearl she was carrying a rear admiral who didnt like to fly and knew that with his flag aboard nobody was going to ask questions about fuel consumed making twentytwo knots it must have been great on the bridge turning the tin can into a speedboat but where he was mccoy thought he had trouble staying in his bunk and his body was bruised black in half a dozen places from bumping into bulkheads and ladder rails when he misjudged where the tin can was going to bounce but diego was next and he would soon be on land again and there was no reason he couldnt get a nice berth on the train from san diego to philly the corps probably wouldnt pay for it but he could do that himself in his money belt he had a little over three hundred dollars in cash the hundred hed started with plus the hundred ninety hed wonten and twenty dollars at a timefrom the pigboat sailors on the charles e whaley and the ten hed won in the only game there had been on the tin can plus an ornately engraved officers guaranteed checque on barclays bank ltd shanghai for that came from the last crazy thing that had happened in shanghai when hed gone to the apartment to sell his stuff the general said hed make it easy for him hed take everything off his hands for five hundred dollars american mccoy had jumped at that then the general pushed a deck of cards at him and demanded double or nothing mccoy cut the deck for the jack of clubs to the generals eight of hearts once more the general demanded just so long as its once more mccoy said im not going to keep cutting the deck until you win and quit he got a dirty look for that once more the general said thats it mccoy cut the five of clubs the general smiled showing his gold teeth until he cut the three of hearts but he paid up even though he had to go to the bank to get that kind of cash mccoy added the generals two thousand american to the money already in barclays bank and then asked for a cashiers check for the whole thing after a moment they understood that what he wanted was what they called an officers checque he made them make it payable in dollars the limeys were in a war and he didnt want to take the chance that theyd tell him to wait for his money until the war was over when he went to cash it he could goddamned well afford a pullman berth from california to philly even if they wouldnt give him credit for the government rail voucher and he had to pay for the whole damned thing himself mccoy had taken boot camp at parris island and hed shipped to china out of mare island in san francisco so this was his first time in diego his initial impression of the placeor anyway of the part that he saw which was the marine corps recruit depotwas that it was a hell of a lot nicerlooking at least than parris island although he supposed that that didnt make a hell of lot of difference to boots they probably had the same kind of semiliterate sadistic assholes for dis here that they did at parris island there was a bullshit legend in the corps that after you finished boot camp you would understand why the dis treated you like they did how it had been necessary to make a marine out of you and how youd now respect them for it as he watched a diego di jab his elbow in the gut of some kid who wasnt standing tall enough or who had dared to look directly at the di or some other chickenshit offense mccoy remembered his own parris island di if i ever see corporal ellwood doudt that vicious shitkicking hillbilly again he thought ill make him eat his teeth even if i have to go after him with a twobyfour mccoy found the post transportation office without trouble in a spanishlooking building with a tile roof he set his seabags down and presented his orders to a sergeant behind a metalgrilled window like a tellers station in a bank you need a partial pay corporal the sergeant asked let it ride on the books mccoy said i was a little lucky on the ship your luck just ran out the sergeant said i hate to do this to you corporal but you report to the brig sergeant what theyll explain it over there the sergeant said i just do what im told all i want from you is a rail voucher to philadelphia mccoy said you would have been smarter to pay your own way and put in for it when you got there but you didnt you came here and my orders are to send the next three corporals who come in here over to the brig theres a shipment of prisoners headed for portsmouth the guard detail needs a sergeant and three corporals now that youre here they can go give me a break forget i came in i cant the sergeant said i got to send a twx to washington saying youre in the states you read the orders the brig sergeant was a fortyyearold gunnery sergeant a wiry tightlipped man with five hash marks and a face so badly scarred that mccoy wondered how the hell he managed to shave what did you do corporal fuck up in china he said when mccoy gave him his orders not as far as i know gunny mccoy said im being transferred in grade well we got sixteen sailors headed for portsmouth he said mostly repeat shipjumpers one deserter one assault upon a commissioned officer one thief and three fags you plus a second lieutenant a staff sergeant and two other corporals are going to take them there and all the time you thought the corps didnt love you right theres no way i can get out of this youre fucked corporal the gunny said you just lucked out in addition to the other corporals the sergeant and the lieutenant the guard detail consisted of seven privates and pfcs the other corporals and the sergeant were at least ten years older than mccoy the lieutenant was mccoys age a muscular crewcut tanned man whoto prove his own importance mccoy thoughtwent right after mccoy youre a little young to be a corporal arent you have you had any experience with a detail like this no sir youve qualified with the shotgun no sir why not i dont know sir whats your skill motor transport sir they must be pretty generous with motor transport promotions in china the lieutenant said i guess so sir frankly id hoped to have a more experienced noncom the lieutenant said one at least who has qualified with the shotgun im an expert with the springfield and the sir i think i can handle a shotgun you cant handle a shotgun corporal until youre qualified with the shotgun the lieutenant said as if explaining something to a backward and unpleasant child ill have the gunnery sergeant arrange for you to be qualified aye aye sir a corporal drove mccoy to the range in a pickup truck the same corporal watched him fire ten brasscased rounds of oobuckshot from a winchester model gauge trench gun at a silhouette target at fifteen yards he then drove him back to the brig and told mccoy it was sop to clean a riot gun whenever it had been fired that meant it had to be detail stripped mccoy couldnt just run a brass brush and then a couple of patches though the bore as careful as mccoy was he managed to spot his shirt tie and trousers with bore cleaner which meant that he might as well use them for rags or throw them away because no matter how many times you washed them you couldnt get bore cleaner out of khakis when he reported back to the lieutenant the lieutenant told him that he had a soiled uniform aye aye sir ill change it when you do change it corporal make sure you have a shirt with regulation chevrons sir get rid of those tijuana stripes corporal mccoy decided to take a chance he had nothing to lose anyway sir embroideredtothegarment chevrons are regulation in china youre no longer in china corporal the lieutenant said and i dont want to debate this with you i expect to see you here at tomorrow in the correct uniform aye aye sir and corporal ive inquired and regulations state that at my discretion the noncoms may be armed with the pistol since you say you are an expert with the pistol i think you had better draw one rather than arm yourself with a trench gun aye aye sir mccoy said the th motor transport company at philadelphia mccoy thought had to be an improvement over what he was doing now otherwise he was going to belt some chickenshit sonofabitch like this before his discharge came and get dragged to portsmouth with a trench gun pointed at his back he went to the clothing store and bought three shirts and had regulation chevrons sewn to their sleeves and then he fought down the temptation to get a hotel room in diego the way his luck was running lately hed get in a fight or something and get his ass in a crack the duty nco at the brig found a cot for him and he slept there in the morning the lieutenant gave everybody detailed instructions and a little pep talk then they went to the brig gate to take over the prisoners the prisoners were in blue denim with a foothigh p stenciled on the knee of the trousers and on the back of the jacket they each carried a small cotton bag which contained a change of underwear and socks another set of pmarked denims a toilet kit less razor since attempted suicide was a possibility especially among the deviates they would shave themselves under the supervision of their guards and their choice of either new testament or roman catholic missal they were handcuffed the right wrist of one man to the left wrist of the man beside him and their ankles were chained which made them walk in a shuffle on the brig bus the lieutenant informed the guard detail that if a prisoner escaped marine corps regulations stated that the guard responsible for that prisoner would be confined in his place mccoy knew that was bullshit but he wondered if the lieutenant really believed it or whether it was just one more instance of an officer believing the troops in line were so stupid he could tell them anything he wanted the brig bus delivered them to the san diego railroad station a us army troop car had been made available to the marine corps for the trip it was attached to the train immediately behind the locomotive mccoy marched his guard detailtheir riot guns at port armsand the fourteen handcuffed and shackled prisoners through the crowded concourse and down the platform to the army troop car he tried to tell himself that all he was doing was his duty that these guys had fucked themselves up that they had no one to blame but themselves for the mess they were in but it didnt work none of the fourteen prisoners was old enough to vote most of them looked not only frightened and humiliated but insignificantlike little boys and so did most of their guards he was going to have to have a quiet word with the guards on his shift to make sure that one of the little boys didnt without goddamned good reason turn his shotgun on another of the little boys mccoy was relieved when they were all inside the army car he could not ever remember being so uncomfortableso ashamed of himself was more like itthan when he had marched this pathetic little band through the station the sergeant showed up just before the train pulled out to show mccoy and the other corporals where he and the lieutenant would be sleeping and to explain the arrangements the lieutenant had come to with the conductor regarding chow the dining car would make available sandwich meals for the prisoners which would have to be picked up by the guard detail when things settle down maybe you corporals can get a meal in the dining car but for now the lieutenant says he doesnt want you to leave the car the lieutenant made four ritual appearances every day at and hours he stayed about ten minutes making sure that every prisoner had eaten washed and shaved and had washed his previous days uniform and underclothing mccoy managed to eat in the dining car only once the waiters made it perfectly clear by lousy service and exaggerated courtesy what kind of shit they considered the guards to be he didnt need any more reminding he took every other meal in the us army troop car which meant that he ate nothing but sandwiches and coffee all the way across the north american continent it wasnt what he had dreamed about on the pacific a plush seat in a pullman car and meals and drinks in the club car as america the beautiful rolls past the windows but that of course was fantasy this was reality this was the fucking united states marine corps two boston massachusetts hours july mccoy had to change trains at boston for the philadelphia train he had plenty of time the boston maine from portsmouth had put him into boston at five minutes to three by quarter after three he had a reserved seat on the club car theyd given him a train voucher to philly and two meal tickets at the portsmouth naval prison but hed torn them into tiny pieces and thrown the pieces into a trash bucket he didnt want a fucking thing to do with anything concerning the portsmouth naval prison or more importantly with the fucking united states marine corps he had made that decision somewhere between diego and chicago and still wondered why he hadnt thought of it before for his own sake not in connection with any dumb fucking ideas he had about doing something with ellen goddamnthebitch feller he had five thousand fucking dollars there was absolutely no reason he had to stay in the marine corps and put up with all the shit he could buy his way out of the corps and get a job things were better now and he had a high school diploma maybe even go back to shanghai and see if he couldnt work something out with piotr petrovich muller or the general five thousand simoleons plus was a lot of money even if he spent whatever it cost for passage back to shanghai he would have enough left over not to have to worry about getting a job right that minute he could look around see what looked good and move into that so it was really a good thing in the end that the fucking corps had sent him home as a fuckup for doing what he was supposed to do and even a better thing that he had gotten involved in the prisonerescort detail it had convinced him to get the hell out of the fucking corps otherwise he would have stayed in china sticking his neck out and sooner or later the japs would have done to him what they tried to do to sessions the prisonerescort detail had gotten worse toward the end after theyd changed trains in boston for new hampshire and really rough when they actually got to portsmouth there had been another bus with bars over the windows waiting for them along with three marines carrying pistols in white web gear and threefootlong billy clubs they kept slapping in the palms of their hands all the prisoners were scared shitless and two of them one of the fairies and the great big guy who was going to do ten years before he was dishonorably discharged for slugging an officerhad actually cried there was a little ceremony when the prison signed for the prisoners then one of them tried to ask a question and got the end of a billy club in his gut for it hard enough to knock the wind out of him and knock him down and that fucking lieutenant just stood mere and made believe nothing had happened he knew goddamned well it was a violation of rocks and shoals the disciplinary code for the governance of the naval services to hit somebody with a billy club like that but the chickenshit sonofabitch didnt do a thing about it he was more concerned with important things like taking mccoy aside and telling him he was willing to admit a mistake about him and that he had probably been put off by mccoys tijuana chevrons anyhow the lieutenant went on he wanted to tell mccoy his deportment during the trip was all and more that could be expected of a good marine noncom and that when he got back to san diego he was going to write his commanding officer a letter of commendation what that was going to mean after he got to this fucking truck company in philly and mccoy believed the chickenshit sonofabitch was serious about writing the letter was that whenever some poor sonofabitch had to be transported to portsmouth that shitty detail would go to corporal mccoy since he was so good at it but fuck that the first thing he was going to do when he got to the th motor transport platoon was ask the first sergeant for the forms to buy himself out of the corps there was a bar in the station in boston and mccoy walked by it half a dozen times waiting for the philly train without going in he wanted a drink he wanted lots of drinks but he was going to wait until he was safe on the trainhad left portsmouth naval prison behind him for good before he took one the first time he noticed the guy looking at him was on the platform he was a regular candyass about his age wearing a regular candyass seersucker suit and mccoy thought he was probably a kid going home from college except that it was now the middle of july and colleges were closed for the summer the candyass wasnt just looking at him he was sort of smiling at him as if goosing up his courage to talk to him christ there were fairies all over goddamnthebitch ellen fellers husband wasnt the only one and he never would have guessed that hairy machinists mate second on the whaley was a cocksucker and now here was this kid making eyes at him who looked like an arrow shirt company advertisement for a choirboy boy scout on the train the club car steward put mccoy in a velvet plush chair by a little table and handed him a menu fifty cents not counting tip was a hell of a lot of money for one lousy drink of scotch whiskey but he didnt give a fuck what it cost he was entitled hed been thinking about this drink practically from the moment he went aboard that fucking fleet oiler in shanghai just as the waiter was about to take his order the guy who had been making eyes at him on the platform walked up this free he asked putting his hand on the back of the velvet plush armchair on the other side of the table help yourself mccoy said how am i going to get rid of this pansy without belting him scotch mccoy said to the waiter johnnie walker soda on the side same for me please the pansy said mccoy gave him a dirty look im about to be a marine myself the pansy said youre what mccoy asked incredulously im about to join the marine corps the pansy repeated im about to get out of the marine corps mccoy said you are the pansywhosaidhewasabouttoenlist asked surprised i thought all discharges were frozen im getting out mccoy said firmly he remembered hearing rumors of a freeze or a years extension or something like that but he hadnt paid a hell of a lot of attention jesus christ what if this candyass is right then what you sound as if youre not happy in the marine corps the young pansy said he doesnt talk like a pansy and wave his hands like a woman but then neither did the machinists mate second do i mccoy replied unpleasantly then youre just the guy i want to talk to the young man said the way the recruiters talk its paradise on earth all the food you can eat all the liquor you can drink and all the prettiest girls throwing themselves at you youre really going in the corps mccoy asked his curiosity arousedand his suspicions diminished just a little by the pretty girls im really going in the corps the young man said he put out his hand malcolm pickering he said mccoy took it ken mccoy he said pickerings grip was firm not like a pansys the steward set their drinks on the table put that on my tab pickering said i can buy my own drink mccoy said put the next round on your tab pickering said reasonably mccoy nodded he twisted the cap off the miniature bottle and wondered idly if putting it in its own little bottle was how they got away charging half a buck for one lousy drink he picked it up and read the lable it held ounces that brought it down to cents an ounce which was still a hell of a lot more than he was used to paying for liquor can i ask you a question corporal mccoy malcolm pickering asked mccoy looked at him and nodded i saw you in chicago on the track with some strangelooking guys pickering said what was that all about chicago what the hell does he mean by that and then he understood there had been an hours wait while the railroad switched locomotives the lieutenant had the bright idea that the prisoners should exercise since they couldnt do calisthenics or closeorder drill handcuffed and with their feet shackled what the lieutenant had done was send them shuffling up and back down the track for half a mile or so this pickering guy had obviously seen that we were exercising the prisoners he said that what you mean what did they do pickering asked three of them were fags mccoy said one of them slugged an officer the rest of them found out the hard way that once you enlist youre in until they let you out they were marines sailors mccoy said the marine corps does the navys dirty work like guarding and transporting prisoners what happened to them we took them to the naval prison at portsmouth new hampshire to serve their sentences mccoy said is that what you do in the marine corps pickering asked no mccoy said i just got to san diego when they needed a couple of corporals for the guard detail what do you do pickering asked im a motor transport corporal mccoy said though he didnt like the sound of it thats what he was on paper i work in the motor pool you like it no i told you im just waiting to get out of the marine corps then what will you do mccoy didnt want to tell this nosy guy that he was going back to china that would trigger a whole new line of questions and aside from going back to china he couldnt think of a thing he was likely to do he had been in the marine corps since he was seventeen it was the only thing he had ever done what made you join the corps mccoy asked my father was a marine pickering said in the world war and he didnt warn you off mccoy said he was a corporal pickering said what he warned me to do was get a commission then he realized what he had said i didnt mean to offend he began your father was right mccoy said so with war coming i figured i had better get one pickering said a commission i mean you seem sure that were going to get into this war mccoy said you dont christ i hope not mccoy said were probably going to have to do something about the japanese pickering argued the japs are probably thinking the same thing about us mccoy said and you wouldnt believe how many of the bastards there are but theyre not like americans are they pickering asked the ones ive seen are firstclass soldiers mccoy said he saw the surprise on pickerings face the ones youve seen pickering asked i just came from china mccoy said i was with the fourth marines in shanghai now why the fuck did i start in on that id like to hear about that pickering said id rather talk about something else mccoy said like what pickering said agreeably im going to be stationed in philly mccoy said for a while i mean say a month or six weeks until i can get my discharge if you know anything about it why dont we talk about the best way to get laid in philadelphia the best way ive found pickering said is to use a bed but there is a school of thought that says that turning them upside down in a shower is the way to go mccoy looked at him for a moment and then laughed out loud you tell me about the marines in china mccoy pickering said and then i will tell you about getting laid in philadelphia maybe with a little luck when we get there thats where im going too to the navy yard to give them my college recordswe could conduct what they call a practical experiment if i keep drinking with this guy and then start chasing whores with him i am probably going to get my ass in deep trouble but right now i dont give a fuck he raised his hand above his head snapped his fingers at the steward for another drink and turned to malcolm pickering you can buy a fourteenyearold virgin in shanghai for three dollars he said whats the going rate these days in philly there are no fourteenyearold virgins in philadelphia malcolm pickering said solemnly ill be goddamned if i dont really like this candyass civilian three the bellevue stratford hotel philadelphia pennsylvania hours july the first thing mccoy remembered when he woke up was that there had been a woman in bed with him which meant he was likely to find his money and his watch gone the second thought was more frightening the guaranteed officers checque from barclays bank ltd shanghai had been in his money belt with the three hundred bucks the whore probably wouldnt be able to cash it but sure as christ she would have taken it and it was going to be a real pain in the ass to get it replaced when he sat up his head hurt like a toothache as if his brain had shrunk and was banging around loose inside his skull his lips were dry and cracked and the tip of his tongue felt like the sole of a boot how the hell am i going to get from wherever the hell i am to the navy yard without any fucking money or for that matter out of the hotel jesus christ i hope at least they made me pay in advance he looked around the room and that made it worse this was no dollaranight hotsheet joint this was not only a real hotel but a fancyhotel hotel great big fucking room drapes over the windows a couch and a couple of armchairs and christ only knows what he had paid for the bottles sitting on a chest of drawers across the room before the whore got his money he thought at least hed spent a hell of a lot of it and then he saw the money belt it was on the little shelf over the wash basin in the bathroom that figured just before she left the whore had taken the money belt into the bathroom just in case he should wake up and see her going through it once shed emptied it she hadnt given a damn where she left it he needed a glass of water and desperately maybe if he hadnt been rolled too he could borrow say ten bucks from pickering it wasnt the end of the fucking world he had his pay record with him and he had at least two months back pay on the books all he had to do was come up with enough money to get from here to the philadelphia navy yard and he could draw enough money to keep him going and he would go to some bank and ask them what you were supposed to do when you lost a guaranteed officers checque he would say he lost it and since he hadnt signed it they would have to sooner or later make it good he staggered across the room to the bathroom and saw that it was really a highclass place there was a little button marked ice water that operated a tiny little chrome water pipe and when you pushed the button it really produced ice water he drank one glass of ice water so quickly it made his teeth ache he drank a second glass more slowly from time to time looking at his reflection in the mirror over the sink his eyes were bloodshot andhe had to check twice to make sure what it washis ears were red with lipstick he looked down at other parts of his body well i apparently had a very good time even if i cant remember the details there was something under the empty money belt making a bulge idly curious he pushed the money belt off it it was his watch ill be goddamned mccoy said then told himself that just because the whore hadnt stolen the watch it didnt mean she hadnt helped herself to the cash and the checque it wasnt that good a watch he knew he had bought it primarily because it had a lot of radium paint on the hands so that he could see them at night he picked up the money belt and worked the zipper there was money in it and the checque ill be goddamned he said again now he had a cramp in his bladder so he went to the toilet and relieved himself he saw that the bathroom had two doors one led in from his fancy bedroom and one went out into some other room when he was finished taking a leak an incredibly long teak he tried the knob it was unlocked and he pushed it open malcolm pickering mccoy remembered at that moment that sometime during last night pickering had told him to call him pick was on his back on a double bed stark naked his arms and legs were spread and he was awake please piss a little more quietly pick pickering said i woke up thinking our ship was going down shit mccoy laughed i have come to the conclusion corporal mccoy pick pickering said that you are an evil character who rides on railroads leading innocent youth such as myself into sin it looks like we had a good time mccoy said yeah doesnt it pickering said what time is it a little after nine mccoy said i treat my hangovers with large breakfasts and a beer pickering said that sound all right to you i dont want to report smelling of beer mccoy said they have sensen pickering said and suddenly sat up jesus he said and then he swung his feet to the floor and reached for the telephone room service he ordered and then this is malcolm pickering in large orange juice breakfast steak medium cornedbeef hash eggs up toast two pots of coffee and two bottles of feigenspann ale do that twice please and the sooner the better very classy mccoy thought thatll probably cost three four maybe five dollars but what the hell ive still got most of my money whats this place costing us mccoy asked i probably shouldnt tell you this killer pickering said it is only because i am an upstanding christian that i do we flipped for it last night and you won its not costing you a dime and i dont want to think about what its costing me mccoy was surprised that pickering called him killer the only way he could have known that was if he had told him and the only way he would have told him as if he needed another proof was that he was pretty drunk i want to pay my share mccoy said dont be a damned fool if that quarter had landed on the other side you would have paid pickering said he got to his feet and walked across the room but since i am paying i get first shot at the shower if anything mccoy decided pickerings room was larger than his and then he noticed that a door and not just the bathroom connected both rooms he went back to his own room found his seabags in a closet and took out a clean uniform it was clean but mussed he hated to report in a mussed uniform even if the first thing he was going to do when he reported in was ask for the buyout papers what the hell he said aloud and picked up the telephone he didnt give a damn what it cost he was going to have it pressed so far he hadnt spent much money at all a waiter and a bellboy delivered the breakfast on a rolling table by the time hed eaten everything and put down both bottles of ale he felt almost human again when he was dressed pick pickering lifted up the telephone and told them to send up a boy for the luggage and to have a cab waiting the mp at the gate to the navy yard took one look at mccoys campaign hat and went back in the guard shack for his pad of violation reports got to write you up corporal sorry the mp said maybe theyll let it ride because you just got back the officer procurement board was in a threestory redbrick building near the gate and mccoy said goodbye to pickering there well maybe well bump into each other again pickering said i hope by then im a civilian otherwise ill be standing at attention and calling you sir mccoy said so what pickering said it doesnt work that way pick mccoy said giving him his hand as you are about to find out this is the u fucking s fucking marine corps but it was fun and im glad the quarter landed the way it did good luck pickering said and squeezed mccoys hand a little harder then got out of the cab and walked up the sidewalk to the big redbrick building the th motor transport platoon was in a redbrick barracks building not far from the river two marines were very slowly raking the small patch of carefully tended lawn between the sidewalk and the building mccoy paid the cab driver and then stood by the open truck you guys want to give me a hand with my gear he called to the guys with the rakes he was still a corporal a noncommissioned officer noncommissioned officers dont carry things if there are privates around to carry things they looked at him curiously not missing the outofuniform campaign hat and the illegal chevrons then they stepped over the chain guarding the lawn and shouldered his seabags and followed him into the barracks building the linoleum deck inside glistened and the brass doorknobs and push plates were highly polished this was the states mccoy thought where american marinesnot chinese boyswaxed the decks and polished the brass and marine corporals watched them to make sure they did it right there was a sign on the orderly room door knock remove headgear and wait for permission to enter mccoy checked his uniform to make sure it was shipshape removed his campaign hat knocked and waited for permission to enter come a voice called and he pushed the door open and walked in there was a company clerk a pfc behind his desk and a first sergeant a squeakyclean guy of about thirtyfive behind his behind the first sergeant was a door marked lt aj fogarty usmc commanding you must be mccoy the first sergeant said you was due in day before yesterday at portsmouth they told me i had fortyeight hours to get here mccoy said im not due in until noon tomorrow what were you doing at portsmouth the first sergeant said i was in a squad of prisonerchasers from diego mccoy said shit the first sergeant said nobody told us anything about you going to portsmouth you went on the morning report as awol this morning now well have to do the whole fucking thing over well im stepping right off on the wrong foot not only did i have to take those poor bastards to portsmouth but it put me right on the first sergeants shit list we can submit an amended report the company clerk said when i want your advice ill ask for it the first sergeant said he looked at mccoy sit he said you know that campaign hats nonregulation no i didnt mccoy said well it is the first sergeant said and so are them chevrons i just got a violation written by the mp at the main gate mccoy said for the hat he didnt say anything about the stripes itll take a week ten days to come down through channels the first sergeant said i dont know nothing about violations until the message center delivers them and sometimes they get lost you want a cup of coffee ill be a sonofabitch hes not entirely a prick yes please thank you the first sergeant picked up the telephone on his desk and dialed a number then while it was ringing he covered the mouthpiece with his hand and spoke to the pfc you heard the corporal he said get him a cup of coffee and if they got any a doughnut the pfc scurried from the orderly room sergeantmajor this is quinn the first sergeant said to the telephone corporal mccoy wasnt awol they stuck him with a prisonerchaser detail to portsmouth he just reported in a day early i got him on the morning report as awol how do you want me to handle it whatever the sergeantmajor replied it didnt take long for the first sergeant broke the connection with his finger and dialed another number first sergeant quinn he announced is lieutenant fogarty there a moment later lieutenant fogarty apparently came on the line for quinn delivered the report that mccoy had arrived that he wasnt awol and that hed caught the morning report before it left for washington and was going to make out a new one the old man says wait first sergeant quinn said when he hung up you want to read the newspaper he pushed a neatly folded philadelphia bulletin across his desk toward mccoy top mccoy said what id really like is to get buyout papers filled out what no offense but ive have enough of the corps the first sergeant laughed not unpleasantly all discharges have been frozen he said nobodys getting out of the corps except on a medical discharge didnt they know that in china shit mccoy said theres some people thinks theres going to be war the first sergeant said i didnt know discharges had been frozen mccoy said lamely half an hour later a young pfc came into the orderly room without knocking mccoy noticed if youre corporal mccoy he said the old mans outside in the staff car mccoy looked at the first sergeant who jerked his thumb in a signal for him to go with the driver the old man was about twentyfour mccoy judged a wellsetup exfootball playertype he returned mccoys salute motioned him into the backseat of the staff car and then as it moved off turned to face mccoy im glad it turned out you werent awol corporal mccoy he said that really would have disappointed a lot of people sir i didnt volunteer to go to portsmouth mccoy said i didnt think you did lieutenant fogarty laughed they went back to the building where pick pickering had gone to deliver his college records to the officer procurement board that seemed a lot longer ago than an hour before mccoy thought he followed fogarty into the building and up two flights of stairs to the third floor fogarty pushed open a door and went into an office holding the door open for mccoy then he spoke to a staff sergeant behind a desk the not reallyawol corporal mccoy he said you go right in and report to the captain corporal the staff sergeant said hes been waiting for you since im not going to be able to get out of the corps id better do what captain banning told me to do keep my nose clean in this truck platoon and hope that when he comes home from shanghai hell remember his promise to see about getting me out of it that meant reporting according to the book mccoy went to the closed door knocked was told to enter and marched erectly in carefully staring six inches above the back of the chair that was facing him so that whenever the captain spun around in it he would be looking as custom required six inches over the captains head he came to attention and barked corporal mccoy reporting to the captain as directed sir the chair slowly spun around until the captain was facing him with that china marine hat killer captain edward sessions usmc said im surprised they didnt keep you in portsmouth aside from that how was the trip mccoy was literally struck dumb you seem just a little surprised mccoy sessions said chuckling can i interpret that to mean captain banning didnt guess what we had in mind for you whats going on here mccoy said for public consumption were part of the administrative staff of the marine detachment philadelphia navy yard and you were assigned to the th motor transport platoon because that was a good way to get you to philadelphia without a lot of questions being asked what this really isnot for public consumptionis the philadelphia detachment of the office of the assistant chief of staff intelligence of the marine corps i dont understand mccoy said im disappointed sessions said two things mccoy the first is that my boss believes you know a lot about the japanese in china that no one else knows including captain banning and we want to squeeze that information out of you secondly he thought the japanese would probably decide to do to you what you kept them from doing to me either reason would have been enough to order you home so what happens to me here i hope you have a clear head sessions said because there are two officers here who are about to pump it dry and then what then there are several interesting possibilities sessions said well get into that later when did you make captain mccoy asked and belatedly added sir i was a captain all the time sessions said the orders were cut two days after i sailed for shanghai he leaned across his desk and offered mccoy his hand welcome home mccoy welcome aboard chapter seven one goldens preowned motor cars north broad street philadelphia pennsylvania august there was no doubt in dickie goldens mind that despite the seersucker suit the kid looking at the lasalle convertible coupe on the platform was a serviceman for one thing he had a crew cut for another he was deeply tanned for another he didnt look quite right in his clothing he was wearing a seersucker suit but he was obviously no college kid he was probably a marine from the navy yard dickie golden decided they looked somehow different from sailors he was too young to be more than a pfc but maybe just maybe he was a lance corporal and the finance company would sometimes write up a lance corporal if he could come up with the onethird down payment there was of course no way this kid could come up with onethird down on the lasalle convertible even though it was really one hell of a bargain at cadillac had stopped making lasalles as of which really cut into their resale value and the last couple of years cadillac made them they had practically given them away but that hadnt worked and lasalles were orphans now a cadillac convertible like this one with the same engine about the only real difference between a little cadillac and a lasalle was the grill and the chrome would sell for twelve thirteen hundred the down payment on this would have to be at least and the odds were the kid looking at it didnt have that kind of money dickie golden did the rough figures in his head say he had the that would leave over two years plus a hundred a year for insurance a note over two years at was right at a month they paid marine privates a month he didnt know what they paid lance corporals but it wasnt much more but dickie golden decided what the hell it was an up it was possible the kid had just come off a ship or something with money burning a hole in his pocket from a crap game he just might have for a down payment more likely he could switch the kid over to something he could afford if he wanted an open car there was a pontiac convertible at and a forda little rough needed a new topfor he walked over to the kid good looking car isnt it dickie golden said ive been thinking of buying it myself for the little woman mccoy didnt reply to that you got the keys he asked mccoy had just about decided to buy the lasalle everything else was crazy why not buy a crazy car mccoy had just come from dinner with an officer and his wife that was why he was wearing a suit maybe an apartment in a tall building at parkway wasnt like officers quarters on a base and maybe there was some difference between a regular officer and an intelligence officer but he was a corporal usmc and sessions was a captain usmc it was the first time he had ever heard of a captains wife insisting that a corporal come to dinner more than that grabbing him by the arms and hugging and kissing him on the cheeks with her husband watching she was a goodlooking woman decent looking wholesome she looked a lot like mickey rooneys girl friend in the andy hardy movies ed told me what you did at the ferry ken mrs sessions said i can call you ken cant i yes maam he said well you cant call me maam she said i wont have that youll call me jean he hadnt replied on the wall was an eightbyten enlargement of the picture hed taken of sessions in the black cotton peasant clothes i want to thank you for my husbands life mrs sessions said when she noticed him looking at it and then when she saw how uncomfortable she had made him she added i know hes not much but hes the only one i have then captain sessions put a drink in his hand and soon afterward they fed him firstclass chow that mccoy had never had before one great big steak for all of them served in slices mrs sessions he was unable to bring himself to call a captains wife by her first name told him they called it a london broil since they were both being so nice to him he had been very careful not to say or do anything out of line he watched his table manners and went easy on the booze there was wine with the london broil and cognac afterward and as soon as he thought he could politely get out of there he left which had put him all dressedup on north broad street at eight oclock at night with no place to go but a bar and he didnt want to go to a bar drinking at a bar and trying to pick up some dame and get his ashes hauled did not seem like the right thing to do after a respectable dinner with a marine corps officer and his lady in their home so he had figured he would walk up north broad street and maybe see if he could find a car in one of the usedcar lotsat least get an idea of what they were asking for iron these days and then hed seen the lasalle and decided what the hell why not see what he could do the down payment on a car like this would be maybe a little more dickie golden said not wanting to let the kid take the car for a ride if there was no way he could handle it and the payments including insurance about thirty bucks a month over two years could you handle that much yeah mccoy said i could handle that much youre a marine arent you dickie golden said one more fact out of him and he would go get the keys yeah mccoy said the finance company dont like to make loans on a car like this to anybodys not at least a lance corporal im a corporal mccoy said and i can make the down payment okay you want to let me hear the engine take it for a ride dickie golden put out his hand im dickie golden corporal i didnt catch the name mccoy mccoy said well im pleased to meet you corporal mccoy he said you really know how to spot a bargain ill tell you that you bet your candyass i do you sonofabitch i grew up on a goddamned usedcar lot youre about to be had buster presuming the engine isnt shot in this thing seven hundred dollars seems like a lot of money for an orphan like this mccoy said well maybe we can shave that a little if you dont have a trade dickie golden said the battery was almost dead and went dead before the engine would crank a colored man with a battery on a little wheeled truck was called dickie golden said he would replace the battery maybe all it needs is a charge mccoy offered helpfully you dumb sonofabitch if you knew what you were doing youd not only make sure there was a hot battery in here but youd start it up every couple of days these flathead cubicinch vs are always hard to start no dickie golden said grandly i want this car to be right he told the colored man to replace the battery and then while they were waiting he suggested they take the information for the finance company down on paper he was obviously pleased with the facts mccoy gave him that he was a corporal unmarried and had no other installment loans outstanding mccoy decided he was going to come down from the and make it back by slipping the paper to some finance company who would give him half of the fifty back and make it up by charging eight percent maybe ten that would make the car then he would sell him insurance through some shyster outfit that would charge twice what it was worthmaking it part of the easy paymentsand slip dickie golden another twentyfive bucks back under the table then there would be a creditcheck charge and christ only knew what else after mccoys first look at the lasalle he went to another usedcar lot and gave the wash boy there a dollar to go in the office and borrow the blue book for him the blue book told him the lasalle was worth wholesale the average retail was and the average loan value was mccoy decided he would pay for the car dickie golden wanted to ride along with him of course when he took the test drive mccoy handled that by passing the salesman three hundred in cashenough for the down paymentto hold and when dickie golden said he still thought hed better go along mccoy turned indignant and asked if dickie golden didnt think he could drive and dickie golden backed down mccoy drove up broad street until the engine was warm and then pulled in a gas station on a side street and gave the guy running it a buck to let him put it up on the grease rack and lend him some tools he could find nothing wrong with the car and would have been surprised if he had it needed points and a condenser and an oil change and the wheels aligned but there was nothing seriously wrong with it the heads had never been off and the engine was just as dirty as it ought to be if it had required work it would have showed he drove back to goldens preowned motor cars dickie golden told him he had been getting worried mccoy told him he thought the clutch was going dickie golden said he didnt think so but that it was not much to worry about anyway since they had a thirtyday fiftyfifty fixany thing policy that meant they would pay half of the cost of anything that needed fixing or replacing in the next thirty days and besides he was going to knock off the price because corporal mccoy didnt have a tradein he showed mccoy the papers already made out with everything included after a down payment the payments would come out to over thirty months i talked them into going thirty months dickie golden said to keep your payments down you just hung yourself buster you must really get kickbacks from every sonofabitch and his brother so much that you wont mind going down another on the basic price ill give you for it mccoy said you got to be kidding dickie golden said thats all i can afford mccoy said then i guess we dont have a deal dickie golden said i guess not mccoy said you want to give me my back i guess i could ask my partner dickie golden said i dont think hell go along with this but id like to see you in the lasalle and i could ask him if i can catch him at home if youve got a partner at home or anywhere else ill kiss your ass at high noon at broad and market why dont you ask him mccoy said dickie golden was gone twenty minutes when he came back he had a whole new set of papers all made out my partner says is as low as we can go dickie golden said thats less than wholesale mccoy read the finance agreement with interest then he handed dickie golden deal he said whats this golden said looking at the money but not picking it up i already gave you mccoy said thats the other no this deal was to finance the car and for you to buy your insurance through us what do you want me to do call a cop its against the law in pennsylvania to take kickbacks from finance companies and insurance companies what are you some kind of wise guy you just write on there paid in full in cash mccoy said or we call the cops give me those papers back and get your ass off my lot ill walk just as far as the payphone booth down the block mccoy said with the papers i ought to kick your ass dickie golden said but when mccoy handed him the papers he wrote paid in full on the conditions of sale mccoy was pleased with himself when he drove the lasalle off the lot and onto north broad street not only was the lasalle a nice car but he had just screwed a usedcar dealer mccoy hated usedcar dealers patrick j mccoy of norristown pennsylvania past grand exalted commander of the knights of columbus good ol pat everybodys pal at the bar of the th street bar grill corporal kenneth j killer mccoys father was a usedcar dealer two the next morning was a saturday but there was no reveille bugle at least not one the enlisted members of the philadelphia detachment of the office of the assistant chief of staff for intelligence had to pay any attention to reveille sounded and ten minutes later first call and the truck drivers and mechanics of the th motor transport platoon went down and out on the street and lined up for roll call but the seven enlisted men in the three rooms on the attic floor set aside for the special detachment didnt even get out of bed until the bugler sounded mess call in addition to mccoy there were two gunnery sergeants a staff sergeant and three pfcs the pfcs were clerks the staff sergeant worked for captain sessions mccoy didnt know where the gunnery sergeants worked the only time one of the gunnery sergeants spoke to him since he reported in was when one of them told him he didnt have to stand any formations but that he had to be in the redbrick office building every morning at oheighthundred what happened there was that from the very first day they sat him down in an upholstered chair he suspected had been stolen from a day room and talked to him about what he knew about the imperial japanese army in china there were usually three of them captain sessions another captain and two lieutenants the other captain was pretty oldand an old marinebecause the first thing he asked mccoy was whether he had known major lewis b chesty puller in shanghai he commanded the second battalion sir mccoy said i knew who he was puller was a real hard ass fair but a hardass he acted as if he thought the second battalion was going to war the next day and trained them that way hes pretty good with a thompson himself the old captain said i thought maybe you two had got together and compared techniques aside from recognizing it as a reference to the incident at the ferry mccoy didnt know what the old captain was driving at no sir he said sometimes it was all the officers at once sometimes it was a couple of them and sometimes it was just one of the young lieutenants by himself always there was one of the pfcs to take care of changing the tubular records on a dictaphone however many of them there were the interrogation went generally the same every day they came with folders notebooks and pencils and they had thumbtacked maps of kiangsu shantung honan and hopeh provinces to a cork board the locations of japanese units were marked on each map the wall beside the cork board was painted white and they used that as a screen for a slide projector sometimes there were photographs including some he took himself some of these were blowups and some had been converted to slides and they asked question after question about the japanese forces mccoy was surprised at how wrong their information was about the jap order of battle and he could tell they didnt like some of his answers about the japanese it was as if they hoped he was going to tell them the japs were nothing but a bunch of fuckups who had done so well against the chinese because the chinese were fucked up even worse but he told them what he knew and what he thought the chinese were not lousy soldiers but they just didnt give a damn because they knew they were getting screwed by their officers who would sell the days ration if they could find a buyer the jap officers on the other hand were generally honest mean as hell they thought nothing of belting the enlisted mensergeants tooin the mouth but they didnt sell the troops rations and the rest of the jap system seemed to work well if a jap soldier was told to do something he did it period one of the young lieutenants had studied japanese in college when he was alone with mccoy he spoke a few words of japanese to him he didnt speak it all that well but he spoke better japanese than the old captain who had done eight years with the th marines in shanghai spoke chinese mccoy learned they didnt tell him but he learned that none of the young lieutenants was a regular they had all come into the corps right after college mccoy wondered what the hell they were doing sitting around asking an enlisted man questions as young lieutenants without any experience they should instead have been out with troops in the field once a couple of civilians an old one and a young one dropped in while he was standing in a skivvy shirt by a map of honan province the room was right under the roof and was hot as hell when they entered the room mccoy stopped talking not knowing who they were dont let me interrupt the older civilian said carry on mccoy the old captain ordered so he carried on that was the day he was straightening them out about how good the japanese soldiers were and he went on with that from time to time the old civilian would snort as if he didnt think mccoy knew what the hell he was talking about but mccoy decided to let the old guy fuck himself the civilians stuck around until he was finished when they were gone mccoy asked who they were for some reason the officers thought that was funny they laughed at him and he never got an answer mccoy had no idea how long the interviews were going to go on at first hed hoped they would go on forever but by the end of the second week he knew he was just about talkedout if there was something he knew about china they hadnt gotten out of him he couldnt think of what it was when first call blew that saturday morning he got out of bed and took a shower standing under the shower shaving reminded him of china and made him a little homesick for it the only time in china hed had to shave himself was when he was on a convoy the rest of the time thered been chinese boys to do it for him after he was dressed he went down to the mess for breakfast and then he walked to the gate when he had tried to bring the lasalle onto the yard the night before the guard at the gate wouldnt let him because he didnt have either a yard sticker license plates or proof of insurance but the guard had let him park the lasalle inside the gate and had explained to mccoy that he could get a sticker on saturday morning from the provost marshal if he got there before noon with proof of insurance and license plates mccoy started the lasalle and drove to an office of the pennsylvania motor vehicle bureau where he registered the car and got a cardboard temporary license plate until they mailed him a real one from harrisburg then he wentto an insurance agency and bought insurance it was still early and he didnt like the way the wear on the tires looked so he found a cadillac dealer while they were aligning the front end he went to the parts department and bought a set of points and condensers and a set of spark plugs and a carburetor rebuild kit finally on the way back to the navy yard he saw a sears roebuck where he bought a small set of tools on sale later he got a sticker from the provost marshal and drove to the barracks he would spend the weekend rebuilding the carburetor and changing the points and the plugs and maybe giving it a good shine with simoniz dickie golden for sure had used some quickie polish which made it look good but wouldnt last more than a week what he was doing he knew was not what he should really be doing working on the car was a dodge an escape he should really be going back to norristown even if he had to ride there on the interurban rapid transit but he didnt want to go home now or next week or maybe ever so maybe he would get lucky between now and next weekend maybe something would happen that would keep him from going home then like a transfer to the west coast or maybe getting run over by a truck three united states navy yard philadelphia pennsylvania hours august close the door ken captain sessions said and then help yourself to coffee if youd like i want to talk to you mccoy expected that sessions was going to talk to him about the lasalle he knew there was scuttlebutt around about it where the hell did a corporal come up with enough money to buy a car like that scuttlebutt had a way of getting aroundand that meant to the officers so he thought it had finally become official he poured black coffee in a china cup when he turned around sessions waved him into a chair have you given any thought ken about what youd like to do next that meant that the interviews as mccoy suspected were now over yes sir mccoy said sessions made a come on gesture with his hand captain banning said that when he gets home he would try to find a home for me mccoy said he said i should keep my nose clean and he would either get me to work for him again or send me back to heavy weapons have you ever considered becoming an officer sessions asked mccoy thought that over a moment before answering there were a number of officers around the corps who had been enlisted men and a number of noncoms had at one time or another been officers an even larger number of old noncoms had been officers in the haitian constabulary where the troops theyd commanded had been haitians mccoy had sometimes imagined that there would probably be a chance somewhere down the road after he had more time in for him to get to be a warrant officer and maybe even a commissioned officer but he sensed that sessions wasnt talking about some time in the future youre talking about now sir mccoy asked sessions nodded the corps is about to really expand mccoy even if we dont get in the war the corps is going to be five times as big as it is now were going to need large numbers of officers and many of them are going to come from the noncommissioned officer corps people like yourself in other words are you interested i dont know mccoy said more thinking aloud than a direct reply there are a number of people myself included ken who believe that you have what it takes i hadnt even thought about now mccoy said maybe later the process is simple sessions said you apply sergeant davis has your application all typed up all you have to do is sign it then you appear before a board of officers the purpose of that is to give them a chance to see how well you can think under pressure the board then votes on you and if they approve youll be ordered to marine corps schools in quantico and run through the final phase of the platoon leaders course if you get through that youd be commissioned a second lieutenant i never heard of the platoon leaders course mccoy said the primary source of officers will be young men who have spent their college summer vacations going through officer training courses the first summer they go through what amounts to boot camp and the rest of the time we give them everything from customs of the service to the platoon in the assault if you went to quantico you would be sent through the final phase with a group of them college boys mccoy said thinking of pick pickering thats how pickering was going to become an officer going through college is not a disease mccoy sessions said youd be surprised how many people have gone to college nice people jean went to college i met her there mccoy smiled at him i meant im not sure i could hack it in that kind of company mccoy said all ive got is a high school diploma and four years in the corps sessions said which i think would give you a hell of an advantage at quantico you think i could make it through mccoy asked i do sessions said but the only way to find out for sure is for you to apply pass the board and go its worth a shot i guess mccoy said thinking aloud what have i got to lose sergeant davis has your application all typed up sessions repeated ill approve it of course thank you mccoy said simply four after he signed his name to the applications staff sergeant davis had typed up for him he put the whole business from his mind convinced that like all other paperwork hed seen in the corps it would take forever and a day to work its way through the system he had more important things on his mind than the possibility that the application might some months down the pike be favorably acted upon or that some further months down the pike he would be facing a board of officerswhich probably wouldnt approve him anyway after a while in fact hed come to the conclusion that the incident at the ferry had a lot more to do with the whole business than sessionss brilliant insight that he would make an officer sessions was being nice to him the officers he would face on the board when and if he got to face it wouldnt think they owed him a thing and besides he had three much more immediate problems to face all of them connected the first was what was going to happen to him now that the interviews were over he didnt want to go to the motor transport platoon but on the other hand that would be a good place to keep his nose clean until captain banning came home from shanghai and he didnt really want to go to a heavy weapons platoon as a machinegunner either since hed be transferring in grade they would try to bust him on general principles and that would fuck up going back to work for captain banning he could also ask captain sessions to keep him around the detachment sessions would probably do itas a favor but that would mean hed have to work as a clerk and push a typewriter and he was still not anxious to do that and more important if he stayed in philadelphia hed have to deal with his two other problems he had made up his mind to go home and face that and get it the hell over with once and for all but going home once was not the same thing as having home so close to where he was stationed christ norristown was only an hour away in the lasalle these were the thoughts that were occupying his mind not the remote waydownthepike possibility of being called before a board of officers who would make up their minds whether or not he stood a chance of keeping up with a bunch of college boys at quantico on monday morning he signed the application papers on wednesday morning staff sergeant davis came to the barracks and told him to put on his best uniform and report to the board at sit down corporal a major who was the president of the board said the five officers of the board were sitting behind two issue tables pushed together one was a second lieutenant who was functioning as secretary two of them were first lieutenants lieutenant fogarty the th motor transport platoon commander was one of them captain sessions was the fourth and the last was the major mccoy was seeing for the first time mccoy sat down at attention in a straightbacked wooden chair facing the tables we have before us what is apparently a wellturnedout corporal of the regular marine corps the president of the board said who with his shady reputation his illegal chevrons and his equally illegal campaign hat is just about what we expected of a china marine so highly recommended by captain sessions and others come on major captain sessions chuckled the lieutenants going to write that all down strike everything afterwhat did i saywellturnedout corporal of the regular marine corps lieutenant the president ordered aye aye sir the lieutenant said and smiled at mccoy who comes to us not only recommended by captain sessions but by another member of this board lieutenant fogarty whose recommendation is based on his longtime evaluationit must be three weeks nowas the corporals platoon leader the corporals qualifications having after due evaluation been judged to be more than adequate we now turn to the real question in your own words corporal would you tell this board why you feel yourself qualified after proper training to serve your country and the marine corps as a commissioned officer im not sure i do sir mccoy said thats the wrong answer corporal the president of the board said you want to try again tell us why not mccoy captain sessions said this whole fucking thing is unreal how am i supposed to answer that he paraphrased what was in his mind im not sure i know how to answer that question sir he said youve known second lieutenants mccoy sessions said pick out any one of them except this one and tell us why you doubt your ability to do anything he can do sir all ive got is a high school education mccoy said you speak chinese i have been told the president asked and japanese and several european languages i dont speak japanese as well as chinese sir and i can hardly read it at all well heres a given for you corporal so far as the marine corps is concerned fluency in almost any foreign language is worth more than a bachelors degree anything else i wouldnt know how to behave as an officer sir theyll teach you that at quantico the president said anything else sir captain sessions just sprung this whole idea on me answer this question think it over firstyes or no no qualifications do you want to be an officer or dont you mccoy thought it over for what seemed to him like a very long time the president of the board began to tap his fingertips impatiently on the table captain sessionss left eyebrow was arched a sign of impatience often followed by an angry outburst yes sir mccoy said you are temporarily dismissed corporal the president said while this board discusses your application there may be other questions for you please wait in the corridor aye aye sir mccoy said he stood up did an aboutface and marched out of the room he had just managed to close the door when he broke wind it smelled like something had died the board will offer comments in inverse order of rank the president said lieutenant sir im a little concerned about his attitude the second lieutenant said he certainly took his time thinking it over when you asked him straight out if he wanted to become an officer it has been my experience lieutenant the major said that whats wrong with most junior officers is that they leap into action without thinking things over carefully yes sir the lieutenant said lieutenant bruce so far as im concerned lieutenant bruce said hes what were supposed to be looking for a noncom of proven ability who can handle a wartime commission lieutenant fogarty im impressed with him fogarty said simply hes a little rough around the edges maybe but they can clean up his language and teach him which fork to use at quantico ed the president asked turning to captain sessions i admit of course to a certain personal bias he saved my life one finds all sorts of previously unsuspected virtues in people who do that there was laughter along the table but even if he hadnt saved my skin and even if a certain unnamed very senior officer had not made his desires known i would enthusiastically recommend mccoy for a commission sessions added does he know about the general im sure he doesnt the general and his aide were in civilian clothing and they werent introduced sessions said being as objective as i can i believe the corps needs officers like mccoy because hes a linguist you mean the president asked hed be a linguist anyway sessions said but that would be a waste of his talents even though people who speak chinese and japanese are damned hard to come by we will now vote in the same order the president said unless someone wants to call him back and ask him something else he looked up and down the table lieutenant he asked when he saw that no one had any additional questions i vote yes sir the lieutenant said one by one the others said exactly the same thing this board whose president is not about to put his judgment in conflict with that of the assistant chief of staff for intelligence usmc the president said and waited for the expected chuckles after they came he went on especially after he said slowly carefully and with great emphasisi think we ought to put bars on that boys shoulders if for no other reason than he seems to be the only one in the marine corps besides me and chesty puller who doesnt think the japs can be whipped with one hand tied behind us he waited again for the chuckles then concluded this board has in secret session just unanimously approved the application of corporal mccoy to attend the platoon leaders course at quantico lieutenant you are directed to make the decision known to the appointing authority aye aye sir the lieutenant said call him back in here will you the president said the lieutenant went to the door opened it and motioned mccoy back into the room mccoy marched in and stood to attention beside the straightbacked wooden chair corporal the president said this board has considered your application carefully and after review by the appointing authority that decision will be made known to you through channels in the meantime you will continue to perform your regular duties do you have any questions no sir the president rapped his knuckles on the table this board stands adjourned until recalled by me mccoy thinking he had been dismissed again started to do another aboutface hold it corporal the president said sit down a minute mccoy sat down more or less at attention corporal unofficially what that platoon leaders course actually is is parris island for officers what its really all about is to make marinesmarine officersout of civilians to do that theyre going to lean hard on the trainees that might be harder for a marine corporal to take than it would for some kid straight from college it would be a shame if some marine corporal who a lot of people think would make a good officer were to say im a corporal i dont have to put up with this crap they can stick their commission do i make my point yes sir now while i cannot tell you how this board has acted on your application or whether or not the appointing authority will concur with its recommendation i can mention in passing that the next platoon leaders course begins at quantico one september and if i were you i wouldnt make any plans for the period following one september perhaps between now and one september your platoon commander could see his way clear to putting you on leave yes sir lieutenant fogarty said no problem there sir well thats it then the president said unless anyone else has something i want to sec the corporal a minute when this is over captain sessions said stick around please killer killer the president asked wryly is that what you call him my curiosity is aroused with respect sir that is a little private joke between the corporal and myself captain sessions said five norristown pennsylvania august norristown was dingier dirtier grayer and greasier than mccoy remembered and he had a terrible temptation just to say fuck it and turn the lasalle around and go back to philly in china mccoy had told himself more than once that he would never go back home because as far as he was concerned there was nothing left for him there that had been all right in shanghai but it hadnt been all right once the corps had sent him to philly he knew he was at least going to have to make an effort to go see his sister annemarie who was probably a regular nun by now and his brother tommy who was now eighteen and probably almost a man and maybe even the old man mccoy told himself that at least he was not going back to norristown the way he left on the interurban rapid transit car to philly with nothing in his pocket but the trolley transfer the marine recruiter had given him to get from the twelfth street station in philly to the navy yard he was coming home in a lasalle convertible automobile he was wearing a candyass college boy seersucker suit like pick pickering wore and he had a couple of hundred bucks in his pockets and a hell of a lot more than that in the philadelphia savings fund society bank at the convent a palefaced nun behind a grille told him that she was sorry she couldnt help him but she had never heard of anyone named annemarie mccoy a moment later the door over the grill was once more shut and locked after that he went to the rectory at saint rose of limas a young priest opened the door he was a darkeyed darkhaired guy who looked like he could be either some kind of a mexican or maybe a hungarian he was only wearing a tshirt but the black slacks and shoes gave him away besides mccoy could have told you this one was a priest even if he was naked in a steambath he had that look still mccoy was a little let down that the guy wasnt wearing a white collar and a black front can i help you the young priest asked is father zoghby in mccoy asked standing in exactly this spot he recalled he had asked that same question at least a couple of hundred times before when he was an altar boy later when he was in some kind of trouble in school and the sisters or the brothers sent him to see the father and later still on the night when the old man went apeshit and came after him with crazy eyes swinging the bottom of the lamp mccoy came here that night because he hadnt known where else to go or what else to do im sorry the young priest said father zoghbys no longer at saint roses where is he mccoy asked hes in saint franciss im sorry to say the young priest said and repeated can i help you saint franciss was a hospital near philadelphia it was where they sent you if you were going to die or if you went crazy im looking for annemarie mccoy he said she used to be in this parish and then i heard she was at the sisters of the holy ghost as a novice but when i asked at the convent they told me she wasnt there and they wouldnt tell me where she went whats your interest in her shes my sister mccoy said ive been away i see the priest said there was recognition now in his eyes mccoy thought the young priest had probably heard all about the grief and pain the incorrigible son had inflicted on good ol pat mccoy before they ran the incorrigible off to the marines nobody but his family would believe it but when good ol pat wasnt gladhanding people at the usedcar lot or the kc or the th street bar grill good ol pat mccoy was pouring john jamiesons into his brain only his wife and kids knew it but good ol gladhand pat was a mean vicious drunk who got his kicks slapping his wife and his kids around sometimes he beat them because there was some kind of reason like not showing the proper respect or for bad grades or a note from one of the sisters or the brothers or for leaving polish showing when youd waxed one of the cars on the lot more often he beat them for no reason at all kenneth j mccoy would never forget the time when good ol pat had dragged him in front of the judge god knows your honor pat mccoy told the judge the honorable francis mulvaney a fellow knight at the kc i have tried to do my best for my family god knows that i sent them to parochial school when it was a genuine sacrifice to come up with the tuition i made them take mass regular i tried to set an example he paused then to blow his nose and wipe his eyes and now this his father went on maybe god is punishing me for something i done in my youth i dont know your honor ill hear your side of this his honor said to the incorrigible who replied that good ol pat had slapped his eldestjust turned seventeenson one time too many and his eldest son otherwise known to this court as the accused kenneth j mccoy had seen red and given him a shove back and good ol pat the loving father who had sent the accused to parochial school even when that had been a genuine financial sacrifice had been so drunk that he fell down and tore his cheek when he knocked over the coffee table and that had made of loving father so pissed that he came after die accused with the base of the table lamp after hed demonstrated his willingness to use it by smashing the philco radio and the glass in the bookcases and the plaster statue of the sacred heart of jesus the accused had fled the premises and sought refuge in the rectory of saint rose of lima roman catholic church there he had remained until accompanied by the good father zoghby he surrendered himself to the norristown police to face charges good of loving father pat mccoy had accused his eldest son of assault with intent to do bodily harm as well as general allaround incorrigibility and heathenism and ungrateful sonism im sorry he cut his face the accused mumbled to the judge thats all yes sir it had already been arranged father zoghby had told him when hed come to the jail hed had a word with the judge to spare his family any further shame and humiliation the judge would drop all charges on condition that the accused join the us marine corps for four years later hed tried to send his civvies home in the box they gave you at parris island but it had come back marked refused so had die letters hed written at first to his mother and annemarie and tommy then there had been a letter from father zoghby his father could not find it in his heart to forgive him and had started telling people he had no son named kenneth it would be better father zoghby continued if kenneth stopped writing until things had a time to settle he would pray that his father would in time forgive him and he would keep him posted if anything happened he should know while mccoy was still running the watercooledcaliber browning in dog company first battalion th marines father zoghby had written him one more letter his mother was dead annemarie had a vocation and was a novice at the convent of the sisters of the holy ghost tommy had gone to bethlehem where the steel mills had reopened and there was work and his father had remarried anne marie left the convent at least two years ago im sorry to say the young priest said im sure your father would know where she is i cant ask him mccoy said the priest looked at him for a moment and mccoy sensed that he was making up his mind then the priest stepped outside and closed the rectory door after him maybe i can help you he said he led him past the church building then down the cracked concrete walkway to the school buildingsthe grammar school to the left and the larger newer saint rose of lima high school building to the rightand finally to the nuns residence he spoke first to sister gregory who recognized mccoy as she looked down at him from the steps of the residence but acted as if she had never seen him before in her life she went back inside and a minute later sister paul appeared at the door and walked down the steps to where mccoy and the young priest stood how are you kenneth sister paul said im all right sister mccoy said how are you have you made things right between you and god kenneth i dont know sister mccoy said youre not going to make trouble are you kenneth she asked i just came home from china mccoy said i want to see annemarie you were in china were you yes sister anne marie left the sisters of the holy ghost sister paul said and im sorry to tell you she has also abandoned the church do you know where she is here in norristown sister paul said shes taken up with a protestant excuse me she chose to marry a young man outside the church hes a protestant whose name is schulter he has the amoco station at ninth and walnut they have two babies a little girl and a little boy thank you sister paul mccoy said i dont want you to do anything kenneth that will cause your father more pain she said i hope youve had time to grow up to think things through chapter eight one the man who walked out to the pump island when mccoy drove in wore an amoco uniform a striped shirt and trousers with a matching billed cap there was an amoco insignia on the brow of the cap and a nameplate dutch was sewn to the shirt breast the man was about thirty mccoy judged and already wearing a spare tire fill it with hightest sir he asked mccoy nodded after dutch had opened the hood mccoy got out of the car you must have just had the oil changed dutch said showing mccoy the dipstick clean as a whistle and right to the top your name schulter mccoy asked thats right dutch said warily curious im annemaries brother mccoy said dutch hesitated a moment and then put out his hand dutch schulter he said i heardshe told meyou was in the marines i am mccoy said you must be doing all right in the marines dutch schulter said making a vague gesture first at the lasalle and then at mccoy himself i do all right mccoy said the gas pump made a chugging noise when the automatic filler nozzle was triggered dutch schulter moved to the rear of the car topped off the tank then hung the hose up mccoy looked at the pump eleven point seven gallons at cents a gallon he took a wad of bills from his pocket and peeled off a tendollar bill dutch schulter handed the change to him together with a cocacola glass theyre free with a fillup he said how do i get to see my sister mccoy said schulter looked at him for a moment as if making up his mind and then raised his voice mickey a kid in an amoco uniform appeared at the door of the greaserack bay hold the fort mickey dutch called i got to go home for a minute home was a row house on north elm a little wooden porch in front of a fieldstone house that smelled of baby shit sour milk and cabbage anne marie looked older than he expected she was already getting fat and lumpy and she had lost a couple of teeth she cried when she saw him and hugged him and told him he had really growed up dutch touched his shoulder and when mccoy turned to look at him handed him a bottle of beer youre an uncle kenny annemarie said we got a boy and a girl but i just got them to sleep and youll have to wait to see them you can stay for supper i thought id take you and dutch out for supper mccoy said you dont want to do that she protested you wont believe what restaurants ask for food these days yeah i do mccoy said what i should have done dutch said is had him follow me in the truck you want to run me back by the station could you find your way back here again why dont you take my car mccoy said ive got no place else to go you got a car kenny annemarie asked surprised hes got a goddamned lasalle convertible is what hes got dutch said she looked at him in surprise you been doing all right for yourself i guess she said ive been doing all right mccoy said ill put it up on the rack and grease it dutch said and then have the kid works for me you saw him mickey wash it thank you mccoy said and tossed him the keys dutch schulter returned a few minutes after six as soon as the night man came on at the station mccoy was glad to see him annemarie was getting on his nerves she was a goddamned slob he had to tell her to change the diaper on the older kid he had shit running down his leg from under his diaper the sink was full of unwashed dishes mccoy remembered that come to think of it his mother had been sort of a slob herself many of the times the old man had slapped her around it had started with him bitching about something being dirty she told him she would really rather make his supper herself when dutch returned with his car she said he could take her down to the acme and she would get steaks or something but she didnt mean it and mccoy didnt want to eat in her dirty kitchen off her dirty plates she asked him if he had been to see daddy and he told her no and she told him she hadnt seen him either he had been mad at her since she left the convent and boy could she tell him stories about what went on in that place and after she had married dutch outside the church and all it had gotten worse dutch was a good man she said she had met him when she was working in the highway diner on the bethlehem pike after she left the convent he had been nice to her and one thing had led to another and theyd started going out then they got married and started their family mccoy did the arithmetic in his head and decided she had the sequence wrong she and dutch started their family and then got married the old man could count too which might be one of the reasons he was pissedoff at her how dare she embarrass past grand exalted commander pat mccoy of the kc she not only leaves or gets kicked out of the convent but she gets herself knocked up by some dutchy she meets slinging hash at the highway diner dutch came home with the lasalle all greased and polished then took a bath and got dressedup in a twotone sports coat and slacks annemarie had on a tootight spotted dress with a flowery print they loaded the kids in the car and went looking for someplace to eat anne marie said the food in the th street bar grill was always good and they didnt ask an arm and a leg for it mccoy knew she was less concerned with good food and saving his money than she was in going where the old man would be hanging out so hed see them together all dressedup and him driving a lasalle i saw a place on the way into town norristown tavern inn that looked nice mccoy said they charge an arm and a leg in there annemarie said yeah they do kenny dutch agreed he did care mccoy decided what it was going to cost what the hell i dont get to come all that often mccoy said when they were in the norristown inn in a booth against the wall annemarie looked up from trying to force a spoonful of potatoes into the boy and whispered theres daddy good ol pat mccoy was at the bar with a sharpfaced female her hair piled high on top of her head her lipstick a red gash across her pale face obviously the second mrs patrick j mccoy mccoy thought it over and when they were on their strawberry shortcake he got up from the table without saying anything and walked to the bar hello he said to his father his father nodded at him the second mrs mccoy looked at him curiously hes not surprised to see me which means that he saw me at the table with annemarie and dutch and didnt come over youre home i see mccoys father said about ten days ago mccoys father moved his glass in little circles on the bar learn anything in the marine corps mccoys father asked that told his new wife who i am now she doesnt like me either i learned a little mccoy said so what are you doing now looking for a job not yet maybe the dutchmanll give you one pumping gas his father said he laughed at his own wit and turned to his wife for an audience she dutifully tittered maybe he will mccoy said and walked back to the table what did he say annemarie asked not much mccoy said he told himself he was being a prick when the bill came and he got mad that annemarie had ordered one of everything on the menu hed offered to take them to dinner he shouldnt bitch about what it cost he told annemarie and dutch that he had to go back to philadelphia so he couldnt stay over on the foldaway bed but he promised to write then he dropped them at their row house before he left he asked for tommys address they were obviously pressed for dough and he considered slipping annemarie fifty bucks to buy something for the kids but decided against it shed already started moaning abut how hard it was to make it with two kids on what dutch brought home from the amoco station if he gave her money she would be back for more he didnt return to philly he never intended to though he wasnt on leave he didnt have to go back or make the reveille formation or anything lieutenant fogarty had pointedly told him that no one was going to be looking for him around the platoon and that if he didnt want to use up his leave time he could sack out in the barracks whenever and check in with the first sergeant every couple of days he just wanted to get away from the row house and the stink of baby shit and cabbage he stopped outside of town put the roof up then drove to bethlehem and checked into the hotel bethlehem it wasnt the bellevue stratford but it was nice and when he went down to the dining room in the morning they had breakfast steaks and corned beef hash on the menu he ordered it up fuck what it cost tommy lived in a rooming house a great big old rambling building built on the side of a hill he wasnt there of course but the landlady a big pinkcheeked polack woman told him he could probably catch him at the walk bridge over the railroad tracks when his shift was over and that if he missed him there he could find him at the lithuanian social club he drove around town he saw lehigh university and just for the hell of it drove inside there really wasnt much to see he was disappointed and wondered why what had he expected he went back to the hotel bethlehem and checked out when the eighttofour shift let out he was standing at the end of the bridge over the railroad tracks hoping he would be able to spot tommy tommy spotted him first tommy had changed so much he had let him walk right by him but tommy saw him out of the corner of his eye and came backeven though the last fucking person in the fucking world he expected to see was his fucking brother on the fucking bridge wearing a fucking suit they went to the lithuanian club and drank a lot of beer once tommy told the guys his fucking big brother was a fucking corporal in the fucking marines it was all right with them despite the fucking suit that made him look like a fucking fairy the lithuanian club reminded mccoy of the million dollar club in shanghai not in looks the lithuanian club was a dump it smelled of beer and piss but the million dollar club was the place where marines went because they had nowhere else to go and nothing else to do but get drunk when the duty day was over and thats all the lithuanian club was too a place where the enlisted men from the steel mill went because there was no place else to go when they came away from the open hearths and nothing to do but get drunk tommy reminded mccoy of a lot of marines he knew particularly in the line companies they wound up in a whorehouse by the railroad station mccoy paid for the allnight services of a peroxide blonde not because he was really all that interested in screwing her but because the alternative was worse he was too shitfaced to get in his car and drive back to tommys rooming house or the hotel bethlehem the corps was hell on drunk driving andor speeding he still hadnt accepted the possibility that he could become an officer which was the main reason why he hadnt said anything about quantico to either annemarie or tommy besides they probably wouldnt believe it which was easy to understand he didnt quite believe it himself but getting arrested for drunk driving or speeding would be the end of it he wanted to give it a shot anyway tommy pulled him out of the whores bed at halfpast six in the morning and said he had to go to fucking work and needed a fucking ride and some fucking breakfast he couldnt work eight fucking hours on the fucking open hearth with nothing in his fucking stomach they went to a greasy spoon and had eggs and home fries and coffee he dropped tommy off at the walk bridge over the railroad tracks and drove back to the navy yard two the san mateo club san mateo california august the building that housed the san mateo club had been built in as the country residence of andrew foster sr it so remained until when andrew foster jr seventy on the death of his wife moved into the penthouse atop the andrew foster hotel in san francisco and put the estate on the market it had been quickly snapped up by the board of directors of the san mateo club not only was the price right and the house large enough for the membership then rather crowded into the old clubhouse but the money was there a very nice price had been offered for the old club by developers who wanted to turn its greens and fairways into a housing development the foster estate the new club contained land enough to lay out twentyseven holes as opposed to eighteen at the old club as well as gently rolling pastures right beside the polo field that could accommodate far more ponies than the old club could handle and old mr foster jr had thrown in all of the furnishings except for those in his private apartment which had moved to the hotel penthouse with him the woman was lanky and fairhaired she wore a widebrimmed straw hat a pale blue dress and white gloves from where she was standing by the foot of the wide staircase leading to the second floor of the clubhouse she could see the reserve supply of champagne it was practically if somewhat inelegantly stored by the door to the passageway to the kitchen in icefilled galvanizediron watering troughs for horses she took a delicate bite of her hors doeuvre a very nice pate on a crisp cracker sipped at her champagne and seriously considered just picking up one of the bottles and carrying it upstairs he would probably find that amusing but it would be difficult to explain if she met someone coming down the stairs without the champagne it would be presumed that she was going up to use the john there were inadequate rest room facilities for ladies on the main floor of the san mateo club the men had no similar problem what had been a private study off the library had been equipped with the proper plumbing and that was it which meant that when nature called the men could conveniently take a leak not fifty feet from the bar but the women when faced with a similar requirement more often than not would find their small downstairs facilities occupied and would have to seek release in an upstairs john the silver lining in that cloud was that no one looked curiously at a woman making her way up the wide curving staircase she put her empty champagne glass on the tray of a passing waiter smilingly shook her head when he offered her a fresh glass and started up the stairs no one was in the upstairs corridors which she thought was fortuitous but she hurried nevertheless and quickly entered without knocking a door halfway down the right corridor there was a brass number on the door the numbered rooms were an innovation of the house committee before they had been put up people spending the night or the weekend in the new clubhouse had been unable to find their own rooms she closed the door and fastened the lock she could hear the sound of the shower and of his voice an entirely satisfactory tenor she smiled at that then walked to the bed saw that he had tossed his clothing on it sniffed and wrinkled her nose she delicately picked up the sweatsoaked blue polo shirt a cloth letter still safetypinned to it and an equally sweatsoaked pair of jockey shorts and dropped them onto the floor beside a very dirty pair of breeches a scarred and battered pair of riding boots and a pair of heavy woolen socks then she pulled the cover off the bed and turned it down she looked toward the bathroom wondering how long he had been in there how soon he could come out to find her surprise surprise then she had an even better idea she walked to a credenza and pulled her hat and gloves off and dropped them there then she took off her wedding and engagement rings and very quickly the rest of her clothing it would be amusing only if she was finished undressing but when she had finished that he still hadnt come out the last time shed seen him she remembered he had really needed a bath he had been reeking with sweat and perspiration was literally dripping off his chin but enough was enough she examined herself in a mirror and smiled wickedly at herself walked to the bathroom door opened it and went inside there was no shower stall one corner had been tiled the tiled area was so large that water from three shower heads aimed at the corner did not splash beyond it his head and face were covered with lather still singing cheerfully he was rubbing the tips of his fingers vigorously on his scalp she saw a shower cap on a hook and quickly stuffed her hair under it then she stepped into the tiled area hunching her shoulders involuntarily as the water colder than she expected struck her then she dropped to her knees reached out and put it in her mouth jesus christ pick pickering said are you crazy and then he yelped christ i got soap in my eyes he stepped away from her abruptly to turn his face to a shower stream slipping and almost falling the woman rose to her feet she went to him pressed her body against him and nipped his nipple where the hell is your husband pick pickering asked in the bar i suppose the woman said i got bored she put her hand on it and pumped it just a few times until it filled her hand you want to try doing it standing up she asked it would be sort of like doing it in the rain dorothy pick said she tried to arrange herself so he could penetrate her and failed i dont think thats going to work she said matteroffactly pick pickering picked her up and carried her to the bed penetration there proved simple three minutes later he jumped out of bed wham bam thank you maam she said thats not very nice youre out of your mind dorothy do you know that where are you going i am due in town right now he said who is she anyone i know he didnt reply no goddamned underwear he cried as he pawed through a canvas overnight bag i didnt bring any underwear how sexy dorothy said what the hell am i going to do do without she said i do that all the time he looked at her and smiled you would crack wise at the moment your husband shot us both with a shotgun he said that presumes his being sober enough to hold a shotgun dorothy said you really do have to go dont you the only reason i played at all today is because tommy whitlock canceled at the last minute he pulled a fresh polo shirt over his head and then started to pull on a pair of cotton trousers how lucky for the both of us she said he looked at her and smiled again be careful with the zipper she said i wouldnt want anything to get damaged neither would i he said im not going to see you again am i she asked i dont see how pick said ill miss you baby ill miss you too dorothy he said he found his wristwatch on the bedside table and strapped it on christ i am late he said he looked down at her and she pushed herself onto her elbows he leaned over and kissed her i really am going to miss you she said me too he said be careful baby she said he jumped up and hopping pushed his bare feet into a pair of loafers then he left without looking back at her thirty minutes later he was in san francisco by the entrance to the parking garage of the andrew foster hotel a sign had been placed on the sidewalk there sorry but just now we need all our space for our registered guests like everything else connected with the andrew foster hotel it was not an ordinary sign it was contained within a polished brass frame and lettered in gold and the frame was mounted in an ornate castiron mounting the andrew foster was one of the worlds great hotels the most prestigious as well as the most expensive hotel in san francisco the flagship of the fortytwohotel foster hotel chain certain standards would have been expected of it even if andrew foster were not resident in the penthouse andrew foster was fond of quoting the one great rule of keeping a decent inn it was not the sort of rule that could be written down for it changed sometimes half a dozen times a day it could be summarized and was behind his back as immediately correcting whatever offended his eye at the moment what offended andrew foster could range from a smudge on a bellmans shoes the one great rule of keeping a decent inn is that the staff must be impeccably turned out if you do that everything else will fall into place to an overdone mediumrare steak the one great rule of keeping a decent inn is to give people at table what they ask for if you do that everything else will fall into place to fresh flowers starting to wilt the one great rule of keeping a decent inn is to keep the place from looking like a rundown funeral home if you can do that everything else will fall into place the gilt lettered sign appeared on the sidewalk shortly after mr andrew foster spotted a simple garage full sign everything else would fall in place if people were told by means of a sign that didnt look as if it came off the midway of a secondrate carnival why they couldnt do something they wanted to and were offered the inns apologies for the inconvenience ignoring the sign pick pickering drove his car a black cadillac convertible roof down a brand new one into the parking garage he quickly saw that the garage was indeed full there was not sufficient room for the rear of the car to clear the sidewalk one of the neatly uniformed after the fashion of the french foreign legion parking attendants rushed to the car may i park your car for you sir the attendant asked very politely pick pickering looked at him and grinned would you please tony he asked im really late no the attendant said in elaborate mock surprise is that why everybody but the coast guards looking for you oh christ pickering said the one great rule of keeping a decent inn tony quoted is that people are where they are supposed to be when they are supposed to be there pickering finished for him youve heard that pick have you tony asked you want me to let him know youre here please tony pickering said and walked quickly almost ran between the tightly packed cars to a door marked staff only behind it was a locker room pickering started pulling the polo shirt off his head as he pushed the door open he had his pants off before he stopped before one of the battered lockers two dinner jackets were hanging in the locker and three dress shirts in cellophane bags fresh from the hotel laundry but there was no underwear where there was supposed to be underwear and not even any goddamned socks moving with a speed that could come only of long practice he put suspenders on the trousers studs and cufflinks in the shirt and as he hooked the cummerbund around his waist slipped his bare feet into patent leather shoes ninety seconds after he opened the locker door pick pickering tied the knot in the bow tie as he waited impatiently for an elevator the elevator door opened the operator a middleaged black woman stared at him and said youve got lipstick on your ear pick and the ties crooked would you believe this he said showing her his bare ankles as he stepped into the elevator and reached for a handkerchief to deal with the lipstick going to be dull around here without you she said laughing i understand hes in a rage pickering said is there any special reason or is he just staying in practice you know why hes mad she chided where were you anyway san mateo he said i was delayed i could tell she said then added you may wish you called him and told him most of the passenger waiting lights on the call board were lit up but the elevator operator ignored them as she took him all the way up without stopping pick watched annoyed and angry faces as the car rose past people waiting your ears are clean but dont give him a chance to look at your feet the operator said as she opened the door pickering was surprised to see that the foyer outside the elevator was full of people normally the only thing to be found in it were room service or housekeeping carts he should have known the old man had more in mind than a lamb chop when he said he wanted pick to have supper with him before he went someone recognized him and giggled and then applauded that seemed like a good idea to the others and the applause caught on like a brushfire pick clasped his hands over his head like a victorious prize fighter that caused more laughter i believe the marine corps has landed andrew fosters voice boomed an hour late and more than likely a dollar short im sorry grandfather pick pickering said i assume that she was worth it the old man said i cant believe youd keep your mother and your father not to mention your guests and me waiting solely because you were riding around on a horse three bethlehem pennsylvania august two cops came to the cell okay joe louis on your feet one of them said as the other signaled for the remotely operated door to be opened one of the cops came in the cell and stood over tommy mccoy as he put his feet in his work shoes when tommy finally stood up the cop took handcuffs from a holder on his belt put your hands behind you he said hey im all right now tommy said put your hands behind you the cop repeated as he felt the manacles snap in place around his wrist tommy asked what happens now the cop ignored him he took his arm and sort of shoved him out of the cell then out of the cellblock they stopped at the property room and picked up their revolvers then ripped open a brown manila envelope they tucked his wallet handkerchief cigarettes matches and change in his pockets and led him out of the building to a parking lot in the rear when do i get something to eat tommy asked the cops ignored that question too he wasnt so much hungry as thirsty tommy thought hed really put away the boilermakers the night before and the only water in the cell had been warm and brown and smelled like horsepiss what he really needed was a couple of beers maybe a couple of boilermakers to straighten himself out they took him to the mill to the small brick building just inside the gate it looked like a regular house but was the place where the mill security police had their office in there was also a dispensary where they took people until the ambulance arrived they led him into the office of the chief of plant security he wasnt surprised to see him but he was surprised to see denny walkowicz assistant business manager of local united steel workers of america a big shinyfaced polack no one said hello to tommy or offered him a chair whats all this tommy asked you broke his nose you might like to know the chief of plant security said he said you hit him with a beer bottle bullshit tommy said what do they call that the plant security chief said we got him charged with assault with a dangerous object one of the cops said thats all public drunkenness resisting arrest the cop said theres more nobodys asked for his side of it denny walkowicz said his side dont mean a shit denny lets not start that bullshit all over again another man came into the room one of the fucking whitecollar workers from personnel little shit in a shiny blue suit he had an envelope in his hand which he laid on the table denny walkowicz stood up for you mccoy christ only knows why the plant security chief said heres what we worked out theres two weeks severance pay plus what you earned through last friday you take that or what or they take you back to jail youre facing ninety days in the can kid denny walkowicz said at least maybe a lot more and it aint only the time its a criminal record for getting in a fight you dont listen do you mccoy the plant security chief said you hit a guy with a beer bottle its not like punching him i told you i didnt use no bottle yeah you said that but other people say different well fuck you im glad you were here and the cops are to hear that denny the chief of plant security said using profane or obscene language to a supervisor or member of management shall be grounds for dismissal for cause he quoted hes got you mccoy denny walkowicz said you gotta learn to watch your mouth take him back to jail the chief of plant security said and then picked up the brown envelope and handed it back to the whitecollar guy from administration do what you have to he said no severance pay now wait a minute denny walkowicz said we had a deal we worked this out nobody tells me fuck you the plant security chief said denny walkowicz took the envelope back from the whitecollar guy you he said to tommy mccoy keep your fucking mouth shut then he led him out of the room with the cops following the cops took the handcuffs off him if it was up to me the larger one said youd do time yeah well it aint up to you is it denny walkowicz said if youre smart mccoy you wont hang around bethlehem the cop said you know what i mean as denny walkowicz drove tommy to the boardinghouse in his blue buick roadmaster he said you better pay attention to what the cop said theyre after your ass it took three of them to hold you down and you kicked one of them in the balls theyre not going to take that that was all the union could do for me you ungrateful sonofabitch denny walkowicz exploded we kept you from going to jail tommy went to bed the minute he got to his room he slept the rest of the day and except for going out for two beers and some spaghetti about ten that night slept right around the clock at ten thirty the next morning he went down to the post office and talked to the recruiter the guy was especially nice to him after he told him his brother was a marine too he told tommy that if he enlisted for the duration of the present emergency plus six months he could fix it for him to be assigned to the same unit as his brother and when tommy said that he had always wanted to be a pilot the recruiter said he could arrange for that too thomas michael mccoy was sworn into the united states marine corps at hours that same afternoon he was transported by bus to the us navy yard philadelphia pennsylvania the next morning at philadelphia he learned that the recruiter had been something less than honest with him he wasnt going to be trained as a pilot but as an infantryman and the corporal in philadelphia told him he stood as much chance of being assigned with his brother as he did of being elected pope but the corporal felt that professional courtesy to a fellow corporal required that he inform corporal mccoy that his little brother was on the base awaiting transport to parris island he called post locator and they told him that corporal mccoy had been the day before transferred to marine corps schools quantico virginia then the corporal made the connection this dumb micks brother was the china marine in the campaign hat driving the lasalle convertible the one they were sending to officers school they sure as christ made little apples were not two peas from the same pod he thought four office of the deputy chief of staff for personnel headquarters united states marine corps washington dc august the wooden frame buildingdesigned for no more than five years usagehad been built during the great war the chief of companygrade officer assignments stood waiting in one of the doorways to catch the eye of the deputy chief assignments branch the doorway sagged the chief of companygrade officer assignments a balding stocky man had taken off the jacket of his cord suit and rolled up the sleeves of his sweatsoaked white shirt standing there with his suspenders exposed he didnt look much like the captain of marines he was he held two documents at his side one was that weeks listing of actual and projected billet vacancies the other was the service record of macklin john d st lt the deputy chief assignments branch had been reading with great interest an interoffice memorandum which compared projected companygrade officer requirements for fiscal year against projected officer recruitment for fiscal year and was wondering where the hell they were going to dig up the bodies that represented the difference between what they needed and what they were likely to get finally he noticed the chief of companygrade officer assignments standing in his door and motioned him inside with a wave of his hand the deputy chief assignments branch who had also removed his jacket was a majoralthough he looked and sometimes felt more like a bureaucrat than a marine officer how would you like me to handle this sir the chief of companygrade officer assignments asked he handed the major the documents in his hand the major opened the servicerecord jacket of macklin john d st lt there was a file of orders concerning the officer in question bound to the record jacket with a metal expanding clip the order on top which made it the most recent one had been issued by the th marines lieutenant macklin having been decreed excess to the needs of the command was relieved of duty and would proceed to the united states of america aboard the uss shaumont reporting on arrival to headquarters usmc washington dc for further assignment a thirty day delay en route leave was authorized macklin was not really expected to physically report in washington his orders and his records would be sent to washington when washington decided what to do with him either a telegram or a registered letter would be sent to his leave address telling him where to go and when to be there in a manila folder were copies of lieutenant macklins efficiency reports mounted in the same manner as his orders i wonder what he did the major asked without expecting an answer as he turned his attention to lieutenant macklins most recent efficiency report officers were rarely decreed excess to the needs of a command commands as a rule of thumb generally sent a steady stream of justifications for the assignment of additional officer personnel to carry out their assigned missions a civilian reading the efficiency report would probably have concluded that it was a frank confidential appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of what a civilian would probably think was a typical marine officer he was described as a tall lean and fit officer of erect bearing with no disfiguring marks or scars it said mat lieutenant macklin was slightly below the avenge of his peers in professional knowledge that he had adequately discharged the duties assigned to him that there was no indication of abuse of alcoholic beverages or other stimulants and that lieutenant macklin had a tendency not to accept blame for his failures but instead to attempt to shift the blame to subordinates in this connection it said that lieutenant macklin was prone to submit official reports that both omitted facts mat might tend to make him look bad and to present other facts in such a manner as to magnify his own contribution to the accomplishment of the assigned mission it said finally that lieutenant macklin could not be honestly recommended for the command of a company or larger tactical unit at this time a civilian would doubtless mink mat here was a nicelooking erect young man who was mostly competent did what he was told to do and had no problem with the bottle if there was anything wrong with him at all it was a perfectly understandable inclination to present only his best side to his superiors if he could not be recommended to be a company commander at this time well he was young and there would be a chance for that later in the meantime there were certainly other places where his slightly below average professional knowledge could be put to good use in the corps macklins efficiency report was lethal jesus i wonder what the hell he did the major repeated the endorsing officer is chesty puller the captain said pullers a hardnose but hes fair and you saw how he endorsed it the undersigned concurs in this evaluation of this officer the major quoted so what do we do with him the captain asked maybe he got too friendly with some wife the major asked i think he got caught writing a false report the captain said in which he tried to shaft somebody somebody who worked with him you saw that remark about shifting blame to subordinates and got caught the major agreed that would tee chesty puller off so what do we do with him six months ago i would ask when he planned to resign the major said but thats no longer an option is it no sir whats open the major asked i gave you the list sir the major consulted the weeks listing of actual and projected billet vacancies for companygrade officers it says here theres a vacancy for a mess officer at the school battalion at quantico i thought we sent that kid from the hotel school at cornell down there ye olde round peg in ye olde round hole he developed a hernia the captain said they sent him to the navy hospital at norfolk itll be more than ninety days before hes fit for full duty so they transferred him to the detachment of patients i would hate to see someone who has graduated from the cornell hotel school assigned anywhere but a kitchen the major said the captain chuckled ive sort of penciled in when hes available for assignment assigning him to the marine barracks here hed make a fine assistant officers club officer dont let him get away the major said and in the meantime i think we should send lieutenant macklin to quantico at least for the time being all a mess officer does anywaycornell hotel school graduates exceptedis make sure nobodys selling the rations aye aye sir the chief of companygrade officer assignments said and then he thought of something else weve got another one sir somebody else with an efficiency report like that the major asked incredulously no sir another hotelier is that right the major nodded one of the kids starting the platoon leaders course listed his current occupation as resident manager of the andrew foster hotel in san francisco that sounded a little odd for a twentyoneyearold so i checked on it and he really was he really was and not only because hes andrew fosters grandson our cup runneth over the major said dont let that one get away either maybe something can be done about the quality of the chow after all aye aye sir the captain repeated with a smile chapter nine one us marine corps schools quantico virginia august the man at the wheel of the spotless chevrolet pickup truck was master gunnery sergeant jack nmi no middle initial stecker usmc stecker was a tall muscular tanned erect man of fortyone who looked the way a master gunnery sergeant usmc with twentyfive years in die corps was supposed to look he was in stiffly starched impeccably pressed khakis a vertical crease ran precisely through the buttons of the shirt pockets to the shoulder seam on die front of the shirt there were four creases on the rear one ran horizontally across the back of his shoulders the other three ran down the back one on each side and one down the middle there were a total of six pockets on his khaki shirt and trousers two were in use stackers left hip pocket held his wallet and his right shirt pocket held a small thin notebook and a silverplated parker penandpencil set the other pockets were sealed shut with starch and would remain sealed shut the keys to his office to his quarters and to his personal automobile a packard phaeton as well as a saint christopher medal were on a second dogtag cord worn around his neck stecker did not think it fitting that the uniform of a master gunnery sergeant usmc should bulge in any way there was a handkerchief in his left sock sometimes not often when he knew he would be away from another source of smoking material for a considerable period of time he carried a package of lucky strike cigarettes and a book of matches in his right sock mostly he kept his smoking material in various convenient placesthe glove compartment of the pickup his desk drawer and sometimes if he knew he was not going to have to remove his campaign hat in the crown of the hat master gunnery sergeant jack stecker usmc turned off the macadam range road and slowed the chevrolet pickup as he approached the barrier a weighted pole barring access to the ranges as it often is in virginia in late august it was hot and muggy and jack stecker had rolled the driversside window down but as he approached the known distance rifle range close enough to hear the firing he rolled the window up the crack ofcaiiber rifle fire does more than make your ears ring it permanently damages your hearing if you get enough of it a large red flag hung limply from a twentyfivefoot pole signaling that the range was in use a young marine had been assigned to bar access to the range by unauthorized personnel and to raise the barrier to pass authorized personnel he was about twentyone his nose was sunburned and he wore utilities a world war istyle helmet a web cartridge belt from which hung a canteen and a firstaid packet and had a us rifle caliber model a slung over his shoulder by its leather sling when master gunnery sergeant jack stecker first saw him the young man with the sunburned nose was standing five feet from the flagpole and jack stecker had no doubt that the young man who looked like a boot about to graduate from the recruit depot at parris island but who was in fact an officer candidate about to graduate from the platoon leaders course and become a commissioned officer second lieutenant in the marines had probably been leaning on the pole he had also probably propped the springfield against the flagpole stecker was not offended what was important was that he had not caught him failing in his duties as a guard he would have burned him a new asshole if he had caught him doing what he damned well knew he had been doing but he had not when the trainee recognizing master gunnery sergeant steckers chevrolet pickup had quickly raised the weighted pole barrier he was rewarded for his efforts by a slight but unmistakable nod of steckers head the trainee nodded back and smiled shylyand with some relief he had been forced to make a decision and it had turned out to be the right one when he first recognized the pickup as master gunnery sergeant steckers he hadnt been sure whether stecker expected him to raise the barrier immediately or to bar steckers path until he had satisfied himself that master gunnery sergeant stecker indeed had official business on the range he had decided in the end that the safest course was to presume that whatever master gunnery sergeant stecker wanted to do on the quantico reservation was official business and that it was not his role to question him about it it had not been difficult to differentiate master gunnery sergeant steckers pickup from the perhaps fifty identical chevrolet pickups on the quantico reservation steckers personal pickup was very likely the cleanest most highly polished pickup in the marine corps perhaps in the world when master gunnery sergeant stecker telephoned the motor sergeant to announce that he was through for the day with his transport a motor pool corporal went to base headquarters to fetch it he then drove it to the motor pool where he examined the odometer to see how many miles stecker had driven that day he then filled out the trip ticket with probable if wholly imaginary destinations to correspond with the miles driven it was universally recognized that master gunnery sergeant stecker had more important things to do with his time than fill out forms like a fucking clerk with that done the vehicle went through prescribed daily maintenance the fuel tank was filled the tire pressure checked and the oil level and radiator water replenished the vehicle was then turned over to whatever enlisted men had run afoul of rocks and shoals had gone to office hours and were now performing punitive extra duty in the motor pool they washed the vehicle with soap and water every inch of it inside and outexcept for the glove compartment which was off limits when the vehicle was washed and dried it was swept out with whisk brooms making sure there was no dust or sand in the cracks of the rubber covering of the running board or between the wooden planks of the bed the vehicle was then inspected by the motor transport corporal if the wax polish seemed to need touching up the pickup was waxed when it was finally judged likely to meet master gunnery sergeant steckers standards it was parked overnight inside in the hoist section of the garage in the morning a motor transport corporal drove the pickup to base headquarters where he parked it in a space marked for official visitors only so that it would be available should master gunnery sergeant stecker need transport when the first trucks onequarter ton fourbyfour general purpose called jeeps had been issued to quantico it had been proposed to master gunnery sergeant stecker that one be assigned to him with a driver for his use stecker had somewhat icily informed the motor transport sergeant that even though he could doubtless spare someone to spend most of his duty day sitting around with his thumb up his ass waiting to drive somebody someplace he certainly could find real work for him to do that would be of value to the corps master gunnery sergeant stecker had other reasons to refuse the assignment of a jeep and driver one of them was that a driver would come to know where he went and why and talk about it at night in the barracks the less the men knew where he went and what he did the better neither could master gunnery sergeant stecker see any reason why he should exchange a perfectly satisfactory vehicle which came with nicely upholstered seats and rollup windows for a small open truck with thin canvascovered pads to cushion his bottom there was absolutely nothing that stecker could find wrong which is to say unmilitary in finding comfort wherever it might be found in his twentyfive years of service he had been acutely uncomfortable on more occasions than he liked to remember and there was no question whatever in his mind that he would be made acutely uncomfortable again possibly the corps being what it was as soon as tomorrow it was not necessary to train to be uncomfortable that came naturally like taking a leak when master gunnery sergeant stecker reached the known distance rifle range itself he put wax plugs in his ears to protect them from the damaging crack of riflefire and then got out of his pickup and approached the range tower pretending not to see the range officer a young lieutenant who was in the tower itself he examined the firing records checked over two weapons that had failed to function and the general police of the area then discreetly inquired of the range sergeant how the new range officer was working out hes all right gunny the range sergeant said better than most second lieutenants to tell you the truth stecker nodded then with hands folded against the small of his back and the range sergeant trailing him he marched to one end of the firing line pausing now and again when the targets were marked or to stand behind one prone rifleman and his coach then he reversed course and marched to the other end he found nothing that required correction he really hadnt expected to except for the general truth that the way to keep things running smoothly was to keep your eye on them there had really been no reason for him to have a look at the range then he returned to the pickup and drove back to his office there was a glistening lasalle convertible in one of the official visitor parking spaces stecker had almost bought a lasalle convertible although he considered his packard phaeton to be a fine piece of machinery sometimes he wished he had gone to the lasalle it wouldnt have cost nearly so much money and it was under the skin a cadillac and there would not have been so many eyebrows raised at a master gunnery sergeant driving a lasalle the question was how could an enlisted man even one in the highest enlisted grade afford the monthly payments on a packard phaeton the answer was that mere were no monthly payments he had paid cash on the barrel head for it and the reason cash was available to pay for it was that shortly after he had married when he was a twentyoneyearold sergeant he had gone out on payday and got tanked and blown most of his pay in a poker game elly gave him what he later came to call her look then she put it to him simply not only was he a damned fool but she was in the family way and if the marriage wasnt going to work it would be better if they faced it and called it off either she would handle the money from now on or she was going home to tatamy the next day she then put him on an allowance like a little boy and kept him on it even later when hed gotten more stripes when the kids were big enough shed gotten her teachers certificate and gone to work and it wasnt just her making the buffalo on the nickels squeal before she parted with one elly put the money to work right from the first she had started buying and selling things she would read the unofficial section of the daily bulletin looking for bargains for sale she didnt only buy things to use like kids clothes and from time to time a nice piece of furniture she bought things to resell and she was good at buying things and selling them she told him once that she had a twentyfive percent rule she wouldnt buy anything unless she could buy it for twentyfive percent less than what somebody was asking for it and she wouldnt sell it for less than twentyfive percent more than she had paid for it so the boys college fund kept growing elly was determined from the beginning that the boys would go to college and then as the fund grew her determination changed to the boys would go to a good college in when the depression was really bad jack stecker was a staff sergeant then the bank had foreclosed on her brother fritzs house in tatamy elly took a chance and put in a bid at the sheriffs auction most everybody else in tatamy had been laid off from bethlehem steel too and not many people wanted an old threefamily row house anyway so she got it at a steal and without the down payment really making a big dent in the boys college fund fritz went on living in what had been his apartment and his oldest son and his family in anotherneither of them paying rent because they were out of workbut the third was rented out for nearly enough money to make the mortgage payment jack stecker hadnt said anything to her because he always considered the boys college money to really be ellys money and if she wanted to help her family out when they were in a bind he understood that too he came later to understand that what elly had really done was put the money to work and that if it also made things a little easier for her brother and nephew fine but that wasnt the reason she had bought the house neither fritz nor his kid paid any rent until they got called back by bethlehem steel fritz in his kid not until when fritz complained that paying back rent was a hell of a thing for a sister to ask of her own brother elly told him that she was charging him two percent less than the bank would have charged him that he knew damned well that the bank would not have loaned a laidoff steel worker a dime and that he and his family would have been put out on the street then she offered to sell him the house back at what an appraiser called the fair market value and she would carry the mortgage herself so they had the house appraised and added what fritz and his son owed for back rent to that and fritz was paying it off by the month at six percent interest not to elly anymore elly had sold the mortgage to the easton bank trust company and that money had gone into the boys college fund and then as it turned out they didnt need the boys college fund at all hed gone home one afternoon and saw her with her look but elly waited until he had changed out of his uniform taken his beer from the icebox and listened to the burns allen program on the radio then she made room for herself on the footstool and handed him a paperbound book you ever see this she asked sure hed seen it it was the catalog of the united states naval academy you ever read it she asked i glanced through it he said somewhat defensively it was difficult for a master gunnery sergeant usmc to admit to anyone including his wife that there was any aspect of the naval service of the united states with which he was not intimately familiar god jack elly said disgusted you sometimes are a really thickheaded dutchman she handed him the catalog open with a passage marked in red ink additionally an unlimited number of appointments are available noncompetitively to sons of winners of the medal of honor jack stecker never wore the medal but it was in the strongbox together with a copy of the citation and a nonyellowing photograph of general black jack pershing hanging it around his neck in the name of the american people the congress of the united states awards the medal of honor to sergeant jack nmi stecker usmc for valor in action above and beyond the call of duty in the vicinity of belleau wood near chateauthierry france during the period june to june citation sergeant then corporal stecker in command of a squad of united states marines participating in an assault upon german positions on june was grievously wounded in the leg when it became necessary for american forces to temporarily break off the attack and reform prior to a second attack sergeant stecker refused evacuation and despite his wounds established himself in a position from which he could bring rifle fire to bear upon the enemy during the nights of june through june without regard to either his wound or the great risk to his life posed by incessant small arms and artillery fire sergeant stecker searched the area between the lines of the opposing forces commonly referred to as nomans land for other us marines who had also been unable or unwilling to withdraw to safe positions not only did sergeant stecker save the lives of many of these wounded men by administering first aid to them but inspiring them by his personal example of valor in the face of overwhelming odds formed them into a manstrong fighting force and established a rifle and machinegun position from which when the second successful assault was launched on june he laid a withering fire on german positions which otherwise would have been able to bring fire to bear on attacking american forces with a resultant great loss of life during the fighting involved during the second assault sergeant stecker was wounded twice more and suffered great loss of blood and excruciating pain despite his wounds and pain sergeant stecker remained in command inspiring his subordinates with his courage and coolness under fire until he lost consciousness sergeant steckers valor and dedication to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the united states marine corps and the naval service entered the naval service from pennsylvania so the boys had gone to service academies jack jr to annapolis and richard to west point jack was an ensign on the battleship arizona in the pacific fleet in pearl harbor and richard would graduate next june and take a commission as a second lieutenant of marines elly had waited until she was sure the boys were set then she had used somenot muchof what was now the retirement fund to buy him the packard phaeton he was entitled she said and you only live once three people were waiting outside master gunnery sergeant jack steckers office when he reached it a staff sergeant a pfc and a corporal he nodded at them said be with you in a minute and went inside when his clerk delivered his coffee he would tell stecker what they wanted he knew the staff sergeant he was from post housing and that was personal so it could wait and he supposed the pfc was carrying some kind of message and that could wait too but the corporal was completely unfamiliar to stecker and he was a little curious about him the coffee black brewed no more than thirty minutes before stecker could not stand stale coffee was delivered in a white china messhall mug within sixty seconds of his sitting down behind his desk sergeant quinns here about your quarters steckers clerk a corporal said the pfc was sent by the first sergeant of b company your wife called and said if you could come home early that would be nice and the colonel says hed like to see you when you have time nothing important and the china marine stecker asked you mean the corporal the clerk asked stecker nodded barely perceptibly how do you know hes a china marine what does he want stecker asked deciding that he would not mention the young corporals embroideredtohisshirt chevrons one of the marks of a china marine wouldnt say the clerk said wants to see you i seen him drive up you see that lasalle convertible when you come in send the corporal in stecker said two corporal kenneth j killer mccoy walked into the room looked at stecker and said thank you gunny stecker liked that the kid hadnt tried to kiss his ass with good afternoon sergeant im sorry to bother you or some candyass remark like that but he was polite and recognized that master gunnery sergeants were busy men and that he appreciated this one giving him a little bit of his time stecker liked what else he saw aside from the embroideredtothegarment chevrons and the khaki foreandaft cap this young corporal looked the way stecker liked his young corporals to look neat trim and military and as far as the china stripes were concerned if he had his way everybody would wear them when did you ship home from china stecker asked it shows does it mccoy said smiling yeah stecker said could you use some coffee sure could mccoy said doan stecker raised his voice one java reporting in are you stecker guessed and then guessed again with a problem ive got until midnight tomorrow mccoy said between now and midnight tomorrow stecker said get yourself a campaign hat mccoy chuckled thats funny i just came from the navy yard in philly mccoy said the first thing the first sergeant said to me there was get rid of the campaign hat that was there this is here stecker said what were you doing in philly you ship home the long way around i shipped home to diego on a tincan mccoy said diego shipped me to philly via portsmouth prisonerchasing stecker asked and when mccoy nodded went on then you must just have bought the lasalle he enjoyed the look of surprise on the kids face but left him wondering until after doan delivered the coffee and left my clerk doesnt miss much he said just bought it mccoy said like it except that it drinks gas i like it fine mccoy said what kind of a rice bowl did you have going for you in china stecker asked and again enjoyed the look of surprise on the kids face to bring home enough money to buy a car like that i spent a lot of time on back roads drawing ration money mccoy said motor transport sort of mccoy said what do you mean sort of thats my skill mccoy said and you made corporal on one hitch driving a truck yeah mccoy said why dont i believe that stecker asked i dont know mccoy said its the truth you must have got along pretty good with the motor officer stecker said the translation of that was you must have had your nose pretty far up his ass most of the time i worked for an officer at regiment mccoy said i did a hitch with the fourth marines stecker said i guess i still know some of the officers who did you work for captain banning mccoy said stecker was very pleased to hear that it reconfirmed his first judgment of the young corporal his second more negative judgment sprang from questions about his making corporal in one hitch in motor transport ed banning was the china marines s if this kid had been made a corporal by banning that was a whole hell of a lot different from making it as an asslicker ed banning and i were in nicaragua together in stecker said he was a lieutenant then he was a good officer he is a good officer mccoy agreed well what can i do for you corporal stecker asked got a problem gunny mccoy said and added wryly and when i was a young marine at parris island they told me whenever i had a problem i couldnt deal with myself i should take it to the gunny stecker smiled at him the kid had a sense of humor just think of me as your father son and tell daddy all stecker said i need to get that lasalle registered on the post mccoy said whats the problem unsafe or inadequate insurance no im sure itll pass the safety inspection and im insured up to my ass those were two of the three problems with a corporal getting a pov privately owned vehicle registered on the post stecker now asked about the third you lost your drivers license speeding or drunk driving im in the platoon leaders course mccoy said and a fatbellied pfc over in vehicle registration got his rocks off telling me that means i cant have a car on the post now stecker was surprised the platoon leaders course was designed to turn college kids not china marine corporals into second lieutenants but now that he thought about it hed heard that starting with this class they were going to slip some young marines in with college kids it was sort of an experiment to see if they could hack it the marines in the course would be like this one on their first hitch or maybe starting their second kids without enough experience to get a direct commission but who had been judged to be above average hes right stecker said you cant no cars civilian clothes personal weapons or dirty books or pictures what am i supposed to do with it you should have read the instructions corporal stecker said the part where it said dont take no povs civvies weapons or dirty pictures i dont have any instructions mccoy said i dont even have any orders im traveling voco verbal order commanding officer he must have been pretty sure you were selected stecker said he was on the board mccoy said and as fast as this has gone ive been wondering if the corps didnt ship me home from china for this officer shit officer shit stecker parroted you dont want to be an officer i didnt mean that the way it sounded gunny mccoy said but i walked over and had a look at the school before i came over here it reminded me that im a china marine not a college boy you better not tell anybody that when you start the course stecker said one of the things they expect is enthusiasm you better act as if your one great desire in the whole world is to pin a gold bar on your shoulder or youll get shipped out so quick itll take your asshole six weeks to catch up with you mccoy chuckled thats what i mean about being a marine and not a college boy i know about second lieutenants would you want to be second lieutenant gunny mccoy challenged stecker thought no i wouldnt want to be a second lieutenant i really dont want to be an officer period then you shouldnt have applied stecker said the ways were greased mccoy said what do you mean by that i mean that an officer i knew in china asked me at nine oclock one morning if i had ever heard of the platoon leader program i was through with the selection board before lunch three days later mccoy said but if you dont want to be an officer then i guess youve wasted his effort and the corps money and time coming here at all stecker said dont get me wrong gunny mccoy said im going to go through that course the minute i report in im going to be the eagerest sonofabitch to get a commission they ever saw why well i thought that over driving down here mccoy said asked myself what the fuck i was doing why i hadnt told them what they could do with a gold bar in philly the answer is why not im a good marine ill probably make as good a temporary officer as most of the college kids and probably better than some of them and since they greased the ways like they haveat least a couple of officers think i would make a good second lieutenantwho the hell am i to argue with them you seem pretty sure you wont bilge out of the course stecker said gunny im a good marine ill get through that course my problem is what do i do with my car when im over there being eager as hell where you from pennsylvania norristown if you left now you could drive there leave the car catch a train and be back here by midnight tomorrow if you were a little late so long as it was before reveille on the second i could take care of that i got no place to leave it i thought you said your home was in norristown i said im from norristown mccoy said my home is the corps then i guess youll have to park it outside the gate stecker said yeah and have it either stolen or fucked up the roof cut hey youre a marine corporal wants to be a marine officer you dont know a regulations a regulation mccoy looked at him and stecker saw anger regret and resignation in his eyes but he didnt say anything and he didnt beg thanks for the coffee gunny mccoy said and your time he got up and walked toward the door mccoy stecker called and mccoy stopped and turned around forget what i said about getting a campaign hat that was before i knew you were going to be a student students wear cunt caps like that a soft cap sometimes called an overseas cap makes them easy to tell from marines thanks mccoy said doan stecker called raising his voice send in the sergeant from post housing the sergeant came into the office with all the paperwork involved in turning in one set of government quarters and their furnishings so as to draw another set of quarters and furnishings stecker was movingmoving up though he thought about that pretty much the way mccoy did stecker took his parker pen from his shirt pocket and began to write his signature in a neat round hand where the forms were marked with small penciled xs then he suddenly sat up straight in his chair and spun it around so that he could look out the window he saw corporal mccoy unlocking the door of the pretty lasalle convertible that sure as christ made little apples was going to get all fucked up if he had to leave it parked outside the gate master gunnery sergeant stecker leaned out the window corporal mccoy he bellowed mccoy looked around for him hold it right there corporal mccoy he sat down again and as quickly as he could signed the rest of the forms then he stood up and went in the outer office im going he said you going to see the colonel first doan asked i have an appointment with the colonel at oheightthirty the day after tomorrow whatevers on his mind will have to wait until then you coming back doan asked no have the motor pool fetch the truck stecker ordered is there anything else i can do for you doan asked not a goddamned thing corporal doan stecker snapped not a goddamned thing he glowered at him a moment and then added but ill tell you this doan i told the colonel that it was possible that under all your baby fat there just might be a marine and that he could probably do worse than making you a sergeant youre on orders as of september try at least to act like a sergeant doan now why the hell did i tell him it was supposed to be a surprise what do i tell anybody who calls doan asked the fat little fucker is so surprised at the promotion that he looks like he might bawl hell of a thing for a marine sergeant to be doing tell them to take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut stecker said and pleased with himself marched out of the office he walked up to corporal mccoy where he was waiting by his lasalle i have a black packard phaeton machine corporal mccoy he said and pointed to it you will get in your machine and follow me where we going wherever the hell i decide to take you stecker said mccoy followed him six blocks ending up at the rear of the redbrick singlestory building that housed the provost marshals office next to it was an area enclosed by an eightfoothigh cyclone fence topped with barbed wire every ten feet along its length was a red sign reading military police impounding area off limits inside a fence were a dozen vehicles mostly civilian but with several marine corps trucks mingled among them there was no one near the gate to the fencedin area so stecker blew his horn a steady tensecond blast and then another he saw that he had attracted the attention of the people in the provost marshals building his packard was as well known as his pickup truck he motioned for corporal mccoy to get out of his lasalle and come to the packard a minute later the provost sergeant came out of the building and walked quickly over to him what can i do for you gunny he asked this is corporal mccoy stecker said after you register his car and issue him a sticker for it he will place his vehicle in the impound yard from time to time he will require access to his vehicle to run the engine for example therefore you will put him on the list of people who are authorized access to the impound yard any questions whatever you say gunny the provost sergeant said can he take the car out if wants its his car stecker said he turned to mccoy i think thats all the business we have mccoy he said thanks gunny mccoy said in the future mccoy be very careful when you tell somebody you dont think much of officers or that you have doubts about being one yourself you just might run into some chickenshit sonofabitch with bars on his collar who will take offense i will mccoy said thanks again gunny it would be a damned shame to have a goodlooking machine like your lasalle fucked up stecker said and got behind the wheel of his packard and drove home three elly was home her ford was in the drive he wondered why she asked him to come home early probably because she knew him well enough to worry that otherwise he would head for the nco club establish himself at the bar reserved for senior noncoms and start drinking hard liquor she knew him well enough too not to call the office and order him home or call the office and start whining and begging for him to come home what shed said was that if he could come that would be nice so he was home that was nice the sign master gunnery sergeant j stecker usmc was still on the lawn equidistant between the driveway and the walkway as housing regulations required a precise four feet off the sidewalk he wouldnt need that sign anymore thered be a new sign on the new quarters he would have to remember to take this one down first thing in the morning or maybe so that he wouldnt forget it after dark tonight he entered the small brick house the new quarters would be just a little bigger now that the boys were gone and they didnt need the room by the kitchen door opened the icebox and helped himself to a beer im home he called im in the bedroom elly called he went into the living room and turned on the radio jesus christ its been a long time since i came home and she made that kind of announcement but all she meant by it obviously was that she happened to be in the bedroom that was all she came into the living room where were you jack elly asked what do you mean where was i he asked doan came by she said he said you walked off without your orders and he thought you might need them he said you told him you were going home she had the orders in her hand she extended them to him ive read them he said i know what they say she shrugged it was nice of doan i thought elly said he told me you got him sergeants stripes that was nice of you jack so you called the nco club and asked for me and i wasnt there right he said unpleasantly you know better than that jack elly said and he knew hed hurt her a kid came into the office jack stecker said a china marine a corporal oh he worked for ed banning over there stecker went on banning got him sent to the platoon leaders course and he came in to say hello for ed banning he came in because hes got a lasalle convertible machine and the kids in the platoon leader program arent supposed to have cars with them and the provost marshal wouldnt give him a post sticker for it oh she said at first i thought he reminded me of jack stecker said nice kid goodlooking smart but then i realized that he reminded me of me good looking and smart she teased like i was when i was a corporal he said i remember when you were a corporal she said he doesnt want to be an officer stecker said at least not very much neither did you she said they would have sent you to annapolis if you had wanted to go wanted to get married he said you didnt want to be an officer she said i still dont elly he said she started to say something then changed her mind could you help him about his car she asked i fixed it so he could leave it in the mp impounding area he said thats where i was i knew if you could come home early you would elly said why did you want me to he asked i bought you a present she said i was afraid it wouldnt come in time but it did and i wanted to give it to you what kind of a present he asked you keep this up there wont be anything left in the retirement fund come in the bedroom and ill give it to you elly said you give me a present in the bedroom and ill come home early all the time he said elly ignored him and walked toward the bedroom he got up put his beer bottle down turned the radio off and walked into their bedroom there was a complete uniform on the bed what the hell is this he said what did you do go by the clothing store this comes from brooks brothers in new york city she said i asked doris means where i should buy them and thats where doris said to go youre now calling the colonels wife by her first name ive known her for twenty years jack elly said she said i was to call her by her first name he looked down at the uniform goodlooking uniform he thought firstclass material it had certainly cost an arm and a leg well she said nothing to say looks a little bare he said no chevrons no hash marks attention to orders elly said stecker looked at her in surprise she had the orders in her hand and was reading from them headquarters united states marine corps washington dc general orders number dated august paragraph master gunnery sergeant jack nmi stecker hq company usmc schools quantico virginia is honorably discharged from the naval service for the convenience of the government effective august paragraph captain jack nmi stecker usmc reserve is ordered to active duty for a period of not less than three years with duty station usmc schools quantico virginia effective september general officer commanding quantico is directed to insure compliance with applicable regulations involved with the discharge of an enlisted man for the purpose of accepting a commission as an officer for the commandant usmc james b mcame brigadier general usmc well stecker said now that youve read it out loud i suppose that makes it official arent you going to try it on elly asked ignoring him im not sure im supposed to he said im not an officer yet put it on jack elly said you cant put it off any longer he reached for the blouse and started to put his arm in a sleeve no elly stopped him do it right jack he stripped to his underwear then put on the shirt and the trousers and then tied the necktie then he put on the tunic and the sam browne belt and the sword and even the hat you look just fine jack elly said she sounded funny and when he looked at her she was dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief what the hell are you crying about stecker asked she shrugged and blew her nose loudly he examined his reflection in the mirror he looked very strange he thought very strange indeed he saw for the first time that there was something new in his array of medal and campaign ribbons an inchlong blue one dotted with silver stars the one he never wore the ribbon representing the medal of honor what did you do that for he challenged colonel means said to she said and he said when you asked about it i should tell you that he said that he expects his officers to wear all of their decorations and that includes you too you really like this dont you me being an officer all these years jack elly said i wondered if i did right marrying you thanks a lot he said purposefully misunderstanding her otherwise you would have gone to annapolis she went on and you would have been a major maybe a lieutenant colonel by now or i would have bilged out of annapolis and taken up with a bar girl in diego he said i dont have any regrets elly i dont have any regrets either she said but you deserve those bars jack you should have been an officer a long time ago he turned to look at his reflection again maybe elly said you should take it off now so itll be fresh when you get sworn in he looked at her again she was unbuttoning her dress dont look so surprised she said softly i probably shouldnt tell you this but ive always wanted to go to bed with a marine officer im not a marine officer yet he said not until oheightthirty day after tomorrow then i guess you want to wait till then she asked no what the hell captaindesignate jack nmi stecker usmc reserve said take what you can whenever you can get it i always say chapter ten one quantico virginia september the us rifle caliber ml was known as the garand after its inventor john b garand a civilian employee of the us armys springfield arsenal the garand fired the same cartridge as the us rifle model the us rifle model a and the browning light machine guns this cartridge was known as the the series rifles known as springfields were fiveshot rifles operated by a bolt this bolt was a variation of the action designed by the mauserwerke in germany in the late s and had been adapted by the united states after the spanishamerican war the spanish armys mausers were clearly superior to the american rifles and when theodore roosevelt who had faced the spanish mausers on his march up kettle and san juan hills in cuba became president pretty nearly his first order as commander in chief was to provide the military services with a mausertype weapon a royalty was paid to the mauser company and the springfield arsenal began manufacture of a nearcopy of the mauser model differing from it in caliber and some minor details the spanish mausers had mm bores and the german the springfield rifles had caliber mm bores in an improved caliber was developed which became known as the the springfield rifles served in world war i where they proved reliable efficient and extremely accurate development of the garand began in the early s when general douglas macarthur was army chief of staff it was accepted for service and production began in it had a magazine capacity of eight rounds as opposed to the springfields five far more important it was semiautomatic once a spring clip of eight rounds was loaded into the weapon and the bolt permitted to move forward it would fire the eight rounds as rapidly as the marksman could pull the trigger when the last shot was fired the clip was ejected the bolt remained in its rearward position and another eightround clip could be quickly loaded the ordnance corps of the united states army which is charged with providing every sort of weaponry from pistols to artillery to the united states marine corps was convinced that it was the best infantry rifle in the world in the opinion of most marines the us rifle caliber ml garand was a buck rogers piece of shit with which only the lucky could hit a barn door at ten paces experience had taught the corps that skilled marksmen were very often the key to victory in a battle experience had further taught the corps that the key to skilled marksmanship in addition to the basics of trigger squeeze sight picture and the rest of the technique crapwas joining together a marine and his rifle so that they became one a marine was thus taught that first he cleaned and oiled his piece then he could think of maybe getting something to eat and a place out of the rain to sleep the marine corps further believed that an officer should not order his men to do anything he could not do himself there were two schools of thought concerning the issue of the us rifle caliber ml to the students of the platoon leaders course the official reason was that nothing was too good for the young men who possibly would soon be leading marines in a war it therefore followed that the young gentlemen be issued the newest finest item in the marine corps small weapons inventory in the opinion of most marines however the reason it was being issued to the young gentlemen of the platoon leaders course was that real rifles were needed for real marines it was therefore not surprising that item on the training schedule for day of platoon leaders course right after welcoming remarks major jj hollenbeck usmc was the issuance of riflesgarand riflesto the young gentlemen some of the young gentlemen were wearing marine corps dungarees sometimes called utilities and work shoes they had been issued these uniforms during previous summer training periods it was the prescribed uniform of the day but some of the young gentlemen including malcolm pickering were still in civilian clothing it was not that they didnt have dungarees but that they had not considered that day would begin at hours and that they would be given ninety seconds to get out of bed dress and fall in outside the barracks they presumed that they would have a couple of minutes to take their dungarees from their luggage before they stood the first formation and were marched to breakfast there were members of platoon leaders course and about a dozen of them were in civilian clothing most were in shirts and slacks but there were two including malcolm pickering who had at the last second grabbed their jackets pickering had even managed to grab his necktie he was standing in the rear rank tying his necktie when he came to the attention of the assistant drill instructor a barrelchested corporal of twentynine years with a nearly shaven head and a voice made harsh by frequent vocal exertion his name was pleasant which later became the subject of wry observation by the young gentlemen on seeing movement in the rear rank corporal pleasant walked quickly and erectly between the ranks until he was standing before pickering he then put his hands on his hips and inclined his head forward so that the stiff brim of his campaign hat just about touched pickerings forehead and so that pickering could smell corporal pleasants toothpaste when he shouted what the fuck are you doing asshole i was tying my tie sir pickering said coming to attention he was not entirely a rookie he had been to two previous summer training encampments and knew that as a trainee he was expected to come at attention when addressed by an assistant drill instructor and to call him sir although in the real marine corps only commissioned officers were entitled to such courtesy why are you wearing a tie asshole corporal pleasant inquired pickering could think of no good answer to that i asked you a question asshole corporal pleasant reminded him no excuse sir pickering said another remembered lesson from previous summers one did not offer excuses there was no excuse for not doing what you were supposed to do or for doing what you were not supposed to do the proper response in a situation like that was the one he had just given corporal pleasant was more than a little disappointed he had hoped to have the opportunity to make an example of this candyass wouldbe officer not because he disliked him personally but because it would get the others in the right frame of mind but there was nothing to do now but return to the front of the formation which he did the young gentlemen were marched from the company to battalion headquarters where major jj hollenbeck usmc on behalf of the commanding general us marine schools welcomed them to quantico and wished them well during their course of instruction they were next marched to the company supply room there they were issued a us rifle caliber ml a sling leather and a kit individual for us rifle caliber ml this consisted of a chamber brush and a folding screwdriver all of one piece a waxed cord and a patch holder that could be used by dropping it down the bore if a rod cleaning for us rifles model and ml was not available and a small plastic vial of a yellow grease known as lubricant solid for us rifle caliber ml the rifles came in individual heavy wrapping paper which appeared greasy the reason it was greasy was that the rifles themselves were thickly coated with cosmoline to protect them from rust while in storage corporal pleasant gave the young gentlemen rudimentary instruction in the assembly of the sling leather and its attachment to the us rifle caliber ml and then informed them that by the next morning he expected the rifles to be cleaned and that each individual would be expected by that very day to be as familiar with the serial number of the weapon as he was with his beloved mothers face wheres the serial number one baffled young gentleman asked this fucking things covered with grease it was the opportunity corporal pleasant had been waiting for the first thing the baffled young gentleman was required to do while doubletiming in place with the rifle held above his head was shout this is not my fucking thing my fucking thing is between my legs this is my rifle i will not forget the difference when he had recited this litany ten times he was ordered to run around the armsroom building with his rifle at port arms accompanied by two other young gentlemen who had the erroneous idea that his calling his rifle his fucking thing was amusing and had smiled the young gentlemen were then doubletimed to the mess hall for breakfast and it was there that platoon leader candidate pickering first saw platoon leader candidate mccoy at first he didnt place him the face looked familiar but he thought it was a face from other summer training camps then he remembered who he was his first reaction was distaste breakfast was scrambled eggs and bacon and homefried potatoes two pieces of bread and a lump of butter the only thing that pickering considered safe to put in his mouth were the homefried potatoes the eggs were cold and lumpy the bacon halfraw and the bread driedout mccoy was wolfing down this garbage as if he hadnt had a decent meal in a week pickering watched fascinated as mccoy ate everything on his stainless steel tray even wiping it clean with a piece of the stale bread when he had finished mccoy picked up his tray and walked toward the mess hall exit pickering picked up his nearfull tray and followed him corporal pleasant was there standing before garbage cans under signs reading edible garbage and nonedible garbage corporal pleasant examined mccoys tray and with a curt nod of his head passed him outside when pick pickering reached corporal pleasant corporal pleasant said over there asshole indicating with a nod of his head a group of perhaps a dozen young gentlemen holding their trays us rifles caliber ml slung over their shoulders standing against the concreteblock wall eventually there were nearly thirty young gentlemen who had not found their breakfast appetizing and had left much in some cases most of it on their trays corporal pleasant stood before them gentlemen he said the marine corps loves you because the marine corps loves you it has gone to considerable effort and expense to provide you with a healthy nutritious breakfast the marine corps expects you to eat the healthy nutritious breakfast it has provided for you the young gentlemen looked at him in some confusion for a moment then one of them delicately holding his stainless steel tray in one hand tried to fork a lump of scrambled egg with the other hand while simultaneously going into contortions trying to keep his us rifle caliber ml from slipping off his shoulder corporal pleasant immediately stepped in front of him put his hands on his hips and inclined his head so that the stiff brim of his campaign cap almost touched the young gentlemans forehead what the fuck are you doing asshole corporal pleasant inquired sir the young gentleman bellowed eating my breakfast sir with a fork did you hear me say anything asshole about eating with a fork no sir the young gentleman looked at him in absolute confusion not quite able to accept what corporal pleasant seemed to be suggesting corporal pleasant nodded his head eat asshole he said every last fucking crumb the young gentleman raised the tray and then lowered his face and began to gulp and lick the tray corporal pleasant looked at the others on my command he said slurp it up ready slurp nearly thirty young gentlemen raised their stainless steel trays to their faces and slurped when pickering went outside the mess hall mccoy was waiting where the trainees would be formed in ranks there was a barely perceptible smile on his face pickering went and stood beside him now i know why you ate everything on your tray he said ive been through this sort of shit before mccoy said what are you doing here what does it look like i thought you were going to get out of the marine corps you were right theres a freeze on discharges mccoy said well we can buddy around pickering said thatll be nice it would be a bad idea mccoy said why pickering asked surprised wondering why mccoy was rejecting him why do you say that i know about pleasant mccoy said or people like him if theres one thing he hates more than a college boy who wants to be an officer its another corporal who wants to be an officer as soon as he finds out that im a marine hell start in on me so well be even pickering said hes already started on me take my word for it pickering mccoy said it would be worse if he knew we were buddies for both of us i dont understand pickering said you dont have to understand mccoy said just take my word for it stay away from me well fuck you pickering said his feelings hurt mccoy smiled at him thats the spirit he said pick honest to god i know what im talking about mccoy said sooner or later theyll have to give us some time off then we can see if there are any fourteenyearold virgins in virginia but what you have to do until we can get away from that prick especially if you plan to get through the course is make yourself invisible pickering still didnt understand but he realized he was enormously relieved that mccoy was not rejecting his friendship then he wondered why he was so relieved two company c marine corps school battalion quantico virginia hours september corporal pleasant placed the platoon at ease and then announced that it was now his intention to show them how to disassemble the cosmolinecovered rifles they had been carrying around all day when they had them apart they would clean them corporal pleasant said he would return at hours and inspect the cleaned pieces and then he would show them how to reassemble their rifles he knew he continued that they all wished to begin day of their training with spotless rifles good marines prided themselves on having clean pieces this was pure chickenshit platoon leader candidate mccoy decided a little chickenshit was to be expected and was probably even a good thing pleasant had to make it absolutely clear to these college boys that they were under his absolute control the college boys who had slurped their breakfast from their trays would never again take more chow than they could eat from the mess line there had been a point to that but there was no point to this riflecleaning idea except to make everybody miserable except of course that pleasant wanted something on every last one of them that would give him an excuse to jump their ass there was absolutely no way to remove all the cosmoline from a rifle with rags cosmoline did what it was intended to do preventing rust by filling every last nook crevice and pore in both the action and the stock you could wipe for fucking ever and there would still be cosmoline oozing out someplace there were two good ways to clean cosmoline from a weapon the best and most dangerous was with five gallons of gasoline in the bottom of a garbage can if you didnt strike a spark and blow your ass up the gasoline would dissolve the cosmoline the second way was with boiling water you took a field mess water heater a gasolinefired waterheating device inserted into a fiftyfive gallon garbage can mess kits are sterilized by dipping them into the boiling water and filled it with rifle actions and let the sonsofbitches boil like lobsters pleasant was offering neither alternative he was just being a prick and mccoy decided there was a limit to the chickenshit he would take he had promised himself he would keep his nose clean stay out of sight and do whatever was demanded of him but that did not go so far as spending the next three hours in a futile attempt to rub a rifle free of cosmoline he was standing one rank behind and three files to the left of pick pickering as corporal pleasant delivered his lecture on the disassembly of the us rifle caliber ml he considered for a moment taking pickering with him but decided against it for one thing cleaning an uncleanable rifle was probably an essential part of training for a college boy for another platoon leader candidate mccoy was about to go awol which as corporal pleasant had with some relish informed them during one of the lectures during the day was frowned upon anyone caught awol defined as not being in the proper place at the proper place at the proper time in the properly appointed uniform would instantly have his ass shipped to a rifle company and could forget pinning the gold bars of a second lieutenant on his shoulders when they were dismissed and doubletimed into the barracks mccoy went directly to the latrine and washed his hands as well as he could with gi soap then he grabbed his garand with a rag and went out the back door of the barracks as he made his way toward the provost marshals impound yard he considered that after successfully evading every jap sentry in shantung province it was entirely possible that hed be nailed cold by some eager college boy guarding a barracks with an unloaded garand but he wasnt challenged he hid the garand in a ditch and then went into the provost marshals office master gunnery sergeant steckers order was on file and an mp corporal went and unlocked the compound for him mccoy drove to where he had hidden the garand and reclaimed it then he opened the trunk took out a dungaree shirt with corporals stripes painted on the sleeves put it on and then took his campaign hat from the hat press and set it on his head at the approved jaunty angle the mp at the gate spotting the enlisted mans sticker on the windshield and the stiffbrimmed campaign hat on the driver waved the lasalle convertible through but mccoy slowed and stopped anyway the mp walked up to the car wheres the nearest gas station garage whatever with a steam cleaner mccoy asked the mp thought it over theres a sunoco stations got one he said turn left when you hit us much obliged mccoy said and let the clutch out as he rolled up the window the sunoco stations steam cleaner wasnt working but they had something even better a machine mccoy had never seen before it was designed to clean dirt and greaseencrusted parts a nonexplosive solvent poured out of a flexible spout like water from a faucet over a sort of sink thirty minutes work with a bristle brush and there was no cosmoline left on either the action or the stock of the garand period an hour after he had gone out of the main gate mccoy drove the lasalle back through it and stopped found it he called to the mp thanks anytime the mp said there was time before corporal pleasant reappeared in the barracks to take a shower the water was cold the college boys mccoy decided had tried hot water all it had done was leave a layer of cosmoline on the shower floor everyone was still furiously rubbing rifle parts with rags mccoy tied rags around his feet showered removed the rags threw them in the pile and put on clean dungarees then he disassembled the garand laid the parts on his bunk then crawled under the bunk and lay down to await corporal pleasant five minutes later someone called attention and mccoy started to roll out from under the bunk he was halfway to his feet when pleasant storming purposefully down the aisle spotted him getting up as he came to attention pleasant leaned the brim of his campaign hat into his face anyone tell you to get in the sack asshole corporal pleasant inquired no sir mccoy said then what were you doing in the sack asshole sir i wasnt in the sack sir corporal pleasant seeing the disassembled garand on the bunk was forced to face the fact that there was not room for the asshole to have been in the bunk too he leaned over the bunk and picked up the first part he touched which happened to be the magazine follower you call this clean asshole he demanded before he had chance to examine it at all yes sir mccoy said i believe thats clean sir corporal pleasant shoved the magazine follower under mccoys nose and in the very moment he demanded you call that clean asshole he thought ill be a sonofabitch its clean yes sir mccoy shouted whats the serial number of your piece asshole sir sir corporal pleasant stood eyeball to eyeball with platoon leader candidate mccoy for a moment assemble your piece and then get your ass outside asshole he ordered there is a light on a pole outside the orderly room guard it until i relieve you yes sir mccoy said ten minutes later corporal pleasant marched up to the light pole outside the orderly room mccoy came to port arms halt who goes there he demanded who the fuck do you think corporal pleasant replied and then ordered follow me he walked to the rear of the building and opened the door of a ford coupe get in he said mccoy got in the seat beside him pleasant reached over the back of the seat and came up with two beer cans church keys in the ashtray he said thank you mccoy said and opened his beer youre mccoy right killer mccoy im mccoy theres three marines in there with the assholes pleasant said i wasnt sure which was who mccoy didnt reply you going to give me trouble mccoy pleasant asked strange question why should he think i might give him trouble and why the beer this sonofabitch doesnt have the balls to be a universal prick hes only going to be a prick to those hes sure wont fight back and for some reason hes a little bit afraid of me he called me killer does this dumb sonofabitch think im going to stick a knife in him no mccoy said why should i how did you get that rifle clean pleasant asked there was a time for truth mccoy decided but this wasnt it lighter fluid he said you must have used a quart of it pleasant said what you really need is gasoline lighter fluid works better than a rag mccoy said it also made you stand out from the others pleasant said thats not smart i wasnt trying to be smart mccoy said corporal pleasant looked at him for a long moment and then nodded his head accepting that that wasnt the first cosmolined rifle you ever cleaned was it he asked rhetorically i guess i would have done the same thing mccoy didnt reply theres two stories going around about you mccoy pleasant said the first is that you killed a bunch of chinamen in china the second is that you have friends in high places who got you into this course anything to them there was some shooting in china mccoy said it was in the line of duty and have you got a rabbi have i got a what somebody important taking care of you not that i know about mccoy said i applied for this and i got accepted pleasant snorted as if he didnt believe him let me spell things out for you mccoy he said you stay out of my hair and ill stay out of yours but theres two things you better understand i dont give a shit about any rabbi and theres people who think you belong in portsmouth not here i dont know what youre talking about pleasant mccoy said the hell you dont pleasant said he put his beer to his mouth draining the can and then squeezed it finish your beer mccoy he said and go back to the barracks he got out of the ford coupe and walked away mccoy finished his beer slowly he was sorry but not surprised that what had happened in china was apparently common knowledge the corps was small and marines gossiped as bad as women especially when it was interesting like a marine shooting a bunch of chinese he figured that some other china marines had come home and gone to see gunny stecker another old china marine and told him what had happened at the ferry and gunny stecker had connected it with him and that was how pleasant had heard about it but he couldnt figure out who his rabbi was supposed to be or who the people were who thought he belonged in portsmouth instead of in the platoon leaders program ten minutes after corporal pleasant left him mccoy got out of the ford put the us rifle caliber ml in the position of right shoulder arms and in a military fashion marched back to the barrack took off his utilities and climbed in the sack three marine corps schools quantico virginia october the six weeks passed quickly as mccoy suspected the training was a repeat of parris island boot camp it was necessary to turn the college boys into marines before they could be turned into marine officers that meant they had to be taught immediate unquestioning obedience in such a way that it would become a conditioned reflex thus if a platoon leader candidate did not immediately and unquestioningly respond to whatever order corporal pleasant or another of the drill instructors issued there was immediate punishment if for example the young gentlemen did not respond to an order to fall out on the company street with the proper speed and enthusiasm they were required to fall out again and again and again until corporal pleasant was satisfied and pleasant was a man of some imagination he might suggest that the young gentlemen were slow to fall out because they were unduly burdened by their accoutrements instead of falling out in helmets full marching pack and rifles they could try it again wearing only undershorts skivvy shirts leggings and steel helmets plus of course their rifles this required that they remove their leggings and their utilities the utilities were then folded in the proper manner and placed in the proper place in their footlockers and the leggings laced back on over bare calves if this increased their speed corporal pleasant then experimented they would next fall out in only raincoats utility trousers skivvy shirts and cartridge belts this required unlacing the leggings storing them as prescribed then detaching the canteen first aid packet and web harness from the web cartridge belt and storing these items in their appointed places next perhaps corporal pleasant would order that they again try falling out with the proper speed and enthusiasm in full marching gear this meant of course reattaching the canteen the first aid packet and the harness to the cartridge belt folding the raincoat and placing it in its prescribed location in the footlocker and then relacing the leggings the possible variations were almost limitless and corporal pleasant experimented with as many as he could think of then there was punishment for sin the greatest sin of all was dropping the us rifle caliber ml anyone who did this could expect to doubletime around the parade ground with the rifle held at arms length above his head while shouting in a loud voice my rifle is my best friend and i am a miserable sonofabitch because i abused it god have mercy on my miserable soul another sin was laughter or giggling or even a detected snicker these sinners would doubletime around the parade ground with their rifles at arms length above their heads while shouting at the top of their lungs i am a hyena a hyena is an animal who laughs when there is nothing funny to laugh at this is the sound a hyena makes ha ha ha ha ha ha another means of instilling discipline was calisthenics and closeorder drill this also served to cause the young gentlemen to shed civilian fat and tone their musculature there were thirty minutes of calisthenics later fortyfive minutes and then an hour before breakfast and there was at least an hour of closeorder drill every day individual young gentlemen who came to corporal pleasants attention during the duty day which ran from until whenever pleasant decided the day was over were often required to perform additional calisthenics normally this was in the form of pushups but sometimes when one of the young gentlemen displayed what pleasant thought was ungainly awkward movement such as being out of step it took the form of the duck walk when one did the duck walk one first squatted then one placed the us rifle caliber ml in a horizontal position against the small of the neck and then one waddled while shouting this is the way a duck walks quack quack quack i will try very hard to try to walk like a marine in the future mccoy had been through all this before in boot camp at parris island but that didnt make things any easier he had been genuinely surprised to learn his feet became raw and blistered and his muscles ached how badly out of shape he had become in fact the only real advantages he and the other two marine noncoms had over the college boys was that responding to commands had already been drilled into them and was a reflex action similarly they had experience in giving closeorder drill had already learned how to bark out commands from the pits of their stomachs and more importantly had learned the cadence so that it too was automatic all three of the marines in the platoon learned something else taking closeorder drill from someone who doesnt know what he is doing someone who doesnt understand the cadence and the timing could turn the marine corps drum and bugle corps at the marine barracks in washington into a mob of blind men stumbling over their own feet in addition to the inspections pleasant called whenever the whim struck him and sometimes if he woke early the whim struck before the official rising hour of there was a regularly scheduled inspection each saturday morning the official inspection was conducted by the gunnery sergeant of the company and the company commander in order that he not be embarrassed by slovenly young gentlemen or equipment corporal pleasant conducted both a preinspection and a prepreinspection of the platoon the latter was held on friday evening after the barracks had been scrubbed and polished it was necessary that the platoon pass the prepreinspection before they were permitted to retire for the evening sometimes the prepreinspection did not meet corporal pleasants high standards until very late at night the preinspection was conducted the next morning half an hour before first call it was to determine if the assholes had fucked anything up in the three or four hours while theyd been in the sack after the prepreinspection if they had it could be corrected in the time officially set aside for breakfast scuttlebutt had it that todays inspection was going to be a real bitch the company commander who was rough enough was not on the base thus the inspection would be conducted for him by another officer the battalion mess officer and the scuttlebutt on him was that he had a corn cob up his ass and was a really a chickenshit sonofabitch mccoy was not particularly concerned he knew that once you had prepared your gear and arranged it the situation was out of your hands if an inspecting officer decided to jump your ass he would he would find something wrong even if he had to step on the toes of the boots under your bunk so that he could get you for unshined shoes if you couldnt control the situation there was no point in worrying about it when pleasant barked tenhut on the deck mccoy came to attention his toes at a fortyfivedegree angle the fingers of his left hand against the seam of his trousers his right hand holding the garand just below the bayonet lug he stared straight ahead and heard the clatter of the rifles as one by one the young gentlemen came from attention to inspection arms while this was going on he had speculateda little unkindlythat with just a little bit of luck one of the young gentlemen would catch his thumb in the ml action during the inspection that produced a condition known as m thumb if he howled in pain that just might bring the inspection to a quick end but there was no such fortuitous happenstance the sound of clattering rifles moved closer to him out of the corner of his eye he saw the inspection party approaching he shifted the garand to a diagonal position in front of him slammed the action open bobbed his head over the action to insure that it was unloaded and then looked ahead waiting for it to be snatched from his hand he found himself looking into the face of first lieutenant john r macklin usmc there was no smile on macklins face not even a flicker of recognition this man is unshaven lieutenant macklin said the gunny trailing him dutifully wrote this down on his clipboard macklin snatched the garand from mccoys hand looked into the open action and then raised the butt high in the air so that he could look into the barrel and this weapon is filthy lieutenant macklin said before he threw the garand back at mccoy so hard that it stung his hands and he almost dropped it the gunny dutifully wrote filthy weapon on his clipboard lieutenant macklin moved down the aisle to the next man mccoy closed the action of the garand and returned it to his side the garand had been clean before mccoy had disassembled it and cleaned it and he had shaved no more than two hours before there didnt seem to be much question any longer who believed that killer mccoy belonged in the us naval prison portsmouth rather than in the platoon leaders course at us marine corps schools quantico captain banning mccoy concluded had probably eaten macklins ass out for letting the japs catch him at yenchieng mccoy was summoned to the orderly room half an hour later the gunny was there and pleasant mr mccoy the gunny said there is no excuse in the marine corps for a filthy weapon mccoy brought the garand from the position of attention that is to say with its butt resting on the deck beside his right bootto the position of port arms and then he threw it like a basketball to the gunny what the fuck do you think youre doing the gunny said furiously he had been so surprised he had almost failed to catch it look at it gunny mccoy said who the fuck do you think you are telling me what to do the gunny snapped but he slammed the action open and looked into it and then raised the butt so that he could look down the barrel you want to feel my chin gunny mccoy asked this weapon is filthy mr mccoy the gunny said throwing the garand back to him and you need a shave because lieutenant macklin says so you get the picture i got the picture corporal pleasant will now escort you to the barracks where he will supervise your shave then he will supervise you while you clean your filthy weapon when you have shaved and your rifle is clean he will bring you back here and i will check the closeness of your shave and the cleanliness of your rifle that means i will have to stay here instead of going to my quarters that pisses me off mccoy my wife has plans for the weekend and you have fucked them up mccoy knew enough to keep his mouth shut and ill tell you something else i agree with lieutenant macklin about mccoy i dont know how in the fuck a china marine motor transport corporal with a reputation like yours got it in his head he should be an officer or how you managed to get yourself in here except that you had your nose so far up some officers ass that your ears didnt show i dont like brown noses mccoy and i especially dont like people with rabbis you get the picture yes sir mccoy said finally mr mccoy i would like to make sure you understand that participation in the platoon leaders course is purely voluntary you may resign at any time and keep your stripes im not about to quit gunny mccoy said if you bust out of here the gunny said for misbehavior or malingering something like that they ship your ass to some rifle company its something to think about mccoy yes sir mccoy said corporal pleasant the gunny said i think the deck in the barrack could stand a sanding do you think it might help mr mccoy to remember to shave and to keep his piece clean if he spent the weekend doing that pleasant nodded his agreement he looked a little embarrassed mccoy thought but he was going to go along with the gunny he had no choice four headquarters th marines shanghai china october only a few people were made privy to all the details actual and projected of the removal from china of united states military and naval forces among these was captain edward banning s of the th marines the yangtze river patrol its gunboats and personnel was to sail as soon as possible for the us naval base at cavite on the tip of a narrow fourmilelong peninsula sticking into manila bay it was intended that the yangtze river patrol reinforce us naval forces philippines how much value the old narrowdraft lightly armed riverboats would be was open to question there was even concern that should there be severe weather en route to manila bay the gunboats would founder and sink they were designed to navigate a river not the high seas in a typhoon likewise the small old pigboats of subforchina were as soon as possible to sail for cavite though they were subject to similar fears as to their seaworthiness for they were old and small and designed primarily for coastal rather than deepsea operations but unlike the riverboats if it came to it the pigboats could submerge for maybe five six hours at a time and ride out a storm the two battalions making up the th marines were something else they were marines which was to say they were trained and equipped to fight anywhere but what they would be in fact if war broke out was infantry the official role of the marines was to make amphibious assaults on hostile shores two battalions of marines without landing craft and without larger forces to reinforce them once a landing was made werent going to make much of an amphibious assault force the advance party of the th marines would sail from shanghai aboard the uss henderson a navy transport on october the henderson would then continue on to the united states to onload army reinforcements for the philippines the uss shaumont the other us navy transport that normally served china would similarly be involved in moving us army troops from the west coast of the united states to reinforce the philippines the navy had also chartered space aboard two civilian passenger liners on november the president madison would embark the first battalion and the president harrison the second battalion if nothing went wrong the th marines would arrive in manila during the first week of december then either the henderson or the shaumont would be free to sail to tientsin and pick up the peking and tientsin marine detachments us navy forces philippines was sending to shanghai a consolidated catalina a longrange amphibious reconnaissance aircraft to pick up senior officers of the yangtze river patrol and subforchina and carry them to cavite to prepare for the arrival of their vessels at the last moment the colonel learned of this and prevailed upon his naval counterpart to make space available for one of his officers the colonel did not anticipate any logistical problems when the regiment arrived in the philippines the cavite navy base was enormouscapable of supporting the far east fleet it would be able to house and feed two battalions of marines without difficulty but the colonel did want to know how douglas macarthur former chief of staff of the us army and most recently marshal of the philippine army intended to employ the th marines the obvious officer to find that out was his s and captain edward banning was given twentytwo hours notice to pack his things make arrangements for the personal property he would necessarily have to leave behind and be aboard the catalina when it took off for manila the first thing captain ed banning did when he heard that was get in his pontiac and drive to the headquarters of the shanghai municipal police department he found sergeant chatworth there and told him he needed a big favor like what chatworth asked suspicious i want to marry a stateless person banning said to do that i need a certificate from the municipal police stating there is no record of criminal activity chatworths bushy eyebrows rose or moral turpitude chatworth added banning nodded that isnt all youll need he said you better figure on two weeks at least pulling in all the favors anybody owes you banning looked at his watch i have nineteen hours and thirty minutes he said whats her name chatworth asked when he got back to his apartment milla told him she didnt want to marry him she knew what it would do to his career and she understood how things were when theyd started and she didnt want him to marry her out of pity ill be all right she said finally obviously not meaning it two hours later she held his hand tightly during the brief ceremony at the anglican cathedral and when she kissed him afterward her cheeks were wet with tears sir i ask permission to discuss a personal matter banning standing at attention said to the colonel just as long as you get on that plane ed you have my permission to discuss anything you want with me sir i was married this afternoon banning said i dont think i want to hear this ed the colonel said sir my wife is a stateless person with a nansen travel document jesus christ ed you know the regulations yes sir i know the regulations i didnt hear a word you said captain banning the colonel said i dont wish to believe that an officer of your rank and experience would deliberately disobey regulations concerning marriage and get married without permission if i asked for permission sir it would have been denied or make a gesture like this throwing a fine career down the goddamned toilet the colonel said angrily jesus christ banning didnt reply do you realize what a spot youve put me on ed the colonel asked in exasperation i regret any embarrassment this may cause you sir banning said i am of course prepared to resign my commission the colonel stared at him coldly for a long moment its a good goddamned thing i know you well enough captain banning to understand that was an offer to pay the price rather than an attempt to avoid your duty he said finally mrs banning must be quite a lady again banning could think of nothing to reply sergeantmajor the colonel bellowed the sergeantmajor appeared the colonel told him to close the door captain banning he said was today married to a stateless person captain banning did not have permission to marry the sergeantmajor looked at banning in surprise it will therefore be necessary for you sergeantmajor to preparesuitably backdatedthe application to marry and whatever other documentation is necessary that includes i believe a letter to the assistant chief of staff for intelligence headquarters usmc explaining my reasons for not pulling captain bannings security clearance once it came to my attention that he is emotionally involved with a foreign national aye aye sir the sergeantmajor said my reasons are that i believe the corps cannot at this time afford to lose captain bannings services despite his actions in this matter and that i believe the disciplinary action i have taken closes the matter the disciplinary action sir the sergeantmajor asked you will prepare a letter of reprimand as follows the colonel said quote it has come to my attention that you have married without due attention to the applicable regulations you will consider yourself reprimanded unquote aye aye sir the sergeantmajor said thank you sir banning said if thats all you have on your mind captain banning the colonel said im sure you have a number of things to do before you board the aircraft despite the sergeantmajors claims about his busting his butt to get the consulate to issue milla a nonquota married to an american citizen visa when banning turned over the keys to his pontiac to her he had a strange feeling that he would never see her again they both pretended though that everything was now coming up roses she would promptly get her visa his now their furniture and other belongings including ultimately the pontiac would be turned in for shipment to the philippines if it proved impossible for milla to get her visa in time for her to ship to the philippines with the other dependents she would travel on the first available transportation once the visa was issued what was more likely to happen was that his car and household goods were going to be placed in a godown warehouse on the docks and more than likely disappear forever and that when the dependents sailed milla would be left behind with no visa and he could tell from the look in her eyes that she knew on the catalina he forced milla and the future from his mind there was no sense bleeding to death over something he had no control over it occurred to him that nice guys indeed do finish last macklin that despicable sonofabitch had had three weeks to arrange for the shipment of his car and household goods they had gone on the ship with him and he was in the states not headed for the philippines he was he realized of two minds about macklin on one hand it was goddamned unfair that the sonofabitch should be safe in the states on the other hand if there was to be war it was better that the sonofabitch should be someplace else there was no question in bannings mind that the officer corps of the united states marine corps was about to start earning its pay and in that case a slimy sonofabitch like macklin would do more harm than good and finally before the roar of the engine put him to sleep his thoughts turned to corporal killer mccoy poor mccoy hating every minute of it was probably greasing trucks and keeping his nose clean in philadelphia waiting for him to come home from china and arrange for his transfer mccoy the poor sonofabitch was going to have a long wait chapter eleven one known distance range us marine corps schools quantico virginia november because hed participated back in in the troop test of the garand rifle at fort benning captain jack nmi stecker usmcr assistant s of the school battalion us marine corps schools quantico did not share the generally held opinion that the garand was a piece of shit the corps had sent to the armys infantry school a platoon of marines under master gunnery sergeant jack nmi stecker to find out for themselves what this new rifle was all about he hadnt liked it at first it was bulky and heavy and didnt have the lean lines of the springfield and he had found it difficult to accept that as soon as the slam of the butt into the socket of the shoulder was over the fired cartridge was ejected another cartridge was chambered the action was cocked and the garand was prepared to fire again as a young marine stecker had spent long hours endlessly working his springfield until the action was as smooth as butter and he had learned to fire and work the bolt so fast and so smoothly that the springfield seemed like a machine gun with a slow rate of fire he and the other marines involved in the troop test had been proud of that skill most of them so that the test would not be conducted by forty expert marksmen the corps had detailed a dozen kids fresh from parris island to the platoon they werent experts it took years to really become an expert with a springfield stecker went to the infantry school at benning prepared to dislike the garand but that changed for one thing even if this came close to heresy there was no question that the sights on the garand were better than the sights on the springfield on the other hand the trigger pull started out really godawful must have been ten pounds when they gave him the new garand but he was able to fix that with a little careful stoning of the sear and the action was stiff as hell too but that wore itself in after a couple of hundred rounds and it actually got pretty slick once he learned by trial and error just how much of the yellow lubricant to use and where and then the doggie armorer loaned him his own garand what the hell even if he was a doggie they had things in common the doggie armorer was a master sergeant the same rank as stecker and hed done a hitch with the th can do us infantry in tientsin and they knew about rifles stecker and the doggie armorer had more in common with each other than stecker had with the kids fresh from parris island involved in the troop test so first they had a couple of beers together at the nco club and then the doggie invited him to his quarters for supper and the next morning the doggie armorer handed him a garand and told him hed done a little work on it what hed done was a really good job on the trigger and the action was really smooth and hed taken chisels to the stock and cut away all the wood so the barrel was free floating and he wasnt sure if stecker would like this hed replaced the rear sight with one hed rigged up with an aperture about half as big as issue the first time stecker fired the doggies garandat two hundred yardswhen they marked the target and hauled it up again there was only one spotter bullet holes in rifle targets are marked with circular cardboard disks white if the hole is in the black of the bullseye and black for holes elsewhere on the target a peg in the center of the disk is inserted in the bullet hole a bullet strike is thus visible from the firing line on it a white one but only one have them remark that goddamned target stecker demanded angry and embarrassed he had fired two loose rounds and an eightround clip at that target and apparently hit it only once the doggie corporal on the field phone to the pits ordered the target remarked and it disappeared into the pits it came back up a minute later with just the one white spotter and stecker felt humiliation sweep through him two and a quarter the doggie corporal sang out what the hell does that mean stecker asked there was no such terminology in the corps that means sarge the corporal said tolerantly that you put them all into just over two inches not bad stecker was so pleased and to tell the truth of it so relieved that hed put ten rounds into an area smaller than a spotterwhich was damned near minute of angle one inch at yards two inches at yards etcthat he didnt even jump the doggie corporals ass for calling him sarge that would have been good shooting even with steckers own personal springfield which he privately believed was as accurate as any springfield in the corps that was when he began to change his evaluation of the garand obviously when properly tuned the ugly sonofabitch would shoot which was the important thing and being absolutely fair and objective about it which is what he was supposed to be as the ncoic of the marine troop test you could get back on target after the recoil faster than you could with a springfield like it or not the gasoperated mechanism of the garand ejected a round and chambered another faster than even a master gunnery sergeant of the marine corps could work the bolt of a springfield and there was more to think about not only were the marine marksmen doing well with the garand the sergeants and corporals who knew something about shooting but the kids from parris island too they didnt he realized have a hell of a lot to unlearn they just took the garand and learned how to use it he didnt easily give in to admitting that the garand was actually a fine weapon though for instance he surprised hell out of a squad of the kids by ordering them not to detail strip their pieces when the days firing was over just run a couple of patches first bore cleaner then oil down the bore dont brush the bore i want to see how much it will take to jam it it was three days of firing before the first garand jammed that night he ordered the squad to detail strip and clean their garands but not to reassemble them when all the parts were clean he ordered the kids to put them all together in a pile on the deck of the barrack the kids thought he was really nuts then and even more so when he stepped up to the pile and stirred the parts around with his toe one of the claimed merits of the garand was interchangeability of parts this was a good way to find out now put them together he ordered he stood watching as the kids assembled rifles i dont want anybody exchanging parts after im gone he said im trying something there was only one malfunction of the squads garands the next day a stovepipe when the action fails to eject a fired cartridge case properly and jams it in place with the open end erect it is known as a stovepipe he suspected was a freak he proved this by firing three clips through the rifle as quickly as he could and without further failure to eject master gunnery sergeant stecker returned from fort benning one of the few people in the corps who believed the garand was the best infantry rifle to come down the pike in a long time he was worried then not about whether the garand would be good for the corps but whenor even whether the corps would get it the army would take care of itself first of course the corps would probably wind up with the armys wornout springfields rather than new garands captain jack nmi stecker usmcr was therefore pleased when the first garands were issued to the corps there were not enough of them to go around of course but the door was open for the moment unfortunately there were only enough of them to equip a few detached units and for instructional purposes captain stecker read with interest the reports of scores fired with the new rifle by the students of the battalion and he was not happy with the results from either the commissioned officers at their annual qualification at quantico or of the kids in the platoon leaders course he decided first to see what was wrong with the training of the platoon leader candidates and fix that and then hed see that the same fix was applied to the abbreviated training course given the officers before they fired their annual qualification at which was late enough for the firing on the known distance range to be well under way he got up from his desk and walked out of his office come with me son he said to the ss jeep driver a small very neat pfc trying to make himself inconspicuous on a chair in the outer office as he invariably did when he went for a ride in the jeep with a pfc at the wheel he thought about how much hed liked it better when hed been a master gunnery sergeant with the pickup and didnt have to sit like a statue on an uncomfortable pad in the jeep in the center of the line of known distance rifle range where the platoon leader candidates were firing for record there was a small clutter of buildings surrounding the range masters tower next to the buildings several vehicles were parked with their front wheels against yellowpainted logs halfburied in the sand there were two jeeps one assigned to range nco and the other to the range officer two pickups and a threequarterton dodge weapons carrier which had brought the ammo from the dump two ambulances new ones built on the dodge threequarterton weapons carrier chassis were backed up against the logs stecker told the driver to park the jeep beside the weapons carrier when he stopped stecker removed his campaign hat and took from the crown a small glass bottle which once contained bayer aspirin he took from it four globs of what looked like wax at the end of short pieces of string and handed two of them to the pfc here he said to the driver stick these in your ears what is it sir the pfc asked doubtfully genuine haiti marine earplugs stecker said do what i tell you aye aye sir the pfc said and after he watched stecker carefully push with his index finger one of the wax globs into each ear he somewhat uneasily put the plugs into his own ears unless someone looked very carefully at his ears which was highly unlikely the earplugs would go unnoticed the night before when stecker checked the jar where he kept his earplugs he found only one pair left so he decided he had to make some more so captain stecker spent an hour at his kitchen sink making six pairs of the earplugs he knew that he would be spending several hours on the known distance range and he had long ago learned that ear damage from the muzzle blast of rifle fire was permanent and cumulative there were a lot of deaf gunnery sergeants in the marine corps as proof of that from the time he had been a pfc stecker had understood that the boy scouts were right be prepared said it all he didnt really need any more earplugs than the pair he had in the bayer aspirin bottle not for tomorrow but the day after tomorrow was something else he had no spares and therefore it was time to make some the haiti marine earplugs were a good deal more complicated than they looked he first carefully cut the erasers from a dozen pencils then with an awl heated red on the stove he burned a hole through the center of the eraser he then knotted a length of strong thread through the holes of a small button just a bit larger than the diameter of the eraser the loose end of the thread was then fed through the hole in the eraser one at a time the dozen erasers were carefully placed in holes bored through a piece of wood then in a small pot reserved for this specific purpose he melted paraffin and beef tallow and carefully poured it into the holes in the wood when it had time to cool he pushed each earplug out with a pencil while the beef tallowparaffin mixture would remain flexible enough to seal his ear canal it would neither run from the heat of his body nor harden to the point where removal would be difficult it was a trick captain stecker had learned when he was a corporal in haiti in a staff sergeant named jim finch had taken a shine to him shown him how to make the plugs and warned him that if he was going to spend any time around ranges he had goddamned well better get in the habit of using them stecker put the bayer aspirin bottle back in the crown of his stiffbrimmed campaign hat and then with a quick smooth movement to keep the bottle from falling out flipped it onto his head aside from his field shoes the campaign hat was about the only part of his enlisted mans uniforms that he had been able to use as an officer he had to change the insignia on the campaign hat but it hadnt been necessary to put it up for sale in the thrift shop along with just about everything else when he was ten feet away the range officer spotted him and saluted raising his arm crisply until the fingers touched the stiff brim of his campaign hat good morning sir he barked good morning stecker said is there something special sir the range officer asked just checking stecker said but how are the young gentlemen doing not bad sir the range officer said i think we have two who are going to shoot high expert and the low end i think theyre all going to qualify sir the range officer said you think lieutenant stecker asked out of the corner of his eye he had just seen maggies drawers a red flag waved before a target to show a complete miss yes sir the range officer said think wont cut it lieutenant stecker said if one of the young gentlemen fails to qualify first time out that means his instructors havent been doing their job aye aye sir the range officer said im going to have a look around stecker said i wont need any company and i dont want the pit officer to know im here aye aye sir the range officer repeated stecker walked erectly to the end of the firing line there were twenty firing points each occupied by two platoon leader candidates one firing and one serving as coach for each two firing points there was a training nco socalled even though most of them were pfcs and not noncommissioned officers a half dozen ncos all three stripe buck sergeants moved up and down the line keeping an eye on the training ncos and the firers the firing was near the end of the prescribed course the young gentlemen were about to fire slow fire prone at bullseye targets five hundred yards down range the course of fire would be twenty shots with sixty seconds allotted for each one the targets would be pulled and marked after each string of ten shots what they were doing now was firing sighters they had changed range and were permitted trial shots to see how they had done changing their sights the target before which maggies drawers had flown was down in the pits as stecker watched it came up there was a black marker high on the right side of the target outside the scoring rings this young gentleman stecker thought wryly had probably never held a gun in his hands before he became associated with the marine corps some people learned easily and some didnt bullshit the firer said when he saw the marker more in anger than embarrassment watch your mouth mister the training nco snapped the firer turned his head in annoyance and then he recognized stecker as an officer and looked down the range again he didnt recognize me except as an officer but i recognize him thats the china marine with the lasalle convertible thats surprising a marine noncom ought to be at least able to get them inside the scoring rings he watched as mccoy singleloaded another round at least he knows enough not to mess with the sights stecker thought that was probably a flier he watched as mccoy slapped the stock of the garand into the socket of his arm and wiggled his feet to get in the correct position and he thought he could detect the expelling of half a breath just before the garand went off again the target dropped from sight when it appeared again there was another black marker this time low and leftin other words on the opposite side of the target from the last spotter disk oh bullshit mccoy said furious his coach another young gentleman jabbed him with his elbow to remind him that he was being watched by an officer stecker gave in to the impulse he reached out and kicked the sole of the coachs boot when the coach looked up at him in surprise he gestured for him to get up stecker lay down beside mccoy when mccoy looked at him there was recognition in his eyes all sorts of people get to be officers these days stecker said softly what seems to be your trouble beats the shit out of me mccoy said still so angry and perhaps surprised to see steckerthat it was a moment before he appended sir stecker reached up and tried to wiggle the rear sight sometimes they came loose but not there and neither was the front sight when he tried it try it again stecker ordered turning and holding his hand out for another loose round when mccoy reached for it stecker saw his hands they were unhealthy white and covered with open blisters what did you do to your hands ive sanded a couple of decks sanding decks cleaning them with sand and a brick went back to the days of woodendecked sailing ships now it was used as a punishment lately captain mccoy said stecker wondered what mccoy had done to deserve punishment the boy probably had an automatic mouth stecker watched carefully as mccoy fired another round there was nothing in his firing technique that he could fault and while they were waiting for the target to be marked he saw that mccoy had wads of chewedup paper in his ears it wasnt as good as haiti earplugs but it was a hell of a lot better than nothing and it reminded stecker that this boy had been around a rifle range enough to know what he was doing there was no explanation for his shooting all over the target much less missing it completely except that there was something really wrong with the rifle when the target appeared the marker was black just outside the bullseye thats a little better stecker said i should have split the peg with that one mccoy said furiously by that he meant that he was confident of his shot knew where it had gone thats either bravado or he means it and theres only one way to find out get out of your sling stecker ordered and hand me the rifle as mccoy pulled the leather sling off his arm stecker turned to the training nco and signaled that he wanted a clip of ammunition when mccoy handed him the garand stecker put the strap on his own arm and squirmed into the correct position call my shot he said to mccoy im going to take out your twohundredyard target number mccoy looked at him in surprise so there would be no confusion about which was the correct target there were markers at each distance with fourinchhigh numbers painted on short flat pieces of wood they were not designed as targets stecker himself wondered why he was going to fire at the target number then realized that he thought somebody might be fucking around with mccoys target in the pits if that was the case which now seemed likely he would have the ass of the pit officer you just dont fuck around in the pits the marine corps does not think rifle marksmanship is an area for practical jokes stecker lined up his sights and squeezed one off you took a chip out of the upperright corner captain mccoy reported maggies drawers flew in front of mccoys target stecker fired again you blew it away captain mccoy reported stecker snapped the safety in front of the trigger guard on then slipped out of the sling the piece is loaded he said be careful have a shot at the target marker number eighteen aye aye sir mccoy said the target number disappeared with mccoys first shot nineteen stecker ordered mccoy fired again half of the target number disappeared when the bullet split it do you think you can hit whats left stecker asked he saw maggies drawers being waved furiously in front of the target mccoy fired again and the narrow half remaining of the target number disappeared at targets of opportunity fire at will stecker ordered softly mccoy fired the remaining two rounds in the eightround en bloc clip at other target numbers he did not miss insure that your weapon is empty and leave the firing line bringing your weapon with you stecker said calmly reciting the prescribed litany by the time they were both on their feet the range officer and the range nco were standing beside the training nco having witnessed not only a captain blowing away the target numbers but apparently encouraging a trainee to do likewise they were more than a little uneasy this young man has a faulty weapon captain stecker announced i think he should be given the opportunity to refire for record aye aye sir the range officer said the range sergeant took the garand from mccoy and started to examine it dont you think i know a faulty weapon when i see one gunny captain stecker asked yes sir no offense sir i realize that tomorrow is the first day of thanksgiving liberty captain stecker said but as we want to give this young man every opportunity to make a decent score i think we should have the pit officer back too who is he stecker had decided that the pit officer whoever he might be would never forget that marines dont fuck around the pits after he had spent the first day of thanksgiving liberty personally hauling marking and pasting targets for a platoon leader candidate that made more sense than in writing him an official letter of reprimand or even turning him in to the battalion commander lieutenant macklin sir the range officer said i dont think i know him stecker said hes the mess officer sir he volunteered to help out in the pits the range officer said and then stecker saw understanding and then bitterness in mccoys eyes do you know lieutenant macklin mccoy stecker asked yes sir i know him stecker made a comeon motion of his hands we were in the fourth marines together sir mccoy said i see stecker said ill find out what the hell that is all about i think you can get on with the firing lieutenant stecker said aye aye sir the lieutenant said and then when stecker was obviously going to walk away he called attention and saluted stecker went back to his jeep and was driven off since there was no point in his firing anymore with a faulty weapon platoon leader candidate mccoy and platoon leader candidate pickering were put to work policing brass from the firing line until that relay had finished then platoon leader candidate mccoy served as coach for platoon leader candidate pickering while he fired for record platoon leader candidate pickering qualified as expert two after leaving mccoy captain stecker went to battalion headquarters where he examined the personal record jacket of first lieutenant john r macklin usmc the personnel sergeant was a little uneasy about thatpersonal records were supposed to be personalbut he wouldnt have dreamed of telling master gunnery sergeant stecker to mind his own business and gunny stecker was now wearing the silver railroad tracks of a captain then captain stecker got back in the jeep and had himself carried to the platoon leader course orderly room word had already gotten back that captain stecker had been out on the range and that he had ordered the refiring for record of one of the candidates and that the pit officer be in the pits when he did so the sergeantmajor had been sort of a pal before stecker took a commission and he knew there was more to it than he had been told he came to his feet and stood at attention when stecker walked in good morning sir he said as you were stecker said how may i help the captain sir the sergeantmajor said you wouldnt happen to have a cup of coffee sergeantmajor yes sir the sergeantmajor said and if you have a minute sergeantmajor id like a word with you in private we can use the commanding officers office sir the sergeantmajor said he went out to check on the range sir a corporal followed the two of them into the commanding officers office with two china mugs of coffee and then left closing the door behind him tell me about a kid named mccoy charley stecker said thats the one was a china marine stecker nodded what do you want to know jack how come hes been sanding decks i dont know the sergeantmajor said he fucked up i guess what do you know about lieutenant macklin not much jack the sergeantmajor said after thinking it over the cooks hate his ass but that always happens when theres a new broom and hes an eager sonofabitch the scuttlebutt is hes got a lousy efficiency report and is trying to make up for it so he volunteered to be pit officer and he takes saturday inspections for the officers that kind of stuff i want a look at mccoys records stecker said anything in particular just say im nosy stecker said the sergeantmajor went into the outer office and returned with a handful of manila files hes more of a fuckup than i thought the sergeantmajor said jesus hes been on report at every fucking inspection hes given lip to the dis even macklin wrote him up twice for failure to salute hell be scrubbing decks again over the thanksgiving liberty hes right on the edge of getting his ass shipped out of here hes going before the elimination board a board of officers charged with determining whether or not a platoon leader candidate has proved himself unfit or unworthy of being commissioned on friday stecker grunted he took mccoys records from the sergeantmajor and read them carefully very odd he said his last efficiency report says his personal deportment and military bearing serves as an example to the command i wonder what turned him into a fuckup here the sergeantmajor raised his eyebrows but said nothing it says here that hes an expert with the springfield and the and the light and watercooled brownings i was on the range before so i heard the sergeantmajor said he could barely get a round on the target much less in the black stecker said i found out he had a faulty weapon he could hit target numbers with it it was just that he was all over the target when he fired at a bullseye jesus was he fucking around on the rifle range too the sergeantmajor asked he wasnt fucking around on the rifle range charley stecker said and macklin was the pit officer right the sergeantmajor said finally putting things together was he stecker asked innocently jesus christ the sergeantmajor said im sure you know as well as i do sergeantmajor stecker said that no marine officer is capable of using his office and authority to settle personal grudges yes sir the sergeantmajor said and under the circumstances sergeantmajor i can see no reason for platoon leader candidate mccoy to refire for record it would be an unnecessary expenditure of time and ammunition if he had a properly functioning rifle im sure that he wouldsince he has been drawing expert marksmans pay since boot campqualify with the garand got you the sergeantmajor said further it would interfere with his thanksgiving liberty platoon leader candidate mccoy is shortly going to be commissioned hell have to get past the elimination board the sergeantmajor said with this record he has to go before it what record do you mean sergeantmajor captain stecker said as calmly and deliberately he tore from the manila folder all the official records of misbehavior and unsatisfactory performance platoon leader candidate mccoy had acquired since beginning the course he shredded them and dropped them into the wastebasket what do i tell the old man jack the sergeantmajor asked three things charley stecker said first that if there is some reason mccoy cant have thanksgiving liberty i want to hear about it second that the colonel has taken two evening meals in the mess and found them unsatisfactory and third that i politely and unofficially suggest that maybe the chow would be better if the mess officer stayed where he belongs in the kitchen the sergeantmajor nodded im sorry about this jack he said i feel like a damned fool stecker did not let him off the hook when i was the gunny charley he said the colonel expected me to know what was going on in the ranks i found the best way to do that was get off my ass and have a look at things and then he walked out of the office three inasmuch as ceremonies are an integral part of the life and duties of young officers and because the marine corps schools believed that doing is the best means of learning ceremonies of one kind or another were frequently on the training program of the platoon leaders course one such ceremony was scheduled for hours november it was a formal retreat the platoon leader candidates would be returned from the known distance firing range in plenty of time to clean their rifles shave and wash and change into greens the training schedule allocated all of thirtyfive minutes for this purpose waiting for corporal pleasant to blow his whistle mccoy was pretty well down in the dumps at first he had been almost thrilled that macklin had been caught sticking it to him hed thought that luck was finally falling his way it hadnt taken long for the oldgunnynowacaptain to figure out that somebody was fucking him in the pits or even that the sonofabitch sticking it in him was lieutenant macklin but the good feeling soon dissipated for one thing officers took care of one another and the captain if he said anything at all to macklin wasnt going to jump his ass stecker believed that macklin was either sloppy in the pits or that he thought what he was doing was funny stecker had no reason to think that macklin was personally doing his best to get him booted out of the platoon leaders course all the whole incident had meant was that he was going to get a chance to fire for record again that was all and macklin was being taught not to fool around when he was pit officer by having to spend thanksgiving morning on the range it was possible that he would pull the same shit all over again why not there would be nobody there to watch him when he came off the rifle range the sand and the bricks would be waiting for him and he would spend thanksgiving afternoon on his knees scrubbing the decks for disrespectful attitude and on friday morning he would go before the elimination board pleasant had told him about that he could get out of it pleasant said and probably get the whole thanksgiving weekend as liberty if he would just face the fact that they werent going to make him an officer and resign he had told pleasant to go fuck himself which is why he would be sanding the deck mccoy didnt believe he was ever going to get a gold bar to put on his shoulder not really not inside but he was going to take the one chance he saw sometimes the elimination board wouldnt bust people out but would instead drop them back which meant that you went through part of the course again with a class that started later that happened when somebody bilged academics he had never heard of somebody being dropped back for attitude or unsuitability which is what they called it when they sent you before the elimination board for fucking up but thats what he was going to ask for he had come this far and he wasnt just going to belly up for the bastards he probably wouldnt get it and next monday he would probably be on his way as pvt mccoy to camp lejeune or maybe diego as a machinegunner and it was a real pain in the ass to get all shined up for a retreat parade knowing that they were going to read your name off on two lists one for extra training which is what they called the deck sanding and the other to go before the elimination board and when they had done that knowing that while everybody else was off getting beered up at the slop chute he would be on his fucking hands and knees sanding the deck if i helped you with the deck pick pickering said as if he was reading his mind maybe we could get done quicker pleasant would get you your own deck mccoy said but thanks pick lets give it a shot pickering said when they hold formation mccoy said theyre going to read off names of people going before the elimination board mine is on it you dont believe that pickering said loyally i know mccoy said its not scuttlebutt thats not right pickering said christ its goddamned unfair its an unfair world mccoy said this is the marine corps there ought to be some way to register a complaint pickering said mccoy laughed at him but then touched by pickerings loyalty punched him affectionately on the arm pickering was a good guy dumb but a good guy even after mccoy had told him that he was on everybodys shit list and that if he kept hanging around some of the shit they were throwing was bound to splatter on him hed hung around anyway pickering was going to be a good officer turn around asshole mccoy said let me check you out there was nothing wrong with pickerings uniform or equipment but a pin on one of mccoys collar point oxes platoon leader candidates wore brass insignia the letters oc hence ox standing for officer candidate on shirt collar points and foreandaft hats in lieu of insignia of rank had come off and the ox was hanging loose pickering fixed it what the fuck difference does it make mccoy thought bitterly this is the last time ill wear it anyway ill go before the elimination board in dungarees corporal pleasant blew his whistle and all the freshly bathed and shaved young gentlemen rushed out onto the company street where they formed ranks corporal pleasant then issued the appropriate order causing the young gentlemen to open ranks so that he could more conveniently inspect their shaves the press of their green uniforms and the cleanliness of their garand rifles they would be inspected again a few minutes later by the company commander and gunnery sergeant but corporal pleasant wanted to make sure they were all shipshape before that happened to mccoys surprise pleasant not only found nothing wrong with his appearance shave or shine he didnt even inspect his rifle when he stepped in front of him he probably figures he doesnt have to bother anymore the company commander and the gunnery sergeant made their appearance at the end of the company street and one by one the drill instructors of the four platoons of platoon leader candidates called their troops to order mccoys company commander a lieutenant spoke to him as he inspected his rifle i understand you had some trouble with this today mccoy yes sir and i also understand the stoppage has been cleared what the fuck is he talking about stoppage yes sir the company commander moved on the sergeantmajor looked right into mccoys face but said nothing and there was no particular expression on his face when the four platoons had been inspected the officers took their positions and the gunny read the orders of the day the next day was thanksgiving until december thanksgiving was celebrated on the third thursday of november the gunny announced as if no one had figured that out for himself liberty for all hands with the exception of those individuals requiring extra training would commence when the formation was dismissed the next duty day friday would be given over to the purchase of uniforms those individuals who were to appear before the elimination board would not repeat not order any officertype uniforms until the decisions of the elimination board were announced liberty would begin on friday until hours the following monday as soon as the platoon leader candidates had arranged for the purchase of officertype uniforms there would be no repeat no liberty for anyone called before the elimination board the gunny then read the list of those who required extra training and then the list of those to face the elimination board and then he did an aboutface and saluted the company commander who returned the salute ordered him to dismiss the formation and walked off the gunny barked dismiss pick pickering punched mccoys arm see i told you you werent gonna get boarded and neither mccoy thought did i hear my name called for extra training and they didnt say anything about refiring for record either what the fuck is going on he thought it was entirely likely that the gunny had forgotten to read his name so that when he failed to show up to sand the deck or to refire for record or for the elimination board itself they could add awol to everything else he saw pleasant going behind the building to get into his ford he ran after him pleasant rolled down the window something i can do for you mr mccoy what the fuck is going on pleasant why wasnt my name called for extra training and for the elimination board because youre not on extra training mr mccoy and because youre not going before the elimination board you are on liberty mr mccoy you going to tell me whats going on very well mr mccoy its very simple in ten days they are going to pin a gold bar on your shoulder between now and then the gunny and i will do whatever we can to make things as painless as possible for you i thought you wanted to bust me out of here oh we do pleasant said nothing would give us greater pleasure but then we know better than to fuck with a rabbi what rabbi is there anything else mr mccoy pleasant said if not with your permission sir i would like to start my thanksgiving liberty fuck you pleasant mccoy said pleasant rolled up the window and drove off pick pickering was waiting for mccoy in the barracks well im on liberty like everybody else mccoy said and no elimination board great pickering said and punched his arm lets go find a cab and get the hell out of here out of here where in compliance with orders from the united states marine corps i am going to buy some officertype uniforms what the hell are you talking about were not supposed to buy uniforms until friday right pickering said well im learning pickering said you will recall that they didnt say anything about where we were to buy the uniforms just that we buy them on friday so on friday i am going to buy uniforms in brooks brothers in new york whats brooks brothers its a place where they sell clothing including uniforms jesus mccoy said and when were not buying our uniforms we can be lifting some skirts pickering said the only problem is finding a cab to get us off this fucking base to someplace we can catch a train to new york we dont need a cab mccoy said ive got a car you have a car here pickering asked surprised mccoy nodded mr mccoy pickering said the first time i laid eyes on you i said now there is a man of many talents the sort of chap it would be wise to cultivate in the furtherance of my military career mccoy smiled and will this car of yours make it to new york without what i have recently learned to call mechanical breakdown its a lasalle mccoy said in that case if you pay for the gas pickering said i will take care of the room fair fair mccoy agreed chapter twelve one the foster park hotel central park south new york city new york hours november pick pickering was at the wheel of the lasalle when it pulled up in front of the marquee of the foster park hotel they had gassed up just past baltimore and changed places there mccoy had gone to sleep thinking about ellen feller about her probably being somewhere in baltimore and about what had happened between them in chinamemories that reminded him of the very long time since hed had his ashes hauled the doorman stepped off the curb walked out to the drivers side opened the door and said welcome to the foster park hotel sir before he realized that the driver was some kind of a soldier a marine and an enlisted man not even an officer may i help you sir pickering got out of the car take care of the car please he said well need it sometime sunday afternoon youll be checking in sir the question seemed to amuse the marine i hope so he said the luggage is in the trunk he turned back to the car off your ass and on your feet mccoy he said were here mccoy sat up startled looked around and as almost a reflex action opened his door and got out where are we he asked groggily my grandfather calls it sodomonhudson pickering said and took mccoys arm and propelled him toward the revolving door the desk clerk was busy with someone else as pickering and mccoy approached registration pickering pulled the register in front of him took the pen and filled out one of the cards when the desk clerk turned his attention toward pickering he thrust the registration card at him wed like a small suite he said im not sure that well be able to accommodate you sir the clerk said the clerk didnt know what the oc insignia on the collar points of the uniforms meant but he knew a marine private when he saw one and marine privates couldnt afford the prices of the foster park hotel house is full is it the marine asked what i mean to suggest sir the desk clerk said as tactfully as he could is that our prices are well a little stiff thats all right the marine said i wont be paying for it anyway something with a view of the park if one is available the desk clerk looked down at the card in his hand he didnt recognize the name but in the block special billing instructions the marine had written andrew foster sf attn mrs delahanty just one moment please sir ill check the desk clerk said he disappeared behind the rack of mailandkey slots and handed the card to the night resident manager who was having a cup of coffee and a danish pastry at his desk he handed him the registration card the night resident manager glanced at it casually and then jumped to his feet he approached the marines standing at the desk with his hand extended welcome to the park mr pickering he said its a pleasure to have you in the house thank you pick pickering said shaking his hand is there some problem absolutely no problem would penthouse c be all right with you if youre sure we cant rent it pickering said not at this hour mr pickering the night resident manager said laughing appreciatively well if somebody wants it move us pickering said but otherwise thats fine well be here until sunday afternoon the night resident manager took a key from the rack and came from behind the marble counter if we had only known you were coming mr pickering he said im afraid theres not even a basket of fruit in the penthouse at half past four this afternoon it was even money that we would be spending the weekend with a brick and a pile of sand pick pickering said i dont much care about fruit but i wish you would send up some liquor peanuts that sort of thing immediately mr pickering the night resident manager said as he bowed them onto the elevator penthouse c of the foster park hotel consisted of a large sitting room opening onto a patio overlooking fiftyninth street and central park to the right and left were bedrooms and there was a butlers pantry and a bar with four stools when he went directly to answer natures call mccoy found himself in the largest bathroom he had ever seen by the time he came out there were two room service waiters and a bellboy in the room the bellboy was arranging cut flowers in vases one waiter was organizing on the rack behind the bar enough liquor bottles to stock a saloon and the other was moving through the room filling silver bowls from a twopound can of cashews pick pickering was sitting on a couch talking on the telephone he saw mccoy and made a gesture indicating he was thirsty scotch he called putting his hand over the mouthpiece by the time mccoy had crossed to the bar the night resident manager had two drinks made were glad to have you with us sir the night resident manager said as he put one drink in mccoys hand and scurried across the room to deliver the other to pickering when they were all finally gone and pickering finished his telephone call mccoy sat down beside him what the hell is all this he asked pickering leaned back against the couch and took a swallow of his drink christ that tastes good he said incidentally i have located the quarry what quarry the females with liftable skirts pickering said theres a covey of them in a saloon called el borracho which appropriately means the kiss i think i asked you whats going on around here mccoy said we all have our dark secrets pickering said i for example know far more than i really want to about your lady missionary come on pick mccoy said this is the foster park hotel pickering said along with fortyone others it is owned by a man named andrew foster andrew foster has one child a daughter she married a man who owns ships a lot of ships ken they have one child me jesus christ mccoy said it is not the sort of thing i would wish our beloved corporal pleasant or our sainted gunny to know so keep your fucking mouth shut about it mccoy jesus christ mccoy repeated yes pickering asked benignly as befitting the saviour what is it you wish my son two they did not get laid all the girls at the first night club had escorts they smiled especially at pick pickering but it proved impossible to separate them from the young men they were with the candyasses were worried about leaving their girls alone with pickering mccoy thought approvingly he was sure they had learned from painful experience that if they blinked their eyes pickering and their girls would be gone most of the time mccoy didnt know what the hell anyone was talking about only one of the girls showed any interest at all in him she asked him if he had been at harvard with malcolm when he said no she asked him where he had gone to school when he said saint rose of lima she gave him a funny smile and ignored him thereafter in the second place which was called the club mccoy thought they probably could have gotten laid there were enough women around but the son of the proprietor fucked that up he wanted to hear all about the platoon leaders course because hed joined the corps and was about to report for active duty pick kept him fascinated with tales of corporal pleasant and slurping food from trays and doing the duck walk when they left he insisted on paying for their drinks and told mccoy that he was welcome any time but that didnt get them laid either the third place mccoy remembered hearing about somewhere it was called the stork club when they got there he didnt think they were going to get in because there was a line of people waiting on the sidewalk but pick just walked to the head of the line and a bouncer or whatever lowered a rope and called pick mr pickering and they walked in there was a table against the wall with a reserved sign on it but a headwaiter snatched that away and sat them down there moments later a waiter with a bottle of champagne showed up soon followed by the proprietor of the stork club the proprietor asked about mr foster and told pick to make sure he carried his best regards to his parents like the guy at he picked up the bill that meant they got a decent load on without spending a dime tomorrow ken we will get laid pickering said as they got in a cab to return to the hotel look on tonight as reconnaissance the key to a successful assault you will recall is a good reconnaissance as they were having breakfast the next morning pick had an idea he called the harvard club and had the steward put a notice on the bulletin board mr malcolm pickering will entertain his friends and acquaintances at postthanksgiving dinner cocktails from pm penthouse c the foster park hotel friends and acquaintances are expected to bring two girls mccoy had a good time in the morning he made some remark about what a nice hotel it was and pickering then took him on a tour this was fascinating to mccoy and it was a complete tour kitchens laundry even the little building up above the penthouses where the elevator machinery was mccoy saw that there was more to the tour than showing him around pickering looked inside garbage cans even went into rooms with open doors he was inspecting the place looking for things that werent as they were supposed to be the other side of that was that he knew how things were supposed to be he might be rich as shit but he understood the hotel business he wondered if pickering had learned that in school and asked him pick laughed and told him that the first job hed had in a foster hotel was as a twelveyearrold busboy cleaning tables i can do anything in the hotel except french pastry pickering said ive never been able to handle egg white properly about one oclock as they sat in the sitting room in their shirts and trousers drinking feigenspann xxx ale from the necks of the bottles the hotel started setting up for the cocktail party there was an enormous turkey and a whole ham and a piece of roast beef and all kinds of other stuff thinking of how much it was costing made mccoy uncomfortable no matter how nice pick was being mccoy was beginning to feel like a mooch it got worse when the people started showing up for the party it wasnt hard to figure that if all the guests werent as rich as pick they were still rich and he had nothing in common with them the only thing he had in common with pick was the marine corps and then there was one particular girl she really made him uncomfortable he had never seen a more beautiful girl in his life she was fucking nearperfect she had black hair in a pageboy with dark glowing eyes that made her skin seem pure white she wasnt dressed as fancy as the others just a sweater and a skirt with a string of pearls hanging down around her neck his first thought was that he would happily swap his left nut to get her in the sack and his second thought was that she wasnt that kind of female at all she wasnt going to give any away until she had the gold ring on her fingernot because she was careful but because that was the kind of woman she was once when she caught him looking at her she looked right back at him as if she was asking whats a scumbag like you doing looking at me im not like the rest of these people and for some reason she kept him from putting the make on anybody else not all of picks friends and acquaintances had shown up with two girls but a lot of them had and a bunch of women had come by themselves one of them a sharpfeatured woman with blond hair down to her shoulders had even come on to him smiling at him and touching his arm when she asked him if he was in the marines with pick but he saw the girl in the pageboy looking at them with her dark eyes and didnt do anything about the blonde after a moment she went away ten or fifteen minutes later the smoke in the place there must have been a hundred people and they were all smoking got to him and he realized hed had more scotch than he should have he didnt want to get shitfaced and make an ass of himself and embarrass pick in front of his friends so he took another bottle of ale from the refrigerator walked into his bedroom where he interrupted a couple kissing and feeling each other up and went out on the patio for a breath of cold fresh air the sun had come up there wasnt much wind and it wasnt as cold as he thought it would be it was nippy but thats what he wanted anyhow he sat on the wall carefully because they were twentytwo floors up and looked down at fiftyninth street when that started to make him feel a little dizzy he looked into central park he was pretty far gone from where he thought he would be on thanksgiving afternoon he thought sanding the fucking deck then he remembered he was really far from where he had been last thanksgiving a pfc machinegunner in dog company first battalion th marines in shanghai hed taken the noon meal in the mess hall they always sent in frozen turkeys on thanksgiving and christmas and that was the only time there was turkey in china they even bent the rules for thanksgiving and christmas and you could bring guests who werent european he remembered that zimmerman had brought his chinese wife and all their halfwhite kids to the mess dont go to sleep a female voice said to him thats a long step if you walk in your sleep startled he stood up and then looked to see who was talking to him it was the perfect fucking female in the pageboy haircut i wasnt about to go to sleep he said you could have fooled me she said you looked like you were bored to death and about to doze off i was thinking mccoy said the string of pearls around her neck had looped around one of her breasts it wasnt sexy it was feminine about what what what were you thinking about she pursued she sat down on the wall and looked up at him jesus christ up close shes even more beautiful where i was last thanksgiving he said and where you might be next thanksgiving no he said i wasnt thinking about that i thought you might be she said and she smiled why well youre a marine she said dont they wonder where theyll be moved next i dont he replied without thinking not any further than the corps i mean i know im going to be in the corps it doesnt matter where ill be itll still be the corps she looked as if she didnt understand him but the question she asked was perfectly normal where were you last thanksgiving she asked shanghai he said and added china so thats where shanghai is she said brightly i knew it was either there or in australia i knew fucking well that i would show my ass if i tried to talk to somebody like this what a dumb fucking thing to say she saw the hurt in his eyes sorry she said its all right mccoy said no its not she said there are extenuating circumstances but i shouldnt have jumped on you what are the extenuating circumstances mccoy asked im an advertising copywriter she said i dont know what that is mccoy confessed i write the words in advertisements she explained oh he said our motto is brevity she said oh mccoy repeated we try not to say anything redundant she said its okay to jump on somebody who does okay he said i had no right to do that to you she said i didnt mind mccoy said yes you did she said matteroffactly when she looks into my eyes my knees get weak what did you do in china last thanksgiving i was in a watercooled browning crew he said browning machine gun you mean she asked he was surprised that she knew he nodded i somehow didnt think you were up in cambridge with our host she said i guess thats pretty obvious isnt it she understood his meaning different means different she said not better or worse the door to the sitting room opened and six or seven people came onto the patio and headed for them they sure as hell dont know me which means theyre headed for her probably to take her out of here and if she goes thats the last ill ever see of her prove it mccoy said huh go somewhere else with me mccoy said where she asked warily i dont know mccoy said anywhere you want she was still looking at him thoughtfully when pickerings friends came over to her we wondered what had happened to you one of the girls said were going over to marcys you about ready you go along the most beautiful female mccoy had ever seen said ive other plans she looked into his eyes and smiled he realized that his heart was throbbing like the water hose on a browning three where are you taking me she asked as they walked through the lobby of the foster park i dont know anyplace to take you he said ive never been in new york before i have sort of a strange idea she said chinese food huh i guess your thanksgiving in shanghai speech triggered it she said or maybe im over my ears in turkey youll have to show me he said i dont know anything about this town he said i think we could find a chinese restaurant in chinatown she said lets get a cab he said lets take the subway she said i can afford a cab mccoy said which means of course that you cant i like to watch the people on the subway she said took his arm and headed him toward sixth avenue why he asked you ever been no of course you havent she said youll see his eyes widened at the variations of the species homo sapiens displayed on the subway and they smiled at each other and somehow she wanted to touch him and did and put her arm in his her hand against the rough fabric of his overcoat maybe it is the uniform she thought men in uniform are supposed to get the girls she let herself think about that it was not her style to leave parties with men she had met there especially friends of people like malcolm pickering what was there about this young man that made him different a drunk a young one in a leather jacket and a knitted hat with a pompom walked past them and examined her with approval and something happened to the eyes of the young man whose arm she was holding and my god whose name i dont even know his eyes narrowed just a little but visibly and they brightened and turned alert and menacing she was more than a little frightened my god he is a marine and all i need is to have him get in a fist fight with a drunk on the subway she watched fascinated as the drunk sensed the menace put on a smile and walked further down the car mccoys eyes followed him until he was sure the threat had passed then his eyes moved to her and they changed again the menace disappeared and was replaced by something much softer it was almost as if he was now frightened my god hes afraid of me i dont know your name she said mccoy he said mccoy smith mccoy jones she asked kenneth mccoy he said she took her arm from under his and gave him her hand ernestine sage she said my parents obviously hoped for a boy please dont call me either ernestine or ernie what can i call you kenneth mccoy asked not what do i call you she thought but what can i call you hes asking permission he doesnt want to offend me i dont have to be afraid of him most people call me sage she said sage means wise i know he said she slipped her hand back under his arm and she saw the skin of his neck deepen in color they walked down mott street with her hand very much aware of the warmth of his body even through the overcoat there is a legend that young white women should not come here alone sage said that they will be snatched by white slavers he did not sense that she was teasing him youll be all right he said when she looked into his face he averted his eyes they say the best food is in little places in the alleys sage said that the places on mott street are for tourists the trouble is that they speak only chinese in the little places i speak chinese he said and while she was still wondering whether or not he was trying to pull her leg he led her into one of the alleys fifty feet down it he stopped in front of a glasscovered sign and started to read it hes really very clever if i didnt know better id almost believe he knew what he was looking at see anything you think id like she asked innocently no he said this is a szechuan restaurant most szechuan food is hotter than hell an old chinese woman scampered toward them mccoy spoke to her in chinese sage looked at him in astonishment but there was no question he was really speaking chinese because chattering back at mccoy the old woman reversed direction and led them farther down the street her nephew mccoy explained runs a cantonese restaurant youll like that better i think the restaurant was on the fourth floor of an old building there were no other white people inside and the initial response to the two of them sage thought was resentment even hostility but then mccoy spoke to the man who walked up to them and smiles appeared they were bowed to a table tea was produced and a moment later an egg roll rich with shrimp this is to give us an appetite mccoy said hell i can make a meal of egg rolls then he heard what he had said sorry he said you have to remember im a marine we get in the habit without being around women of talking a little rough hell sage said i dont give a damn if it makes you feel any better cuss as much as you goddamn well please he looked at her without comprehension then he smiled when he smiled like that he looked like a little boy their knees touched under the table he withdrew his as if the contact had burned with a mind of its own seemingly sages foot searched for his when they touched he withdrew again she finally managed to pin his ankle against the table leg now they didnt seem to be able to look at each other there was a steady stream of food very small portions i told him to bring us one of everything he said if you dont like something give it to me what does that oc mean on your collar they call it the oxes he said i suppose it stands for officer candidate youre going to be an officer he nodded wondering if that would surprise her and then hoping it might impress her a little when end of the month he said then what what do you mean then what where will you be stationed i dont know he said i remember its all the corps and therefore it doesnt make any difference right something like that we are both pretending sage thought he is pretending that i am not playing anklesy with him and i am pretending that i am not doing it i cant eat another bite she said after a while i dont even know what ive eaten mccoy said to hell with turkey anyway sage said this is what im going to do from now on on thanksgiving for some reason when they got to the street sage felt a little dizzy this time a cab she said where are we going west third street she said whats there another chinese restaurant i heard about what else she motioned him into her apartment and then closed the door and locked it he roamed the apartment and when he came back she was still leaning on the door i like your apartment he said im glad she said my father calls it my hovel i was afraid you were going to turn out rich like pick would that have bothered you yes he said simply they looked at each other their eyes locking for a long moment i dont know what the hell im doing mccoy said all i know is that i dont want to fuck this up hes so upset that he didnt hear himself otherwise id have got an apology for the fuck and he would have blushed like a tomato neither do i sage said i dont expect you to believe this under the circumstances but neither do i i think maybe i had better go she pushed herself off the door and walked so close to him that she could smell the wet wool odor of his overcoat theres a time and a place for everything she said and this is the time and place where i think you should kiss me if that goes the way i think it will then i think you should pick me up and carry me into the bedroom pick you up he asked incredulously i could crawl i suppose she said he laughed and scooped her up and carried her into the bedroom he lowered her onto the bed and then stood up he still hasnt kissed me all weve done is play anklesy and the way hes standing there with that dumb look on his face nothing is going to happen very deliberately she reached for the hem of her sweater and pulled it over her head he stared at her in marvel she reached behind her back and unhooked her brassiere so that he could look at her naked to the waist now you she said very softly she looked at him then as he ripped the uniform off hes good at that very fast hes probably had a lot of experience taking his clothes off in a hurry in situations like this and then he was naked youre the most beautiful thing i have ever seen he said so are you sage said as mccoy came to the bed and put his arms around her and with a great deal more tenderness than she expected held her tight against him sage thought i wonder if its going to hurt as much as they say it hurts and if there will be a lot of blood and if that will embarrass him four pick was sitting in his underwear having breakfast in the sitting room of penthouse c when mccoy returned been out spreading pollen have you pick said mccoy didnt reply i wondered what the hell had happened to you pickering said i took a chance and ordered breakfast for both of us im not hungry mccoy said but he sat down for a cup of coffee and wound up eating a breakfast steak and a couple of eggs and the half dozen remaining rolls i thought you might take just a little bite pickering said for restorative purposes fuck you mccoy said then you didnt get any pickering said with your wellknown incredible good luck you fell into the clutches of one of our famous cockteasers i got a goddamned cherry mccoy said i didnt know there were any left pickering said without thinking before realizing that mccoy wasnt boasting that quite to the contrary he was ashamed who was she he asked there were two poor people in here yesterday mccoy said i found the other one what has being poor got to do with getting laid pickering asked just looking around i get the idea that poor people spend a lot of time screwing shes a nice girl pick mccoy said and i copped her cherry death pickering said mocking the sonorous tones of the announcer in the march of time newsreels and losing cherries comes inexorably in due time to all men and virgins screw you mccoy said but he was smiling which one was it pickering asked mccoy didnt want to tell pickering her name were going to have lunch he said i will of course vacate the premises pickering said nothing like that goddamn it mccoy said she has to work this morning she said she would meet me for a sandwich someplace called the grand central oyster bar you know where it is oddly enough i do the grand central oyster bar despite the misleading name is in grand central station he stopped himself from saying what popped into his mind that mccoys deflowered virgin had apparently heard of the aphrodisiacal virtues of oysters its right around the comer from brooks brothers she said twelvethirty mccoy asked is that going to give us enough time sure pickering said platoon leader candidates pickering and mccoy were not the first abouttobe commissioned marine officers the salesman at brooks brothers had seen more than that he was pleased to see them not only was it a sale of several hundred dollars more if the customer wanted his uniforms custom made rather than off the rack it was a quick sale none of the salesmans time had to be spent smiling approval as the customer tried on one item after another there were no choices to be made the style was set uniforms gentlemen the salesman said sure one of the marines said i thought it would be a good idea if you remeasured me i have just gone through a rather interesting physical training course and i think i aint what i used to be oh you have an account with us sir yes pickering said but im glad you brought that up this is mr mccoy hes just come from the orient and he doesnt have an account i dont think hes even had time to open a bank account have you ken ive got a bank account mccoy said in any event youll have to open an account for him pickering said im sure that wont be a problem sir the salesman said i didnt catch the name pickering malcolm pickering one moment sir and ill get your measurements the salesman said pickerings measurements were filed together with his account there were coded notations that payment was slow but was always eventually made in full brooks brothers preferred to be paid promptly but they were just as happy to have very large accounts the last order from young mr pickering had been for two dinner jackets three lounge suits one morning coat a dozen shirts a dozen sets of underwear a dozen dress shirts and two pairs of patent leather evening slippers paid whenever it was convenient for the affluent the fitter was summoned mr pickering was an inch and a half larger around the chest than he had been at his last fitting and his acrosstheshoulder measurement had increased by an inch you know what were supposed to have mr pickering asked yes sir well measure him then and we can get out of here mr mccoy has a pressing social engagement when mccoy signed the bill he couldnt quite believe the amount they were to be paid a uniform allowance the uniforms he had just ordered brooks brothers guaranteed their delivery if necessary by special messenger in time for their commissioning were going to cost him just under he had the money in the account at the philadelphia savings fund society but it was absolutely unreal that he was going to pay nearly twice as much for uniforms as he had paid for the lasalle when they were on the street pickering said i debated you getting your uniforms there he said theyre expensive but youre going to need good uniforms in the long run theyre just as cheap if you dont have the dough ill lend it to you i dont need your money hey get off my back get two things straight first that youre my buddy and second that being rich is better than being poor and i have no intention of apologizing to you because i was smart enough to get born to rich people the last shirts i bought cost me sixtyfive cents mccoy said i just bought a dozen at sixninetyfive apiece thats what they call unexpected then you had better be careful with them hadnt you pickering said make a real effort not to spill mustard on them when youre eating a hot dog mccoy smiled at him he found it very difficult to stay sore at pickering for very long its five minutes after twelve mccoy said wheres grand central station yonder pickering said pointing at it do i get to meet your deflowered virgin thats going too fucking far mccoy flared pickering saw icy fury in mccoys eyes for that i apologize he said the ice in mccoys eyes did not go away im sorry ken pickering said you know my mouth well lay off this subject okay okay pickering said i said i was sorry and i meant it if youre free ill be either in the room or call me if youre not otherwise occupied mccoy nodded and then turned and walked toward grand central station pickering watched him halfway down the block he looked over his shoulder as if to check if pickering was following him pickering pretended to be looking for a cab the poor sonofabitch has really got it bad for this broad i wonder who she is a cab stopped and pickering got in grand central he said its right down the street for christs sake pickering handed him five dollars take the long way around he said im in no hurry feeling something like a private detective shadowing a cheating husband he stationed himself in the oyster bar where he felt sure he could see mccoy and the deflowered virgin but they could not see him pickering was twice surprised when the deflowered virgin showed up five minutes early and after a moments hesitation kissed mccoy first impersonally and distantly and then again on the lips looking into his eyes as a woman kisses her lover pick pickering had known ernie sage most of her life he was surprised that she had been a virgin and he was surprised that mccoy thought she was poor there were some people who thought ernie sage had gotten her job with j walter thompson advertising inc because she had graduated summa cum laude from sarah lawrence and there were those who thought it just might be because j walter thompson had the account of american personal pharmaceutical inc which spent fifteen or twenty million a year advertising its wide array of toothpastes mouthwashes and hair lotions the chairman of the board of american personal pharmaceuticals and supposedly its largest stockholder was ernest sage chapter thirteen one us near washington dc hours november they stopped for gas and a hamburger and when they started off again pickering took the wheel what did you think of the met pickering asked what since i didnt see you from the time we walked out of brooks brothers until fivethirty this afternoon i naturally presumed that you had been enriching your mind by visiting the cultural attractions of new york city like the metropolitan museum of art mccoy snorted we did take the staten island ferry he said she said it was the longest ride for a nickel in the world it must have been thrilling pickering said fuck you mccoy said cheerfully since youre so fucking nosy we spent most of the time in her apartment we are now going sixtyeight miles per hour pickering said so what youre driving youll get the ticket not me then he added but maybe you had better slow down a little the corps goes apeshit when people get speeding tickets especially in cars theyre not supposed to have in the first place if you were to slug me i would probably lose control and we would be killed in a flaming crash pickering said mccoy looked at him curiously i mention that because i have something to say to you some thingsplural two and i want you to understand the risk you would be running by taking a poke at me you can say anything you want mccoy said god is in his heaven and all is right with the world ernie sage really got to you huh how do you know her name mccoy demanded suspiciously i followed you pickering said when you met her in grand central i was lurking behind a pillar you sonofabitch mccoy said but he wasnt angry i hope you got an eyeful very touching pickering said romeo and juliet shes really something mccoy said i realize this is none of my business then dont say it mccoy interrupted but since you seem to put such weight on such things i feel obliged to tell you something about her be careful pick mccoy said and there was menace in his voice ernie is named after her father pickering said ernest sage ernest sage is chairman of the board of american personal pharmaceutical so what mccoy said i never even heard of it pickering recited a dozen brand names of american personal pharmaceutical products in other words mccoy said finally catching on shes like you rich the rich say comfortable ken pickering said i dont care what they say mccoy flared rich is rich there was a moments silence and then mccoy said oh goddamn it was a wail of anguish as i have tried to point out being rich is not quite as bad as having leprosy pickering said im sure that if you put your heart in it you could learn to like it she lied to me goddamnit why did she do that mccoy asked pickering knew he hadnt heard what he had told him there is a remote possibility that the lady finds you attractive pickering said marines have that reputation im told she made a fucking fool out of me mccoy said goddamnit she got me to tell her all about norristown norristown about why i went in the corps about my father even about my slob of a sister if she wanted to hear about that then that means shes interested in everything you are whats wrong with that just butt out of this all right now im sorry i told you pickering said if you hadnt i would have made an even bigger fucking fool of myself mccoy said adding a moment later jesus as i said pickering said there is a remote possibility that ernie likes you she doesnt like to be called ernie mccoy said for what you are warts and all pickering continued jesus you just dont understand do you this isnt the first time this has happened to me all she wanted was a stiff prick marines have a reputation for having stiff pricks i think youre dead wrong pickering said fuck what you think i know mccoy said you told me that youpickering paused and then went onwere the first so what that means something to women from what ive seen they can only give it away once ernie chose to give it away to you she decided to get it over with and i was available thats bullshit and you know it she lied to me you dumb fuck a whole line of bullshit about this being her first job right out of school and i thought she meant high school and how they were paying her eighteen fifty a week and thats why her apartment was such a dump thats all true pickering said you know what i mean mccoy said she had to lie to you you dumb fuck pickering said you have this welldeveloped inferiority complex and she was afraid youd crawl back in your hole do me a favor pickering mccoy said just shut your fucking mouth ken i want to keep you from shut your fucking mouth i said the subject is closed pick pickering decided that under the circumstances the only thing to do was shut his fucking mouth two the last week of training in platoon leaders course went just as rapidly as the previous weeks had but far more pleasantly in the words of pick pickering its as if the corps having spent all that time and effort turning us into savages has considered the risks theyd run if they turned us loose on an unsuspecting civilian population and is now engaged in recivilizing us there were several lectures on the manners and deportment expected of marine corps officers and lectures on personal finance management and the importance of preparing a last will and testament there was a lecture on insurance and another on the regulations involved in the travel and transfers of officers they were even taken to the officers club where the intricacies of officer club membership were explained in a handson demonstration they were ushered into the dining room allowed to order whatever struck their fancy from the menu which pickering and mccoy found somewhat disappointing and then shown how to sign the chit commissioned officers and gentlemen do not pay cash in officers clubs afterward before they marched back to the company area a lance corporal at a table outside the dining room permitted them to redeem the chits for cash but they got the idea and they had their first meal as gentlemenif not quite yet officersandgentlemenand were thus free since they had paid for it not to eat it if they didnt like it corporal pleasant had not even marched them over to the officers club platoon leader candidate mccoy had been ordered to do that and there was thus no risk that any of them would be ordered to slurp it up and they were given liberty at night during the last few days from retreat to last call pickering and mccoy went to the slop chute where a pitcher of beer and paper cups were available for a quarter mccoy put away a lot of beer but neither he nor pick pickering got drunk or reopened the subject of miss ernestine sage on wednesday afternoon in time for the retreat formation most of the officer uniforms were delivered the uniform prescribed for the retreat formation was a mixture of officer and enlisted uniforms they could not be permitted to wear officers brimmed caps of course because they were not yet officers but they wore officers blouses and trousers without officertype insignia because the primary purpose of the formation was really to see if the uniforms would fit on friday when they would be sworn in platoon leader candidates pickering and mccoy did not have their officers uniforms on wednesday afternoon when this was discovered by corporal pleasant it afforded him one last opportunity to offer his opinion of the intelligence responsibility and parentage of two of his charges but even after that they were not restricted to the barracks for the evening they got the lasalle one last time from the provost marshals impounding lot and went off the base so that platoon leader candidate pickering could make inquiries of brooks brothers it was a lot of trouble to make a lousy phone call but there were few pay phones available on the base and these generally had long lines waiting to use them and they had to get the car from the impounding compound rather than take a bus because the mps checked passes on buses mccoys properly stickered car and campaign hat got them past the mp at the gate without inspection on thursday morning as the platoon was preparing to march off to rehearse the graduation and swearingin ceremony a blue ford station wagon drove into the company area a large black man emerged from it and addressed corporal pleasant hey mac he called out brooks brothers im looking for mr pickering and mr mccoy even pleasant seemed amused the asshole with the guidon he said is mr mccoy and mr pickering is the tall asshole in the rear rank wave at the nice man mr pickering the man from brooks brothers cheerfully waved back at mr pickering and then began to unload bagwrapped uniforms cartons of shirts and oblong hat boxes from his station wagon he stacked everything on the ground and then sought out mr pickering and mr mccoy to get his receipt signed after the rehearsal as they were unpacking their uniforms and preparing their enlisted mens uniforms to be turned in corporal pleasant entered the barracks attention on deck someone bellowed stand at ease corporal pleasant said and then he went to each man and handed him a quarterinchthick stack of mimeograph paper it was their orders there were three different orders or more precisely three different paragraphs of the same general order the first sent about half of platoon leader class to camp lejeune north carolina for such duty in the field as may be assigned the second sent just about the rest of to san diego california for such duty in the field as may be assigned there were only two names on the third paragraph of the general order it said that the following officers having entered upon active duty at quantico virginia for a period of three years unless further extended by competent authority were further assigned and would proceed to headquarters us marine corps washington dc for such administrative duty as may be assigned what the hell does this mean pickering asked when pleasant had left mccoy had a very good idea what it meant so far as he was concerned but he had no idea what the corps had planned for pickering it means while the rest of these clowns are running around in the boondocks you and i will be sitting behind desks he said at hours friday november platoon leader candidate class fell in for the last time they were wearing the uniforms of second lieutenants us marine corps but corporal pleasant took his customary position and marched them to the parade field the first order of business was to give them the legal right to wear the gold bars on their shoulders they raised their right hands and swore to defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic and to obey the orders of such officers who were appointed over them and that they would discharge the duties of the office upon which they were about to enter to the best of their ability so help them god detail commander front and center harch corporal pleasant barked mccoy to his surprise had been appointed to this role he marched from his position at the left of the rear rank up to corporal pleasant pleasant saluted take the detail sir pleasant said take your post corporal mccoy ordered they exchanged salutes again pleasant did a rightface and marched off to take a position beside the gunny and the first sergeant just to the right of the reviewing stand mccoy did an aboutface right face he ordered and then fowward harch he gave them a column right and then another and when they got to the proper position relative to the reviewing stand bellowed eyes right and raised his hand to the brim of his new brooks brothers cap marine officers with the cord loops sewn to its crown at the moment he issued the command the quantico band which had been silent except for the ticktick beat of its drummers to give them the proper marching cadence burst into the marine corps hymn and the moment second lieutenant pickering usmcr snapped his head to he right he saw two familiar faces on the reviewing stand his father and his mother on the goddamned reviewing stand not with the other parents and wives and whoever had showed up for the graduation parade on the goddamned reviewing stand the officers on the reviewing stand returned mccoys hand salute eyes front mccoy ordered when he judged the last file of the formation had passed the reviewing stand he marched them back to where they had originally been the officers marched off the reviewing stand in order of rank when the colonel got to mccoy mccoy saluted put your detail at rest lieutenant the colonel ordered puh rade rest they moved their feet the prescribed distance apart and put their hands and arms rigidly in the small of their backs congratulations the colonel said to mccoy welcome to the officer corps of the us marine corps he shook his hand and simultaneously handed him a rolledup tube of paper which contained his diploma and his commission then leaving mccoy at parade rest the colonel trailed by his entourage went down the ranks and repeated the process exactly for each man finally the entourage returned to the reviewing stand lieutenant the colonel called you may dismiss these gentlemen mccoy saluted did an aboutface and barked attenhut dismissed just stood there for a moment as if unwilling to believe that it was actually over and that they were now in law and fact commissioned officers and gentlemen of the united states marine corps and then one of them yelped probably mccoy thought that flatfaced asshole from texas am who was always making strange noises that broke the trance and they started shaking hands and pounding each other on the back captain jack nmi stecker walked off the reviewing stand and then across the field to mccoy as he approached mccoy pickering started for the reviewing stand mccoy wondered where the hell he was going but with stecker advancing on him there was no chance to ask he saluted stecker who offered his hand despite what some people think of china marines lieutenant stecker said every once in a while some of them make pretty good officers i think you will thank you sir mccoy said i thought you might need a ride to the impounding compound stecker said i got the car last night sir he said then in that case mccoy just good luck he offered his hand they exchanged salutes and stecker walked away mccoy saw that most of had formed a line by the reviewing stand corporal pleasant was saluting each one of them they then handed him a dollar it was a tradition fuck him mccoy decided pleasant had been entirely too willing to kick him when he was down and he wasnt even that good a corporal im not going to give the sonofabitch a dollar to have him salute me hell head right for the nco club with it and sit around making everybody laugh with stories about the incompetent assholes the corps had just made officers and then he saw that pick pickering was not in the line he was standing with a couple the man well dressed the woman in a fulllength fur coat obviously picks folks had come to see their son graduate mccoy started to walk back to the company area pickering ran after him and caught up with him i want you to meet my mother and dad pick said wouldnt i be in the way dont be an asshole asshole pick said and grabbed mccoys arm and propelled him in the direction of the reviewing stand i didnt see you giving pleasant his dollar pickering said i didnt mccoy said just because were now wearing bars doesnt make him any less of a vicious asshole my you do hold a grudge dont you lieutenant pickering said you bet your ass i do mccoy said fleming pickering smiled and put his hand out as they walked up i knew who you were of course he said sir mccoy asked confused one marine corporal can always spot another even in a sea of clowns fleming pickering said pleased with himself flem mrs pickering protested she smiled at mccoy and gave him her hand youll have to excuse my husband his being a marine corporal was the one big thrill of his life im pleased to finally meet you ken i can call you ken maynt i malcolms written so much about you yes maam mccoy said i would like nothing better fleming pickering said than to sit over a long lunch and have you tell me how you shepherded the lieutenant here around the boondocks but we have a plane to catch id forgotten about that pick said this time tomorrow we will be high above the blue pacific fleming pickering said bound for sunny hawaii i was originally going by myself but then some scoundrel told my wife about the girls in the grass skirts i wasnt worried about the hulahula girls picks mother replied what concerned me was the way you behave on a ship if they serve eight meals a dayand pacificorient doesand i wasnt along youd eat all eight of them and theyd have to take you off the ship in a wheelbarrow youre coming back by ship pick asked i thought you were flying both ways no picks father said i put off the meeting in san francisco until the twentieth that way we can board ship in honolulu on the tenth and still make it back in plenty of time pick nodded his understanding mccoy finally figured out what they were talking about he had been a little impressed that picks parents would come all the way to virginia just to see him get sworn in but so far as they were concerned that was like a trip to the corner drugstore for cigarettes they were about to fly to hawaii the only thing that had surprised pick about that was they werent going to fly both ways pick and his family were people from a different world a world like ernestine sages a world where i dont belong even with a gold bar on my collar three washington dc hours november before pickerings parents had showed up it had been understood between mccoy and pickering that immediately after they were sworn in they would drive to washington the lasalle was already loaded with their luggage he had been sure that would change because of his parents but that hadnt happened pick shook hands with his father allowed himself to be kissed by his mother and then the pickerings left taking trips halfway around the world was obviously routine stuff for them pick and mccoy as originally planned then simply backed from the parade field to where mccoy had parked the lasalle by the barracks got in and drove off there were no farewell handshakes with the others in because he had been on pleasants and the gunnys shit list the others had most of the time avoided mccoy as if he were a leper and they had avoided pickering too because he was mccoys buddy and there had been whispers at the end about the two of them getting administrative duty in washington rather than in the field at lejeune and san diego pickering thought about this as they got in the lasalle if somewhere down the pike class sent him an invitation to its twentieth reunion he would send his regrets this time they were stopped by the mp at the gate first the mp waved them through then he saw the bars and saluted and finally he stepped into the road in front of them with his hand up he saluted as mccoy rolled down the window excuse me sir is this your car yes it is mccoy said its got an enlisted decal sir thats because until about twenty minutes ago i was enlisted mccoy said the mp smiled broadly i thought that was you he said admiringly you been sneaking in and out of here all the time you was in the platoon leader course havent you how could you even suspect such a thing mccoy asked the mp came to attention and saluted you may pass out sir he said thank you sir a minute later after they had left the base mccoy said i guess i better stop someplace and scrape that sticker off and then what what do you mean then what what are we going to do when we get to washington i thought youd be taking some leave mccoy said no pickering said id rather report in i want to find out whats planned for me how exactly do we do that today is a day of duty mccoy explained patiently we get a days travel time to washington that carries us up through midnight tomorrow so long as we report in by midnight on sunday that makes sunday a day of duty so about eleven oclock sunday night well find out where it is youre not going home pickering asked and when mccoy shook his head went on or to new york no mccoy said stiffly i thought maybe youd come to your senses about going to new york pickering said you miss the point mccoy said i have come to my senses and thats the end of that particular subject okay so well go to the lafayette pickering said its a little stuffy but it has a very nice french restaurant another hotel you own grandpa owns it actually pickering said its right across from the white house do you suppose you can find the white house without a map lieutenant no ive never been in washington before and i dont have a map and im not going to sponge again off you or your grandpa mccoy said very well pickering said i will stay in the lafayette and you can stay in whatever fleabag with hotandcold running cockroaches strikes your fancy just so long as i know where to find you when it is time for us to go to the marine barracks and sign in i hate to tell you this lieutenant you being an officer and a gentleman and all but you have a great talent for being a horses ass mccoy laughed youre sure you want to sign in early he asked it may be a long time until they offer you any leave again i need to know what this administrative duty is all about pickering said i dont like the sound of it whats the difference mccoy asked whatever it is theyre not offering you a choice indulge me pickering said take me along with you so that you can explain things to me and for christs sake stop being an ass about being comped in one of our hotels being what comped pickering explained complimentary accommodations its part of the business if you work for foster hotels youre entitled to stay in foster hotels when youre away from home i dont work for foster hotels mccoy argued thats all right youre with me pickering said and i am the apple of grandpas eye will you stop being an ass it makes me uncomfortable mccoy said so do you when you pick your nose pickering said but if you agree to stay in grandpas hotel you can pick your nose all you want and i wont say a thing the doorman at the lafayette knew pickering by sight he rushed around and opened the door with all the pomp shown a respected guest but what he said was jesus pick are you for real or is there a costume party you are speaking sir to an officer and a gentleman of the us marine corps pickering said you will not have to prostrate yourself kneeling will suffice he turned to mccoy ken say hello to jerry toltz another old pal of mine we bellhopped here all through one hot long miserable summer how long are you going to be here the doorman asked i dont know probably some time they know youre coming i dont think so pickering said i thought i would have heard jerry toltz said the house is full pick we need someplace to stay pickering said well if they dont have anything for you you and your pal can stay with me theres a convertible couch thank you pickering said will you be needing the car yeah pickering said im glad you asked dont bury it we have to go out thats presuming you can get in the doorman said and motioned for a bellboy and told him to park the car in the alley the man behind the reception desk also knew malcolm pickering he gave him his hand you will be professionally delighted to hear the house is full he said personally that may not be such good news how are you its good to see you your granddad told me you were in the marines good to see you pickering said this is my friend ken mccoy they shook hands how long have you been an officer the manager asked it must be four five hours now pickering said and i dont have a bed for you all i can do is call around the sheraton owes me a couple of big favors what about maids room in the bridal suite theres only a single in there the manager protested put in a cot then pickering said ill sleep on that ill probably be able to find something for you tomorrow the manager said lieutenant mccoy and i are going to be here for some time pickering said what about one of the residential hotels i really hate to comp if we can rent it theres a waiting list for every residential room in washington the manager said if you dont want to sleep on a park bench youll have to stay here ill come up with a bedsitter for you in a day or two unless you need two bedrooms lieutenant mccoy and i will not know how to handle the luxury of a bedsitter we have been sharing one room with thirty others you want to go up now no what we want to do now is locate the marine barracks the manager drew them a map they arrived at the marine barracks coincidentally just as the regularly scheduled friday evening formal retreat parade was beginning the music was provided by the marine corps band in dress blues its like a wellchoreographed ballet pickering thought as he watched the ceremony the intricacies of which were now familiar progress with incredible precision ill be damned mccoy thought these guys are really as good as theyre supposed to be there were marines in dress blues stationed at intervals around the manicured grass of the parade ground their primary purpose mccoy saw was more practical than decorative from time to time one or more of them had to restrain eager tourists from rushing out onto the field to take a snapshot of the marching and drilling troops or just to get a better look when the marine band had finally marched off the perimeter guard near them a lance corporal left his post when he came to pickering and mccoy he saluted snappily good evening sir he barked good evening mccoy heard himself say something bothered him after a moment he realized what it was when the kid had tossed him the highball he had done so automatically the kid had seen a couple of officers and he had saluted them there had been nothing in his eyes that suggested he suspected he was saluting a china marine corporal in a lieutenants uniform i really am an officer mccoy thought until right now it was sort of playacting but now its real when that kid saluted me i felt like an officer well this is the place to have it happen he thought at the marine barracks in washington after a formal retreat parade with the smell of the smoke from the retreat cannon still in my nose and the ticktick of the drums of the marine band fading as it marches away four on saturday pickering and mccoy drove around washington pickering was at first amused at the notion of playing tourist but then he realized it wasnt so bad after all he saw more of washington with mccoy than hed seen during the entire summer hed spent bellhopping at the lafayette and he came to understand that mccoy was doing more than satisfying an idle curiosity he was reconnoitering the terrain he wasnt sure if it was intentional but there was no question thats what it was it occurred to him again as it had several times at quantico that mccoy was really an odd duck in society as for example a jesuit priest is an odd duck they werent really like the other ducks swimming around on the lake they swam with a purpose answering commands not heard by other people a jesuits course through the waters of life was guided by god mccoys by what he believedconsciously or subconsciouslywas expected of him by the marine corps they spent most of sunday at the smithsonian institution and again pickering was pleased that they had come he was surprised at the emotion he felt when he saw the tiny little airplane charles lindbergh had flown to paris and when he was standing before the faded and torn flag that had flown in the rockets red glare over fort mchenry at half past ten on sunday night pickering was still not fully accustomed to thinking in military time and had to do the arithmetic in his head to come up with second lieutenants m pickering and kj mccoy presented their orders to the duty officer at the marine barracks and held themselves ready for duty your reporting in early is probably going to screw things up with personnel the officer of the day said ill send word over there that youre here and theyll call you at the boq bachelor officers quarters were in a hotel in town pickering said okay probably even better as youll find out the corps is scattered all over town what hotel the lafayette pickering said very nice the officer of the day said whats the room number i dont know pickering said and started to smile then how do you know where to sleep when you get there the officer of the day asked sarcastically actually were in the bridal suite pickering said and then quickly he added in the maids room off the bridal suite at the next morning the telephone in the maids room of the bridal suite rang it was a captain from personnel lieutenant pickering was ordered to report as soon as he could get there to brigadier general dg mclnerney whose office was in building f at the anacostia naval air station before mccoys reconnoitering over the weekend pickering had only a vague idea where anacostia naval air station was now he knew he even knew where to find building f he had seen the building numbersor rather building lettersin front of the office buildings there lieutenant mccoy was to report to a major almond in room building t one of the temporary buildings in front of the smithsonian they knew where that was too as a result of mccoys daylong scoping of the terrain you drop me there mccoy said i can walk back here anacostias to hell and gone pickering found building f without difficulty it was one of several buildings immediately behind the row of hangars three minutes later to his considerable surprise he was standing at attention before the desk of brigadier general dg mclnerney usmc unable to believe that a brigadier general of marines would have thirty seconds to spare for a second lieutenant he had simply presumed that whatever they were going to have him do here his orders would come from a first lieutenant general mclnerney looked like a general there were three rows of ribbons on his tunic below the gold wings of a naval aviator he didnt have much hair and what there was of it was cut so close to the skull that the bumps and the freckles on the skin were clearly visible the general pickering decided as he stood at attention was not very friendly and he was unabashedly studying him with interest so youre malcolm pickering general mclnerney said finally you must take after your mother you dont look at all like your dad pickering was so startled that for a moment his eyes flickered from their prescribed focus six inches over the generals head you may sit mr pickering general mclnerney said would you like some coffee yes sir pick pickering said thank you sir a sergeant appeared apparently in reply to the pushing of an unseen buzzer button this is lieutenant pickering sergeant wallace general mclnerney said he will probably be around here for a while the sergeant offered his hand how do you do sir he said lieutenant pickerings father and i were in the war to end all wars together general mclnerney said dryly is that so the sergeant said and the lieutenants father called me and for auld lang syne sergeant wallace asked me to take care of his boy and of course i said i would i understand sir pickering felt sick and furious i think we can start off by getting the lieutenant a cup of coffee aye aye sir sergeant wallace said how would you like your coffee lieutenant black please pickering said aye aye sir you get fixed up all right with a boq general mclnerney inquired or are you perhaps staying in a hotel a foster hotel im in the lafayette sir i thought you might be general mclnerney said i mean what the hell if your family owns hotels how many hotels does your family own lieutenant there are fortytwo sir pick said what the hell if your family owns fortytwo hotels why not stay in one of them right theres certainly no room service in the boq is there no sir the coffee was delivered thank you sergeant pickering said certainly sir sergeant wallace said i guess it took a little getting used to not having someone to fetch coffee for you at quantico i mean general mclnerney asked yes sir pickering said well at least here youll have sergeant wallace and several other enlisted men around for that sort of thing it wont be quite like home but it will be a little better than running around in the boondocks with a rifle platoon yes sir pickering said its not quite what the corps had in mind for you general mclnerney said but ive arranged for you to be my junior aidedecamp how does that sound permission to speak frankly sir pickering asked of course general mclnerney said my father had no right to ask you to do anything for me pickering said i knew nothing about it if i had any idea that he was even thinking about something like that i would have told him to keep his nose out of my business is that so general mclnerney said doubtfully yes sir pickering said fervently thats so and with respect sir i do not want to be your aidedecamp i dont recall asking whether or not you wanted to be my aide i presented that as a fact i have gone to considerable trouble arranging for it sir i feel that i would make you a lousy aide you are now a marine officer when a marine officer is told to do something he is expected to reply aye aye sir and set about doing it to the best of his ability i am aware of that sir pick said but i didnt think it would ever be applied in a situation where the order was to pass canapes youre telling me that you would prefer to be running around in the swamp at camp lejeune to being the aide of a general officer general mclnerney asked on the edge of indignation yes sir thats exactly my position pickering said i respectfully request that i not be assigned as your aide i am sorry to tell you lieutenant general mclnerney said that i have no intention of going back to headquarters usmc and tell them that i have now changed my mind and dont want you as my aide after all as i said arranging for your assignment as my aide wasnt easy he waited until that had a moment to sink in and then went on so where would you say that leaves us lieutenant it would appear sir pick said that until i am able to convince the general that he has made an error the general will have a very reluctant aidedecamp general mclnerney snorted and then he chuckled lieutenant you are a brandnew officer could you take a little advice from one who has been around the corps a long time yes sir dont jump until you know where youre jumping from and where youre going to land general mclnerney said in other words until you have all the intelligence you can get your hands on and have time to evaluate it carefully yes sir pick said annoyed that he was getting a lecture on top of everything else in this case the facts as i presented them to you seem to have misled you sir your dad is indeed concerned about you and he did in fact call me and ask me to look after you but what he was concerned about was the possibility that some chairwarmer would review your records see what you did as a civilian and assign you appropriately he said he didnt want you to spend your hitch in the corps as a mess officer or a housing officer and when i checked thats exactly what those sonsofbitches had in mind for you if i had not gone over there lieutenant and had you assigned to me you would have reported for duty this morning to the officers club at the barracks picks eyes widened so because your dad and i are old buddieswe were corporals together at belleau woodi am protecting your ass i think you would make a lousy aide too you will be my junior aide only until such time as i decide what else the corps can do with you i seem to have made an ass of myself sir pickering said we sort of expect that from second lieutenants general mclnerney said reasonably the only thing you really did wrong was underestimate your father did you really think he would try to grease the ways for you my father is married to my mother sir pickering said i take your point general mclnerney said i have the privilege of your mothers acquaintance may i ask a question sir sure was my moving into the hotel a real blunder not so far as im concerned general mclnerney said i understand your situation i was thinking of my best friend i suppose is the best way to decribe him i sort of pressured him to move in with me i see mclnerney said another hotelier classmate at school no sir he was a china marine a corporal before we went through the platoon leaders course mclnerney thought that over a moment before he replied i think it might be a good idea if he moved into the boq he said there would certainly be curiosity it could even turn into an intelligence matter where would a second lieutenant an exchina marine enlisted man get the money to take a room in the lafayette it could be explained of course but the last thing a second lieutenant needs is to have it getting around that intelligence is asking questions about his personal life thank you sir pickering said i was afraid it might be something like that may i ask another question shoot how long will i be assigned here i mean you said something about deciding what to do with me how long will that take that depends on what you would like to do and whether or not youre qualified to do it presumably you learned at quantico that leading a platoon of riflemen is not quite the fun and games the recruiter may have painted it yes sir have you ever thought of going to flight school general mclnerney asked no sir pickering confessed general mclnerney was a little disappointed to hear that but decided that fleming pickerings kid meant what he said that he simply had not thought of going to flight schoolnot that he had considered the notion and discarded it because he didnt like the idea of flying thats an option general mclnerney said but only if you could pass the flight physical on your way out have sergeant wallace set up an appointment for a flight physical and then take the rest of the day off son and get yourself settled im talking about your friend too of course ill check out of the hotel too of course pickering said dont do it on my account general mclnerney said so far as im concerned id be delighted to have you in there in case my wife and i wanted to make reservations for dinner general mclnerney stood up and offered his hand welcome aboard he said youre your fathers son and thats intended as a compliment chapter fourteen one room temporary building t washington dc hours december mccoy had seen quite a few office doors during his time in the corps most of them had a sign announcing in some detail not only what function was being carried out behind the door but by whom the door to room didnt even have a room number mccoy had to find it by counting upward from room number which had a sign officer s head he thought hed gotten it wrong even then for what he thought was room had two sturdy locks on ita storeroom in other words full of mimeograph paper and quart bottles of ink but with no other option that he could think of he knocked on it as soon as he knocked however he heard movement inside then the sound of deadbolt locks being operated and a moment later the door opened just wide enough to reveal the face of a grimlooking man he said nothing but the expression on his face asked mccoy to state his business im looking for room mccoy said the man nodded waiting for mccoy to go on i was ordered to report to room mccoy said whats your name please the man asked mccoy may i see your identification please the man asked mccoy handed over his brandnew officers identification card the man looked at it carefully then at mccoys face and then opened the door wide enough for mccoy to enter inside was a small area just enough for a desk on the other side of the room there was another door again with double deadbolt locks when the man walked to the telephone on the desk mccoy saw that he had a colt a on his hip on his tail really and not in a gi holster but in sort of a skeleton holster through which the front part of the pistol stuck out if he was wearing a jacket mccoy thought youd never know he had a pistol i have lieutenant mccoy here the man said to the telephone hes not due in until december there was a pause well shit i suppose everybodys been told but us what does he get there was obviously a reply but mccoy couldnt hear it the man put the telephone down and then reached into his desk and came out with a clipboard and a small plastic card affixed to an alligator clip sign here please he said just your signature not your rank mccoy signed his name the man handed him the plastic card you use this until we get you your own he said pin it on your blouse jacket mccoy looked at it before he pinned it on it was a simple piece of plasticcovered cardboard it said visitor and there was the insignia of the navy department it was overprinted with purple stripes thats good anywhere in the building the man said or almost everywhere but its not good for oni office of naval intelligence until you get your credentials youd better avoid going over to oni okay mccoy said wondering what was going on the man stuck out his hand im sergeant ruttman he said we didnt expect you until the fifteenth so i heard you say mccoy said you just went through that course at quantico right thats right mccoy said pain in the ass yes it was mccoy said they want to send me sergeant ruttman said but ive been putting off going i figure if they really want me to take a commission they can give it to me i already know about chickenshit good luck mccoy said wondering if ruttman was just running off at the mouth or whether he was telling the truth ruttman replaced the clipboard in his desk and then took keys from his pocket and unlocked both of the locks in the door follow me he said beyond the door was a strange assortment of machinery there were typewriters and other standard office equipment but there were also cameras what mccoy guessed was a blueprint machine a large photograph print dryer a stainlesssteeldrum affair larger than a desk and a good deal of other equipment that looked expensive and complicated mccoy couldnt even guess the purpose of some of it the equipment was being manned by a strangelooking assortment of people all in civilian clothes and all of them armed most of them had standard web belts and issue flapped holsters for the lals they carried but some carried the pistols the way ruttman carried his and others were armed with snubnosed smith wesson revolvers what is this place sergeant the thing youre going to have to keep in mind lieutenant is that its just like boot camp at parris island if they think you should know something theyll tell you otherwise its none of your business he turned his attention from mccoy to the drawer of a desk he took a looseleaf notebook from it and two blank forms one of them a card with purple stripes like his visitor badge and the other a navy identification card of some sort before i fuck things up he called out raising his voice has anybody made out any of these and not logged them in the book there was no response to the inquiry and he put both identification cards in a typewriter and typed briefly and rapidly on them i need an officer to sign these he called out again and one of the civilians a slight tall man walked to the desk despite the smith wesson snubnose revolver on his hip he looked like a clerk he waited until ruttman finished typing and then took the card from him and scrawled his name on it then he looked at mccoy youre mccoy he asked yes sir not that im not glad to see you but you werent due to report in until the fifteenth i reported in early sir youll regret that the officer said abandon hope all ye who enter here he walked back where he had come from mccoy saw that he was making notations on a large map next to the map were aerial photographs and a stack of teletype paper liberally stamped secret in large letters you want to sign this lieutenant sergeant ruttman asked there was space for two signatures on the identification the holder and the issuing officer the tall skinny civilian had already signed it according to the card he was lieutenant colonel fl rickabee usmc he sure as christ didnt look like any lieutenant colonel mccoy had ever seen before he didnt even look much like a marine just your signature again ruttman said no rank you didnt give me back my id card mccoy said you dont get it back ruttman said and then apparently had doubts he raised his voice does he get his id card back no the tall thin man who looked like a clerk called back not anymore they changed the policy as if mccoy hadnt heard the exchange ruttman said you dont get it back lieutenant the tall skinny clerktype had another thought and turned from his map and secret teletype messages how long is it going to take to get him his credentials im just about to take his picture ruttman said today you mean hell get his credentials today hell have them by lunchtime ruttman said confidently okay the clerktype said and returned his attention to the map based on the total absence of military courtesy ruttman had not once said sir much less aye aye sir to him and the clerktype hadnt seemed to care mccoy decided that the clerktype was not lieutenant colonel fl rickabee usmc it was common practice for junior officers to sign senior officers names to routine forms sometimes initialing the signature and sometimes not he went further with his theory the tall skinny clerk was probably a warrant officer warrant officers were oldtime noncoms generally with some special skill they wore officers uniforms could go to the officers club and were entitled to a salute but the most senior chief warrant officer ranked below the most junior second lieutenant and a warrant officer particularly a new one would probably not get all excited if an oldtime noncom like ruttman didnt treat him as if he was a lieutenant or a captain ruttman stood mccoy against a backdrop at which was pointed a speed graphic fourbyfiveinch plate camera take off your blouse and your field scarf and the bars ruttman ordered and put this on he handed mccoy a soiled wellworn striped necktie mccoy looked at him in disbelief the way ill shoot this ruttman explained that shirtll look just like an arrow he took mccoys picture twice to make sure i get it then led him to a table where he inked his fingers he put his thumb print on both of the id cards and then took another full set on a standard fingerprint card ruttman handed him a towel and bottle of alcohol to clean his hands and then said thats it here lieutenant now you go see major almond hes in the last office down the passageway there was no sign hanging on major jj almonds door either but aside from that he was what mccoy expected a marine major to be he was a short man but muscular and so erect he seemed taller than he was and he was in uniform his desk was shipshape and two flags were on poles behind his desk the marine flag and the national colors and to the left of major almonds desk was a door with another sign lt col fl rickabee usmc commanding it was clear to mccoy now that hed just gone through some sort of administrative service office where they made out id cards and did that sort of thing and that he was now about to face his new commanding officer let me say mccoy major jj almond said that i appreciate your appearance you look and conduct yourself as a marine officer should as you may have noticed there is a lamentable tendency around here to let things slip because of what we do here we cant run this place like a line company but we go too far i think far too often i am going to rely on you lieutenant to both set an example for the men and to correct on the spot whomever you see failing to live up to the standards of the corps aye aye sir mccoy said now before we get started you reported in early yes sir you are entitled to a fourteenday leave if it is your intention to apply for that leave now that you have reported aboard i would like to know that now no sir youre in the boq at the barracks i presume no sir where are you in a hotel sir i dont want to go through this mccoy pulling one fact after another from you im in the hotel lafayette sir sharing a room with another officer sir lieutenant malcolm pickering sir well that is fortuitous major almond announced it is the policy of this command that both officer and enlisted personnel live off the base you will draw pay in lieu of quarters will that pay be enough to pay for your hotel room yes sir whats your room number almond asked and ill need the hotel telephone number i dont know the phone number sir mccoy said were living in the maids room of the bridal suite sir major almond smiled and nodded approvingly very enterprising he said i wondered how you could afford to live in the lafayette he reached into his desk drawer and came out with a threeinchthick manila folder he saw his name lettered on it and that it was stamped secretcomplete background investigation this is the report of the fbis investigation of you lieutenant he said it is classified secret and you are not authorized access to it i show it to you to show how carefully they have gone into your background mccoy had no idea what was going on major almond then handed him a printed form in normal circumstances the procedure would have been for you to complete this form before the fbi did its complete background check but the circumstances have not been normal time was important the fbi had to so to speak start from scratch using existing records so what has happened is that i have had our clerks prepare your background statement using existing records and the fbi report are you following me lieutenant yes sir mccoy said i think so sir the standing operating procedure requires that your completed background statement be in the files major almond said now while i am sure that the fbi has done their usual thorough job i am nearly as sure that they have missed something what i want you to do is take your background statement to the desk over there and go over it with great care if there is anything on it that is not absolutely correct i want you to mark it we will then discuss it more important i want you to pay particular attention to omissions particularly of a nonflattering nature sir i want you to make sure that all the blemishes on your record are visible major almond said the next step in the administrative procedure is to evaluate your record and judge whether or not you are qualified to be granted a top secret and other security clearances if it came out later that there are blemishes which do not appear on the record that would cause trouble do you understand yes sir the sergeant will give you a lined pad and pencils major almond said make your notations on the lined pad not on the form aye aye sir mccoy said work steadily but carefully major almond said time is of the essence aye aye sir mccoy wondered if they had found out that hed been under charges in shanghai about the italian marines and whether or not he should tell them if they werent the charges had been dropped did that mean they didnt count was getting charged with murder a blemish if they dropped the charges he sat down at the desk and looked at the form it was immediately apparent that they knew more about him than he knew himself he didnt know his mothers date of birth or his fathers but they were in the blocks on the form and so were annemaries and tommys and even annemaries husbands two an hour later he had worked his way through the sixpage form to a section headed arrests detentions indictments charges et cetera they knew about the charges in china not prosecuted initial facts in error and they knew about the old man signing the warrant for his arrest nol prossed on condition enlistment usmc and they knew about speeding tickets reckless driving and even two charges of malicious mischief and being found in possession of a daisy red ryder bb gun in violation of the city ordinances of norristown pa nol prossed bb gun confiscated released in custody of parents it was absolutely incredible how much they knew about i him he wondered what was going to happen when whoever previewed his records came to the business about the marines in china was that going to keep him from getting a security clearance the door opened and the tall skinny clerktype walked in without knocking mccoy saw in the same moment major almond rose to his feet he is about to get his ass eaten out the clerktype walked toward the door of lieutenant colonel fl rickabee and put his hand on the knob for all intents and purposes he looked as if he was going to barge in there too without knocking then he stopped turned to mccoy and smiled come on in mccoy he said whatever that is itll wait then he looked at major almond what the hell is that he demanded sir its lieutenant mccoys background statement isnt that a waste of his time rickabee demanded sharply and ours when i read the fbi report i had the feeling they knew everything there is to know about him major almond seemed to have difficulty framing a reply i know jake colonel rickabee said more kindly its regulation yes sir come on in mccoy and you too jake itll save time aye aye sir major almond said rickabee sat down behind his desk for openers mccoy despite that inexcusable outburst of mine let me make it clear that major almond is what keeps this lashup of ours functioning without him it would be complete rather than seventyfive percent chaos i didnt mean to jump your ass jake ive had a bad morning yes sir i know sir major almond said no apology is necessary sir colonel rickabee turned to mccoy with a threeinchthick fbi report on you in major almonds safe mccoy we wont have to waste much time asking and answering questions about your background and in addition to the official report i have two personal reports on you you made one hell of an impression on the boss in philadelphia sir mccoy asked you apparently delivered quite a lecture on the high state of discipline in the imperial japanese army and how they were going to be formidable foes since the one true test of an intelligent man is how much he agrees with you the boss thinks youre a genius the boss sir the chief of intelligence rickabee said you dont know what im talking about do you no sir let it pass then rickabee said smiling newly commissioned second lieutenants should not be praised it tends to swell their heads i had another personal report on you just a week ago ed banning wrote me from manila you knew that the fourth has been shipped to the philippines no sir i didnt banning said that he thought i should have you transferred to this lashup and that i should consider somewhere down the line even sending you to officer candidate school mccoy didnt know how to respond in japanese colonel rickabee said i understand youre reasonably fluent in japanese and chinese i wouldnt say fluent sir say it in japanese rickabee interrupted i cant read very much japanese sir mccoy said in japanese and my chinese isnt much better rickabee nodded approvingly thats good enough he continued in japanese and then switched to english we can use that talent but theres a question of priorities when we knew you were coming here mccoy what we planned to do with you was to have you replace sergeant ruttman i want to run him through quantico too he thinks hes been successfully evading it the truth is that i needed somebody to take his place while he was gone you seemed ideal to do that youre a hardnose and it would give you a chance to see how things are done here but the bestlaid plans as they say there are higher priorities specifically the boss has levied on usand i mean the boss personally not one of his stafffor three officer couriers were moving a lot of paper back and forth between here and pearl and here and manila especially now that the fourth is in the philippines youre elected as one of the three mccoy sir i dont know what an officer courier is there are some highly classified documents and sometimes material that have to pass from hand to hand from a specific officer here to a specific officer someplace elseas opposed to headquarters to headquarters that material has to be transported by an officer yes sir mccoy said theres one other factor in the equation rickabee said the pacificespecially pearl harbor but cavite toohas been playing dirty pool we have sent officer couriers out there with the understanding that they would make one trip and then return to their primary duty what pearl has done twice and cavite once is to keep our couriers and send the homewardbound mail in the company of an officer they didnt particularly need we have lost two cryptographic officers and one very good intercept officer that way mccoy knew that a cryptographic officer dealt with secret codes but he had no ideas what an intercept officer was ive complained of course and eventually well get them back after everything has moved slowly through channels but i cant afford to lose people for sixty ninety days not now so there had to be a solution and major almond found it mccoy said nothing arent you even curious mccoy rickabee asked yes sir every officer in the marine corps is required to obey the orders of any officer superior to him right yes sir if the orders conflict he is required to obey the orders given him by the most senior officer right yes sir wrong rickabee said or at least there is an interesting variation there is a small generally unknown group of people in the corps who dont have to obey the orders of superior officers unless that officer happens to be the chief of intelligence their ranks arent even known just their name and photo and thumbprint is on their id cards and the id cards say that the bearer is a special agent of the assistant chief of staff intelligence usmc and subject only to his orders yes sir congratulations lieutenant mccoy you are nowor you will be when ruttman finishes your credentialsa special agent of the assistant chief of staff for intelligence if anybody at pearl or cavite knows or finds out that you speak japanese and decides they just cant afford to lose you you will show them your identification and tell them you are sorry but you are not subject to their orders rickabee saw the confusion on mccoys face question mccoy am i going to pearl harbor sir and cavite rickabee said more important i think you will be coming back from pearl and cavite and you can get away with giving me one of these cards for the time being rickabee said when they catch us im sure major almond will think of something else clever let me make it clear lieutenant mccoy major almond said that the identification and the authority that goes with it is perfectly legitimate the personnel engaged in counterespionage activity who are issued such credentials are under this office major almond pointed out to me mccoy that i had the discretionary authority to issue as many of them as i saw fit yes sir we dont wish to call attention to the fact that people like you will have them rickabee said for obvious reasons you will travel in uniform on regular travel orders and you will not show the identification unless you have to you understand that yes sir i dont know how long well have to keep you doing this mccoy colonel rickabee said we have a certain priority for personnel but so do other people and that fbi background check takes time and the fbi is overloaded with them youll just have to take my word for it that as soon as i can get you off messengerboy duty and put you to work doing something useful to us i will yes sir whats his schedule jake rickabee asked well today of course there are administrative things to do get him a pistol get his orders cut that may run into tomorrow morning hell need some time to get his personal affairs in order but theres no reason he cant leave here on wednesday night thursday morning at the latest presuming theres not fifty people ahead of him in san francisco also with aaa priority that should put him in pearl no later than monday december eighth and into manila on the tenth is that cutting it too close for you mccoy colonel rickabee asked no sir mccoy said immediately rickabee nodded take him to lunch at the armynavy club jake colonel rickabee ordered sign my name to the chit aye aye sir major almond said i like to do that myself rickabee said turning to mccoy we dont have time for many customs of the service around here but when i can i like to have a newly reportedaboard officer to dinner or at least take him to lunch but i just dont have the time today wont have it before you go to pearl im really sorry then he stood up and offered his hand welcome aboard mccoy he said im sorry your first assignment is such a lousy one but it happens sometimes that way in the corps he headed out of his office and then stopped at the door get him out of the boq before he goes he said if theres no time to find a place for him have his gear brought here and well stow it while hes gone until we can find something hes got a room in the lafayette sir ill be damned colonel rickabee said but then ed banning did say i would find you extraordinary for some reason mccoy thought it was no longer hard to think of fl rickabee as a lieutenant colonel of marines three second lieutenant malcolm pickering usmcr was sitting in the maids rooms sole armchair his feet up on the cot when second lieutenant kenneth j mccoy usmcr carrying a briefcase entered the room pickering was in the act of replacing a bottle of ale in an icefilled silver winecooler he had borrowed from the bridal suite what the hell are you doing with a briefcase pick asked thats not all mccoy said wait till i tell pickering shut him off by holding up his hand wait a minute he said ive got if not bad then discomfitting news discomfit me then mccoy mocked him fuck up what otherwise has been a glorious day my general thinks you should move into the boq pickering said oh shit mccoy said what the fuck business is it of his anyway hes a nice guy pickering said he and my father were corporals together and he stayed in the corps hes trying to be nice sure mccoy said just a friendly word of advice my boy an officer is judged by the company he keeps disassociate yourself from that former enlisted man jesus christ pick said without thinking you do have a runaway social inferiority complex dont you fuck you mccoy said its not like that at all goddamn your thick head what hes worried about is getting you in trouble with intelligence what mccoy asked i dont know if you know this or not pickering said but the corps has intelligence agents counterintelligence agents what they do is look for security risks no shit mccoy asked listen to me goddamn you pickering said what these guys do is look for something unusual like second lieutenants living in hotels like the lafayette expensive hotels they would start asking where you got the money to pay for the bill special agents of the deputy chief of staff for intelligence usmc you mean mccoy asked smiling broadly you know about them then goddamn it ken its not funny its the funniest thing i heard of all day mccoy said he took off his jacket and then opened the briefcase what the hell are you doing pickering asked mccoy took a leatherandrubber strap arrangement that only after a moment pickering recognized as a shoulder holster he slipped his arms in it and then took a colt a from the briefcase and put it in the holster then he put his tunic back on goddamn you you havent listened to a word ive said pickering said well i may be dumb mccoy said but youre a japanese spy if i ever saw one come with me young man if you cooperate it will go easier on you it was some kind of joke obviously but pickering didnt have any idea where the humor lay mccoy took a small leather folder from his hip pocket opened it and shoved it in pickerings face special agent mccoy he announced triumphantly youre a dead man you filthy jap spy what the hell is that pickering asked snatching it out of his hand and then looking at it carefully is this for real what is it its for real mccoy said and its my ticket to sunny hawaii and other spots in the romantic orient its for real pickering repeated in disbelief well not really real mccoy said i mean its genuine but im not in counterintelligence im an officer courier they gave me that so no one will fuck with me on the swift completion of my appointed rounds pickering demanded a more detailed explanation of what had gone on but how did you get involved in intelligence in the first place thats what i did in china mccoy said it was the first time he had ever told anyone that he remembered just before hed boarded the charles e whaley captain banning ordering him not to tell anyone in or out of the corps about it but that order had been superceded by his most recent order from major jj almond youll have to tell your roommate something mccoy you can say where you work advising him that it is classified information and what you do because that in itself is not classified and with the th marines gone from shanghai there didnt seem to be any point in pretending that he hadnt done what he had done and it was nice to have an appreciative audience an audience that had previously believed he had been a truck driver the important thing he said finally when he realized that he was tooting his own horn too much is that my colonel doesnt want me in the boq so where does that leave us pickering reached for the telephone this is malcolm pickering he said will you get the resident manager on here please when the resident manager came on the line pickering told him there had been another change in plans i will need that suite he said lieutenant mccoy and i will be here for the indefinite future they went down to dinner there pickering talked about flight school im going to take a flight physical thursday afternoon he said if i pass it i think im going to go for it and then they began a lengthy and ultimately futile search for a couple of skirts to lift it did not dampen their spirits at all there was always tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and the week after that there were supposed to be twice as many women as men in washington despite the legend mccoy said it had been his experience that a marine uniform was a bar to getting laid when he came back from hawaii and manila they would do their pussychasing in civilian clothes four security intelligence section us naval communications washington dc hours wednesday december the sign on the door said opg and there was a little window in it like a speakeasy when mccoy rang the bell a face appeared in it lieutenant mccoy to see commander kramer mccoy announced ill need to see your id lieutenant the face said mccoy held the little leather folder up to the window the man took his sweet time examining it but finally the door opened the commander expected you five minutes ago the face said the face was now revealed as a chief radioman the traffic was bad mccoy said he followed the chief down a passageway where the chief knocked at a door when he announced who he was there was the sound of a solenoid opening a bolt lieutenant mccoy commander the chief said his id checks im sure he wont mind if i check it again a somewhat nasal voice said commander kramer was a tall thin officer with a pencilline mustache he looked at mccoys credentials and then handed them back i was about to say that we dont get many second lieutenants as couriers kramer said that is now changed to we dont get to see much identification like that no sir mccoy said are you armed lieutenant yes sir and youre leaving when at sixteenthirty sir from anacostia you mean yes sir naval aircraft at least as far as san francisco you normally work for colonel rickabee is that it yes sir i heard that they had levied him for officer couriers kramer said im sorry you were caught in the net but it wouldnt have been done if it wasnt necessary i dont mind sir mccoy said solemnly instead of heading around the world by airplane i would of course prefer to be here in washington inventorying paper clips or better than that at camp lejeune running around in the boondocks practicing the infantry platoon in the assault your briefcase is going to be stuffed kramer said she was sealing the envelopes just now ill have her bring them in he pushed a lever on an intercom mrs feller the courier is here would you bring the material for pearl harbor in here please mrs feller ellen feller backed into commander kramers office with a teninchthick stack of heavy manila envelopes held against her breast mrs feller this is lieutenant mccoy commander kramer said the lieutenant and i are old friends ellen said really we got to know one another rather well in china didnt we ken you dont seem very surprised to see me mccoy said i knew you were here she said i didnt expect to see you so soon but i did hope to see you may i suggest you get on with the document transfer commander kramer said a tinge of annoyance in his voice lieutenant mccoy has a sixteenthirty plane to catch at anacostia there were thirteen envelopes in the stack ellen feller laid on commander kramers desk there was a numbered receipt to be signed for each of them and mccoy had to place his signature across the tape sealing the flap at the place where it would be broken if the envelope was opened it took some time to go through the paperwork and stuff the unyielding envelopes into the briefcase enough time for commander kramer to regret jumping on both of them ellen he said if you wished to continue your reunion with the lieutenant theres no reason you cant ride out to anacostia with him oh id like that ellen said mccoy took the handcuffs from his hip pocket and looped one cuff through the handle of the briefcase then held out his wrist for kramer to loop the other cuff around it have a good trip lieutenant commander kramer said offering his hand he then held the door for both of them to pass through my coats just down the corridor ellen said a navy gray plymouth station wagon and a sailor driver waited for them at the entrance mccoy had ridden over to opg in the front seat with him but when the sailor saw ellen feller he ran around and held the back door open for her mccoy hesitated a moment before he got in beside her holding the heavy briefcase on his lap you were right ellen said as they drove off about what that i could probably find a job because i speak chinese she switched to chinese the first place i applied was to the navy and they hired me right on as a translator but theres not that much to translate so ive become sort of office manager im a gs i dont know what that means mccoy said relieved that they could speak chinese and the driver wouldnt understand them wheres your husband hes in new york busy with his work she said you manage to smuggle the vase in all right mccoy asked she raised her eyebrows at the question but didnt answer it i have a nice little apartment here she said youll have to come see it the last time i saw you youseemed damned glad to be getting rid of me well my god you remember what happened the day before she said that was quite a shock yeah he said sarcastically sure i was upset ken she said im sorry forget it he said those things happen i understand why youre angry she said he didnt reply she turned on the seat and caught his hand in both of hers i said im sorry she said nothing to be sorry about he said if youre still angry then there is she said im not angry he said she rubbed his hand against her cheek and then let him go not everything that happened the day before was unpleasant of course she said he didnt reply do you remember what happened just before you were blowing me thats what happened just before no he said i often think about it she said i dont know what youre talking about mccoy said fuck you lady you get to screw old mccoy just once im not about to start up anything with you again dont you really ellen asked and then sat forward on the seat to give the driver instructions stay on pennsylvania she ordered its faster this time of day yes maam the driver said when she slid back against the seat her hand went under the skirt of mccoys tunic and closed around his erection liar she said softly for gods sake he said pushing her hand away pity theres not more time isnt it but you wont be gone all that long will you at least with her i know what shes after its not like with picks richbitch friend and thirty minutes in the sack with the old vacuum cleaner and i wont even be able to remember miss ernestine sages name much less remember what she looked like no he said a couple of weeks is all no more than three thatll give us both something to look forward to wont it ellen feller said mccoy reached out for her hand and put it back under the skirt of his blouse chapter fifteen one the madison suite the lafayette hotel washington dc hours december until this week airplanes for second lieutenant malcolm pickering usmcr had been something like taxi cabs they were there when you needed to go somewhere you got in one and it took you that changed the navy medico more properly flight surgeon which pickering thought had a nice aeronautical ring to it told him that he met the physical standards laid down for naval aviators general mcinemeys senior aidedecamp himself a dashing naval aviator with wings of gold then explained that while there might officially be say fifty wouldbe birdmen in any course of primary flight instruction at the pensacola naval air station flight training for marine aviators is conducted by the us navy marine aviators wear the same gold wings as naval aviators that was something of a fiction more than the prescribed number were routinely ordered to the shores of the gulf of mexico experience had taught that a number of students would quickly prove themselves incapable of learning how to fly by sending extras the corps wound up with the desired number after the inept had bilged out general mclnerney was in a position to have pickering sent as a member of the supernumeraries pickering knew his mother would have a fit when she heard that he was to become an aviator which was a problem that would be a bit difficult to handle on the other hand there was a positive appeal about the prospect of swapping the slushfilled streets of washington for the white sandy beaches of pensacola on the way home from anacostia naval air station in mccoys lasalle on friday evening he stopped at a bookstore asked for books on aviation starting with the theory of flight and bought half a dozen that looked promising he was now reading one of them one with a lot of drawings the others stacked up beside his chair waited for his attention a small table beside him held a silver pot of coffee he was attired for a more primitive means of transportation than he was reading about a tweed jacket with leather patches over the elbows a plaid cotton shirt open at the collar a pair of pink breeches and a pair of hailey smythe riding boots which rested on a pillow to preserve the furniture on the coffee table before him he had spent the morning in virginia aboard a horse sort of a fox hunt without either the fox or the ceremony that went with a hunt just half a dozen riders riding about the countryside jumping fences of opportunity they were going to sit around in the afternoon and get smashed rather nobly he thought he had pleaded the press of duty and returned to the hotel to read the airplane books the telephone rang and he looked around for it a look of annoyance crossing his face as he spotted it ten feet out of reach it had taken him some effort to reach his present comfortable position with his feet just so and his back just so and with the miracle of flight propped up just so on his belly he had just begun to grasp the notion that aircraft are lifted into the air because there is less pressure on the upper curved and thus longer portion of a wing than there is on the bottom flat and thus shorter portion of a wing as the wing moves through the air it simply follows the path of least resistance upward and hauls the airplane along with it he wasnt entirely sure he fully understood this he was sure however that he didnt want to chat just now with whomever was on the phone especially since he had to get up to go answer it yes he snapped impatiently what is it oh shit its probably general mclnerney and i was supposed to have answered that lieutenant pickering speaking pick it was a female and a halfsecond later he knew which one hello ernie he said are you alone can you talk ernestine sage said you have interrupted a splendid orgy but whats on your mind i want to talk to you ernie sage said then talk he said just make it quick ill be right up ernie sage said youre here he asked genuinely surprised in the hotel i just happened to be in the neighborhood and thought id just pop in she said and the phone went dead between the time she hung up and the time he answered her knock at the door he had considered the possibilities certainly this had to do with ken mccoy but what would bring ernie all the way to washington except true love and the possibility not as astonishing when there was time to think it over that ernie was in the family way could she be sure so soon to the best of his recollection it took several months to be sure about that it hadnt been that long since he had seen juliet kissing romeo in the grand central oyster bar hi ernie said when he opened the door dont you look horsey for the first time in a long time pickering looked at her as a female and not as part of the woodwork damned goodlooking he judged marvelous knockers they had obviously grown a good deal since he now remembered with somewhat startling clarity he had last seen them looking down her bathing suit in boca raton he and ernie must have been thirteen or fourteen at the time come into my den as the spider said to the fly youre a hard man to find she said i called your mother or tried to and they said she was in hawaii so i called your grandfather and he told me where you were why do i suspect that you werent suddenly overcome with an irresistible urge to see me pickering asked she looked into his face where is he she asked wheres who come on pick she said ken you mean where is he in hawaii too come to think of it pick said oh hell she said not to worry he said he will be back she looked at his face thats important to you isnt it pickering asked dont be a shit about this pick please ernie sage said okay he said it will be an effort obviously do you have something i could have to drink he gestured to the bar help yourself he said she walked to the bar and made herself a scotch you want one she asked i want one but oh what the hell yes please she made him a drink handed it to him and then sat down on a couch and stirred the ice cubes in her glass with her index finger i never imagined myself doing this she said without looking at him doing what running after a boy she said and corrected herself a man im not surprised pick said she looked at him quickly for one thing mccoys quite special pick said and for another i saw the two of you in the oyster bar she did not seem at all embarrassed to hear that just curious what were you doing there mccoy had led me safely through the wild jungles of quantico pickering said protecting me from unfamiliar savage beasts i thought it only fair that i return the favor protect him from me you mean thanks a lot i didnt know who it was until i saw you pickering said where did you meet him on a train from boston pickering said he had just escorted prisoners to the naval prison at portsmouth and then he showed up wholly unexpected at quantico why unexpected because our peers were our peers mccoy was a noncom of the regular marine corps just in from years in china he told me about china she said he took me to a tiny little chinese restaurant off mott street where he talked chinese to them as i say hes something special isnt he she said then she looked up at him four hours after i met him i took him to bed he told me pickering said i dont know what you think of me pick ernie sage said but thats not my style he told me that too pickering said gently that surprised her she looked into his face until she was sure that she had not misunderstood him pretty close are you or did he proudly report it as another cherry copped actually he was pretty upset about it pickering said but not too upset to tell you all about it we are pretty close pickering said i dont know its something like having a brother i guess you heard about his brother the one who was offered the choice of the marine corps or jail i even know that was the choice they gave him too pickering said like i say ernie were close okay so tell me what happened i have six letters all marked refused he found out you were rich pickering said oh god she wailed then the accusation you told him why the hell did you have to do that pickering shrugged his shoulders helplessly and threw up his hands now im sorry that i did he said she turned her face away from him then turned back frowning but i suppose i was thinking that the bad news better come gently and from me i didnt want that shocking revelation suddenly thrust upon him if you came from a background like his it would upset you too ernie sage said loyally he has pride for gods sake i know hes a fool but did he tell you about the lady missionary what lady missionary there was a lady missionary in china who apparently gave him a bad time strung him along hurt him pretty badly id like to kill her ernie sage said matteroffactly youve really got it pretty bad for him dont you as incredible as it sounds she said im in love with him okay can we proceed from that point love as in forsaking all others until death do you part i was disappointed when i found out i wasnt pregnant she said hows that i hope you know what youre getting into pickering said it doesnt matter pick she said i have absolutely no control over how i feel about him i thought that only happened in romantic novels obviously it doesnt only happen in fiction im jealous pickering said what have you got to be jealous about ernie asked and then she understood you should be she said but thats your problem what do we do about mine i dont know pickering said if youre really sure about this ernie big brother will think of something i have never been so sure of anything in my life she said its either him and me hand in hand or to hell with it for what its worth with the caveat that i am relatively inexperienced in matters of this kind i would not say its hopeless ernestine sage brightened visibly really she asked really pickering said for reasons i cannot imagine lieutenant mccoy seemed to be more than a little taken with your many charms god i hope so she said and then asked whats he doing in hawaii they made him an officer courier pickering said he carries secrets in a briefcase i never heard of that she said how long did you say hell be gone hes going to hawaii he got there today or will get there today there is something called the international dateline and ive never figured it out and from there hes going to manila and then back to hawaii and then back here and what are we going to do when he gets back here well arrange for him to find you in a black negligee in his bed pickering said as a marine officer he would be dutybound to do his duty you can play the ball from there if i thought that would work she said id do it i think ernie pick pickering said seriously that all it would take would be for him to find you sitting there just like you are now she looked at him and smiled then she got up and walked to him and kissed him on the cheek and i was really afraid that youd be a shit about this she said my god me pick pickering cupids righthand man she chuckled and looked at her watch i was so sure of it that i reserved a compartment on the threefifteen to new york ive still got time to make it maybe pickering said you should get some practice riding coach she looked at him curiously for a moment until she took his meaning if thats what it takes thats what ill do she said but the next time not today he smiled at her and walked with her to the door where she kissed him impulsively again he had just rearranged himself in the chair with his feet on the pillow and the miracle of flight propped up on his belly when there was another knock on his door jesus h christ he fumed as he went to answer it it was ernie sage and he could tell from the look in her eyes that something was terribly wrong a radio ernie said have you got a radio theres one in here he said she pushed past him into the sitting room she had the radio on by the time he got there repeating the bulletin the voice of the radio announcer said the white house has just announced that the navy base at pearl harbor hawaii has been attacked by japanese aircraft and that there has been substantial loss of life and material jesus christ pickering said if hes dead ernestine sage said melodramatically ill kill myself you dont mean that pickering said oh my god pick your mother and father are there he hadnt thought of that somehow he wound up holding her in his arms everything is going to be all right ernie bullshit she said against his chest and then it occurred to him that he was a marine officer and that what he should be doing now was getting into uniform and reporting for duty two pearl harbor hawaii december the japanese task force which had sailed from hitokappu bay in the kurile islands began to launch aircraft at hours the task force was then approximately nautical miles from pearl harbor in relation to the task force pearl harbor was on the far side of oahu island the second largest island of the hawaiian chain japanese intelligence was aware that the attack could not be entirely as successful as was initially hoped in the best possible scenario essentially all of the united states pacific fleet would be in pearl harbor the worst possible scenario was that essentially all of the pacific fleet would be at sea the reality turned out to be between these extremes all the battleships of the pacific fleet were in pearl harbor as well as a number of other ships but the seven heavy cruisers and the two aircraft carriers the japanese had also hoped to find at anchor were at sea the japanese knew the composition of the atsea forces but not their location task force an aircraft carrier three cruisers and nine destroyers and destroyer minesweeperswas approximately nautical miles from pearl task force one cruiser and five destroyers and destroyer minesweeperswas nautical miles off johnson island about nautical miles from pearl harbor task force one carrier three cruisers and five destroyerswas about as far from pearl harbor as task force operating approximately nautical miles north of task force the decision was made to attack anyway there was always the chance of detection the destruction of harbor facilities and airfields was of high priority and the destruction of one or more battleships would severely limit the capability of the american fleet the code command for the attack was climb mount niitaka approximately nautical miles from pearl harbor the stream of aircraft from the japanese task force split into two streams fifty miles from oahu what was now the left stream began to split again this time into three streams the first two turned right and made for pearl harbor across the island the third stream continued on course until it was past the tip of oahu and then turned toward the center of the island and made an approach to pearl harbor from the sea meanwhile the right stream had broken into two with one crossing the coastline and making for pearl harbor across the island and the second continuing on course past the island then turning back to attack pearl harbor from the open sea the first wave of japanese bombers struck at hours and the second at by then the task force had changed course and was making for the japanese inland sea hoping to avoid any encounter with carrierbased aircraft from task forces and or with landbased aircraft on oahu intelligence reported that at least one squadron of longrange fourengine b bomber aircraft was en route from the continental united states despite the risk of detection by radio direction finders shortly after hours a priority message from the japanese task force was radioed to headquarters of the imperial japanese navy in tokyo tora tiger tora tora it was the prearranged code for the successful completion of the attack three although he tried to be very nonchalant about the whole thing second lieutenant kj mccoy made his first aerial trip from anacostia to the west coast all in all once he got used to it he found it very enjoyable the airplane was a navy transport but so far as he could tell identical to the douglas dcs used by civilian airlines the navy called it an rd yet it even had white napkins on the seats to keep your hair tonic from soiling the upholstery it was considerably more plush than the aircraft that carried him from california to hawaii as major almond had warned there were a lot of people in california with an aaa priority waiting for air transportation to hawaii he could wait the sergeant told him until there was a space but he should understand that when two people had an aaa priority the one who was senior in rank got the seat as a second lieutenant he was liable to wait a long time there was another way to get to hawaii the army air corps was flying a squadron of b bombers to hickam field they had excess weight capacity because they would not carry bombs and they were carrying passengers well if thats the only way to get there sergeant mccoy said with feigned reluctance i suppose thatll have to be it the truth of the matter was that he was a little excited about the idea of flying on a bomber and the flight started off on an egopleasing note too when he got to the airbase and presented his orders a thoroughly pissedoff air corps major had to get out of the airplane so that second lieutenant mccoy of the marines with his briefcase and aaa priority could get on they were supposed to land at hickam field about noon an hour before that the radio operator established contact with hawaii moments later the pilot came back in the fuselage and told the crew and the four supercargo passengers two air corps lieutenant colonels an army master sergeant and mccoy what had happened in hawaii it was all over when the b appeared over oahu but some dumb sonsofbitches didnt get the word and shot at the b not just once but twice the second time as they made their approach to hickam field the airfield was all shot up there were burning and burnedout airplanes everywhere and not one hangar seemed to be intact an enormous cloud of dense black smoke rose where the japs had managed to set off an aviation fuel dump they had no sooner landed than an air corps major appeared in a jeep and told the pilot to take off again for a landing field on a pineapple plantation on one of the other islands he seemed thoroughly pissedoff when the pilot said he didnt have enough fuel aboard to take off for anywhere mccoy very politely asked the air corps major about transportation to the navy base at pearl harbor good christ lieutenant the air corps major said jumping all over his ass are you blind pearl harbor isnt there anymore there was no point arguing with him so mccoy the briefcase in one hand and his suitcase in the other started walking there were a lot of other excited types at hickam running around like chickens with their heads cut off and even more who seemed to be moving around with strange blank looks in their eyes none of them were any help about getting him from hickam to pearl harbor even after he showed a couple of them his credentials so mccoy decided that under the circumstances it would be all right to borrow transportation he found a ford pickup with nothing in the back and the keys in the ignition the mp at the gate held him at rifle point until an officer showed up the officer took one look at the credentials and let him go as he approached the navy base there was even more smoke than thered been at hickam field when he got to the gate the marine mp on duty wasnt any more impressed with the credentials than the army mp at hickam field had been and he had to wait for an officer to show up before he would let him inside while he was waiting for the officer to come to the gate mccoy asked the mp if the marine barracks had been hit and if so how badly the mp wouldnt tell him that worried mccoy even more tommy was in the marine barracks which meant in the middle of this shit he didnt like to consider the possibility that tommy had got himself blown up the officer who came to the gate passed him through and told him where he was supposed to go the navy seemed a lot calmer than the air corps had been but not a whole hell of a lot still he found a classifieddocuments officer a middleaged harassedlooking lieutenant commander who relieved him of the contents of the briefcase as mccoy was taking off the handcuff and thes shoulder holster so he could put them into the briefcase he asked the lieutenant commander what he was expected to do now get yourself a couple of hours of sleep lieutenant the lieutenant commander said and then report back here aye aye sir the lieutenant commander looked at him strangely you got a wife anything like that lieutenant he said you might want to write a letter mccoys eyebrows rose quizzically youre going on to cavite he said with a little bit of luck you might get there before the japs do the japs hit cavite too and everything else in the philippines the lieutenant commander said but what i meant is before the japs land in the philippines is that whats going to happen mccoy asked the lieutenant commander nodded then he shrugged there was a secret operational immediate the highestpriority communication a couple of hours ago the lieutenant commander said a japanese invasion fleet was spotted headed for the lingayen gulf why the hell it was classified secret i dont know the japs must know where they are and where theyre headed and you think that once i get there im stuck mccoy asked i didnt say that the lieutenant commander said but if i was going to fly into cavite on a catalina id write my wife or whatever a letter thank you mccoy said mccoy didnt even consider writing his sister if anything happened to him she would find out when they sent the insurance check to her kids briefly the notion of writing pick entered his mind but he dismissed it he wouldnt know what the hell to say and he thought for a moment of writing ernie just for the hell of it i thought you would like to know i love you then he saw that for what it was a damnedfool idea and went looking for tommy it wouldnt be exactly what he had had in mind when hed thought about seeing tommy at pearl harbor tommy didnt even know he was an officer hed planned to surprise him with that to see what he did when he saw him with the lieutenants bars he got back in the borrowed pickup and drove to the marine barracks one of the barracks buildings had been set on fire but the fire was out there were bullet marks all over and in the middle of the drill field was a huge unidentifiable firescarred chunk of metal there werent very many people around a few noncoms and some other people but no troops nobody seemed to be running around looking for something to do he found the headquarters building and went inside there was a guard in field gear and steel helmet at the door he saluted and there was a first lieutenant and a pfc in the personnel office the lieutenant spotted him before the pfc who belatedly jumped to his feet reporting in lieutenant the lieutenant asked passing through sir mccoy said for a moment he thought about dazzling the lieutenant with his special agent credentials and then decided that wouldnt be right what can i do for you my brothers assigned to the first defense battalion mccoy said ive been wondering about him no doubt the lieutenant said he handed mccoy a yellow lined pad this is the first casualty report he said my clerks about to type it up all the names on there are confirmed casualties or kia but thats not saying all the casualties are on the list thank you sir mccoy said he quickly scanned the names tommys name wasnt on it well hes not on it mccoy said hes a private mccoy thomas j the lieutenant started to consult a list and then remembered just seeing that name he consulted another list at the head of which he had penciled cut orders transferring wake island one of the names on the list of those to be shipped out as soon as transport could be found as reinforcements for the small marine force under major james devereux on wake island was mccoy thomas j hes in the beach defense force he said i dont know where the hell to tell you to look for him i dont have the time anyway mccoy said you said you were passing through on my way to manila mccoy explained to the fourth marines mccoy nodded there was no point in telling this guy he was a courier youre going to have a hell of a time finding transport the lieutenant said maybe with a little bit of luck i wont be able to mccoy said i did a hitch with the second battalion until as an enlisted man good outfit i used to be on a watercooled in dog company first battalion mccoy said look the lieutenant said theyre not going to ship you out of here for a couple of days at least the odds are your brother will be back in here if he gets in ill pass the word youre here and send him over to the transient boq thanks mccoy said what the hell a couple of old china marines have to take care of each other right absolutely mccoy said thanks again when mccoy had gone the lieutenant looked over the list of names of people to be transferred to wake island as soon as possible erased private thomas j mccoys name from it and penciled in another he had no doubt that wake island would fall and besides no matter where he was there would be enough war left for private mccoy and for his brother the philippines were probably going to go under too if what happened this morning was any indication christ hawaii might fall this would give them a chance to say hello or goodbye when mccoy drove back to compacfleet he parked the borrowed truck where no one could see him get out of it and then went in search of something to eat the lieutenant commander found him in the cafeteria eating a bologna sandwich i just looked all over the goddamn boq for you he said thats where i told you to go mccoy his mouth full held up the bologna sandwich the lieutenant commander handed mccoy a briefcase and a pad of receipt forms then he took him to ford island where a catalina was being fueled by hand the airbase was a shambles and the dense cloud of black smoke rising from battleship row was visible for a long time after they had taken off four headquarters th regiment usmc cavite naval base manila bay territory of the philippines hours december the th marines was just about clear of the area when mccoy finally found it they had apparently moved out in haste there was a large pile of packaging material roughcut lumber cardboard and wood shavings on what had been the neatly trimmed lawn in front of regimental headquarters the buildings were deserted completely deserted mccoy thought until he was nearly run down by the colonel trailed by the sergeantmajor as he turned a comer they were in khakis no field scarves wearing web belts withs dangling from them and tin hats both of them had springfields slung over their shoulders mccoy was in greens with a leatherbrimmed cap the colonels eyebrows rose when he saw mccoy i know you who are you the colonel demanded mccoy popped to attention corporal mccoy sir he barked shit the sergeantmajor said and laughed out loud lieutenant mccoy sir mccoy said ill be damned the colonel said what the hell is going on mccoy lieutenant i just graduated from platoon leaders course sir and they assigned you back here the colonel asked incredulously no sir mccoy said im an officer courier i just got in i thought id come by and say hello to captain banning jesus h christ the colonel said and shook his head and marched out of the building five santos bay lingayen gulf luzon territory of the philippines hours december captain edward j banning lay behind a quickly erected sandbag barrier at the crest of the hill leading down to the beach the day was going to be cloudless cloudless and probably hot it was entirely likely that he would die here today possibly even this morning behind a sandbag barrier on a hot cloudless day the beach was being defended by two companies of marines they had not had time or material to mine the approaches to the beach they had four watercooledcaliber brownings six aircooledcaliber brownings and half a dozen mortars somewhere en route allegedly were two mm cannon from a doggieofficered philippine scout field artillery battery a mile offshore were two dozen japanese ships half merchantmen converted to troop transports half destroyers at first light they were supposed to have been attacked by army air corps bombers banning was not surprised that they had not been the japs had wiped out the air corps in the philippines after it had been conveniently lined up on airfields for them it had occurred to some air corps general that since there was a chance of sabotage if the planes were in widely dispersed revetments they could be more economically guarded if they were gathered together in rows they had been all lined up for the japs when they came in there would be no bombers to attack the japanese invasion force and the japanese landing force would not be repelled by two companies of marines and a handful ofcaliber machine guns these two companies of the th marines would die here today in a futile defense of an indefensible beach and the rest of the regiment would die on other indefensible beaches he was resigned to it thats what he had been drawing all his pay for for all those years so he would be available for a situation like this he heard movement behind him and turned to see what it was and had trouble believing what he saw it was corporal killer mccoy without headgear wearing a khaki shirt and green trousers staggering under the load of a bar browning automatic rifle caliber and what looked like twenty or more magazines for it what the hell are you doing here banning asked with what looked like his last ounce of energy mccoy set the bar down carefully on the sandbags and then collapsed on his back breathing heavily still festooned with bandoliers of twentyround magazines for the bar it was only then that banning saw the small gold bars pinned to mccoys collar i found the bar and the ammo at a checkpoint mccoy breathed still flat on his back whoever was manning the checkpoint took off what are you doing here banning asked and wearing an officers shirt i thought you knew mccoy said i went to the platoon leaders course no i didnt know banning said but what the hell are you doing here i came in as a courier mccoy said now that i am here i guess im doing what youre doing he rolled onto his stomach and raised his head high enough to see over the sandbags jesus christ theyre just sitting out there isnt there any artillery theres supposed to be but theres not banning said there was also supposed to be bombers shit were going to get clobbered did somebody order you up here mccoy banning asked no mccoy said simply but i figured this is where i belonged where are you supposed to be they told me to hang around the navy comm center in case there was a way to get me out of here but thats not going to happen youve got orders ordering you out of the philippines banning asked mccoy nodded you goddamned fool id give my left nut for orders like that mccoy looked at him curiously perhaps even contemptuously banning thought get your ass out of here mccoy banning said mccoy didnt respond instead he picked up bannings binoculars and peered over the sandbags through them too late he said theyre putting boats over the side he handed banning the binoculars banning was looking through them when the tin cans started firing the preassault barrage the first rounds were long landing two three hundred yards inland the second rounds were short setting up plumes of water fifty yards offshore the third rounds would be on target he thought as he saw the japanese landing barges start for the beach the first rounds of the fire for effect barrage landed on the defense positions close to the beach the fucking japs knew what they were doing when the first of the landing barges was five hundred yards off shore maybe six hundred yards from where they were mccoy brought it under fire the noise of the bar going off so close to bannings ear was painful as well as startling he turned to look at mccoy mccoy was firing as he was supposed to short three four fiveround bursts aimed bursts giving the piece time to cool a little as he fired hes probably hitting what hes shooting at but its like trying to stamp out ants theres just too many of them and in a minute some clever jap is going to call in a couple of rounds on us and that will be the end of us captain edward j bannings assessment of the tactical situation proved to be correct and precise two minutes later the first round landed on their position so close to him that the shock of the concussion caused him to lose control of his sphincter muscle he didnt hear the sound of the round explode although he heard it whistle on the way in its true he thought surprised just before he passed out you dont hear the one that gets you banning awoke in great pain and in the dark and he couldnt move his right arm he sensed rather than saw that he was no longer on the crest overlooking the beach then he felt his body and learned that he was bandaged he was chilled with panic at the thought that he was blind but after a moment he could make out vague shapes he lay immobile wondering where he was and what he was expected to do and then there was light one of the vague shapes moved to him and put a matteroffact hand on his neck to feel for a heartbeat mccoy yes sir where the hell are we in the basement of some church mccoy said you brought me here the sonsofbitches dropped one right on us mccoy said without emotion i dont know what the hell happened to the bar but it was time we got the hell out of there did you get hit i took a little shrapnel in the side he said they just pulled it out where are the japanese banning asked christ only knows mccoy said they went by here like shit through a goose were behind their lines yes sir this may sound like a dumb question but what kind of shape am i in we got you pretty well doped up mccoy said the filipinoshes a nurse the one that took the shrapnel out of mesays you shouldnt be moved for a couple of days then what happens banning asked they say we probably cant make it back through the jap lines so when you can move theyre going to take us up in the mountains and maybe off this island onto another one mindo something mindinao banning furnished thats right what happened to the marines on the beach they were gone before we got hit mccoy said god forgive me i have absolutely no heroic regrets that i did not die with the regiment im goddamned glad im alive and thats all there is to it do you think you could make it through the japanese lines banning said you cant go anywhere for a while mccoy replied thats not what i asked banning said what the hell is the point mccoy asked i think id much rather go in the hills for a while and see how i could fuck them up if i go back theyll just give me a platoon and the same thing will happen to me as happened to those poor bastards on the beach yesterday the point lieutenant mccoy is that you are a marine officer and marine officers obey their orders you have two that currently affect you the first is to leave the philippines mccoy chuckled whos going to enforce that one theyd have to come get me i am banning said this is an order you will make your way through japanese lines and report to the proper authorities so that you may comply with your basic orders to leave the philippines youre serious arent you mccoy asked genuinely surprised you bet your ass im serious lieutenant you better get it through your head that youll fight this war the way the corps tells you to fight it not the way you think would be nicest and what happens to you i am in compliance with my orders i was ordered to resistthe japanese invasion ill continue to do that as soon as i am physically able this sounds like one of those dumb lectures at quantico mccoy said maybe you should have paid closer attention to those dumb lectures banning said shit mccoy said has it ever occurred to you goddamn you that you can do a hell of a lot more for mis war as an intelligence officer than you could running around in the boondocks ambushing an odd jap here and there so could you captain but i cant move and you can mccoy several minutes later asked once more you really think i should go back and try to get back to the states yes goddamnit i do aye aye sir mccoy said as soon as it gets dark ill go six quarters us marine corps base quantico virginia december elly stecker knew what was happening when she saw doris means at her door with her husband but

his living room jesus christ elly colonel means said im sorry seven the madison suite the lafayette hotel washington dc hours january mccoy pushed open the door and threw his suitcase in ahead of him pick you here there was no response he went to picks bedroom and pushed the door open the bed was made he shrugged and went to the bar and poured two inches of scotch in a glass and drank it down and then poured another two inches into the glass he was so fucking tired he could barely stand which meant he would not be able to get to sleep he didnt know why the hell it was but thats the way it was
