mary higgins clark where are you now acknowledgments perhaps the question i am most frequently asked is where do you get your ideas the answer is simple i read an article in a newspaper or magazine and for some reason it sticks in my mind thats what happened when i read about a young man who disappeared thirtyfive years ago from his college dorm and phones home every year or so refusing to give any information about why he left or where he is his mother is now elderly still hoping that one day before she dies she will see him again when a situation intrigues me i ask myself three questions suppose what if why i thought suppose a college senior disappeared ten years ago what if he calls only on mothers day why did he disappear and then all the supposes and what ifs and whys start to tumble around in my mind and a new novel begins writing is always a marvelous adventure for me by its very nature of course it is a solitary one fortunately i have the steadfast guidance and encouragement of my forever editor and friend michael korda this year with the assistance of senior editor amanda murray heartfelt thanks michael and amanda sgt stephen marron nypd ret and detective richard murphy nypd ret are my splendid experts in police procedure and criminal investigation cheers and thanks steve and rich associate director of copyediting gypsy da silva and i have worked

unending to the home front john conheeney spouse extraordinaire and all our children and grandchildren we are indeed blessed blossoms of spring and heaps of good wishes to you my cherished readers i hope you enjoy reading this tale as much as ive enjoyed writing it same time next year you bet in memory of patricia mary riker pat dear friend and wonderful lady with love where are you now who lies beneath your spell the kashmiri song words by laurence hope music by amy woodfordefinden i t is exactly midnight which means mothers day has just begun i stayed overnight with my mother in the apartment on sutton place where i grew up she is down the hall in her room and together we are keeping the vigil the same vigil weve kept every year since my brother charles mackenzie jr mack walked out of the apartment he shared with two other columbia university seniors ten years ago he has never been seen since then but every year at some point on mothers day he calls to assure mom he is fine dont worry about me he tells her one of these days ill turn the key in the lock and be home then he hangs up we never know when in those twentyfour hours that call will come last year mack called at a few minutes after midnight and our vigil ended almost as soon as it began two years ago he waited until the very last second to phone and mom was frantic that this slim contact with him was over mack has to have known that my father was killed in the twin towers tragedy i was sure that no matter what he was doing that terrible day would have compelled him to come home but it did not then on the next mothers day during his annual call he started crying and gasped im sorry about dad im really sorry and broke the connection i am carolyn i was sixteen when mack disappeared following in his footsteps i attended columbia unlike him i then went on to duke law school mack had been accepted there before he disappeared after i passed the bar last year i clerked for a civil court judge in the courthouse on centre street in lower manhattan judge paul huot has just retired so at the moment im unemployed i plan to apply for a job as an assistant district attorney in manhattan but not quite yet first i must find a way to track my brother down what happened to him why did he disappear there was no sign of foul play macks credit cards werent used his car was in the garage near his apartment no one of his description ever ended up in the morgue although in the beginning my mother and father were sometimes asked to view the body of some unidentified young man who had been fished out of the river or killed in an accident when we were growing up mack was my best friend my confidant my pal half my girlfriends had a crush on him he was the perfect son the perfect brother handsome kind funny an excellent student how do i feel about him now i dont know anymore i remember how much i loved him but that love has almost totally turned to anger and resentment i wish i could even doubt that hes alive and that someone is playing a cruel trick but there is no doubt in my mind about that years ago we recorded one of his phone calls and had the pattern of his voice compared to his voice from home movies it was identical all of this means that mom and i dangle slowly in the wind and before dad died in that burning inferno it was that way for him too in all these years i have never gone into a restaurant or theatre without my eyes automatically scanning to see if just maybe by chance i will run into him someone with a similar profile and sandy brown hair will demand a second look and sometimes close scrutiny i remember more than once almost knocking people over to get close to someone who turned out to be a perfect stranger all this was going through my mind as i set the volume of the phone on the loudest setting got into bed and tried to go to sleep i guess i did fall into an uneasy doze because the jarring ring of the phone made me bolt up i saw from the lighted dial on the clock that it was five minutes to three with one hand i snapped on the bedside light and with the other grabbed the receiver mom had already picked up and i heard her voice breathless and nervous hello mack hello mom happy mothers day i love you his voice was resonant and confident he sounds as though he doesnt have a care in the world i thought bitterly as usual the sound of his voice shattered mom she began to cry mack i love you i need to see you she begged i dont care what trouble you may be in what problems you have to solve ill help you mack for gods sake its been ten years dont do this to me any longer pleaseplease he never stayed on the phone for as long as a minute im sure he knew that we would try to trace the call but now that that technology is available he always calls from one of those cell phones with a prepaid time card i had been planning what i would say to him and rushed now to make him hear me out before he hung up mack im going to find you i said the cops tried and failed so did the private investigator but i wont fail i swear i wont my voice had been quiet and firm as i had planned but then the sound of my mother crying sent me over the edge im going to track you down you lowlife i shrieked and youd better have an awfully good reason for torturing us like this i heard a click and knew that he had disconnected i could have bitten my tongue off to take back the name i had called him but of course it was too late knowing what i was facing that mom would be furious at me for the way i had screamed at mack i put on a robe and went down the hall to the suite that she and dad had shared sutton place is an upscale manhattan neighborhood of town houses and apartment buildings overlooking the east river my father bought this place after putting himself through fordham law school at night and working his way up to partner in a corporate law firm our privileged childhood was the result of his brains and the hard work ethic that was instilled in him by his widowed scotchirish mother he never allowed a nickel of the money my mother inherited to affect our lives i tapped on the door and pushed it open she was standing at the panoramic window that overlooked the east river she did not turn even though she knew i was there it was a clear night and to the left i could see the lights of the queensboro bridge even in this predawn hour there was a steady stream of cars going back and forth across it the fanciful thought crossed my mind that maybe mack was in one of those cars and having made his annual call was now on his way to a distant destination mack had always loved travel it was in his veins my mothers father liam oconnell was born in dublin educated at trinity college and came to the united states smart welleducated and broke within five years he was buying potato fields in long island that eventually became the hamptons property in palm beach county property on third avenue when it was still a dirty dark street in the shadow of the elevated train track that hovered over it that was when he sent for and married my grandmother the english girl he had met at trinity my mother olivia is a genuine english beauty tall still slender as a reed at sixtytwo with silver hair bluegray eyes and classic features in appearance mack was practically her clone i inherited my fathers reddish brown hair hazel eyes and stubborn jaw when my mother wore heels she was a shade taller than dad and like him im just average height i found myself yearning for him as i walked across the room and put my arm around my mother she spun around and i could feel the anger radiating from her carolyn how could you talk to mack like that she snapped her arms wrapped tightly across her chest cant you understand that there must be some terrible problem that is keeping him from us cant you understand that he must be feeling frightened and helpless and that this call is a cry for understanding before my father died they often used to have emotional conversations like this mom always protective of mack my father getting to the point where he was ready to wash his hands of it all and stop worrying for the love of god liv he would snap at mom he sounds all right maybe hes involved with some woman and doesnt want to bring her around maybe hes trying to be an actor he wanted to be one when he was a kid maybe i was too tough on him making him have summer jobs who knows they would end up apologizing to each other mom crying dad anguished and angry at himself for upsetting her i wasnt going to make a second mistake by trying to justify myself instead i said mom listen to me since we havent found mack by now hes not worrying about my threat look at it this way youve heard from him you know hes alive he sounds downright upbeat i know you hate sleeping pills but i also know your doctor gave you a prescription so take one now and get some rest i didnt wait for her to answer me i knew i couldnt do any good by staying with her any longer because i was angry too angry at her for railing at me angry at mack angry at the fact that this tenroom duplex apartment was too big for mom to live in alone too filled with memories she wont sell it because she doesnt trust that macks annual telephone call would be bounced to a new location and of course she reminds me that he had said one day he would turn the key in the lock and be homehome here i got back into bed but sleep was a long way off i started planning how i would begin to look for mack i thought about going to lucas reeves the private investigator whom dad hired but then changed my mind i was going to treat macks disappearance as if it had happened yesterday the first thing dad did when we became alarmed about mack was call the police and report him missing id begin at the beginning i knew people down at the courthouse which also houses the district attorneys office i decided that my search would begin there finally i drifted off and began to dream of following a shadowy figure who was walking across a bridge try as i would to keep him in sight he was too fast for me and when we reached land i didnt know which way to turn but then i heard him calling me his voice mournful and troubled carolyn stay back stay back i cant mack i said aloud as i awakened i cant m onsignor devon mackenzie ruefully commented to visitors that his beloved st francis de sales church was located so close to the episcopal cathedral of st john the divine that it was almost invisible a dozen years ago devon had expected to hear that st francis would be closed and he could not in honesty have contested the decision after all it had been built in the nineteenth century and needed major repairs then as more apartment buildings went up in the area and older walkups were renovated he had been gratified to see the faces of new parishioners at sunday masses the growing congregation meant that in the past five years he had been able to carry out some of those repairs the stainedglass windows were cleaned years of builtup soil removed from the murals the wooden pews sanded and refinished the kneeling benches covered with soft new carpeting then when pope benedict decreed that individual pastors could decide to offer a tridentine mass devon who was proficient in latin announced that henceforth the eleven oclock sunday mass would be celebrated in the ancient tongue of the church the response stunned him that mass was now filled to overflowing not only with senior citizens but teenagers and young adults who reverently responded deo gratias in place of thanks be to god and prayed pater noster instead of our father devon was sixtyeight two years younger than the brother he had lost on and uncle and godfather of the nephew who had disappeared at mass when he invited the congregation to silently offer their own petitions his first prayer was always for mack and that one day he would come home on mothers day that prayer was always especially fervent today when he returned to the rectory there was a message waiting for him on the answering machine from carolyn uncle devhe called at five of three this morning sounded fine hung up fast see you tonight monsignor devon could hear the strain in his nieces voice his relief that his nephew had called was mixed with sharp anger damn you mack he thought havent you any idea what youre doing to us as he tugged off his roman collar devon reached for the phone to call carolyn back before he could begin to dial the doorbell rang it was his boyhood friend frank lennon a retired software executive who served as head usher on sundays and who counted itemized and deposited the sunday collections devon had long since learned to read peoples faces and to know instantly if there was a genuine problem that was what he was reading in lennons weathered face whats up frank he asked mack was at the eleven dev lennon said flatly he dropped a note for you in the basket it was folded inside a twentydollar bill monsignor devon mackenzie grabbed the scrap of paper read the ten words printed on it then not trusting what he was seeing read them again uncle devon tell carolyn she must not look for me e very year for the past nine years aaron klein had made the long drive from manhattan to the cemetery in bridgehampton to place a stone on the grave of his mother esther klein she had been a lively fiftyfouryearold divorcee who died at the hands of a mugger as she was on her daily run early one morning near the cathedral of st john the divine aaron had been twentyeight then newly married comfortably secure in his upward climb at wallace and madison investment bankers now he was the father of two sons eli and gabriel and a small daughter danielle who bore a heartbreaking resemblance to her late grandmother aaron never visited the cemetery without once again experiencing anger and frustration at the fact that his mothers murderer was still walking the streets a free man she had been struck in the back of the head with a heavy object her cell phone was on the ground beside her had she sensed danger and taken it out of her pocket to try to dial that possibility was the only one that made sense she had to have been attempting to call the records the police obtained showed she had neither made nor received a call at that time the cops thought it was a random mugging her watch the only jewelry that she ever wore at that time of day was missing as was her house key why take her house key if whoever killed her didnt know who she was and where she lived he had asked the cops they hadnt had an answer to that one her apartment had its own streetlevel entrance around the corner from the doormanmonitored main entrance of the building but as the detectives who worked on the case pointed out there was nothing missing from it her wallet containing several hundred dollars was in her pocketbook her jewelry box open on the dresser held the few pieces of valuable jewelry he knew her to own the intermittent rain began to fall again as aaron knelt down and touched the grass over his mothers grave his knees sank into the muddy ground as he placed the stone and whispered mom i so wish you had lived to see the kids the boys are finishing the first grade and kindergarten danielle is a little actress already i can just see her in a dozen years auditioning for one of the plays youd be directing at columbia he smiled thinking of what his mothers response would be aaron youre a dreamer do your math by the time danielle is in college id have been seventyfive years old youd still be teaching and directing and youd still be full of spunk he said aloud o n monday morning carrying the note mack had dropped in the collection basket i set off for the district attorneys office in lower manhattan it was beautiful out sunny and warm with a balmy breeze the kind of weather that would have been appropriate for mothers day instead of the cold wet day that had spoiled any hope of outdoor gatherings mom and uncle dev and i had gone out to dinner sunday night obviously the note that uncle dev handed us sent mom and me into a tailspin moms initial reaction was to be thrilled that mack might be so near she has always been convinced that he is far away in colorado or california then she became fearful that my threat to find him had put him in some kind of jeopardy at first i simply didnt know what to think about it but now i had a growing suspicion that mack might be head over heels in trouble and trying to keep us away from it the lobby at hogan place was crowded and the security was as tight as it gets even though i had plenty of identification without a specific appointment to see someone i could not get past the guard as the people on line behind me began to get restless i tried to explain that my brother was missing and we might finally have something to indicate where we could begin looking for him maam youll have to place a phone call to missing persons and make an appointment the guard insisted now please there are other people who need to get upstairs to their jobs frustrated i walked outside the building and pulled out my cell phone judge huot had been in civil court and i never had much contact with the assistant das but i did know one matt wilson i called the district attorneys office and was connected to his phone matt wasnt at his desk and had recorded the usual answering machine instructions leave your name number and a brief message ill get back to you this is carolyn mackenzie i began weve met a few times i was judge huots law clerk my brother has been missing for ten years he left a note for me yesterday in a church on amsterdam avenue i need help to see if we can track him down before he disappears again i finished by giving my cell phone number i was standing on the steps a man was going past me a squareshouldered guy in his midfifties with closecropped gray hair and a purposeful stride i could tell that he had overheard me because somewhat to my dismay he stopped and turned around for a moment we eyed each other then he said abruptly im detective barrott ill take you upstairs five minutes later i was sitting in a shabby small office that contained a desk a couple of chairs and stacks of files we can talk in here he said too much noise in the squad room he never took his eyes off my face as i told him about mack only interrupting me to ask a few questions calls only on mothers day thats right never asks for money never i had put the note in a plastic sandwich bag i dont know if his fingerprints might be on it i explained unless of course he had someone else drop it in the basket for him it seems so crazy that he would take a chance on uncle dev spotting him from the altar depends he might have dyed his hair could be twenty pounds heavier be wearing dark glasses it isnt hard to disguise yourself in a crowd especially when people are wearing rain gear he looked at the scrap of paper the writing was plainly visible through the plastic do we have your brothers fingerprints on file im not sure by the time we reported him missing our housekeeper had dusted and vacuumed his room at home he shared the student apartment with two of his friends and like most of those places there were at least a dozen others who were in and out every day his car was washed and cleaned after the last time he used it barrott handed it back to me we can run this paper through for prints but i can tell you now we wont get anything you and your mother handled it so did your uncle the monsignor so did the usher who brought it to your uncle my guess is that at least one other usher might have helped to add up the collection feeling as though i needed to offer more i said im macks only sibling my mother and father and i came in to register with the familial dna laboratory but weve never heard from them so i guess theyve never found anyone who could be even a partial match ms mackenzie from what you tell me your brother had absolutely no reason to willingly disappear but if he did that there was and is a reason youve probably watched some of these crime programs on television so you probably have heard that when people disappear the reason usually ends up being an accumulation of problems caused by either love or money the jilted suitor the jealous husband or wife the inconvenient spouse the addict frantic for a fix you have to reexamine all your preconceived notions about your brother he was twentyone you say he was popular with the girls was there one special girl no one his friends told us about certainly no one who ever came forward at his age a lot of kids gamble too much a lot more experiment with drugs and become addicted suppose he was in debt how would your father and mother have reacted to that i found myself reluctant to answer then i reminded myself that these were questions my mother and father had undoubtedly been asked ten years ago i wondered if they had been evasive my father would have been furious i admitted he had no use for people who threw away money my mother has a private income from an inheritance if mack needed money he could have gotten it from her and she wouldnt have told dad all right ms mackenzie im going to be perfectly honest with you i dont think we have a crime here so we cant treat your brothers disappearance as a crime you cant imagine how many people walk out of their lives every day theyre stressed they cant cope or even worse they dont want to cope anymore your brother calls you regularly once a year i interrupted which is still regularly you tell him youre going to track him down and he responds immediately leave me alone is his message to you i know it sounds rough but my advice is to make yourself realize that mack is where he wants to be and the most connection he wants to have with you and your mother is that one mothers day call do the three of you a favor respect his wishes he stood up clearly our interview was over clearly i should not waste the time of the police department any longer i picked up the note and as i did reread the message uncle devon tell carolyn she must not look for me youve been veryhonest detective barrott i said substituting the word honest for helpful i didnt think he had been helpful in the least i promise i wont bother you anymore f or twenty years gus and lil kramer now in their early seventies had been the superintendents of a fourstory apartment building on west end avenue that the owner derek olsen had renovated for student housing as olsen explained when he hired them look college kids smart or dumb are basically slobs theyll have boxes of pizza piled up in the kitchen theyll amass enough empty beer cans to float a battleship theyll drop their dirty clothes and wet towels on the floor we dont care they all move out when they graduate my point he had continued is that i can raise the rent as much as i want but only as long as the common areas look sharp i expect you two to keep the lobby and hallways looking like fifth avenue digs i want the heat and the airconditioning always working any plumbing problems fixed on the double the sidewalk swept every day i want a quick paint job when a space is vacated when the new arrivals come with their parents to check out the place i want all of them to be impressed for twenty years the kramers had faithfully followed olsens instructions and the building where they worked was known as upscale student housing all the students who passed through it were fortunate enough to have parents with deep pockets a number of those parents made separate arrangements for the kramers to regularly clean the lodgings of their offspring the kramers had celebrated a mothers day brunch at tavern on the green with their daughter winifred and her husband perry unfortunately the conversation had been almost completely a monologue from winifred urging them to quit their jobs and retire to their cottage in pennsylvania this was a monologue theyd heard before one that always ended with the refrain mom and dad i hate to think of you two sweeping and mopping and vacuuming after those kids lil kramer had long since learned to say you may be right dear ill think about it over rainbow sherbet gus kramer had minced no words when were ready to quit well quit not before what would i do with myself all day late monday afternoon as lil was knitting a sweater for the expected first child of one of the former students she was thinking about winifreds wellmeant but irritating advice why doesnt winifred understand that i love being with these kids she fumed for us its almost like having grandchildren she certainly never gave us any the ring of the telephone startled her now that gus was getting a little hard of hearing he had raised the volume but it was much too loud you could wake up the dead with that racket lil thought as she hurried to answer it as she picked up the receiver she found herself hoping that it wasnt winifred following up on her retirement speech a moment later she wished it had been winifred hello this is carolyn mackenzie is this mrs kramer yes lil felt her mouth go dry my brother mack was living in your building when he disappeared ten years ago yes he was mrs kramer we heard from mack the other day he wont tell us where he is you can understand what this is doing to my mother and me im going to try to find him we have reason to believe that hes living in the area may i come and talk with you no lil thought no but she heard herself answering the only way possible of course you can iwewere very fond of mack when do you want to see us tomorrow morning too soon lil thought i need more time tomorrows very busy for us then wednesday morning around eleven yes i guess thats all right gus came in as she was replacing the receiver who was that he asked carolyn mackenzie shes starting her own investigation into her brothers disappearance shes coming to talk to us wednesday morning lil watched as her husbands broad face reddened and behind his glasses his eyes narrowed in two strides his short stocky body was in front of her last time you let the cops see you were nervous lil dont let that happen in front of the sister you hear me dont let it happen this time o n monday afternoon detective roy barrotts shift was up at four pm it had been a relatively slow day and at three oclock he realized that he had nothing to command his immediate attention but something was bothering him like his tongue roving through his mouth to find the source of a sore spot his mind began to retrace the day searching for the source of the discomfort when he remembered his interview with carolyn mackenzie he knew that he had found it the look of dismay and contempt he had seen in her eyes when she left him made him feel both ashamed and embarrassed now she was desperately worried about her brother and had hoped that the note hed left in the collection basket at church might be a step toward finding him although she hadnt said it she obviously thought he might be in some kind of trouble i brushed her off barrott thought when she left she said she wouldnt bother me again that was the word she used bother now as he leaned back in his desk chair in the crowded squad room barrott shut out the sounds of the ringing telephones that surrounded him then he shrugged it wouldnt kill me to take a look at the file he decided if nothing else to satisfy myself that its nothing more than a guy who doesnt want to be found a guy who will one day change his mind and end up on dr phil being reunited with his mother and sister while everybody has a good cry wincing at a touch of arthritis in his knee he got up went down to the records department signed out the mackenzie file brought it back to his desk and opened it besides the pile of official reports and the statements from charles mackenzie jrs family and friends there was a legalsized envelope filled with pictures barrott pulled them out and scattered them on his desk one immediately caught his eye it was a christmas card with the mackenzie family standing in front of their christmas tree it reminded barrott of the christmas card that he and beth had sent in december the two of them with the kids melissa and rick standing in front of their christmas tree he still had that card in his desk somewhere the mackenzies got a lot more dolled up for their picture than we did barrott thought the father and son were in tuxedos the mother and daughter in evening gowns but the overall effect was the same a smiling happy family wishing their friends the joys of christmas and greetings for the new year it had to be the last one they sent before the son disappeared now charles mackenzie jr had been missing for ten years and charles mackenzie sr had been dead since barrott rummaged through some personal papers in his desk and pulled out his familys card he rested his elbows on the desk and held up the two christmas cards comparing them im lucky he thought rick has just finished his freshman year at fordham on the deans list and melissa another straighta kid is finishing her junior year at cathedral high and going to a prom tonight beth and i are more than lucky were blessed the thought crossed his mind suppose something happened to me on this job and rick walked out of his dorm and disappeared what if i wasnt around to find him rick wouldnt do that to his mother and sister not in one hundred thousand years he told himself but that in essence is what carolyn mackenzie wants me to believe about her brother slowly barrott closed the charles mackenzie jr file and slid it into the top drawer of his desk ill look it over in the morning he decided and maybe drop in on some of those people who gave statements at that time cant hurt to ask some questions and see if their memories got refreshed along the way it was four oclock time to shove off he wanted to be home in time to take pictures of melissa in her prom dress with her date jason kelly a nice enough kid barrott reflected but so thin that if he drank a glass of tomato juice it would be as visible as mercury in a thermometer i also want to have a little chat with the limo driver whos picking up the kids just to get a look at his license and let him know that hed better not even think of driving one mile over the speed limit he stood and put on his jacket you take all the precautions you can to protect your children barrott thought as he turned and yelled see you to the guys in the squad room and walked down the corridor but sometimes no matter what you do something goes wrong and your kid becomes involved in an accident or is the victim of foul play please god he prayed as he pushed the button for the elevator dont let it ever happen to us u ncle dev had told elliott wallace about the note mack left in the collection box and on monday evening elliott met us for dinner only a flicker of anxiety showed through his typically unruffled exterior elliott is the ceo and chairman of wallace and madison the investment firm on wall street that handles the family finances hed been one of my fathers best friends and mack and i have always considered him a surrogate uncle divorced for years elliott is in love with my mother i think i also believe that her lack of interest in him in the years since dad died is one more casualty of macks disappearance as soon as we were settled at his favorite table in le cirque i handed elliott macks note and told him it made me more determined than ever to find him i had really hoped that elliott would side with me in my decision to try to find mack but he disappointed me carolyn he said slowly as he read and reread the note i dont think youre being fair to mack he calls every year so that youll know hes all right youve told me yourself that he sounds confident even happy he responds immediately to your promiseor threatto find him in the most direct means at his disposal he orders you to leave him alone why dont you go along with his wishes and more important why dont you refuse to allow mack to remain the center of your existence it was not the kind of question id expected from elliott and i could see the effort it took for him to make it his eyes were troubled his forehead creased as he turned his gaze from me to my mother whose own expression had become unreadable i was glad we were at a corner table where no one else could observe her i was afraid she would flare up at elliott as she had at me after macks call on mothers day or even worse break into a storm of weeping when she didnt answer him elliott urged olivia give mack the space he wants be satisfied that hes alive even take comfort in the fact that hes obviously close by i can tell you right now that if charley were here thats exactly what he would be telling you my mother always surprises me she picked up a fork and in an absentminded way traced something on the cloth with the prongs i would bet anything it was macks name as soon as she began to speak i realized i had been completely wrong in evaluating her response to macks note since dev showed us that message from mack last night ive been thinking somewhat in the same vein elliott she said the pain in her voice was evident but there was no hint of tears there i lashed out at carolyn because she became angry at mack that wasnt fair to her i know that carolyn worries about me all the time now mack has given us an answer not the answer i wanted but thats the way it is here mom tried to smile i am going to try to consider him an awol sonabsent without leave he may live in this area as you say he did respond quickly and if he doesnt want to see us carolyn and i are going to respect his wishes she paused then added firmly so there olivia i hope you stick to that decision elliott said fervently im surely going to try as a first step my friends the clarences are leaving for a cruise on their yacht starting at the greek islands this friday theyve been trying to persuade me to join them im going to do it she put her fork down in a gesture of finality i sat back and pondered this unexpected turn of events i had planned to talk to elliott about my appointment with the superintendents of macks building on wednesday now of course i wouldnt ironically mom had finally come to accept macks situation as i had begged her to for years and now i didnt welcome it as every hour passed i was more and more convinced that mack was in serious trouble and facing it alone i was about to raise that possibility but then clamped my lips together with mom away i could search for mack without having to cover up what i was doing or worse yet lying to her about it how long is the cruise mom i asked at least three weeks i think its a great idea i said honestly so do i elliott agreed now what about you carolyn still interested in becoming an assistant district attorney absolutely i said but ill wait a month or so to apply if im lucky enough to be hired i wont have any time off for quite a while the evening progressed pleasantly mom lovely in a pale blue silk shirt and matching slacks became animated and smiling far more than i had seen her for years it was as though coming to terms with macks situation was giving her peace elliotts mood brightened as he watched her growing up i used to wonder if elliott wore a shirt and tie to bed he is always terribly formal but when mom turns on the charm he simply melts hes a few years older than mom which makes me wonder if his head of charcoal brown hair can possibly be natural but i think it may be he carries himself with the erect posture of a career military officer his expression is usually reserved even aloof until he smiles or laughs and then his whole appearance lightens up and you can catch a glimpse of a more spontaneous person hiding behind his ingrained formality he jokes about himself my father franklin delano wallace was named after his distant cousin president franklin delano roosevelt who remained fathers hero why do you think my name is elliott that was the name the president chose for one of his sons and despite all he did for the common man remember that roosevelt was first and foremost an aristocrat im afraid my father was not only an aristocrat but a downright snob so when i come across too stuffy blame it on the stuffed shirt who raised me by the time we finished coffee i had decided that i absolutely would not even hint to elliott that i was going to actively search for mack i offered to stay at moms apartment while she was away a fact that pleased her she isnt impressed with the studio in greenwich village that i rented last september when i started my clerkship with the judge she certainly didnt know that my reason for staying at sutton place was to be available if mack learned that i was still looking for him and tried to reach me there outside the restaurant i hailed a cab elliott and mom chose to walk to sutton place as the cab pulled away i watched with mixed feelings as elliott took moms arm and their shoulders brushing they went down the street together s ixtysevenyearold retired surgeon dr david andrews did not know why he had felt so uneasy after putting his daughter back on the train to manhattan where she was completing her junior year at nyu leesey and her older brother gregg had come up to greenwich to be with him on mothers day a tough day for all of them only the second one without helen the three of them had visited her grave in st marys cemetery then gone out for an early dinner at the club leesey had planned to drive back to the city with gregg but at the last minute decided to stay overnight and go back in the morning my first class is eleven oclock she had explained and i feel like hanging around with you dad sunday evening they had gone through some of the photograph albums and talked about helen i miss her so much leesey had whispered me too honey he had confided but monday morning when he dropped her at the station leesey had been her usual bubbly self which was why david andrews could not understand the gnawing sense of worry that undermined his golf game both monday and tuesday on tuesday evening he turned on the news and was dozing in front of the television when the phone rang it was kate carlisle leeseys best friend with whom she shared an apartment in greenwich village her question and the troubled voice in which she asked it caused him to bolt up from the easy chair dr andrews is leesey there no she isnt kate why would she be here he asked as he spoke he glanced around the room even though he had sold the big house after helens death and shed never been in this condo when the phone rang he instinctively looked around for her her hand outstretched to take the receiver from him when there was no answer he demanded sharply kate why are you looking for leesey i dont know i just hoped kates voice broke kate tell me what happened last night she went out with some of our friends to the woodshed a new place weve been talking about trying where is it its on the border of the village and soho leesey stayed after the others left there was a really good band and you know how she loves to dance what time did the others leave it was about two oclock dr andrews had leesey been drinking not much she was fine when they left but she wasnt here when i woke up this morning and no one has seen her all day ive been trying to reach her on her cell phone but she doesnt answer ive been calling everyone i could think of who might have seen her but no one has did you call that place where she was last night i spoke to the bartender there he said that leesey stayed till they closed at three oclock and then left alone he swore that she absolutely wasnt drunk or anywhere near it she just stayed till the end andrews closed his eyes trying desperately to sort out the steps he needed to take let her be all right god he prayed leesey the unexpected baby born when helen was fortyfive years old and they had long since given up hope of having a second child impatiently he pulled his legs off the hassock pushed it aside stood up brushed back his thick white hair from his forehead then swallowed to activate the salivary glands inside his suddenly dry mouth the commuter traffic is over he thought it shouldnt take more than an hour to get down to greenwich village from greenwich connecticut to greenwich village leesey had joyfully announced three years ago when she decided to take early acceptance at nyu kate ill start down right away andrews said ill call leeseys brother well meet you at the apartment how far is this bar from your place about a mile would she have taken a cab it was nice out she probably would have walked alone on dark streets late at night andrews thought trying to keep his voice from breaking he said ill be there in an hour keep calling anyone you can think of who might have an idea where she is dr gregg andrews was showering when the phone rang and he decided to let the answering machine pick it up he was off duty and had a date with someone he had met the night before at a cocktail reception for the launching of a novel by a friend now a cardiac surgeon at new yorkpresbyterian hospital as his father had been until his retirement he toweled dry walked into his bedroom and considered the fact that the may evening had begun to turn cool from his closet he chose an opennecked longsleeve light blue shirt tan slacks and a navy blue jacket leesey tells me i always look so stuffy he remembered thinking with a smile of the little sister who was twelve years his junior she says i should get some cool colors and mix them up she also says i should get contact lenses and get rid of my crew cut he thought gregg youre really cute not handsome but cute she had told him matteroffactly i mean women like men who look as though they have a brain in their heads and they always fall for doctors its kind of a daddy complex i think but it doesnt hurt to look a little zippy the message light was blinking on the phone he debated whether he should bother to check it now but then pressed the play button gregg its dad leeseys roommate just called me leesey is missing she left a bar alone last night and no one has seen her since im on my way to her apartment meet me there chilled gregg andrews stopped the machine and pushed the numeral that rang his fathers car dad i just got your message he said when his father answered ill meet you at leeseys apartment on the way ill call larry ahearn just dont drive too fast grabbing his cell phone gregg rushed out of his apartment caught the elevator as it was descending from an upper floor ran through the lobby and ignoring the doorman rushed out into the road to flag down a cab as usual at this hour there was none to be seen with the light on frantically he looked up and down the street hoping to spot one of the gypsy limos that were often available on park avenue he spotted one that was parked halfway down the block and rushed to get in it he barked leeseys address to the driver then opened his cell phone to call his college roommate at georgetown who was now captain of detectives in the manhattan district attorneys office after two rings he heard larry ahearns voice instructing the caller to leave a message shaking his head in frustration gregg said larry its gregg call me on my cell leesey is missing he checks his calls all the time gregg reminded himself as the car threaded its way downtown with agonizing slowness when they were passing fiftysecond street he remembered that in fifteen minutes the young woman he had met last night would be waiting for him in the bar of the four seasons he was about to leave a message for her when ahearn called back tell me about leesey he ordered she was in a bar or club or whatever you want to call those places in the village and soho last night she left alone when it closed and never got home whats the name of the bar i dont know yet i didnt think to ask dad hes on his way in who would know leeseys roommate kate shes the one who just called dad im meeting him at the apartment she and leesey share give me kates phone number ill get back to you larry ahearns private office was adjacent to the squad room he was glad that at this moment no one could see the expression on his face leesey had been six years old when he visited the andrews home in greenwich the fall of his freshman year in georgetown he had seen her grow up from a pretty kid to a strikingly beautiful young woman the kind any guy never mind a predator would zone in on she left the bar alone when it closed dear god that crazy kid they just dont get it larry ahearn knew that soon he would have to tell gregg and leeseys father that in the last ten years three young women had disappeared in that same sohovillage area after spending an evening in one of those bars o n wednesday morning as eleven oclock drew near lil kramer became increasingly uneasy ever since the call came from carolyn mackenzie on monday gus had been constantly warning her to say only what she knew about macks disappearance ten years ago which is nothing he kept reminding her absolutely nothing just do your usual stuff about what a nice young man he was period no nervousnelly glances at me to help you out the apartment was always immaculate but today the sun was especially bright and like a magnifying glass exposed the worn areas on the arms of the couch and the chip on the corner of the glass coffee table i never wanted that glass table lil thought glad to find an object to blame for her distress its too big it doesnt go with this oldfashioned furniture when winifred redecorated her own apartment she insisted that i take it and get rid of my nice leathertop table that was aunt jessies wedding gift to me this glass thing is too big and im always bumping my knees on it and it doesnt match the end tables like the other one did she thought her mind jumped to another source of concern i just hope that altmans not here when the mackenzie girl comes in howard altman the real estate agent and manager for the nine small apartment buildings owned by mr olsen had arrived an hour ago for one of his unscheduled visits gus called him olsens gestapo it was altmans job to make sure that the individual superintendents were keeping everything up to snuff he never even has the slightest complaint about us lil thought what scares me is that whenever he comes into this apartment he always says its a waste of money to have two people living in a big fiveroom corner unit if he thinks ill ever switch to a pokey onebedroom he has another think coming she told herself indignantly as she adjusted the leaves in the artificial plant on the windowsill then she stiffened as she heard voices in the hall and realized that gus was coming in with altman even though it was warm outside howard altman as usual was wearing a shirt tie and jacket lil could not see him without thinking of winifreds scornful description of him hes a wannabe mom he thinks getting all dolled up to inspect apartment buildings will make people think hes hot stuff he was a superintendent just like you and dad until he started kissing the feet of old man olsen dont let him bother you but he does bother me lil thought he bothers me because of the way he looks around as he walks in the door i know that someday hes going to try to make us switch apartments so that he can tell mr olsen hes figured out a new way to make more money for him he bothers me because as mr olsen got older he practically turned over the running of all the buildings to altman the door opened and gus and altman came in well hello lil howard altman said heartily as he crossed the living room with long strides and an outstretched hand to greet her today he was wearing trendy sunglasses a light tan jacket and brown slacks a white shirt and striped green and tan tie his sandy hair was too short in lils opinion and it was too early in the season to have such a deep tan winifred was sure he spent half his spare time in a tanning salon but all of the above considered she grudgingly admitted he was a goodlooking man with even features dark brown eyes an athletes build and a warm smile if you didnt know how petty he could be he could fool you she thought he took her hand in a firm grip he claims he hasnt hit forty yet i say that hes fortyfive if hes a day lil thought as she gave him a tight smile i dont know why i even bother to stop by here howard said jovially if i could only have the two of you in all our buildings we could make a fortune well we try to keep everything nice gus said in the fawning voice that drove lil crazy you do more than try you succeed it was good of you to stop by lil said glancing at the clock on the mantel it was five minutes of eleven couldnt pass by without popping my head in to say hello ill be on my way now the intercom rang from the foyer and lil was sure it was carolyn mackenzie she and gus exchanged glances and he went to the phone on the wall yes of course come right in were expecting you dont say her name lil prayed dont say her name when howard sees her on his way out hell probably think she wants to inquire about an apartment ms mackenzie gus finished apartment b to the right as you come into the foyer lil watched as the goodbye smile on howard altmans face disappeared mackenzie wasnt that the name of the guy who disappeared just before i came to work for mr olsen there was no answer except yes howard mr olsen told me how upsetting that publicity was he felt it really tarnished the image of this building why is she coming to see you as gus walked to the door he said flatly she wants to talk about her brother id like to meet her howard altman said quietly if you dont mind ill stay i m not really sure what i expected when i walked into that building on west end avenue i remember mack showing me the apartment after he moved out of the dorm at columbia he was beginning his junior year then so i was just turning fifteen because he lived in the city there was no need for our parents or me to visit him there instead he dropped in at home or met us at a restaurant regularly i know that after he vanished my mother and father went up to talk to his roommates and other people in the building but they never let me come with them that first summer they made me go back to camp even though all i wanted to do was to help look for my brother as it turned out i was glad that the kramers couldnt meet me until now yesterday my mother had me out all day with her doing some lastminute shopping for her cruise then the eleven oclock news last night carried the story of an nyu student who vanished early yesterday morning after leaving a bar in soho there was a shot of her father and brother leaving her apartment building in the village and i realized with a jolt that it was right next door to mine i ached for them no amount of money can convince mom that living in the village is every bit as safe as living on sutton place for her the sutton place apartment is a haven a home she and my father joyfully bought when she was pregnant with me at first it was a large sixroom onefloor apartment but then as my father became more and more successful he bought the apartment above us turned the two into a duplex and doubled its size now to me it seems like a prison where until now my mother has been listening always listening for the key to turn in the door and mack to call out im home for me that belief that he might return has become a frustration a sadness that wont ever go away i feel so terribly selfish i loved mack my big brother my pal but i dont want to have my life on hold any longer even the decision to wait before i apply for a job in the das office isnt about the fact that being hired means no time off for awhile its all about trying to find mack and if i fail promising myself that then ill get on with my own life at last ill spend most of these three weeks in sutton place while moms away but thats not to feel safeits just in case mack has some way of knowing im beginning to talk to everyone who was ever close to him and tries to call me this building where mack had lived was old the façade that gray stone that was so popular in new york in the early twentieth century but the sidewalk and steps were clean the handle of the outer door polished that door was unlocked and opened into a narrow foyer where one can either dial an apartment number and be buzzed in or use a key to open the door to the lobby i had spoken to mrs kramer and i dont really know why but somehow i expected to hear her voice on the intercom instead a man responded and directed me to their groundfloor apartment when i got inside the door of b was already open and a man was waiting for me who introduced himself as gus kramer the superintendent as i was going over the file this morning i remembered what my father had said about him that guy is more worried that hell be blamed for macks disappearance than hes concerned that something happened to mack and his wife is worse she had the gall to say that mr olsen would be upset as if we have to be concerned about the owner of that renovated tenement its funny that when i was dressing for this appointment i kept changing my mind about what to wear i had actually laid out a lightweight pantsuit the kind i wore to court when i was working for the judge but somehow it seemed too businesslike i wanted the kramers to feel comfortable with me as much as possible i wanted them to see me as macks kid sister to like me to want to help that was why i decided to wear a longsleeve cotton sweater jeans and sandals as a portent for success i wore the chain mack gave me on my sixteenth birthday there were two gold charms on it one of ice skates the other a soccer ball in honor of my two favorite sports after gus kramer introduced himself and invited me in it was like stepping back in time despite daddys success he could never budge my grandmother from her apartment in jackson heights queens this one had the same velour furniture machinemade persian carpet and leathertop end tables as hers the only thing that seemed out of place was the glass coffee table my first impression of gus and lil kramer was that they were the kind of people who grow to look alike after years together her steelgray hair was exactly the same shade as his they were a little shorter than average height with sturdy bodies their eyes were a matching pale blue and there was no mistaking the wary expression in both faces as they offered me a begrudging smile actually it was the third person in the room who took over as host ms mackenzie im so pleased to meet you i am howard altman the district manager of olsen properties i wasnt here at the time of your brothers disappearance but i know how concerned mr olsen wasand has beenabout it why dont we all sit down and let you tell us how we can be of assistance to you i could sense the resentment the kramers had to altman taking over but for me it made it easier to deliver my planned speech i sat on the edge of the nearest chair and addressed myself to him as you obviously have heard my brother mack disappeared ten years ago there simply hasnt been a trace of him since then but he does call us every mothers day as he did a few days ago i got on the phone while he was talking to my mother and vowed to find him later that day he went to st francis a church in this neighborhood where my uncle is the pastor and left a note for me to warn me away im so afraid mack may be in some kind of trouble and ashamed to ask for help a note lil kramers exclamation silenced me i was astonished to see the way her cheeks became flushed and the unconscious gesture with which she reached over and grasped her husbands hand you mean he went to st francis and left a note for you she asked yes at the eleven oclock mass why would that surprise you mrs kramer i know over the years that there have been articles about my brothers disappearance and the fact that he contacts us gus kramer answered for his wife ms mackenzie my wife has always felt terrible about your brother he was one of the nicest politest kids we ever had here thats what mr olsen said howard altman told me then he smiled ms mackenzie let me explain mr olsen is so aware of the pitfalls that occur in this day and age with young people even intellectually gifted young people he was always around to greet new students hes up there in years now but hes told me about how impressed he was with your parents and your brother and i can tell you the kramers have always kept a sharp eye out for heavy drinking or worse drug use if your brother had encountered some kind of problem it didnt begin or continue under this roof this from a man who didnt know mack who only knew about him the message was loud and clear dont look here for your brothers problem lady i dont mean to suggest that anything about mack residing here triggered his disappearance but you can understand that it makes sense for me to start searching for him in the last place where he was seen the brother i knew would never willingly cause my mother and father and me the grief and anxiety we have been living with for ten years i felt the tears that were always too close to the surface shining in my eyes as i corrected myself i mean the anxiety my mother and i experience constantly i think you may already know that my father was a victim your brother never seemed like the kind of young man who would just disappear without a mighty important reason gus kramer agreed his tone was sincere but i did not miss the glance he shot at his wife or the fact that she was nervously biting her lips did you ever consider the possibility that your brother may have experienced a cerebral hemorrhage or any other physical condition that might have given him an attack of amnesia or even partial amnesia howard altman asked im considering everything i told him i reached into my shoulder bag and took out a notebook and pen mr and mrs kramer i know its been ten years but could i just ask you to tell me what you remember about anything mack did or said that might have some significance i mean sometimes we think of something that didnt occur to us at the time maybe as mr altman just suggested mack had some kind of amnesia attack did he seem in any way troubled or worried or as though he wasnt feeling well physically as i asked these questions i thought of how after the police gave up on trying to find mack my father then hired private investigator lucas reeves to continue the search for the last few days ive been reviewing every word of his files everything the kramers told him was in my notes i listened as mrs kramer hesitantly then enthusiastically told me how mack was the kind of young man who always held the door open for her who put his laundry in his hamper who always picked up after himself i never saw him look troubled she said the last time she had seen him was when she tidied up the apartment he shared with two other seniors both of the other boys were out he was working on his computer in his bedroom and told me the vacuum wouldnt bother him thats the way he always was easy nice polite what time was that i asked her she pursed her lips about ten oclock in the morning i would guess that would be right gus kramer confirmed quickly and you never saw him again i saw him leave the building at about three oclock i was on my way home from the dentist i was putting my key in the lock of our apartment gus heard me and opened the door we both saw mack come down the stairs he waved as he went through the lobby i watched her glance at her husband for approval what was mack wearing mrs kramer what he had on in the morning a tshirt and jeans and sneakers and lil youre mixed up again mack was wearing a jacket and slacks and an opennecked sport shirt when he left gus kramer interrupted sharply thats what i meant she said hurriedly its just i keep seeing him in the tshirt and jeans because thats when i had a little talk with him that morning her face convulsed gus and i had nothing to do with his disappearance she cried why are you torturing us as i stared at her i thought of what lucas reeves the private investigator had written in his file that the kramers were nervous that they might lose their jobs because of macks disappearance now nearly ten years later i didnt accept that reasoning they were nervous because they had something to hide now they were trying to keep their stories straight ten years ago mrs kramer had told reeves that mack was just coming out of the building when she saw him and that her husband was in the lobby at that moment i would have bet my life that neither one of them ever saw mack leave this building or did he ever leave it that question rushed into my mind and was immediately dismissed i know how long its been i said but would it be possible to see the apartment where my brother lived i could see that my request startled them this time both kramers looked to howard altman for guidance of course the apartment has been rented he said but since its the end of the term many of the students have already left what is the situation in d lil the two who shared the larger bedroom are gone walter cannon has macks old room but hes leaving today then perhaps you could phone and ask if ms mackenzie might stop in altman suggested a moment later we were climbing the stairs to the fourth floor the students dont mind stairs altman told me i must say im glad i dont go up and down them every day walter cannon was a sixfootfour twentytwoyearold who waved aside my apologies for the interruption im just glad you werent here an hour ago he said i had stuff all over the place he explained that he was on his way home to new hampshire for a summer vacation and was starting law school in the fall hes at the same point in time mack was when he disappeared i thought sadly the apartment coincided with my vague memory of it a small foyer now stacked with the luggage cannon would be carrying a kitchen directly opposite the outer door a hall to the right with a sitting room and bedroom off it a bathroom at the end to the left of the foyer a second bath and beyond it the bedroom where mack had lived not listening to altmans comments about how well the apartments were maintained i walked into what had been macks bedroom the walls and ceilings were offwhite a light flowered cotton spread was tossed on the bed matching drapery panels framed the two windows a dresser desk and easy chair completed the furnishings a walltowall bluegray carpet covered the floor this apartment like all the others after theyve been vacated will have a fresh coat of paint immediately altman was saying the carpet and spread and drapes will be cleaned gus kramer will make sure the kitchen and baths are spotless were very proud of our units mack lived here for two years i thought i imagined him feeling about it the way i feel about my apartment it was his own space he could get up early or late read or not read answer the phone or not answer the phone the closet door was open and of course it was empty now i thought about the kramers claim that he was wearing a jacket and opennecked shirt and slacks when he left that afternoon what was the weather like that day i wondered was it one of those chilly may afternoons like last sunday or if it was very warm and mack did leave at three oclock would wearing a jacket have any significance a date a drive to a girls house in connecticut or long island its funny but in that room ten years later i had a sense of his presence he was always so laid back dad had been competitive quick to size up a situation and with lightning accuracy appraise and judge it i know im like that too mack was more like mom he was always giving everyone a break like her if he ever realized he was being used or treated shabbily he wouldnt have a confrontation hed simply withdraw from the situation and that i think is what mom is doing nowshe views macks note in the collection basket as a slap in the face i moved to the window trying to see what he had seen knowing how mack loved to stand at the windows of the sutton place apartment and study the panorama the east river with boats and barges the lights of the bridges the air traffic heading in and out of laguardia airport i was sure hed often gazed out these windows overlooking west end avenue the sidewalks constantly streaming with people the vehicle traffic bumper to bumper in the street the dream i had had of him after his predawn phone call on mothers day replayed itself in my mind once again i was walking along a dark path desperate to find mack and once again he was warning me to stay back i n a weary voice dr david andrews said detective barrott leesey left that bar at three oclock yesterday morning it is now one oclock wednesday afternoon she has already been missing thirtyfour hours shouldnt you check the hospitals again if anyone knows how busy emergency rooms are god knows its me leeseys father was sitting at the small kitchen table in his daughters college apartment his hands folded his head bowed heartsick sleepdeprived and despairing he had refused his sons plea to go back with him to his apartment and wait for word there after being here all night gregg had gone home to shower and change before stopping at the hospital to see his postoperative patients roy barrott was sitting opposite leeseys father at the table the night my daughter went to a prom his daughter went to that joint then disappeared roy thought with a sudden guilty feeling at his own good fortune dr andrews he said you have to hold on to the possibility that leesey may be perfectly all right she is an adult and has the right to privacy barrott saw the expression on the doctors face harden into anger and scorn i sound like im suggesting that shes an easy pickup he thought and hurried to add please dont think i believe that this is the case with leesey were treating her disappearance as a serious problem barrotts boss captain larry ahearn had made the urgency of this case perfectly clear already then what are you doing to find her the anger drained from david andrewss face his voice was low and halting hes only one degree from going into shock barrott thought weve reviewed the security cameras of the woodshed and she did leave alone the only people left in the bar were the band that was playing the bartender and the security guard they all swear that none of them left for at least twenty minutes after leesey so we presume none of them followed her so far they all check out as okay guys right now our people are going over every frame in the security camera at that bar monday night to see if we can identify any potential troublemakers maybe someone who was there earlier waited outside for her david andrews knew that his voice was a monotone is this detective trying to reassure me he asked himself then the same thought crossed his mind for the thousandth time i know something terrible has happened to leesey he pushed his chair away from the table and stood up im going to offer a twentyfivethousanddollar reward to anyone who helps us find her he said im going to put her picture and a description of what she was wearing on posters youve met my daughters roommate kate shell get leeseys friends to tack them up on every street between that bar and this building somebody has to have seen something as a father thats exactly what i would do if i were in his shoes roy barrott thought as he got to his feet too dr andrews thats a very good idea give us the picture from your wallet and her height weight and hair color well take care of having the posters made it will be a big help if those posters are up when the bar crowd comes out tonight i can promise you our undercover people will be in the woodshed and every other dive around here talking to people with any luck we might find a person who saw someone paying a lot of attention to her but i would suggest sir you go to your sons apartment and get some rest ill have an officer drive you there im only in the way david andrews thought bleakly but hes righti do have to sleep without speaking he nodded the door from the bedroom was open kate carlisle had spent a sleepless night and now after napping briefly she saw them leaving with barrotts hand firmly under the doctors arm dr andrews are you all right she asked anxiously dr andrews is going to his sons apartment barrott explained ill be back and forth kate do you by any chance have a more recent photo of leesey the one ive seen that was in dr andrewss wallet is more than a year old yes i have a good one i took it only last week angelina jolie and brad pitt were walking in soho with their kids and the paparazzi were all around them i told leesey to pretend she was a movie star and i snapped a couple of pictures of her with my cell phone camera one of them is a terrific shot she was planning to have it framed for you dr andrews her voice broke flustered kate ran back into the bedroom opened a drawer in a night table grabbed a print from it and hurried back to them in the photo leesey had struck a models pose her smiling face turned to the camera her long hair tossed by the breeze her slender body almost slouching her hands buried deep in the pockets of her denim jacket barrotts eyes traveled from the lovely girl in the center to the passersby in the background none of the faces was clear was it possible one of them had noticed leesey he wondered a predator on the prowl ill get this enlarged he thought as he took it from kate this is a very clear picture of leesey he said i also want you to give me a print of the other picture you took of her from what i understand she was wearing a denim jacket the night she went to the club shes wearing a denim jacket in this picture she was wearing that same jacket kate said she bought it two years ago just before her mother died david andrews said it has a skirt she wore with it her mother laughed and told her that the skirt had strings hanging off it leesey told her that was the style her mother said if that was considered style it was time to bring back the hoopskirt i sound maudlin david andrews told himself im holding up this detective from finding leesey ive got to get out of the way here kate thats a good picture of leesey anyone who saw her could identify her from it thank you very much without waiting for her to answer he started for the door grateful for the strong hand under his arm in silence he walked down the three flights of stairs he was vaguely aware of a camera flashing and someone shouting questions at him as he crossed the sidewalk and was helped into a squad car he did remember to ask detective barrott what else he would do to try to find leesey barrott closed the car door and then leaned down to the window dr andrews weve already canvassed the people in this building we know from the security camera here that leesey didnt get to this door but these houses all look alike she might have gone to the wrong one were going to start door to door working the whole neighborhood it will help to have her picture why on earth would she go to the wrong door she didnt have too much to drink you told me that yourself the bartender and all those other people in the woodshed swear she was fine when she left that place david andrews reminded him sharply it was on the tip of barrotts tongue to reply that unless it can be proven otherwise ninetynine percent of bartenders will swear that a missing patron left the bar sober instead he said doctor no stone unturned thats my promise to you the single reporter on the scene stuck a microphone in barrotts face as he turned from the squad car look barrott said impatiently captain ahearn is holding a press conference at five oclock hes authorized to give a statement im not he walked back into the lobby of the building waited till he saw the reporter and cameraman get into their van and drive away then came back out and walked to the next building like most of them on this block the outer door was unlocked and admittance was gained either by a key or being buzzed in by a tenant barrotts eyes moved up and down the tenant list then they widened as he spotted one name carolyn mackenzie six degrees of separation he asked himself maybe roy barrott stood perfectly still then traced his index finger over carolyn mackenzies name the unerring instinct that made him such a superb detective was telling him that somehow someway there was a connection between the two cases a fter i left the apartment building where mack had lived i went back to sutton place in the day and a half since mom had made the decision to go on the cruise she had been energized as if after living so long in limbo she was trying to make up for lost time she told me she was planning to go through closets and pull out clothing to give away and then this evening she would be meeting elliott and some other friends for dinner i wondered why she would bother to clean out closets just before she went on vacation but that became evident over a quick lunch a sandwich and a cup of tea in the breakfast room she told me that she was listing the apartment with a broker and that as soon as she came back she was going to look for something smaller youre never going to move back in she said i know that i will have call forwarding just in case mack decides to phone next mothers day but on the other hand if i miss his call so be it i just may not hang around and wait for it i looked at her astonished when she said she was going to clean out closets i was thinking that she meant her own but now without asking i was sure that it was the closets in macks room that were going to be emptied what are you going to do with macks things i asked trying to sound casual ill have dev send someone to get them and deliver them to a place where theyll be put to good use mom looked at me for approval and finding something missing in my expression said quickly carolyn youre the one telling me to move on the fact remains that even if mack walked through the door today and even if his clothes still fit him theyd probably be out of style dont misunderstand me i told her i think its a good idea but i also think that its the last thing in the world you should be worrying about two days before youre getting on a plane to fly to greece look mom do yourself a favor let me go through macks clothes and sort them out even as i spoke it occurred to me that it was possible that ten years ago no one had ever carefully explored the pockets of slacks and jackets that mack had left in this apartment lucas reeves had indicated in his case report that nothing of importance was found in the clothing mack had left behind in his student apartment without much hesitation even with relief mom agreed i dont know what id do without you carolyn she said youve been my rod and staff through all this but i know you you only stopped working two weeks ago and i can tell youre restless what will you do while im gone she had inadvertently furnished me with a response that was at least partly honest we know someone will snap up this place in a heartbeat i said i never intended to stay in the studio indefinitely im going to look around for a bigger place myself youll let me have my pick of any furniture you dont take with you right of course let elliott know a decent onebedroom is an expenditure hell certainly approve elliott was the trustee of the money my grandfather had left me mom took the last gulp of tea and stood up id better rush helene will have a fit if im late for my hair appointment for the kind of money she charges she could stand to possess a little more humility she gave me a quick kiss on my cheek then added if you find an apartment you like make sure it has a doorman i never have been comfortable with you living in a place where you have to let yourself in ive been checking the news theres no sign of that girl who lived next door to you who disappeared god help her family i was glad mom had the salon appointment now that i was determined to find mack i had the sense that i must not lose a minute in my search for him geographically he had been so close to us when he left that note on sunday the meeting with the kramers had left me desperately uneasy memories do fade but when i spoke to them they had contradicted each other about what mack was wearing and exactly where they had seen him last also lil kramer had been absolutely shocked when i told her he had been at the mass why was mack a threat to them what did they know that scared them so much i had taken the report of investigator reeves from the file drawer in dads desk now i wanted to get the addresses of macks former roommates bruce galbraith and nicholas demarco nick had kept in touch with dad regularly in the beginning naturally as time passed he heard from him less and less frequently the last time i saw him was when he attended dads memorial mass but that day is a complete blur to me dads study isnt large but as he used to say it was big enough for what he needed his big desk dominated the paneled room to my mothers horror the faded ninebytwelve carpet that had been in his mothers living room was on the floor reminds me of where i came from liv he would say after one of her periodic efforts to get rid of it a worn leather chair with a hassock was his favorite spot in the morning he always got up very early made himself coffee and settled in that chair with the morning papers before showering and getting dressed to go to the office bookcases covered the wall opposite the windows scattered on them were framed pictures of the four of us from those happy days when we had been together dad had a presence that showed through even in casual pictures the determined jaw softened by the wide smile the keen intelligence in his eyes he had done everything possible to trace mack and would still be trying if he were alive im sure of that i opened the top drawer of his desk and took out his phone book on a slip of paper i wrote down bruce galbraiths phone number i remembered he had gone into the family real estate business in manhattan i copied both his home and business numbers nick demarco the son of immigrant parents who owned a small storefront restaurant in queens had been a scholarship student at columbia i remembered that after he got his mba from harvard he went into the restaurant business and i understand has been very successful both his home and business phone numbers and addresses were in manhattan i sat at dads desk and picked up the receiver i decided to call bruce first there was a reason for that when i was sixteen i had a fierce crush on nick he and mack were particularly close friends and mack regularly brought him home for dinner i lived for those dinners but then one night he and mack brought a girl with them barbara hanover was a senior at columbia and lived in the same student apartment building and it was immediately clear to me that nick was crazy about her even though i was absolutely crushed i thought i had kept up a good front that evening but mack could read me like a book before he nick and barbara left he pulled me aside and said carolyn i know you have big eyes for nick forget it hes got a different girlfriend every week stick to guys your own age my angry denial only caused mack to smile youll get over it were his parting words to me that night that was about six months before he disappeared and it was the last time i stayed home when nick was coming i was embarrassed and didnt want to be there the fact that it was obvious to mack that i had a crush on nick made me sure it had been obvious to everyone else i was grateful neither of my parents ever referred to it i got through to bruces secretary at galbraith real estate and was told that he was on a business trip until next monday did i care to leave a message i gave the secretary my name and phone number hesitated then added its about mack we just heard from him again then i called nick his office is at park avenue thats about a fifteenminute walk from sutton place i thought as i dialed when i asked for him his secretary picked up and crisply told me that if i was from the media any statement would be coming from mr demarcos lawyer im not from the media i said nick was a friend of my brothers at columbia im sorry i didnt realize he was having legal troubles maybe the sympathy in my voice and the use of his first name was the reason his secretary was so frank mr demarco is the owner of the woodshed the place where a young woman was last seen before she disappeared the other night she explained if you give me your telephone number ill have him return your call a aron klein had been working for wallace and madison for fourteen years he had started there directly after receiving his mba degree at that time joshua madison was chief executive of the privately held wealthmanagement company but when he died suddenly two years later his partner elliott wallace had taken over as chairman and ceo aaron had loved the gruff josh madison but initially he had been intimidated by wallace whose formal manner was completely the opposite of his own easygoing style then as aaron continued to rise steadily through the ranks working with higher and higherprofile clients elliott had begun to invite him to lunch in the executive dining room of their office on wall street a clear sign that he was being groomed for a top job ten years ago their relationship had taken a giant leap forward when elliott let down his guard and confided to aaron the grief and pain he was experiencing at the disappearance of charles mackenzie jr elliott had been managing the mackenzie money for years and after charles sr died on he spoke of olivia mackenzie and her children with an air of fierce protectiveness from everything elliott had ever said about the missing young man aaron knew that he looked on mack as a surrogate son the fact that aarons mother esther had taught mack in one of her drama classes at columbia only strengthened the bond between them then a year later when aarons mother was murdered during what was determined to be a random mugging the bond had tightened further still now it was generally accepted in the company that aaron klein was the chosen successor of elliott wallace aaron had been away visiting clients in chicago on monday and tuesday late wednesday morning he received a call from his boss aaron do you have plans for lunch none that i cant change aaron said promptly then please meet me at twelve thirty in the dining room i wonder whats up aaron asked himself as he replaced the receiver elliott isnt usually this lastminute about lunch at he got up from his desk went into his private bathroom ran a comb through his sparse head of hair and straightened his tie mirror mirror on the wall he thought sardonically whos the baldest of us all thirtyseven years old in good shape not badlooking but at the rate im going by the time im fifty ill be lucky if i have six hairs left on my head he sighed and put away the comb jenny tells me thats part of the reason ive done so well he told himself she says i look ten years older than i am thanks honey friendly as they had become aaron was always aware that to the blueblooded elliott wallace the fact that he his chosen successor was the grandson of immigrants had to be disappointing that thought was in his mind as he walked toward the dining room the kid from staten island approaches the privileged descendant of one of the first settlers of new amsterdam he thought never mind that the immigrants grandson graduated from yale in the top ten percent of his class and has a masters degree from wharton it still isnt the same as having classy ancestors i wonder if ill hear the cousin franklin story again aaron acknowledged that he both hated and was bored by elliotts oftrepeated anecdote of fdrs having invited a republican woman to host an event at hyde park when his wife eleanor was away when he was chided by the democratic chairman an astonished fdr replied but of course i asked her to be my hostess she is the only woman in hyde park who is my social equal that was my fathers favorite story about his cousin franklin elliott would chuckle as he reached the table and a waiter pulled out a chair for him aaron immediately sensed that anecdotes about his revered relatives were the last thing on elliotts mind today he looked thoughtful and concernedin fact preoccupied aaron good to see you lets order quickly i have a couple of meetings i assume youll have your usual cobb salad no dressing and iced tea mr klein the waiter asked smiling youve got it aaron did not mind letting his boss think that his salad luncheon was a sign of selfdiscipline the fact was that his wife jenny loved to cook and even her most casual dinners far surpassed the sterile menu of the executive dining room elliott ordered and when the waiter was out of earshot he got right to the point we heard from mack on sunday he said the usual mothers day call aaron asked i was wondering if hed stick to form and phone this year he did that and more aaron did not take his eyes off elliott wallaces face as he listened to the account of the written communication from mack ive advised olivia to respect macks wishes elliott said but oddly enough she seems to have come to that conclusion on her own she referred to mack as absent without leave shes going to join some mutual friends of ours for a cruise around the greek islands ive been invited to be with them and may go for the last ten days you should aaron said promptly you dont give yourself nearly enough time off and on my next birthday ill be sixtyfive in a lot of companies id be pushed out at that age thats the benefit of owning this oneim not going anywhere for a long time he paused as if preparing himself then said but i didnt ask you to join me to discuss vacation plans surprised aaron klein watched as wallaces eyes clouded with worry aaron youve gone through the experience of losing your mother in a random crime if the positions were reversed if your mother was the one who had disappeared and then kept in contact would you respect her wishes or would you feel that you should keep on trying to find her i find myself absolutely uncertain and troubled did i give olivia the right advice or should i have told her to renew and redouble her efforts to find mack suppose mom had disappeared ten years ago aaron asked himself suppose she phoned once a year then when i told her i needed to find her and was going to track her down she sent me a note telling me to leave her alone what would i do the answer was not hard to reach if my mother did to me what mack has done to his family and to you i would say if thats the way you want it mom so be it i have other fish to fry elliott wallace smiled other fish to fry thats a strange way to put it but thank you aaron i needed to be reassured im not failing mack or olivia he paused then corrected himself i mean his mother and sister of course youre not failing them aaron klein said emphatically that night as he was sipping a predinner glass of wine with his wife aaron said jenny today i realized that even stuffed shirts are like schoolboys when they fall in love elliott cant mention olivia mackenzies name without getting stars in his eyes n icholas demarco owner of the trendy club the woodshed as well as an upscale restaurant in palm beach was notified of the disappearance of the nyu coed leesey andrews late tuesday evening while on a golf outing in south carolina on wednesday morning he flew home and by three oclock wednesday afternoon he was following a secretary down a long corridor on the ninth floor of hogan place to the section where the detectives assigned to the district attorney of manhattan worked he had an appointment with captain larry ahearn the commanding officer of the squad tall with the lean figure of a disciplined athlete nick walked with long strides a worried frown on his forehead absentmindedly he passed a hand through his short hair which despite his best efforts curled when it was damp i should have stopped home long enough to change he chided himself he was wearing an opennecked checkered blue and white sport shirt which felt too casual even with a light blue jacket and dark blue slacks this is the detectives squad room the secretary explained as they entered a large room in which rows of desks were haphazardly clustered only a half dozen of them were occupied although piles of papers and ringing telephones testified to the fact that all of the others were active workstations the five men and one woman who were there looked up as he crossed the room threading his way between the desks after the secretary he was keenly aware of being the object of sharp scrutiny ten to one they all know who i am and why im here and they resent me they have me pegged as the owner of one of those raunchy bars where underage kids get drunk he thought the secretary knocked on the door of a private office to the left of the squad room and without waiting for an answer opened it captain larry ahearn was alone in the room he got up from behind the desk and offered his hand to demarco thank you for coming in so promptly he said briskly please sit down he turned to the secretary ask detective gaylor to join us demarco took the chair nearest ahearns desk im sorry that i wasnt available last night early yesterday morning i flew to south carolina to meet some friends i understand from your secretary that you flew your own private plane from teterboro airport ahearn said thats right and i flew back this morning i couldnt get an early start because of the weather down there they had heavy storms in charleston when did your staff notify you that leesey andrews a young woman who left your club at closing time early tuesday morning had disappeared the call came to my cell phone about nine oclock last night i was out to dinner with friends and hadnt carried it with me quite frankly as a restaurant owner i consider people who make or take calls in restaurants pretty insufferable when i got back to the hotel at about eleven i checked my messages is there any word about ms andrews has she called her family no ahearn said briefly then looked past demarco come in bob nicholas demarco had not heard the door open he stood up and turned as a trim man with graying hair who looked to be in his late fifties crossed the room with a quick stride he smiled briefly as he reached out his hand detective gaylor he said then pulled up a chair and turned it facing nick at a right angle to the captains desk mr demarco ahearn began we are very concerned that leesey andrews may be the victim of foul play your employees tell us that you were in the woodshed at approximately ten oclock on monday evening and were speaking with her thats right nick answered promptly because i was leaving for south carolina i worked late at my office at park avenue then i stopped at my apartment changed to casual clothes and went down to the woodshed do you visit your club frequently i would say i drop in frequently i no longer do nor want to do handson management tom ferrazzano runs the woodshed for me as both host and manager and i might add he does an excellent job of it in the ten months weve been operating weve never had one single incident caused by an underage drinker being served or an adult being served too much for his or her own good our employees are thoroughly checked out before theyre hired as are the bands we book to perform the reputation of the woodshed is good detective gaylor agreed but your own employees tell us that you spent quite a bit of time talking to leesey andrews i saw her dancing nick said promptly shes a beautiful girl and a really excellent dancer to look at her you would think she was a professional but she also looks very young i know her id had been checked but if i had to bet on it id have sworn she was underage thats why i had one of the waiters bring her over to my table and asked to see it myself she had just turned twentyone she joined you at your table gaylor said flatly you bought her a drink she had a glass of pinot grigio with me then returned to her friends what did the two of you talk about while she was sipping that glass mr demarco captain ahearn asked the usual socialtype conversation she told me she was graduating from nyu next year and still deciding what she wanted to do she said her father and brother were doctors but becoming a medical doctor wasnt right for her she said that more and more she was thinking of going for a masters in social work but she wasnt sure she was going to take a year off after college and then figure out the next step didnt that seem to you to be a lot of personal information to impart to a stranger mr demarco nicholas demarco shrugged not really then she thanked me for the drink and went back to her friends i would say she was at my table for less than fifteen minutes what did you do then ahearn asked i finished dinner and went home where do you live my apartment is on park avenue and seventyeighth street however i recently bought a building in tribeca and have a loft apartment there that was where i stayed monday night nick had debated about furnishing that information to the police and decided it was wiser to put it on the table immediately you have a loft in tribeca none of your employees told us that i dont share my personal investments with my employees is there a doorman in your building in tribeca he shook his head as i told you my apartment is a loft the building is five stories high i own it and have bought out the leases of the tenants the other floors are now unoccupied how far is it from your bar about seven blocks nicholas demarco hesitated then added i am very sure you must have most of this information already i left the woodshed shortly before eleven oclock i walked to the tribeca place and went to bed immediately my alarm went off at five am i showered dressed and drove to teterboro airport i took off at six fortyfive and landed in charleston at charleston airport i teed off at the club at noon you did not invite ms andrews to stop in for a nightcap no i did not nicholas demarco looked from one to the other of the detectives from the news reports i heard driving in from the airport i know that leeseys father has posted a twentyfivethousanddollar reward for any information leading to her whereabouts i intend to match that sum more than anything i want leesey andrews found alive and well primarily because it would be horrifying if anything happened to her primarily ahearn said taken aback momentarily what other reason do you have to want her found my second very selfish reason is that a great deal of money has been spent buying the property on which the woodshed is situated renovating the premises furnishing and staffing it i wanted to create a safe fun place for young people and notsoyoung people to enjoy if leeseys disappearance is traced to an encounter she had in my club the media will hound us and within six months our doors will be closed i want you to investigate our employees our customers and me but i can promise you that youre wasting your time if you think i had anything to do with that girls disappearance mr demarco you are one of the many people we are and will be interviewing ahearn said calmly did you file a flight plan at teterboro of course if you check the records the flying time down yesterday morning was excellent today because of the nearby storms it was somewhat slower one last question mr demarco how did you get back and forth to the airport in my car i drove myself what kind of car do you drive i usually drive a mercedes convertible unless for some reason im carrying a lot of baggage actually my golf clubs were in my suv so that was what i drove back and forth to the airport yesterday and today nicholas demarco did not need to catch the glance the two detectives exchanged to know that he had become a person of interest in the disappearance of leesey andrews i can understand why he thought i was talking to her a few hours before she disappeared no one can verify that she didnt meet me later at the apartment i took off early the next morning in a private plane i cant blame them for being suspiciousthats their job with a brief smile he offered his hand to both men and told them that he was going to make public immediately his offer to match the twentyfivethousanddollar reward for information leading to leeseys whereabouts and i can assure you well be working to find her or if something has happened to her find the person who did it ahearn said in a tone of voice that nicholas demarco correctly interpreted as a warning a s i was leaving the sutton place apartment my cell phone rang the caller identified himself as detective barrott and though my pulse quickened i kept my response to him deliberately cool he had brushed me off on monday so what possible reason did he have for calling me now ms mackenzie as you may be aware a young woman leesey andrews who disappeared last night lives next door to you on thompson street i am there now interviewing the neighbors on the block i saw your name listed on the directory in your building id very much appreciate an opportunity to speak with you again is it possible to set up an appointment with you soon holding the phone to one ear i signaled to the doorman to hail a cab for me there was one nearby just discharging a passenger as i waited for an elderly lady to get out i told barrott that i was on my way back to my own apartment and depending on traffic would be there in about twenty minutes ill wait for you he said flatly giving me no opportunity to let him know whether that was convenient for me or not some days a cab ride between sutton place and thompson street takes fifteen minutes other days the traffic simply crawls this was one of those crawling days it wasnt as though i was in any rush to see detective barrottits just that once im on my way anywhere im impatient to get there another characteristic inherited from my father and that made me think of my fathers anxiety when mack disappeared and the anxiety leesey andrewss father must be feeling now last night on the eleven oclock news holding back tears dr andrews had held up his daughters picture and pleaded for assistance in finding her i thought i could imagine what he was going through then wondered if that was really true bad as it had been for us mack had after all seemingly walked out of his life in midafternoon leesey andrews was surely more vulnerable alone at night and certainly no match for a strong predator all that was whirling through my mind as the cab made its way slowly to thompson street barrott was sitting on the steps of the brownstone an incongruous sight i thought as i paid the driver the afternoon had turned warm again and he had opened his jacket and loosened his tie when he spotted me in a fluid movement he stood up quickly tightened the tie and buttoned the jacket again we greeted each other with reserved courtesy and i invited him inside as i turned the key in the entrance door i noticed a couple of vans with tv markings parked outside the building next door the building where leesey andrews livedor had lived my studio apartment is in the rear of the building and is the only one on the lobby floor i took it on a years lease last september when i started working for judge huot in these past nine months it has become for me a peaceful haven from sutton place where my sense of loss over my father and anxiety over mack are never totally absent mom was appalled at the size of this place carolyn nine hundred square feet you wont be able to turn around she had lamented but i have been thrilled by the womblike space it is a cheery cocoon and i think has been greatly responsible for helping me evolve from a chronic state of inner sadness and anxiety to a surging desire even a need to have done with it to get on with life thanks to moms good taste i grew up in a home that was beautifully decorated but ive taken a certain joy in shopping for my studio at bargain sales in home furnishings departments my spacious bedroom on sutton place has a separate sitting area on thompson street i have a pullout couch which remarkably has a very comfortable mattress as detective barrott followed me into the apartment i caught the way he surveyed the room with its black enamel side tables and bright red modern lamps small black enamel coffee table and two armless chairs upholstered in the same stark white of the couch he let his eyes slide over the white walls and the rug with its checkered black and white and red pattern the kitchen is a narrow unit off the living room an ice cream parlor table and two padded wrought iron chairs under the window are the full extent of the dining facilities but the window is wide lets in a lot of light and plants and geraniums on the sill bring the outdoors in barrot took everything in then politely refused my offer of water or coffee and sat down opposite me on one of the side chairs he surprised me by starting with an apology ms mackenzie he said im pretty sure you feel that i dismissed your concerns when you came to see me on monday i let my silence tell him that i agreed i started to look over your brothers file yesterday ill admit that i didnt get very far the call came in about leesey andrews and of course that took precedence but then i realized it would also give me another chance to talk to you as i told you were canvassing the neighborhood do you know leesey andrews the question surprised me maybe it should not have but i thought to myself that when he phoned and asked to meet me if i had known her even slightly i would have said so immediately no i dont know her i said did you see her picture on television yes i did last night and you didnt have any sense of ever having seen her around he persisted as though he wasnt sure that i wasnt being evasive no but of course living next door i may have passed her in the street there are a number of young women students in that building i knew i sounded irritated and i was surely barrott wasnt suggesting that because my brother was missing i might have some kind of link to this girls disappearance barrotts lips tightened ms mackenzie i hope you realize that im asking you the same questions i and other detectives are asking everyone in this neighborhood because we already know each other and because you of all people understand the agony her father and brother are going through im hoping that somehow you can help us youre an extremely attractive young woman and as a lawyer youre trained to be very observant he leaned slightly forward his hands clasped do you ever walk around this area alone at night lets say after dinner or a movie or do you ever go out very early in the morning yes i do i knew my tone had softened most mornings i jog around six oclock and if im meeting friends locally in the evening i often walk home alone have you ever had a sense of being watched of someone following you no i havent on the other hand i would say im rarely out later than midnight and the village is still pretty lively at that time i understand but id appreciate it if youd keep your eyes open for us predators like arsonists sometimes enjoy watching the excitement theyve created something else there is another way you might be able to help us your neighbor on the second floor mrs carter is very fond of you isnt she im very fond of her shes terribly arthritic and terrified of going out if the weather is bad i explained shes had a couple of nasty falls i check on her and pick up odds and ends from the grocery store if she needs them i leaned back in my chair wondering where he was going with this barrott nodded she told me that in fact she was singing your praises but you know how it is with some old people theyre afraid of getting in trouble themselves if they talk to police my own aunt was like that she wouldnt admit it when she saw a neighbor dent another neighbors car its none of my business was the way she put it he paused thoughtfully i could tell that mrs carter was nervous about talking to me he continued but she did tell me she enjoys sitting at the window she claims she didnt recognize leeseys picture but i have a hunch she did it may only be that she has noticed leesey walking by and doesnt want to get involved with the investigation in any way but maybe if you have a cup of tea with her she might open up to you ill do that i said willingly mrs carter may be old but she doesnt miss a trick and she is a window sitter i thought she certainly has all the dirt on the neighbors who live on the three floors above her i considered the irony that i was now investigating for barrott when my intention had been to have him investigate for me barrott stood up thank you for letting me stop in ms mackenzie as you can understand were working round the clock on this case but when its resolved im going to get back to reviewing your brothers file and see if we can come up with some new avenues to follow he had given me his card on monday but probably suspected that i had torn it up which i had as i accepted another one from him he said hed keep in touch with me i saw him out locked the door behind him and realized that i suddenly felt weakkneed something about his manner made me suspect that detective roy barrott had not been honest to him i was not just someone who happened to be a neighbor of a missing young woman he was trying to create reasons to keep in contact with me but why i simply didnt know l il kramer had been nervous from the moment carolyn mackenzie phoned on monday requesting a meeting but on wednesday shortly after carolyn left had gone into the bedroom laid down closed her eyes and begun to cry silently tears running down her cheeks lil could hear gus saying his goodbyes to howard then he walked into the bedroom and stood over her at her husbands impatient demand to know what her problem was her eyes had flown open my problem ill tell you what it is gus i was in st francis de sales church at the latin mass last sunday ive been thinking about going ever since they began saying it again last year dont forget my father was a catholic and used to take me to church once in a while back when all the masses were in latin you never told me you went there sunday gus snapped and why would i have told you you have no use for any religion and i didnt need to hear you ranting that all clergymen are con men gus kramers expression changed all right all right you were there hope you said a prayer for me so what it was so crowded you wouldnt believe it people were standing in the aisles you heard what carolyn mackenzie just told us that mack was there i know you wont believe me but at mass i had the feeling that i saw someone familiar just for a moment but as you know im blind as a bat if i dont have my bifocals with me and i forgot them when i changed my purse i repeat so what gus dont you understand what im saying mack was there suppose he does decide to come back you know she finished in a whisper you know as she had expected gus had immediately become angry damn it lil that guy must have had his own reasons for pulling the disappearing act im sick of seeing you wringing your hands over him knock it off stop it you told his sister just enough to satisfy her now keep your mouth shut look at me roughly he leaned over the bed and raised her chin so that she could not avert her gaze from him youre halfblind without your distance glasses youre jumping to conclusions because of that note mack supposedly left in the collection you didnt see him there so forget all about it lil would not have believed she had the courage to ask her husband why he was so sure how can you be so positive that mack wasnt there she demanded in a tense whisper just trust me gus said his face darkening with anger it was the same rage she had seen ten years ago when she told gus what she had found in macks room while she was cleaning it was that rage that had made her wonder despairingly all these years if gus could have been responsible for macks disappearance in a clumsy gesture of affection gus ran his calloused hand over lils forehead then with a heavy sigh said you know lil im beginning to think it may be a good idea after all for us to retire to pennsylvania if that sister of macks starts dropping around here sooner or later shes going to get you so upset youll say too much lil who loved living in new york and who had dreaded moving to an idle retired life whimpered i want to go right away gus im so afraid for us b ruce galbraith always checked in with his secretary at the end of the business day unlike most of the people he knew he did not carry a blackberry and often turned off his cell phone too many distractions for my taste was his explanation its like watching a juggler with too many balls in the air thirtytwo years old average height with sandy hair and rimless glasses he joked about himself that he was so average he wouldnt even be noticed by a security camera on the other hand he was not so selfeffacing that he did not know his own worth he was a superb dealcloser and was considered by his colleagues to have a nearpsychic ability to foresee the trends in the real estate market the result was that bruce galbraith had multiplied the value of the family real estate business to the point where his sixtyyearold father had simply turned over the reins to him at his retirement dinner his father had said bruce my hats off to you youre a good son and a far better businessman than i ever was and i was good now you keep making money for us and ill pursue my goal of becoming a scratch golfer bruce was in arizona on wednesday when he made his daily lateafternoon call to his secretary she told him that a carolyn mackenzie had phoned and left a message that mack had been in contact again and would bruce please call her carolyn mackenzie macks kid sister these were not names he wanted to hear bruce had just returned to his suite in the hotel he owned in scottsdale shaking his head he walked over to the minibar and reached into it for a cold beer it was only four oclock but he had been outside in the heat most of the day and deserved it he assured himself he settled in the big armchair facing the floortoceiling window that overlooked the desert at any other time it was his favorite view but at this moment he was seeing only the college apartment he had shared with mack mackenzie and nick demarco and reviewing again what had happened there i dont want to see macks sister he told himself all that happened ten years ago and even then macks parents knew i was never close to him he never once asked me home to sutton place for dinner although he was always taking nick with him it didnt even cross macks mind that i might enjoy going too to him i was just an unobtrusive guy who happened to be sharing an apartment with him nick the ladykiller mack everyones choice for the nicest guy in the world so nice that he apologized for beating me out by a fraction to be one of the top ten graduates of our class ill never forget the look on dads face when i told him i hadnt made it four generations at columbia and i was the first not to be in the top ten and barbara god the crush i had on her in those days i worshipped her shenever even glanced in my direction he thought bruce tilted his head and finished the beer ill have to call carolyn he decided but ill tell her what i told her parents mack and i lived together but we never hung out together i didnt even see him the day he disappeared i got out before he and nick were awake so leave me alone little sister he stood up forget it he told himself impatiently just forget about it the quote that often ran through his head whenever he happened to think about mack jumped into his mind again he knew the quote wasnt completely accurate but it worked for him but that was in another land and besides the king is dead he went back to the phone picked it up and dialed when his wife answered he knew his face lit up at the sound of her voice hi barb he said how are you sweetheart and how are the kids a fter his luncheon with aaron klein elliott wallace went back to his office and found himself thinking about charles mackenzie sr and the friendship they had forged in vietnam charley had been in the armys rotc and was a second lieutenant when they met elliott had told charley that he was born in england of american parents and had spent most of his childhood in london he had moved back to new york with his mother when he was nineteen he had then enlisted in the army and four years later he had earned his own commission and was side by side with charley in some of the fiercest fighting of the war we liked each other from day one elliott thought charley was the most competitive person ive ever met and probably the most ambitious he was planning to go to law school the minute he was discharged he swore that he was going to be a very successful lawyer and a millionaire he was actually pleased that he had grown up in a family that didnt have two nickels to rub together he used to kid me about my background and what was the butlers name ell he would ask me was it bertie or chauncey or jeeves as he leaned back in his leather chair elliott smiled at the memory i told charley that the butler was william and he was gone by the time i was thirteen i told him that my father god rest him was the most cultivated human being and the worst businessman in the history of the civilized world that was why my mother finally threw in the towel and brought me home from england charley didnt believe me back then but i swore to him that in my own way i was just as ambitious as he was he wanted to become wealthy because hed never known that world i was one of the haves who became a havenot and wanted it all back while charley was in law school i went to college and then got my mba we both succeeded financially but our personal lives were so different charley met olivia and they had a wonderful marriage god how like an outsider i felt when i saw the way they looked at each other they had twentythree good years until mack disappeared and after that they didnt have a day that wasnt filled with worry about him and then and charley was gone my marriage to norma was never fair to her what was it princess diana told an interviewerthat there were three people in her marriage to the prince of wales yes thats the way it was with norma and me only less glamorous grimacing at the memory elliott picked up his pen and began to doodle on a pad norma didnt know it of course but the way i felt about olivia was always between us and now that my marriage is a distant memory after all these years maybe olivia and i can plan a future together she recognizes that she cant live her life around mack anymore and i can see that her feeling about me has changed in her eyes ive become more than charleys best friend and the trusted family advisor i could tell that when i kissed her good night i could tell when she confided that carolyn needs to be free to stop worrying about her and most of all i can tell because shes planning to sell the sutton place apartment elliott got up walked over to the section of the mahogany bookcase that housed a refrigerator and opened the door as he reached for a bottle of water he wondered if it was too soon to suggest to olivia that a penthouse on fifth avenue down the block from the metropolitan museum might be a wonderful place to live my penthouse he thought with a smile even twentyfive years ago when i bought it after norma and i were divorced i dreamed i was buying it for olivia the telephone rang then the crisp british voice of his personal secretary sounded on the intercom mrs mackenzie is calling sir elliott rushed back to his desk and picked up the receiver elliott its liv june crabtree was coming for dinner and at the last minute she cant make it i know carolyn is meeting her friend jackie by any chance would you like to take a lady to dinner i would be delighted how about having a drink at my place around seven and then going over to le cirque perfect see you then when he replaced the receiver elliott realized there was a slight bead of perspiration on his forehead ive never wanted anything more in my life he thought nothing must spoil it for us and im so afraid something might then he relaxed and laughed aloud as he thought of what his fathers reaction would be to that kind of negative thinking as dear cousin franklin said he thought the only thing we have to fear is fear itself l ate wednesday afternoon and long into the night grimfaced nyu students scattered throughout greenwich village and soho were taping posters on storefronts and telephone poles and trees in the hope that someone might recognize lisa leesey andrews and provide information that would lead to her recovery the photo that her roommate had taken only a few days earlier of a smiling leesey the statistics of her height and weight the address of the woodshed the time she left it her home address where she was presumed to have been heading and the fifty thousand dollars reward offered by her father and nicholas demarco were all included on the poster more information than we usually give but were pulling out all the stops captain larry ahearn told leeseys brother at nine oclock wednesday night but gregg im going to be fair with you truth is if leesey was abducted every hour that passes lessens our chances of finding her alive and safe i know that gregg andrews had gone down to headquarters after giving his father a strong sedative and making him go to bed in the guest room of his apartment larry i feel so damn helpless what can i do he slumped in his chair captain ahearn leaned across his desk toward gregg his expression sober you can be a crutch for your father and take care of your patients in the hospital leave the rest of it to us gregg gregg did his best to look reassured ill try he got up slowly as if every move was an effort he reached for the door of ahearns office then turned back larry you said if leesey was abducted please dont waste your time thinking that she would deliberately put us through this agony gregg opened the door and came facetoface with roy barrott who was about to knock on the door of his bosss office barrott had heard andrewss statement and realized it echoed what carolyn mackenzie had said about her brother in this same office two days earlier pushing aside that comparison he greeted andrews then stepped into ahearns office the tapes are finished he said briefly want to look at them now larry yes i do ahearn said looking at greggs retreating figure do you think theres any benefit in having her brother look at them with us barrott turned swiftly to follow ahearns line of sight maybe there is ill grab him before he gets to the elevator barrott caught gregg as he was punching the elevator button and asked if hed accompany them down the hall to the tech room barrott explained dr andrews the tapes taken monday night by the security cameras at the woodshed have been enhanced frame by frame to try to pick out anyone who seemed particularly close to leesey on the dance floor or who was among the last to leave the club without speaking gregg nodded then followed barrott and ahearn into the tech room and took a chair as the tape ran barrott who had already studied it twice briefed him and captain ahearn on the contents except for the friends she was sitting with all night nothing we have seems to show anything significant the friends all agree that leesey was with them except for the fifteen minutes she was with demarco at his table or when she was on the dance floor after the rest of her group left at two am the only time she sat at a table was when the band started to pack up the place had thinned out by then so we have a couple of pretty clear shots of her until she exited alone can you go back to that shot of her at the table gregg asked watching his sister on tape sent a wave of sadness through him sure barrott rewound the tape in the vcr do you see anything that weve missed doctor he asked trying to keep his voice noncommittal leeseys expression when she was dancing she was smiling look at her now she looks so pensive so sad he paused our mother died two years ago and leeseys had a hard time struggling with that grief gregg do you think that her state of mind would cause her to have a temporary amnesia or anxiety attack that would make her run away ahearns question was penetrating and demanded a straight answer is that a possibility gregg andrews raised his hands and pressed his temples as though trying to stimulate his thought processes i dont know he said finally i just dont know he hesitated then continued but if i had to stake my life and leeseys life on it i would say it didnt happen that way barrott fastforwarded the vcr all right in that last hour whenever the camera scans her she never has a glass in her hand which backs up what the waiter and bartender told us that she only had a couple of glasses of wine all night and wasnt drunk when she left he turned off the vcr nothing he said in disgust gregg andrews got up his voice strained he said ill go home now i have surgery in the morning and i need to catch some sleep barrott waited till he was out of earshot then stood and stretched i wouldnt mind catching some sleep myself but im going to the woodshed do you think demarco will show up there tonight ahearn asked my guess is that he will he knows our guys are going to be swarming all over the place and hes smart enough to know that it will be a big night for him plenty of customers will want to get in out of curiosity and of course the minorleague socalled celebrities will flock to the place knowing the media will be around trust me the maggots will gather of course they will ahearn stood up i dont know if youve checked since you got back but the track we have on leeseys cell phone shows whoever has it has been moving around in manhattan all day demarco only got back from south carolina late this morning so if he did it he has someone in new york working with him it would be nice to think that girl went off the deep end and shes the one whos running around manhattan barrott commented as he reached for his jacket but i dont think thats the way its going to turn out i think whoever grabbed her has already dumped her somewhere and is smart enough to know that when the cell phone is on we can target that area and start searching there and smart enough to know that by moving her cell phone around it leaves open the door that shes alive ahearn looked thoughtful weve checked out demarco so thoroughly that we know when he lost his baby teeth nothing in his background suggests hed try something like this did our guys find anything in the files of the other three girls who disappeared nothing that we havent investigated into the ground were checking out the credit card receipts from monday night to see if we can match any patrons of the woodshed to the names we have of the people who were in the bars in those cases uhhuh okay see you larry ahearn studied barrotts face youve got someone in mind besides demarco havent you roy im not sure let me think about it barrott said vaguely but ahearn could see that barrott was focused on something j ackie reynolds has been my closest friend since the first grade when we attended the academy of the sacred heart together as sixyearolds shes one of the smartest people i know as well as a gifted athlete jackie can hit a golf ball so hard that it would make tiger woods blink the september after we graduated from columbia we drove to duke together while i was studying law she was working for a doctorate in psychology she has that unmistakable look of the born athlete tall and firmbodied with long chestnut hair that as often as not is held together at the nape of her neck with a rubber band her extraordinary brown eyes are her dominant feature they exude warmth and sympathy and make people want to confide in her i always tell her that she should give cut rates to her patients you dont have to drag their problems out of them jackie they walk through your door and spill their guts we talk frequently on the phone and get together every few weeks it used to be even more often but now jackie is getting pretty serious about the guy shes been dating for the past year ted sawyer is a lieutenant in the fire department and a genuinely topdrawer person he intends to be fire commissioner of new york someday then run for mayor and id bet my bottom dollar that hell do both jackie has always been worried about how little interest ive shown in dating she correctly attributed my lack of interest to the fact that ive felt emotionally burned out tonight if the subject came up i intended to reassure her that i am now actively working to put all that inertia behind me we met at il mulino our favorite pasta place in the village over linguine with clam sauce and a glass of pinot grigio i told her about macks phone call and the note he left in the collection basket uncle devon tell carolyn she must not look for me jackie repeated im sorry carolyn but if mack did write that note it suggests to me that he may be in some kind of trouble she said quietly if he werent under stress and just wanted to be left alone i think he would have written please dont look for me or simply carolyn leave me alone thats exactly what im afraid of the more i look at the note and think about it the more i sense desperation i told jackie about going to see detective barrott he practically showed me the door i said he wasnt interested in the note he gave me the impression that if mack wanted to be left alone i should respect his wishes so i started my own investigation by meeting with the superintendents of macks apartment building she listened to my description of the meeting interrupting only to query me about mrs kramer you say she seemed nervous when you talked to her she was nervous and she kept looking over to her husband for approval as if she wanted to make sure she had given the right answers then they both changed their story in midstream about the last time they saw mack and what he was wearing memory is notoriously inaccurate especially after ten years jackie said slowly if i were you id try to see mrs kramer when her husband isnt around i made a mental note then told her about my second conversation with detective barrott jackie hadnt realized that my studio is right next door to the building where leesey andrews lived i told her about detective barrott meeting me there and that i felt there was something behind his wanting to stay in touch with me the expression in jackies eyes changed i could read deepening concern in them ill bet detective barrott wishes he had taken that note from you she said vehemently ill bet hell get around to asking you for it soon what are you getting at i asked carolyn have you forgotten about the missing persons cases that were in the news just before mack disappeared that a bunch of columbia guys including mack were in the bar in soho where that first girl who disappeared had been hanging out that was just a few weeks before mack himself vanished i hadnt thought of that i admitted but why would that be relevant now because youve handed the das office a possible suspect mack doesnt want you to find him which as i just suggested could mean that he may be in some kind of trouble or it could mean that he is the trouble he called your mother on sunday and left the note in the collection basket later in the morning suppose mack decided to check out where you now live maybe to warn you away again your address at the apartment is listed in the phone book suppose he came by early tuesday morning and spotted leesey andrews on the street walking home ill bet thats the way your detective barrott is adding things up jackie are you crazy i began but the words died in my throat i was desperately afraid that she had analyzed barrotts thinking process correctly in his eyes and because of me my missing brother may have become a person of interest in the disappearance of leesey andrews and perhaps of the young woman who vanished ten years ago only weeks before he did then in utter dismay i remembered that not one but three young women had vanished in these ten years before leesey andrews failed to return home in his wildest dreams could barrott possibly be beginning to believe that if mack is alive he may have become a serial killer s ometimes the best thing about the moment he took a life was when the scent of fear reached his nostrils they knew they were going to die and at that point they stammered out a few words one of them asked why another whispered a prayer lord receiveme a third tried to break away then spat an obscenity at him the youngest pleaded with him dont please dont he ached to go back to the woodshed tonight to listen to everything they were saying there it was amusing to watch the plainclothes detectives at work he could spot them a mile away their eyelids always had a hooded look because they were trying to conceal the fact that their bright little eyes were darting around the room an hour ago in brooklyn he had phoned the number they had on the poster using one of his unsubscribed phones and prepaid phone cards hed made his voice sound excited and said i just left peter lugers restaurant i saw that girl leesey andrews having dinner with some guy there then he turned off both that cell phone and leeseys cell phone and hurried into the subway he could just imagine the way the cops must have swarmed over there disrupting the place annoying the diners querying the waiters by now theyve probably decided that it was just another nutcase calling i wonder how many crazies have called in to say theyve seen leesey he wondered but only one person saw her me but the family wouldnt be sure that it was a crank call the family never is sure until they see a body dont count on it family if you dont believe me have a chat with the relatives of the other girls he turned on the television to catch the eleven oclock news as hed expected the breaking news story was being reported opposite the woodshed there were crowds of people lined up trying to get into the place a reporter was saying the tip that police received that leesey andrews was seen having dinner at a restaurant in brooklyn has been largely discounted he was disappointed that the police had not released the information about the tracking of her cell phone in brooklyn but later on ill take leeseys cell phone to thompson street for a quick visit he thought that will really drive them crazythinking she might be being held so near her home he almost laughed out loud i t was friday afternoon before i heard from nick demarco as luck would have it when my cell phone rang i was standing just inside the open door of the sutton place apartment saying goodbye to mom elliott had just arrived to take her to teterboro airport where she would join the clarences to fly on their private jet to corfu in the greek islands where their yacht was anchored elliotts chauffeur had carried the luggage down the hall and was pressing for the elevator in another thirty seconds they all would have been gone but i flipped open the phone automatically i could have bitten off my tongue after i said hello nick instantly alert there was no question that both mom and elliott guessed it was nick demarco the statement he gave at a news conference expressing his deep regret that leesey andrews may have met a predator at his club had been broadcast and rebroadcast in the fortyeight hours since he had made it late wednesday afternoon carolyn im sorry i didnt get back to you sooner nick said as you can understand its been pretty hectic these past few days whats your schedule are you free to get together this evening or sometime tomorrow i turned slightly away taking a step back toward the living room this evening would be fine i said quickly aware that elliott and mom were staring at me they reminded me of the game statues that we used to play when i was about ten years old whoever was the leader swung the others around by the hand and after she let go you had to stay frozen in exactly the position you were in when you stopped spinning the one who could last the longest without twitching a muscle was the winner moms body was rigid her hand on the doorknob and elliott holding moms carryon bag was standing statuelike in the vestibule i wanted to tell nick id call him back but was afraid to let the chance pass to confirm a meeting with him where will you be the sutton place apartment i told him ill pick you up there seven oclock okay fine we both clicked off mom had a worried frown on her face was that nick demarco why on earth is he calling you carolyn i called him on wednesday why would you do that elliott asked his tone puzzled you havent had any contact with him since your fathers funeral have you i combined a couple of truths and twisted them into an untruth i had a serious crush on nick years ago maybe its still lingering a bit when i saw him on tv i thought it wouldnt hurt to phone him and express my concern that leesey andrews disappeared after leaving his club resulthe phoned i saw an expression of cautious relief on my mothers face i always enjoyed nick when he came to dinner with mack and i know hes been very successful he certainly seems to have done very well these past ten years elliott agreed as i remember his parents had some sort of storefront restaurant but i must say i dont envy him the publicity hes getting now then he touched my mothers arm olivia we must get started as it is were going to hit all the rush hour traffic and the lincoln tunnel will be a nightmare my mother is famous for leaving at the last minute and counting on all the traffic lights to be turning green to make smooth her path at this moment i found myself comparing elliotts gentle reminder with my fathers reaction if he had been here liv for gods sake were getting a free ride to greece lets not miss it would have been his way of hurrying her out with a final flurry of farewell kisses and admonitions mom got into the elevator with elliott her final words call me if you need anything carolyn muffled by the closing door ill admit that i was flustered about this date with nick if you can call it a date i put on fresh makeup brushed my hair decided to leave it loose then at the last minute i put on a new escada suit my mother had insisted on buying for me both jacket and slacks were a pale shade of green and i knew they brought out the red tones in my brown hair why bother because after ten years i was still embarrassed by macks candid statement that it was obvious i had a crush on nick im not dolling up for him i told myself im satisfying myself that i dont look like a gawky adolescent fainting over her idol but when the concierge phoned from the lobby to tell me that mr demarco was here i have to admit that for a nanosecond i did feel like the sixteenyearold who had been foolish enough to wear her heart on her sleeve then when i opened the door for him what struck me immediately was that the boyish seemingly carefree nick i remembered was gone when i saw him on television i had noticed that his jawline had tightened and that at thirtytwo he already had strands of gray in his dark hair but facetoface there was more his dark brown eyes had always had a teasing flirtatious look but now the expression in them was serious even so his smile when he took my hand was the one i remembered and he seemed genuinely pleased to see me he gave me a social peck on the cheek but spared me the little carolyn all grown up routine instead he said carolyn mackenzie juris doctoris i heard somewhere that you had passed the bar and were clerking for a judge i meant to call to congratulate you but never quite got around to it im sorry the road to hell is paved with good intentions i said matteroffactly or at least thats what sister patricia told us in the fifth grade and brother murphy told us in the seventh grade never put off till tomorrow what you can do today i laughed they were both right i said but clearly you didnt listen we grinned at each other it was the kind of banter we used to exchange at the dinner table i picked up my shoulder bag im all set i told him fine my car is downstairs he glanced around from where he was standing he could see a corner of the dining room i have such good memories of coming here he said when i went home for an occasional weekend my mother wanted to know every detail of what we ate and i had to describe the color of the tablecloth and napkins and what kind of flowers your mother used in the centerpiece i assure you we didnt do that every night i said as i fished my key from my bag mom enjoyed fussing when you and mack were coming home mack didnt mind showing off this place to his friends nick commented but i reciprocated you know i took him to our place in astoria for the best pizza and pasta in the universe was there an edge in nick demarcos voice as though he still resented the comparison maybe not but i wasnt sure in the elevator on the way down he noticed that manuel the elevator operator was wearing a class ring and asked about it manuel proudly told him that he had just graduated from john jay college and was scheduled to start at the police academy i cant wait to become a cop he said of course i havent really lived at home since i started duke law but even so manuel and i often exchanged pleasantries hes worked in our building for at least three years yet in seconds nick knew more about him than i ever did i realized that nick had the ability to make people open up to him immediately and that that might be why he is so successful in the restaurant business nicks black mercedesbenz was parked in front of the building i was surprised to see a chauffeur jump out to hold the back door open for us i dont know why but i never would have visualized nick as having a chauffeur this one was a big heavyset man in his midfifties with the face of a retired prizefighter his broad nose seemed to have lost most of the cartilage and there was a scar along his jaw nick introduced us benny worked for pop for twenty years then when pop retired five years ago i inherited him my very good fortune benny this is carolyn mackenzie despite his brief smile and pleasant nice to meet you ms mackenzie i had the feeling that benny was giving me a very thorough onceover he obviously knew where we were going because he set off without waiting for instructions as we pulled away from the curb nick turned to me carolyn im assuming and hoping that youre free for dinner and i was assuming and hoping youd want to have dinner i thought that would be nice i told him theres a place in nyack just a few miles from the tappan zee bridge the food is excellent and its quiet at this point im pretty anxious to stay away from the media he rested his head back on the leather seat on the way up the fdr drive he told me that he had been asked to stop at the district attorneys office again yesterday afternoon to answer more questions about the conversation he had with leesey andrews the night she disappeared it was unfortunate that i stayed in the loft apartment that night he said frankly theres only my word that i didnt invite her to stop by on her way home and i think for lack of anyone else to focus on im in the spotlight youre not the only one i thought but decided not to share with him my certainty that thanks to me detective barrott also had his sights on mack as a suspect i noticed that nick did not mention macks name in the car and i wondered about that from the message i gave to his secretary that i wanted to see him because i had heard from mack again he certainly knew we were going to talk about my brother i wondered if perhaps he didnt want benny to hear that conversation my suspicion was that benny was gifted with very keen hearing the restaurant nick had chosen la provence was everything he had promised it had been a private home and retained that atmosphere the tables were far apart the centerpieces on them were made up of a candle surrounded by budding flowers and each table had different flowers paintings that i guessed to be of the french countryside were hung on the paneled walls it was obvious from the warm greeting the maitre d extended to nick that he was a regular customer we followed him to a corner table with a window that looked over the hudson the night was clear and the view of the tappan zee bridge spanning the river was splendid i thought of my dream of trying to follow mack as he crossed a bridge then i tuned it out over a glass of wine i told nick about macks usual mothers day call and then about the note he left in the collection basket the fact that he wrote that i must not try to find him makes me feel that something is very wrong in his life i said im just afraid that mack needs help im not so sure about that carolyn nick said quietly i was witness to how close he was to you and your parents he would know that if he needed anything in a financial way your mother would provide it on the spot if hes sick i would think hed want to be around you and your mother i never saw mack touch drugs but i dont know maybe he had started and knew it would crush your father if he found out about it dont think i havent tried all these years to figure out what would make him vanish i guess its what i expected to hear but even so i felt as if every door i tried to open was being slammed in my face when i didnt respond nick waited me out for a minute then said carolyn you said yourself that mack sounded pretty chipper when he called on mothers day why dont you look at that message not as a plea for help but as a firm request or even a command you can certainly read it that way too tell carolyn she must not look for me he was right i know he was but in a much bigger sense he was wrong every instinct in my body told me that let it go carolyn nick said now his voice was gentle when and if mack decides to surface i am going to give him one swift kick for the way hes treated you and your mother now tell me about yourself i guess your clerkship with the judge expires soon isnt that the way it works ill tell you about that i said but just a little more about mack first i went to see the kramers wednesday morning the kramers you mean the superintendents of the building where mack and i lived yes and nick you may not believe me but mrs kramer was nervous she kept looking over at her husband to make sure whatever she told me was all right i swear to you she was afraid of making some kind of mistake what did you think of them when you lived there to be honest its not what i thought of them its more that i didnt think about them mrs kramer cleaned the apartment thanks to your mothers generosity and did our wash once a week otherwise it would probably have been a pigsty she was a good cleaning woman but downright nosey i know bruce galbraith was furious at her he came in one day and she was reading the mail on his desk if she was reading his i figured she was probably reading mine too did you challenge her on it he smiled no i did something dopey i typed a letter signed her name to it and stacked it with my mail so that she would find it it read something like this darling it is such a pleasure for me to wash your clothes and make your bed i feel like a young girl when i look at you sometime will you take me dancing all my love lilly kramer you didnt i exclaimed the boyish twinkle i remembered appeared in nicks eyes for a brief moment when i thought it over i threw it out before she could see it sometimes i wish i hadnt do you think mack might have had a problem with her going through his mail he didnt say it but i have a feeling he was upset about her too but he never said why then he was gone do you mean it was just before he disappeared nicks expression changed carolyn surely you dont think the kramers had anything to do with macks disappearance nick just talking about them to you brought up something that obviously never came up at the time of the investigation that bruce caught her snooping and that mack may have been upset with her too give me your assessment of gus kramer good superintendent nasty temper i heard him yelling at mrs kramer a couple of times nasty temper i asked raising my eyebrows then said you dont have to answer but think about it suppose he and mack had some kind of confrontation the waiter then came to take our orders and nick never did answer my question after that we kept the conversation to catching up on the past ten years i told him that i was going to apply for a job in the district attorneys office going to apply now it was nick who raised his eyebrows as brother murphy said never put off till tomorrow what you can do today any special reason for waiting i answered vaguely about taking a little time to find an apartment after dinner nick opened his blackberry discreetly and checked it for messages i asked him to see if there was any update about leesey andrews good idea he pushed a button scanned the news briefs then turned off the blackberry hope is fading that shell be found alive he said soberly i wouldnt be surprised if im asked to drop in to the das office again tomorrow and i may get a call from barrott i thought we finished our coffee and nick signaled to the waiter for a check it was only later when he was dropping me at the door of sutton place that he brought up the subject of mack again i can read you carolyn youre going to keep trying to find mack arent you yes who else are you going to talk to i have a call in to bruce galbraith you wont get much help or sympathy from him he said wryly why not do you remember barbara hanover the girl who came with mack and me to dinner at your house and how i thought yes i remember her i said but then i couldnt help adding i also remember that you had a big crush on her nick shrugged ten years ago i had a crush on someone different every week anyhow it wouldnt have done me any good if she cared about anyone my guess is that it was mack mack could i have been so focused on nick that i didnt notice couldnt you tell but barbara was looking for a ticket to medical school her mother had a catastrophic illness that ate up all the money that had been earmarked for barbaras education that is why she married bruce galbraith they eloped that summer remember thats something else that never came out during the investigation i said slowly was bruce jealous of mack nick shrugged you never knew what bruce was thinking but whats the difference you talked to mack less than a week ago you certainly dont think bruce sent him into hiding do you i felt like a fool of course not i said i really dont know anything about bruce at all he never came here with you and mack hes a loner that last year at columbia even the nights hed hit the clubs in the village and soho with a crowd of us he always seemed to be by himself we called him the lone stranger i searched nicks face eager for more detail after mack disappeared when the investigation started did the police question bruce at all the only thing i found about him in the file was his statement about the last time he saw mack in the apartment i dont think they did why would they he and mack never hung out together i was just reminded by an old friend that a week or so before he disappeared mack and some other guys from columbia were in a club the same night as the first girl who went missing do you remember if bruce was there nick looked pensive yes he was i remember because the club had recently opened and we decided to check it out but it seems to me that he left early he certainly was never the life of the party anyhow its getting late carolyn ive enjoyed it a lot thank you for coming he gave me a quick peck on my cheek and opened the door to the lobby for me there was no mention of getting together again i walked through the lobby to the elevator then glanced back nick was already in the car and benny was standing on the sidewalk holding a cell phone to his ear his expression unreadable for some reason there was something sinister about the way benny smiled as he snapped the cell phone closed got back in the car and drove away e very saturday morning howard altman took his boss derek olsen out for brunch they met at exactly ten oclock in the lamplighter diner near one of the apartment buildings olsen owned on amsterdam avenue in the decade during which he had been working for the increasingly testy olsen altman had become very close to the elderly widower a relationship he carefully nurtured lately the eightythreeyearold olsen made no bones about the fact that he was becoming more and more disgruntled with the nephew who was his only close relative do you think steve gives a damn whether i live or die howie he asked rhetorically as he wiped the last of the egg yolk from his plate with a piece of toast he should call me more often im sure steve gives more than a damn derek howard said lightly i certainly give a damn about you but i still cant persuade you not to order two fried eggs bacon and sausage when we get together on saturdays olsens eyes softened youre a good friend howie it was my lucky day when you came to work for me youre a goodlooking guy you dress nice you handle yourself well i can play bridge with my friends and play golf and know youre out there doing a good job for me so whats going on in the buildings everything up to snuff i would say so weve got a couple of kids in behind in their rent but i stopped in to see them and reminded them that your list of favorite charities doesnt have their names on it olsen chuckled id have put it a little more crudely keep an eye on them he tapped his cup on the saucer signaling to the waitress that he wanted more coffee anything else something that really surprised me gus kramer phoned me yesterday and gave me two weeks notice what the genial expression vanished from derek olsens face i dont want him to go he said flatly hes the best super i ever had and lil is like a mother hen to the students the parents like her too they feel good about her why do they want to leave gus said theyre ready to retire they werent ready last month when i dropped in over there howie ive got to tell you something there are times when you push to cut corners when it dont make sense you think youre doing me a favor by trying to kick them out of a big apartment so that you can get good rent for it i know all about that but for what i pay them letting them have more space is a bargain sometimes you overstep yourself this is one of them make nice with them give them a raise but make sure they stay and now that were on the subject when you deal with them and with the other supers keep something in mind you represent me but youre not me clear very clear of course howard altmans vocal cords started to form the name derek instead he said humbly very clear mr olsen im glad to hear it anything else howard had planned to tell his boss that carolyn mackenzie had been in the kramers apartment on wednesday asking questions about her missing brother but he realized it would be a mistake in his present mood olsen would decide that he should have been told at once that howie didnt understand what was important besides that over the past decade whenever olsen talked about the mackenzie disappearance he went ballisticred in the face his voice raised sharply that kid takes off in may he would rant the apartments were all rented for the next september half of them were canceled the last place mackenzie was seen was in my building so his parents thought there might have been some nut hanging out in the stairwell howard realized that his boss was studying him intently howie you look like you have more on your mind do you nothing at all mr olsen howard said firmly good you been reading about that missing girl whats her name leesey andrews yes i have its very sad i was watching the news before i left this morning i dont think they expect to find her alive these young women should stay out of these clubs in my day they sat home with their mothers howard reached for the check as the waitress placed it beside olsen it was a ritual they went through every week ninety percent of the time olsen let him pick it up when he was annoyed he did not olsen grabbed the check i dont want the kramers to leave howie understand remember last year you stepped on the toes of the super on ninetyeighth street his replacement stinks if the kramers leave maybe you should look for another job i hear my nephew is out of work again hes not stupid in fact hes pretty damned smart maybe if he had your cushy apartment and salary hed pay a little more attention to me i hear you mr olsen howard altman was furious at his employer but much more so at himself he had played it all wrong the kramers had been as nervous as cats on a hot tin roof when carolyn mackenzie showed up the other day why he should have been smart enough to find out what was upsetting them he made a silent vow to get what it was out of them before it was too late i want my job he thought i need it neither the kramers nor carolyn mackenzie were going to cause him to lose it h ope is fading that leesey andrews will be found alive dr david andrews read as the latest news report scrolled across the bottom of the television screen he was sitting on the leather couch in the den of his sons park avenue apartment unable to sleep he had gone in there sometime in the predawn hours he knew he must have dozed off at some point because shortly after he heard gregg leave to make his rounds at the hospital he became aware that a blanket was tucked around him neatly now three hours later he was still there alternately dozing and watching television i should get showered and dressed he thought but he was too weary to move the clock on the mantelpiece showed that it was quarter of ten im still in pajamas he thoughtthats ridiculous he looked up at the television screen what had he just seen on it i must have read it because the setting is on mute he realized he groped for the remote control which he remembered placing on the cushion so that he could adjust the volume in an instant if something came on about leesey its sunday he thought its been more than five days now what do i feel right at this minute nothing not fear nor grief nor that murderous anger at whoever has taken her right now at this minute i just feel numb it wont last hope is fading he thought is that what i just read in the news tape on the screen or did i make it up why does that sound familiar a mental image of his mother playing the piano at family parties and everyone joining in the singing burst into his mind they loved the old vaudeville songs he thought one of them began with the words darling i am growing old leesey wont ever grow old he closed his eyes against the tidal wave of pain the emotional numbness was gone darling i am growing oldsilver threads among the goldshine upon my brow todaylife is fading fast away hope is fadingthose were the words that made me think of that song dad are you okay david andrews looked up and saw the concerned face of his son i didnt hear you come in gregg he rubbed his eyes did you know that life is fading fast away leeseys life he stopped tried again no im wrong its hope thats fading that shell be found alive gregg andrews crossed the room sat next to his father and put an arm around his shoulders my hope isnt fading dad isnt it then you believe in miracles why not i used to believe in them myself too keep believing in them dad remember how your mother seemed to be doing so well then overnight the picture changed and we lost her thats when i stopped believing in miracles david shook his head trying to clear it and patted his sons knee youd better take good care of yourself for me youre all i have he stood up i feel as if im talking in my sleep ill be okay gregg im going to shower and dress and go home im absolutely useless here with your schedule at the hospital you need downtime when youre here and at home ill be better able to keep a grip on myself i hope ill try to get back into some kind of routine while were waiting to see what develops gregg andrews looked at his father with the clinical eye of a doctor observing the deep circles under his eyes the bleak expression in them the way in these four days his trim frame suddenly seemed extremely thin he hasnt eaten a thing since he heard about leesey gregg thought in one way he wanted to object to his father leaving in another he sensed that hed be better off in greenwich where he volunteered at the urgent care center three days a week and where he was among close friends i understand dad he said and maybe you think youve given up hope but i dont believe you believe me his father said simply forty minutes later showered and dressed he was ready to leave at the door of the apartment the two men embraced dad you know youll have a dozen people wanting to have dinner with you go out to the club with some of them tonight gregg urged if not tonight i will very soon after his father left the apartment felt empty weve been trying to keep up appearances for each others sake gregg thought id better take my own advice and stay busy ill take a long run in central park then try to nap he had already planned to go back and forth between the woodshed and leeseys apartment tonight at three am the same time she had started to make that walk maybe ill find someone to talk to someone the cops have missed he thought detective barrott had told him that plainclothes detectives were doing that every night but the need to help in the search had been building to a fever pitch in gregg while dad was here i couldnt do it he thought hed have insisted on coming with me the day had started overcast but when he went outside at eleven the sun had broken through the clouds and gregg felt his own spirits lift a bit surely on a beautiful spring morning like this his kid sister funny pretty leesey could not be gone but if she wasnt dead then where was she let it be an emotional breakdown or a spell of amnesia gregg prayed as he covered the three blocks to the park with long strides there he decided to head north and swing back around the central park boathouse right foot left foot right foot left foot letusfindherletusfindherhe prayed in cadence to the rhythm of the run an hour later tired but somewhat less tense he was walking back to his apartment when his cell phone rang with conflicting emotions of hope and dread he grabbed it from the pocket of his jacket flipped it open and saw that the call was from his father the words hello dad died on his lips as he listened despairingly he heard uncontrollable sobbing oh god he thought theyve found her body leesey david andrews managed to say gregg its leesey she phoned she what she left a message on the answering machine less than ten minutes ago i just walked in i cant believe it i just missed her call again gregg andrews heard his fathers sobs dad what did she say where is she the sobs suddenly stopped she saidthatshe loves me but has to be by herself she asked me to forgive her she saidshe saidthat shell call again on mothers day i spent saturday morning in macks room in the sutton place apartment i wont say it had a sunset boulevard quality to it but i do know that it no longer held any sense of his presence for me after mack had been missing a few days dad ransacked his desk hoping to find some clue as to where he might have gone but the only things he found were the usual trappings of a college studentnotes for exams postcards blank personal stationery one file contained a copy of macks application to duke law school and his letter of acceptance from them on it he had scrawled an exuberant yes but dad didnt find what he was looking formacks daily calendarwhich might have given us a clue to any appointments he had made prior to his disappearance years ago mom had our housekeeper take down the banners mack had tacked on the wall and the corkboard covered with group pictures of him and his friends everyone in those pictures had been questioned by the cops and later by the private investigator the brown and beige coverlet matching pillows and contrasting window treatments were the same as was the cocoa brown carpet there was still a picture of the four of us on top of the dresser i found myself studying it and wondering if by now mack had any strands of gray on his temples it was hard to imagine hed had such a boyish face ten years ago now he was not only long past being a college student was probably a suspect in absentia in more than one kidnapping andor murder case there were two closets in the room i opened the doors of both of them and detected that faint musty odor that grows when no fresh air circulates into a relatively small space i took a stack of jackets and slacks from the first closet and laid them on the bed they all had plastic cleaners bags over them and i remembered that when mack had been missing about a year mom had everything he owned cleaned and put back in the closet i remember at the time dad had said livvy lets give them all away if mack comes back ill take him shopping let somebody else get some use out of all this stuff his suggestion had been rejected there was nothing to be found in this sterile clothing i didnt want to just dump everything in large trash bags i knew that would make it easier to carry them to the donation center but it would be a shame if anything got wrinkled then i remembered that a couple of macks large suitcases the ones hed used on our last family trip were in the storeroom behind the kitchen i found them there and brought them back to his room hauling them up on the bed i opened the first one and as a matter of habit ran my fingers through the pockets to see if there was anything in them there wasnt i filled the suitcase with neatly folded suits and jackets and slacks lingering over the tuxedo mack wore in our family photo that last christmas the second suitcase was a size smaller again i ran my hand through the side pockets this time i felt something i guessed to be a camera but when i pulled it out i was surprised to see that it was a tape recorder i never remembered seeing mack using one there was a tape in it and i pushed the play button what do you think ms klein do i sound like laurence olivier or tom hanks im recording you so be kind i heard a womans laugh you sound like neither of them but you sound good mack i was so shocked that i pushed the stop button as tears welled in my eyes mack it was as though he were in the room bantering with me his voice lively and animated these yearly mothers day calls and the everincreasing resentment that was my reaction to them had made me forget the way mack used to sound funny and energetic i pushed the play button again okay here i go ms klein mack was saying you said to select some passage from shakespeare how about this one then he cleared his throat and began when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes his tone had changed drastically had suddenly become ragged and somber i all alone beweep my outcast state and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries that was all that was on the tape i rewound it and played it again what did it mean was it a random selection or had it been chosen deliberately because it suited macks frame of mind when was it made how long before he disappeared had it been made esther kleins name was in the file of people the cops spoke to about mack but obviously she had offered nothing of consequence i vaguely remembered that dad and mom had been surprised that mack had been taking private acting lessons with her on the side i can understand why he didnt tell them dad was always afraid that mack was becoming too interested in his theatre electives then esther klein had been fatally mugged near her apartment on amsterdam avenue nearly a year after mack went missing the thought occurred to me that there might have been other tapes that he made while he studied with her if so what happened to them after her death i stood in macks room holding the recorder and realized it would be easy enough to find that out esther kleins son aaron was a close associate of uncle elliott i would call him i put the recorder in my shoulder bag and began packing macks clothes when i was finished the drawers in the dresser were empty as were the closets mom had let dad give macks heavy coats away one particularly cold winter when the charities were pleading for them as i was about to close the second suitcase i hesitated then took out the formal black tie i had tied for mack just before we posed for our christmas picture that last year i held it in my hands thinking back to how i had told him to lean down because i couldnt reach high enough to tie it tight as i wrapped it in tissue and put it in my shoulder bag to take back to thompson street with me i remembered macks laughing response blest be the tie that binds now please dont make a mess of it carolyn h e wondered if her father had heard the message yet he could just imagine his reaction when he listened to it his little girl was alive and didnt want to see him she said she would call on mothers day only fiftyone weeks to wait daddy must be twisting in the wind he thought by now the cops undoubtedly had a wiretap on dr andrewss phone in greenwich he could just imagine the frenzy they were in would they throw up their hands and decide that leesey has a right to her privacy and drop the search for her maybe it was just the kind of thing people did it would be safer for him if they did would they tell the media she had phoned i like the headlines he thought and i like reading about leesey andrews theyve known since tuesday that shes missing shes been in all the headlines the last three days but today the story about her was buried on page four which was disappointing it had been the same thing with the other three girlswithin two weeks the story was dead as dead as they were ill play around with what to do to keep leesey on everybodys mind but for now he thought ill have my fun moving her cell phone around that must be driving them crazy goosey goosey gander he whispered wither do you wander upstairs downstairs in my ladys chamber he laughed all three places he thought all three d octor youre sure that it is your sisters voice on the answering machine absolutely sure unconsciously gregg kneaded his forehead with his thumb and forefinger i never get headaches he thought i dont need one to start now three hours after his father called he was downtown in the detective squad section of the district attorneys office the message leesey had left on the answering machine in his fathers greenwich connecticut home had been taken from the wiretap and amplified in the tech room detective barrott had already played it several times for him and larry ahearn i agree with gregg ahearn told barrott ive known leesey since she was a little girl and i would swear thats her voice she sounds nervous and agitated but of course she may have had some sort of breakdown or he looked at gregg or she was forced to leave that message you mean by someone who abducted her yes gregg thats exactly what i mean youve confirmed that that call was made from her cell phone gregg asked trying to keep his voice steady yes it was ahearn said it was bounced from the tower at madison and fiftieth thats why she may be being held somewhere in that area on the other hand if she did choose to disappear i dont see how she can walk outside in that location even to buy groceries without worrying about being spotted her picture has been all over the newspapers television and the internet unless she has some kind of disguise like a burka that would hide everything except her eyes barrott pointed out but even that would draw attention in manhattan he began to rewind the tape of leeseys call our tech guys are working on the background sound lets concentrate on listening to that larry ahearn caught the bleak expression on greggs face i dont think we need to hear it again roy what happens now gregg asked him if you decide leesey did leave voluntarily do you give up looking for her no ahearn said emphatically not for one minute knowing leesey as well as i do even if she disappeared on her own something is terribly wrong were staying on this until we find her thank god for that theres something else i need to ask them gregg thought oh i know how about the media are you going to tell them that shes contacted us we dont want anyone to know larry said shaking his head that was the first thing i told your father when we spoke to him you told me the same thing but i thought you meant you wanted to be sure it wasnt a crank call or someone just imitating leeseys voice gregg we dont want a hint of this to get out larry ahearn said urgently awful as this is its good to know that as of a few hours ago leesey was alive i guess i agree but where is she if shes alive what may be happening to her the other young women who disappeared after being at one of those clubs in soho were never found but neither did any of them call a member of the family gregg ahearn reminded him dr andrews theres something else barrott began make it gregg please a hint of a smile crossed gregg andrewss lips after i got my md if anyone called me at home and asked for dr andrews it took leesey months before she didnt automatically hand the phone to my father barrott smiled briefly thats the way it is in my house if my son gets great marks or some kind of achievement award his sister thinks it was a mistake all right gregg he continued the last time you saw your sister was a week ago on mothers day was there anything unusual about that day thats what absolutely bewilders me gregg told him my mothers been dead only two years so naturally its a pretty lowkey day for us the three of us went to church together visited her grave then had dinner at the club leesey had planned to drive back to the city with me but at the last minute decided to stay overnight with dad and take the train home in the morning before your mother died was mothers day in any way symbolic for all of you other than the usual sentiment thats attached to it no not at all we celebrated it together but it wasnt a big deal when my grandparents were alive they were with us there was nothing extraordinary at all about it gregg caught the way the two detectives glanced at each other and then the way larry ahearn nodded to roy barrott theres something you havent told me he said what is it gregg do you know carolyn mackenzie ahearn asked now his temples were beginning to pound gregg searched his memory then shook his head i dont think so who is she shes a lawyer ahearn volunteered twentysix years old her studio is on thompson street in the building next door to where your sister lives does she know leesey gregg asked quickly does she have any idea where she might be no she doesnt know her but maybe you remember a case ten years ago when a college student walked out of his apartment and disappeared his name was charles mackenzie jr everyone called him mack i remember that case they never found him did they no ahearn said but he calls his mother every year on mothers day on mothers day gregg jumped up hes been gone ten years and calls his mother on mothers day are you suggesting that leesey might be planning to follow a crazy pattern like that gregg were not suggesting anything ahearn said soothingly leesey was eleven years old when mack mackenzie disappeared so theres no reason to think that she might have known him but we thought its possible you or your father might know the family my guess is that you travel in some of the same circles whatever that means he looked perplexed did mack mackenzie call his mother last sunday yes he did ahearn decided not to immediately share the fact that mack had left a message in the collection basket we dont know what that guy is doing or why he had to go underground it certainly isnt widespread knowledge that he still phones his family on that one day it makes us wonder if at some point leesey might have met him maybe at one of those clubs in soho and if she decided to disappear on her own as he seems to have done whether shell stay in touch the same way what do you know about mackenzie larry i mean if he disappeared voluntarily was he in some kind of trouble gregg looked pointedly at larry searching for answers we couldnt find anything that added up he had everything going for him and just walked out of his life the same thing could be said about leesey gregg snapped are you starting to think that if shes come across this guy the next time well hear from her is mothers day next year he looked from one to the other of them wait a minute do you think that this mack guy might be a weirdo and has something to do with leeseys disappearance larry looked across the table at his college roommate its not just his father who aged this week he thought gregg looks ten years older than he did when we played golf last month gregg we are exploring everyone and every situation that may give us a lead to follow most of them will be dead ends now do me a favor and take my advice go home get a decent dinner and go to bed early take some comfort in the fact that we know leesey was alive this morning youve got a lot of patients who depend on your skill to give them a new lease on life you cant fail them and you will if you dont eat and sleep properly not unlike the advice i gave dad gregg thought i will go home i will get a couple of hours sleep and eat something but tonight im going to walk back and forth between that soho club and thompson street leesey was alive this morning but that doesnt mean that if shes with some kind of nut shell stay alive he pushed back his chair and stood up youre absolutely right larry he said with a brief wave he started to leave but spun around when ahearns cell phone rang ahearn grabbed it from his pocket and raised it to his ear whats up gregg saw the angry frown before he heard larrys muttered profanity for the second time that day he despairingly thought that leeseys body had been found ahearn looked at him someone called the new york post a few minutes ago and said that leesey andrews left a message for her father today and said shed call again on mothers day the post wants confirmation spitting out the words he shouted absolutely no comment and slammed down the phone did leesey make the call gregg demanded the reporter who took it couldnt be sure said it was a muffled whisper there was no caller id that means that the call wasnt made from leeseys phone gregg said she has caller id thats exactly what i mean gregg im going to be brutally honest either leesey had some kind of breakdown and wants publicity or shes in the hands of a dangerous gameplaying nut who only calls home on mothers day roy barrott said quietly or who has a loft apartment near the woodshed and a longtime chauffeur who would do anything for him ahearn said bitterly h oward altman gave careful thought about how he would approach the kramers to persuade them to stay on as superintendents olsen is right he admitted the guy i got him to fire last year in the ninetyeighth street apartment house was saving us a lot of money i just didnt get it olsen doesnt want to do major repairs there the property next door is for sale and when it goes hes sure theyll make a big offer for his building too the old super was keeping things together with chewing gum and kite string the new one has a list of all the repairs that are needed and keeps telling olsen its criminal negligence not to do them immediately i should have kept my mouth shut he thought but i never could see why the kramers needed a threebedroom apartmentthe other two bedrooms are never used every so often when howard stopped by the kramers he asked for permission to use the bathroom that gave him a chance to look into the spare bedrooms never once in the nearly ten years since he had started working for derek olsen had he noticed any change in the placement of the teddy bears on the pillows of the beds he knew they never used those rooms but he told himself that what he should have realized was that lil kramer took a certain lowbrow pride in her big apartment and i know all about lowbrow he thought ruefully when i was a kid and pop bought his first brandnew car the cheapest one on the lot you would have thought hed won the lottery we had to show it off to all the relatives just because pop hoped theyd be drooling with envy i should start a blog and write about my own messedup family howard told himself i cant let the kramers retire maybe olsen would get over it if i got some good new people in fast on the other hand it would be just like him to fire me and give my job to that sicko nephew of his in thirty days olsen would probably be on his knees begging me to come back but thats a chance i cant take so what approach do i take with the kramers howard altman considered possible solutions over the weekend then satisfied with the plan he had come up with at quarter of ten on monday morning he stepped into the west end avenue building where the kramers lived he had definitely decided that pleading with them to stay offering them a raise and assuring them that the large apartment would always be their home was exactly the wrong way to go if gus kramer thought that by quitting he could get me fired hed do it even if he doesnt really want to retire now when he turned the key in the outside door and went into the lobby he found gus kramer polishing the already gleaming brass mailboxes gus looked up i guess i wont be doing this much longer he said hope the next guy you get is half as good as ive been for nearly twenty years gus is lil around howard said almost whispering i need to speak to both of you im worried about you two seeing the look of outright fear in kramers face he knew he was on the right track shes in the apartment sorting stuff out gus said without bothering to wipe the final cloud of polish from the mailboxes he turned and walked across the lobby to his apartment he unlocked the door pushed it open and walked in leaving howard to grab it before it slammed in his face ill get lil gus said abruptly it was obvious to howard that kramer wanted a chance to talk to his wife and possibly warn her before she saw him shes in one of the two bedrooms down the hall he thought thats where she must be sorting things out shes finally found a use for that extra space it was almost five minutes before the kramers joined him in the living room lil kramer was visibly agitated she was rubbing her lips together in a compulsive manner and when howard extended his hand to her she rubbed her own hand on her skirt before she reluctantly responded to the greeting as he had expected her palm was wringing wet do the onetwo punch right now howard thought send them reeling im going to talk straight from the shoulder he said i wasnt here when the mackenzie kid disappeared but i was here the other day when his sister showed up lil you were as nervous then as you are now it was clear to me as an observer that you were afraid to talk to her that tells me that you know something about why or how that boy disappeared or that maybe you had something to do with it he watched as lil kramer threw a terrified look at her husband and gus kramers cheekbones darkened to an ugly purplered shade im right he thought theyre scared to death emboldened he added the sister isnt finished with you next time she might bring a private investigator or the cops with her if you think youll get away from her by rushing to pennsylvania youre both crazy if youre gone when she comes back shell ask questions shell find out you quit abruptly lil how many people have you told over the years that you dont intend to budge from new york until youre at least ninety now lil kramer was biting back tears howard softened his tone lil gus think about it if you leave now carolyn mackenzie and the cops will be sure you have something to hide i dont know what it is but youre my friends and i want to help you let me tell mr olsen that youve reconsidered and dont want to leave the next time carolyn mackenzie calls to make an appointment let me know and ill be here ill tell her in no uncertain terms that the management doesnt welcome her bothering the employees whats more ill remind her that there are stiff penalties for stalking he saw the relief on their faces and knew he had convinced them to stay and i didnt have to give them a raise or promise to leave them in this apartment he thought exultantly but as he accepted lils groveling gratitude and guss terse expression of thanks he was burning to find out why they were so afraid and what if anything they knew about the reason for mack mackenzies disappearance ten years ago s unday morning i went to the last mass at st francis de sales i got there early slipped into the last pew and after that tried to study the faces of the arriving congregation needless to say i didnt spot anyone who even vaguely resembled mack uncle dev always delivers a thoughtful homily frequently laced with irish humor today i didnt hear a word of it when the mass was over i stopped in at the rectory for a quick cup of coffee smiling and waving me into his office devon said he was meeting friends in westchester for a round of golf but they could wait he poured coffee into two thick white mugs and handed one to me as we sat down i hadnt yet told him that i had gone to see the kramers and when i did i was surprised to learn that he remembered them clearly after we knew that mack was missing i went over with your dad to that apartment on west end he said i remember the wife was all upset at the thought that something might have happened to mack do you remember anything about gus kramers reaction i asked when uncle dev gets a thoughtful frown on his face his resemblance to my father is almost startling sometimes that gives me comfort other times it hurts today for some reason was one of the days it hurt you know carolyn he said that kramer is an odd duck i think he was more upset by the possibility of media attention than he was concerned about mack ten years later that was exactly my reaction to kramer but knowing devon had to be on his way soon i didnt take the time to talk that over with him instead i took out the recorder i had found in macks suitcase and explained how i had discovered it then i played the tape for him i watched my uncles sad smile at the sound of macks voice speaking to the teacher then his bewildered frown when mack began to recite when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes i all alone beweep my outcast state and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries after i turned off the recorder my uncle said his voice husky im glad your mother wasnt around when you came across that tape carolyn i dont think id ever play it for her i dont intend to let her hear it but devon im trying to figure out its significance if any did mack ever talk to you about taking private lessons with a drama teacher at columbia i remember that in an offhand way he did you know when mack was about thirteen and his voice was changing he went through a period where it was really highpitched he got unmercifully teased about it at school i dont remember mack having a highpitched voice i protested then paused to search my memory when mack was thirteen i was eight years old of course his voice deepened but mack was a more sensitive kid than most people realized he didnt show his feelings when he was hurt but years later he admitted to me how miserable he had been during that period uncle dev tapped the side of his mug remembering maybe some residual of that pain got him involved in the voice lessons on the other hand mack wanted to become a trial lawyer and a good one he told me that a good trial lawyer must also be a good actor maybe that could account for both the lessons and the passage he recited on that tape obviously we could come to no conclusion whether mack had chosen that dark passage because of his own state of mind or was simply reciting a prepared text could only be a guessing game nor could we possibly know why he either stopped recording or erased the rest of the session with the drama teacher at uncle devon gave me a warm hug and went off to his golf game i went back to sutton place and was glad to go there because i no longer felt at home in my west village apartment the fact that i lived next door to where leesey andrews lived was terribly troubling to me if it were not for that fact i thought i am sure that detective barrott would not be trying to connect mack to her disappearance i wanted to talk to aaron klein the son of macks drama teacher it would be easy enough to contact him aaron had been working at wallace and madison for nearly twenty years and was now uncle elliotts chosen successor i remembered that a year after mack disappeared his mother was the victim of a robbery and was murdered and that mom and dad went with uncle elliott to visit him when he was sitting shiva the problem was i didnt want uncle elliott to be involved in our meeting as far as elliott was concerned he believed that mom and i were planning to accept macks request which in so many words was leave me alone if elliott knew i was contacting aaron klein because of mack as sure as day follows night he would feel it his duty to discuss it with mom that meant i had to make an appointment with klein outside the office and ask him to keep whatever conversation we had confidential then trust him not to go blabbing to elliott i went back to dads office flicked on the light and went over macks file again i knew lucas reeves the private investigator had interviewed macks drama teacher as well as other members of the columbia university faculty i had read his comments the other day and knew they werent helpful but now i was looking specifically for what he had written about esther klein it was very short ms klein expressed her sorrow and shock over macks disappearance she was unaware of any specific problem he may have been having an innocuous statement i thought remembering the dictionary definition of the word innocuous pallid uninspiring without power to interest or excite the few words she and mack had exchanged on the tape suggested they had had a warm relationship had esther klein been deliberately evasive when she was talking to reeves and if so why it was a question that made me toss and turn in bed that night monday morning couldnt come fast enough for me i took the chance that aaron klein was one of those executives who gets to his desk early and at twenty of nine phoned wallace and madison and asked for him his secretary had the usual question what is this in reference to and seemed miffed when i said it was personal but when she gave aaron klein my name he took my call immediately as briefly as i could i explained to him that i did not want to upset elliott or my mother by continuing to search for my brother but that i had come across a tape of mack and aarons mother and could i possibly meet him outside the office to play it for him his response was warm and understanding elliott told me that your brother phoned on mothers day last week and left a note saying that you were not to search for him exactly i said which is why i want to keep this between us but the tape that i found may suggest that mack was having a problem i dont know how much your mother may have talked to you about him she was very fond of mack klein said swiftly i do understand why you dont want to involve elliott and your mother ive always been so sorry about your brother listen im leaving early today my boys are in a school play this evening and i dont intend to miss it by being caught in traffic i have all the tapes my mother made with her private students in a box in the attic im sure any she made with your brother are there would you want to drive up to my house at about five oclock this evening ill give them all to you of course i promptly agreed i called down to the garage and told the attendant id be picking up my mothers car i knew it would be hurtful to hear macks voice over and over again but at least if i could be reasonably sure that the tape i found in the suitcase was one of many in that vein it would end the gnawing fear that he disappeared because he had a terrible problem he could not share with us satisfied that i had made the connection i made a fresh pot of coffee and turned on the morning news then listened with a sinking heart to the latest report on the leesey andrews case someone had tipped a reporter at the post that she had phoned her father saturday and had promised to call again on mothers day on mothers day my cell phone rang every instinct told me that it was detective barrott i did not answer and a moment later when i checked my messages i heard his voice ms mackenzie id like to see you again as soon as possible my number is i disconnected my heart racing i had his number and i had no intention of calling him back until after i saw aaron klein at five oclock that evening when i arrived at the klein home in darien i walked into a firestorm after i rang the bell the door was opened by an attractive woman in her late thirties who introduced herself as aarons wife jenny the strained expression on her face told me that something was terribly wrong she brought me into the den aaron klein was on his knees on the rug surrounded by overturned boxes stacks of tapes had been separated in individual piles there must have been three hundred of them at least aarons face was deathly pale when he saw me he got up slowly he looked past me to his wife jenny they are absolutely not here not one of them but it doesnt make sense aaron she protested why would he interrupted her and looked at me his expression hostile i have never been satisfied that my mother was the victim of a random crime he said flatly at the time it didnt seem as if anything had been taken from her apartment but that isnt true there is not a single tape of your brothers lessons with her here and i know there were at least twenty of them and i know they were there after he disappeared the only person who would want them would be your brother i dont understand i said sinking into the nearest chair i now believe my mother was killed because someone had to get something from her apartment the person who killed her took her house key at the time i couldnt find anything missing but there was something takenthe box that contained all the tapes she had made of your brother but your mother was attacked nearly a year after mack disappeared i said why would he want them what use would they be to him then suddenly outraged i demanded what are you insinuating im not insinuating aaron klein snapped at me i am telling you that i now believe that your missing brother may have been responsible for my mothers death there may have been something incriminating in those tapes he pointed out the window there is a girl from greenwich who has been missing all week i dont know her but if the newscast i heard coming up here in the car is accurate she called her father and promised to call again next mothers day isnt that the day of choice for your brother to call no wonder he warned you not to try to find him i stood up my brother is not a killer he is not a predator when the truth is known mack will not be responsible for whatever happened to your mother and leesey andrews i walked out got into the car and began to drive home i guess i was in such a state of shock that i was on some kind of mental autopilot because my next clear memory is of pulling up in front of our building on sutton placeand seeing detective barrott waiting for me in the lobby o h come on poppa youre not really mad at me you know i love you steve hockneys tone was wheedling as he sat across the table from his elderly uncle derek olsen he had collected olsen at his apartment and taken him by cab to shun lee west on sixtyfifth street for dinner were having the best chinese food in new york so were celebrating your birthday a few weeks late maybe well celebrate it all year steve saw that he was getting the reaction he wanted the anger was disappearing from his uncles eyes and an unwilling smile was hovering around his lips ive got to be more careful hockney warned himself forgetting his birthday was the stupidest thing ive done in a long time youre lucky i dont throw you out of your apartment and make you support yourself for a change olsen muttered but without rancor it always surprised him the swift rush of emotion he felt when he was with his dead sisters handsome son its because he looks so much like irma olsen reminded himselfthe same dark hair and big brown eyes the same wonderful smile flesh of my flesh he thought as he took a bite of steamed dumplings steve had ordered for him it was delicious these are good he said you take me to nice places all the time i must be giving you too much money no youre not poppa ive been doing a lot of gigs downtown my big break is just around the corner youre going to be so proud of me think about it my band is going to be the next rolling stones ive been hearing that since you were twenty how old are you now fortytwo hockney smiled thirtysix and you know it olsen laughed i know i know it but listen to me i still think you should take over running the apartments howie gets on my nerves sometimes he irritates people i would have fired him today except that the kramers changed their minds about leaving thank god the kramers theyll never leave new york their daughter made them buy that place in pennsylvania and ill tell you why she doesnt want her parents to be superintendents hurts her image with her dreary stuckup friends well howie talked them into staying but you should think about getting a lot more involved in the business oh please steve hockney thought then he suppressed the feeling of irritation be careful he warned himself again be very careful im his only living relative but with his moods he could leave everything to charity or even give a big cut to howie this week hes mad at him next week hell be telling me that nobody runs his business like howie that hes like a son to him he took a couple of bites then said well poppa ive been thinking that i should be more of a help to you look at all you do for me maybe the next time you make the rounds of the buildings i should go along with you and howie id really like to do that you really would derek olsens tone was sharp his eyes focused on his nephews face then satisfied with what he saw he said you mean it i can tell of course i mean it why do i call you poppa you took over being my father when i was two years old after all i warned your mother not to marry that man he was a nogood dishonest conniving when you were in your teens i was afraid youd end up just like him thank god you straightened yourself out with some help from me steve hockney smiled appreciatively then reached into his pocket and took out a small box he put it on the table and slid it across to his uncle happy birthday poppa ignoring the last steamed dumpling olsen quickly untied the ribbon tore the birthday wrapping paper and opened the box it was a montblanc pen with his initials engraved on the gold clip a pleased smile brightened his face how did you know i lost my good pen he asked the last time i saw you you were using a cheap giveaway it wasnt that hard to make the deduction the waiter arrived with a platter of mandarin duck for the rest of the dinner steve hockney carefully directed the conversation to reminiscences of his late mother and how she had always said that her big brother was the smartest nicest man shed ever known when mom was sick she told me that all she ever wanted me to do was to be just like you he was rewarded with the sight of sentimental tears filling his uncles eyes when dinner was over hockney hailed a cab and deposited his uncle at home not leaving him until he was inside his apartment doublelock the door he cautioned with a final affectionate hug as soon as the click confirmed that olsen had followed instructions he rushed downstairs and with rapid steps hurried to his own apartment ten blocks away inside he ripped off his jacket and slacks and shirt and tie and changed into dungarees and a sweatshirt time to check out soho he told himself god i thought id go nuts sitting with that old man for so long his groundfloor apartment had a private entrance when he went out he looked around and as he often did thought of the previous resident the drama teacher who had been murdered on the street only a block away that other place i had was the pits he thought but after the teachers death poppa was glad to let me have this i convinced him that people are superstitious he agreed with me that it was better not to rent it while her death was still in the news that was nine years ago by now who remembered im never going to leave it he swore to himself it suits my purposes exactly and there are no damn security cameras to keep track of me d etective barrott had one good reason for tracking me down he wanted the note that mack had left in the collection basket i had left it in macks file in my fathers office i invited barrott to come upstairs with me and he followed me into the apartment i was deliberately rude leaving him standing in the foyer while i went for the note it was still wrapped in the plastic sandwich bag i took it out and studied it ten words in block letters uncle devon tell carolyn she must not look for me how could i be sure that mack had printed those words the paper appeared to be unevenly cut from a larger sheet when i offered it to barrott last monday he hadnt been interested hed said that it had probably been handled by at least one usher my uncle my mother and myself i dont remember if i told him i had shown it to elliott as well was there any chance that macks fingerprints were still on it i put it back in the plastic and brought it out to barrott he was speaking on his cell phone when he saw me coming down the hall he ended the conversation i had hoped that he would simply take the note and leave but instead he said ms mackenzie i need to talk with you let me stay calm i prayed as i led him into the living room my knees suddenly felt weak and i sat in the big queen anne wing chair that had been dads favorite spot in this room i glanced up at the portrait of him my mother had had painted still hanging over the mantelpiece the wing chair faced the fireplace and dad used to joke that when he sat in it he did nothing but admire himself my god liv cast your eyes on that grandlooking devil he would say how much extra did you pay the painter to make me look that good sitting in dads chair somehow gave me courage detective barrott sat on the edge of the couch and looked at me without a hint of warmth ms mackenzie ive just been told that aaron klein of darien connecticut has called our office and told us he believes your brother is the person who murdered his mother nine years ago he said that he always felt that whoever killed her wanted something in her apartment he now is convinced it was the tapes with your brothers voice he said you told him you were bringing up a tape to play for him do you have that tape i felt as if he had dashed freezing water in my face i knew how that tape would sound to him he and everyone else in the district attorneys office would decide that mack had been in big trouble and had confided in esther klein i grasped the arms of the wing chair my father was a lawyer as i am i told barrott and before i say another word or give you anything i am going to consult a lawyer ms mackenzie i want to tell you something barrott said as of saturday morning leesey andrews was still alive there is nothing more important than finding her if it isnt already too late you must have heard the news reports that she phoned her father two days ago and told him shed call again next mothers day you must surely agree that it defies belief that its just a coincidence she is followingor being forced to followyour brothers modus operandi it wasnt a secret that mack phones on mothers day i protested other people knew about it a year after mack disappeared a reporter wrote an article about him and mentioned it all thats on the internet for anyone who wants to look it up it isnt on the internet that after your brothers drama teacher was murdered all the tapes of his voice were stolen from her apartment barrott shot back he gave me a stern look ms mackenzie if there is something on the tape you are holding that might in any way help us to find your brother your sense of decency ought to compel you to give it to me now i wont give you the tape i said but i will swear to you that there is nothing on it that would give you any idea of where mack might be ill go further the tape is less than a minute long mack says a few words to his drama teacher and then starts to recite a passage from shakespeare that is it i think barrott believed me he nodded if you do hear from him he said or if something occurs to you that might help us find him i hope you will keep in mind that leesey andrewss life is far more important than trying to protect your brother when barrott left i did the one thing i knew i had to do immediatelycall aaron kleins boss elliott wallace my fathers best friend my surrogate uncle my mothers suitor and tell him that by violating our agreement to accept macks wishes i had made my brother a suspect in both a murder and a kidnapping n ick demarco had spent an uneasy weekend he did not want to admit to himself how unsettling it had been to see carolyn again pizza and pasta had been his code name for himself when he used to have dinner at the mackenzie home on sutton place i had zero social graces he remembered i was always watching to see what fork they used how they placed their napkins on their laps pop tucked his under his chin even hearing mr mackenzie joke about his own workingclass background didnt do it for me i thought he was just being a nice guy trying to help an awkward idiot feel welcome and that crush i had on barbara when i look back it was just one more way in which i was jealous of mack it wasnt about her at all it was about carolyn i always felt comfortable with her she was always funny and sharp i enjoyed being with her the other night macks family was my snobby ideal i loved my own mom and dad but i wished dad didnt wear suspenders i wished mom didnt give a bear hug to all the regular customers whats that saying something like our children begin by loving us as they grow up they judge us sometimes they forgive us it should be the other way around parents start out by loving us as we grow up they judge us sometimes they forgive us but not often i hadnt wanted pop to have a storefront anymore i didnt know what i was doing to him when i put him in charge of my new restaurant he was miserable mom missed being in the kitchen too their highclass son wouldnt let them be who they are nick demarco the big success voted bachelor of the month the guy the girls chased he thought with an edge of bitterness nick demarco the big risktaker and now maybe its nick demarco the fool who took one chance too many leesey andrews did anyone hear me offer to help her get a start in show business it wasnt on the camera when i gave her the card with my address but did anyone happen to see me slide it over to her o n tuesday morning captain larry ahearn and detective bob gaylor both relatively fresh from six hours sleep were back in the tech room of the district attorneys office reviewing security tapes from the three other nightclubs in which young women had last been seen before they disappeared the cases of all three young women emily valley rosemarie cummings and virginia trent had been reopened the grainy photos from emily valley s case now ten years old had been sharpened and brightened by the latest in cuttingedge technology in the crowd of students who had entered the club named the scene it was possible to identify clearly mack mackenzie and nick demarco when we started looking for emily valley all those columbia kids came forward in a group after we contacted the ones who signed with credit cards ahearn commented thinking aloud it was only a month or so after we talked to all of them that the mackenzie boy disappeared looking back maybe we should have treated that disappearance as suspicious and tied it to the valley case he doesnt show up in any security videos of the clubs where the other missing girls were hanging out of course it was three years later that the cummings girl vanished and the trent girl was four years ago in all that time he could have changed his appearance a lot he was heavy into dramatics in prep school and in college gaylor pointed out id have sworn that demarco is our guy but the missing tapes from the drama teachers apartment and the reference to mothers day throw it back into mack mackenzies court ahearn said frustration in his tone and on his face how has he managed to hide for ten years what is he living on how can he be moving between brooklyn and manhattan carrying her cell phone without somebody spotting him every cop in new york has an ageenhanced picture of him and where did he keep leesey from the time she disappeared till the time she made that call saturday and if shes still alive where is he keeping her now and what is he doing to her roy barrott asked bitterly neither of his associates had heard him come into the tech room they both looked up startled youre supposed to be home getting some sleep ahearn said barrott shook his head i did i got as much as i need anyway listen i just stopped at the tech room they finished enhancing the two pictures that leeseys roommate kate took of her including the one we used on the poster she took these two pictures less than a minute after she snapped pictures of angelina jolie and brad pitt and their kids we can now see the faces of the people in the background and what did you find ahearn asked look at this picture see if you recognize the guy on the left its demarco ahearn said then repeated it as if he could not believe what he was seeing demarco exactly barrott confirmed demarco never told us he had been in greenwich village a week before leesey disappeared and was across the street when kate took her picture he also told us that when he isnt using his suv he drives a mercedes convertible there wasnt any mention of his chauffeurdriven mercedes sedan ahearn stood up i think its time we invite this guy back for some more questioning and squeeze him real hard he said it would have been easy for him to have his chauffeur get leesey out of his loft apartment in the middle of the night and hide her somewhere our guys keep coming up with new stuff on him demarcos bought a lot of property with not much money down hes on thin ice financially if he loses the liquor license from that fancy new woodshed place he could end up back in queens running a pasta joint ahearn looked at bob gaylor bring him in ten to one hell have a lawyer with him barrott snapped im surprised he took a chance on coming in alone last week m other was scheduled to fly home from greece on wednesday and my anxiety was mounting elliott had come over after my frantic phone call to him on monday evening to calm me down there was something intensely comforting to me about the way he took everything that i had to tell him including the fact that aaron klein his designated successor at wallace and madison now believed that mack was responsible for his mothers death thats absolute nonsense elliott said emphatically aaron forgets he told me at the time nothing had been taken from her apartment i remember his words clearlywhy would someone have killed my mother stolen her key and not bothered to rob the apartment i told him that whoever killed her was probably a drug addict who panicked when he realized she was dead aaron has been fixated on trying to find someone to blame for his mothers death for ages but ill be damned if hes going to try to pin it on mack there was nothing formal or reserved about elliotts heated response dad himself could not have been more vehement i think that was the moment when any hesitation i felt about the growing closeness between mom and elliott disappeared for good it was also the moment when i decided to drop uncle and call him elliott we agreed that it was inevitable i would be called in for questioning about mack and that we had to hire a defense lawyer i will not allow mack to be tried and convicted in the newspapers elliott swore ill search around and get the best person i can find we also agreed that we had to let mom know what was going on it wont be long before an enterprising reporter links macks disappearance with that of the missing girl because of the reference to mothers day elliott decided worse yet i wouldnt put it past the detectives to leak it to the media deliberately your mother must not look as if shes hiding from them elliott made the call and suggested gently that she head home early by the time mom got home on wednesday evening everything elliott had predicted had come to pass the media like bloodhounds on a fresh scent had effectively reopened the cases of the other three young women who had disappeared from nightclubs and reported the fact that mack and his college friends had been present at the scene the night the first girl emily valley vanished the mothers day connection between macks routine phone calls and leesey andrewss message to her father was also headline news of course mom elliotts arm around her firmly had to fight her way past the cameras and microphones when she and elliott arrived at sutton place her greeting to me was exactly what i expected but hoped wouldnt happen circles under eyes that were swollen with weeping for the first time looking every day of her sixtytwo years my mother said carolyn we agreed to let mack live his own life now because of your meddling my son is being hunted down like a criminal elliott has very kindly offered me the hospitality of his home my bags are still in his car and i intend to go there in the meantime you can contend with the mess out on the streets and make your apologies to our neighbors for destroying their privacy before i go i want to hear that tape quietly i retrieved the tape then sat with her in the kitchen and played it for her macks voice joking with his drama teacher do i sound like laurence olivier or tom hanksthenthe dramatic change in his tone when he began to recite the shakespeare quote when i turned it off moms face was pale with grief there was something wrong she whispered why didnt he come to me nothing could have been so bad that i wouldnt have helped him then she reached out her hand to me give me the tape carolyn she said mom i cant i said i wouldnt be surprised if we get a subpoena for it you think it means mack was in trouble another explanation is that he was simply reading a drama assignment elliott and i are meeting tomorrow morning with a criminal defense lawyer i need to have it with me to play for him without another word my mother turned from me elliott whispered ill call you later before he rushed down the hall after her when they were gone i turned on the tape again i all alone beweep my outcast state and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries mack may have been acting or he might have been talking about himself but with a combination of pain and bitterness i thought that now those words were fully applicable to me a couple of minutes later the apartment phone rang as i picked it up and said hello whoever was on the other end hung up h e couldnt get enough of the new media stories about the other three girls emily rosemarie and virginia he remembered them all so clearly emily had been the first the newspapers hadnt made too much of her disappearance at the beginning she had been a runaway so when she once again didnt come home to trenton new jersey even her parents conceded it was possible she had simply chosen to disappear but when rosemarie went missing three years later they began to think it was possible emily had been abducted then when virginia vanished four years ago the media had a field day connecting the three of them of course it didnt last every so often some wouldbe pulitzer prize winner would write a feature story linking the three young women but with nothing new to report the publics interest dropped to zero leesey had changed all that mack where are you now was the question on everyones lips dressed in a hooded running suit and wearing dark glasses he was jogging on sutton place as he expected it was crowded with media vans wonderful he thought wonderful he removed the small metal box from his pocket unsnapped it and took out leeseys cell phone now when he dialed theyd be able to pinpoint his location as being around here but thats what i want isnt it he asked himself with a smile as he dialed the phone number of the apartment waited to hear carolyn answer the call then disconnected then quickening his pace he disappeared into the brisk pedestrian traffic on fiftyseventh street b ruce galbraith and his wife dr barbara hanover galbraith had so far as possible avoided talking about mack mackenzie but finally on wednesday evening after the children were in bed and they had finished watching the ten oclock news bruce knew he had to raise the subject they were in the library of their spacious park avenue apartment whenever bruce was away on a business trip the realization of how happy he was in his home and with his family hit him afresh barbara had changed to light green pajamas and unpinned her ash blond hair so that it fell loose on her shoulders he had long since passed the days when he felt clumsy and awkward in her presence but even so the sense that he might one day wake up and find hed been dreaming that life as he knew it was an illusion always lingered in his subconscious he had witnessed the growing tension in barbara for the past few days since the media began linking mack to the disappearance of leesey andrews the girl from connecticut and then to the murder of the drama teacher during the broadcast with the jealousy he had never overcome bruce had watched his wifes face when pictures of mack were flashed on the screen after he pushed the power button on the remote and watched the screen turn dark he knew it was time to discuss what needed to be done barb he said i was in the nightclub the night that first girl disappeared i know but so were twenty other guys from columbia including nick and mack barbara said avoiding his eyes carolyn mackenzie called me but i havent returned her call ill bet anything that she follows up on it as the police investigation widens its inevitable theyll look me up nick and i were macks roommates after all he watched as his wife tried to force back tears what are you driving at she asked her voice unsteady i think you and the kids should visit your father in marthas vineyard hes had three heart attacks no one would question it if you tell people hes in bad shape again what about school for what were paying we can arrange to get lesson plans and a private tutor the school year is over in a few weeks time anyhow he saw the uncertainty on his wifes face barbara you joined a practice with two other pediatric surgeons so youd have a measure of control over your personal life i would say this is a time to assert that control he got up walked over to her bent down and kissed the top of her head i could kill mack for what he did to you he said quietly im over it bruce i really am no youre not he thought but ive learned to live with that and theres no way on gods earth ill let mack hurt you again o n wednesday evening shortly after mom and elliott left detective barrott phoned i had thought that things couldnt get much worse but i was wrong barrott quietly asked if i knew that the call i had just received that i had thought was a wrong number had been made from leesey andrewss cell phone i was so shocked that i think it was a full minute before i said something like but thats impossible i paused to digest the fact thats absolutely impossible barrott curtly assured me that it was true and did i think it was my brother trying to reach me when i answered it someone hung up i thought it had to be a wrong number cant you tell that i didnt speak to anyone i asked him angrily we know that we also know that this is an unlisted phone in your home ms mackenzie make no mistake if your brother is the one who has leeseys phone and if he tries again to contact you and you do not help us find him you could become an accessory to a very serious crime i didnt answer him i simply broke off the connection sometime between four and seven am on thursday morning i decided to phone lucas reeves and ask to meet with him as soon as possible i needed help from someone i could trust to be thorough and impartial i had already seen from studying his file on mack that he had done a good job interviewing seemingly every possible person who had been close to my brother the opinion he had given dad was very clear there is nothing in your sons background that would suggest he was experiencing a problem that would cause him to flee i would not rule out the possibility of a mental illness that he had successfully concealed from everyone elliott and i were meeting at noon at the office of thurston carver the criminal defense lawyer whom elliott had found to represent us at nine am i phoned reeves he was not in yet but his secretary promised he would call me back as soon as he arrived it was obvious that she recognized my name a half hour later he returned the call as briefly as possible i explained what had happened is there any chance you could see me this morning i asked hearing the desperation in my voice his voice was deep and resonant as he answered ill rearrange my schedule where is your meeting with the lawyer on park and fortyfifth i said the metlife building my phone number is the same but i moved my office two years ago im on park avenue and thirtyninth street just a few blocks down from metlife can you be here at ten thirty yes i could i was already showered and dressed the unpredictable weather had served up another blustery day looking out the window at people wearing jackets and keeping their hands in their pockets i changed from the light suit i had planned to wear to a velour running suit which made me look less like a lawyer and more like somebodys sister i wont say that it flattered me it was dark gray and when i looked in the mirror i could see that it brought out the circles under my eyes and the unusual paleness of my skin i dont usually bother with much makeup during the day but i took the time to use foundation a touch of eye shadow blush mascara and lip gloss all tarted up in defense of my brother i thought then hated the bitterness in my thinking if only i had not gone to see detective barrott if only i had not found the tape in macks suitcase useless thoughts i could feel the beginning of a headache and even though i wasnt hungry i went down to the kitchen made a pot of coffee and toasted an english muffin i carried it to the breakfast alcove and sat at the table gazing at the spectacular view of the east river thanks to the strong breeze the current was visibly swift and i found myself identifying with it i was being carried by a current i could not fight and i had to let it take me along until it either overwhelmed or released me i had been glad that mom was in greece for those few days and i had the apartment to myself but that was when she was supposed to be somewhere else it was incredible to me that she was in new york and not staying in her own home but when i left the apartment i understood why the media trucks were there in full force and reporters rushed to me looking for a statement this is what happened to her last night i thought i had phoned down to the doorman to hail a cab for me and he had one waiting ignoring the microphones i jumped into it and said start driving i didnt want anyone to overhear my destination twenty minutes later i was in the reception room of lucas reevess office promptly at ten thirty he escorted a tenselooking couple whom i guessed to be other clients to the outer door looked around and came over to me ms mackenzie come right in i only remember meeting him once when he came to sutton place ten years ago so either he remembered my face or since i was the only one in the waiting room he assumed i was carolyn mackenzie lucas reeves was even shorter than i remembered i dont think he was more than five feet four with shoes on he had a thick head of wiry saltandpepper hair that had clearly been dyed to give the illusion of natural graying his face was creased with small lines around the mouth which suggested to me that he almost certainly had been a serious smoker his deep pleasant voice was incongruous coming from such a small man but it matched the warmth in his eyes and his hearty handshake i followed him into his private office instead of going to his desk he led me to a seating area with two chairs a couch and a coffee table i dont know about you ms mackenzie he began as he waved me to one of the chairs but for me its time for midmorning coffee how about you or like my british friends would you prefer a cup of tea black coffee would be perfect i said thats two of us the receptionist opened the door and poked her head in whatll it be mr reeves two black thanks marge turning to me he said in this day and age of political correctness i started to make the coffee myself in our little kitchen my assistant my secretary my receptionist and my accountant bodily threw me out they said my coffee would peel the paint from a wall i was so grateful for his attempt to put me at ease that i felt quick tears rush to my eyes he pretended not to notice i had offered to bring macks file with me but he had said he had a duplicate of it his was on the coffee table he pointed to it bring me up to date carolyn his eyes never left my face as i explained how because of me mack had become a suspect in both the leesey andrews and esther klein cases and now they think mack has leeseys cell phone sure we have a private number but its been the same one since i was a child hundreds of people know it i bit my lip it was quivering so much i could not go on the thought flashed through my mind that the reason mom wanted to stay in the apartment all these years was to be sure shed never miss a call from mack listening to me reevess expression had become increasingly troubled i am afraid your brother is a very convenient suspect carolyn i will be honest i could see no reason why a twentyoneyearold man with his background would choose to disappear quite frankly in the last few days with all the media attention on him i have been studying his file and doing some followup purely for my own satisfaction your father paid me generously and i could give him absolutely no help in solving your brothers disappearance he looked past me ah here is the coffee i did not prepare he waited until the cups were on the table and we were alone again before he continued now i am looking at it from the viewpoint of the police the night the first girl disappeared your brother was at that club the scene but so were his two roommates other columbia students and about fifteen more patrons it was a small club but there were also of course a bartender some waiters and a small musical group that list as complete as i could make it is there in your brothers file since the police now believe your brother may be involved in that first disappearance let us think like them with technology it is increasingly easy to follow peoples lives i am proud to say that this agency has a technical system second to none we will begin to update our knowledge of everyone we know to have been in that club ten years ago when all of this started he took a sip of his coffee excellent strength without bitterness admirable qualities dont you agree i wondered if that was an admonition had he sensed my growing bitterness toward mack and even i admitted to myself to my mother he didnt wait for an answer you said you felt that the superintendents the kramers might have something to hide i dont know whether they have something to hide i said i do know that they seemed terribly nervous almost as if they were being accused of knowing something about macks disappearance i interviewed them ten years ago ill have my staff check to see if there was anything out of the ordinary in their lives that might be of use for us to know now tell me about nicholas demarco trust me with any slight nuance that you may have received from him either positive or negative i wanted to be objective nick is obviously ten years older now i said hes more mature of course at age sixteen i had a crush on him so i dont know that i could possibly have judged him honestly he was handsome he was fun looking back i think he was flirting with me and i was young enough to think that i was special to him mack warned me away from nick and after that the few times he came to dinner i made it a point to be out with my friends mack warned you away reeves raised an eyebrow bigbrother stuff i guess i was wearing my heart on my sleeve and mack said that all the girls fell for nick other than that i would say that when i saw him last i had the feeling that nick seemed like someone with a lot on his mind did you talk with him about the other roommate in that apartment bruce galbraith yes nick is out of touch with him frankly i dont think he liked bruce very much he even called him the lone stranger i told you i left a message asking to meet with bruce but so far he hasnt responded call him again i doubt that with all the media attention your brother is getting bruce galbraith would ignore your request to see him in the meantime ill get started immediately on updating our files on the others because of the reference to mothers day the police were already trying to tie mack to the disappearance of leesey andrews and by extension to the disappearance of all those young women now that call to your home from leeseys cell phone will make them certain of his guilt every clue leads conveniently back to mack i am beginning to wonder if everything that has happened began that night in the scene weeks before mack disappeared i pounced on that mr reeves are you saying that someone else may be deliberately trying to tie mack to the disappearance of those four women i think its possible as you yourself said there was a feature article some years ago that made public the fact that your brother only calls on mothers day who knows if someone did not tuck that piece of information in his mind and is now using it to deflect suspicion from himself there are all kinds of identity theft following the known pattern of someone who has vanished and chooses not to defend himself may be one of them leeseys abductor has her cell phone he may also have your unlisted number it was a possibility that made sense when i left reevess office i felt that this time i had come to the right person somebody who would search for the truth without the preconceived notion that mack had become a killer a ccompanied by his lawyer paul murphy nick demarco returned to the detective squad section of the district attorneys office on thursday afternoon this time the atmosphere in captain ahearns office was openly hostile there were no handshakes no brief expression of thanks that he had promptly responded to the phone call requesting his presence as soon as possible but nick had other problems on his mind early tuesday morning after a frantic call from his mother that his father was being rushed to the hospital with chest pains nick had flown to florida by the time he got there the tests had so far been negative but his father had been kept in the hospital to guard against the possibility that he was building up to a heart attack when nick entered the hospital room his mother had rushed into his arms and hugged him fiercely oh nick i thought we had lost him she cried his father an older image of himself propped up on pillows his face pale an oxygen tube in his nostrils and an iv drip in his hand was clearly unhappy nick i hate hospitals was his greeting but maybe it isnt such a bad thing this happened after all in the ambulance i was thinking about things i wish id said to you only your mother wouldnt let me say them now youre going to hear them im sixtyeight years old ive been working since i was fourteen for the first time in my life i feel useless and i dont like it dad i bought a restaurant for you to run nick protested youre the one who decided to retire sure you bought a restaurant here but you should have known it wasnt right for me i was a round peg in a square hole in that place it made me sick to see you bleeding money with your fancy overhead and pricey food ive seen these places come and go do yourself a favor and sell that one or else put some staples on the menu that people can count on when they dont want fois gras and caviar dominick dont excite yourself his mother pleaded i have to excite myself ive got to get this off my chest before i do have a heart attack bachelor of the month it was disgusting to watch how pleased you were youd think you got the congressional medal of honor while im still around to tell you cut it out dad i hear you and believe it or not im listening this time tell me what do you want what can i do to make you happy i dont want to play golf and i dont want to sit in a pricey condominium where i might get beaned by a golf ball because were next to the sixteenth hole dad all thats easy to take care of what else nick had not yet gotten over the look of scorn in his fathers eyes youre thirtytwo years old get real be the son we were so proud of stop running around with the women you meet in clubs in fact get out of the club business youll get in trouble find yourself a nice girl your mother and i are pushing seventy we were married fifteen years before god sent us a son dont make us wait fifteen years from now to have a grandchild all this was going through nicks mind as he and his attorney settled themselves in hard uncomfortable chairs in front of captain ahearns desk detectives barrott and gaylor were seated on either side of the captain its a firing squad nick thought a glance at his attorney showed him that murphy was having the same reaction mr demarco ahearn began you didnt tell us you have a mercedes sedan which you only use when you are being driven by your chauffeur nick frowned wait a minute if im right you asked about cars i drove i never drive the sedan its either the convertible or the suv when im on my own you didnt mention your chauffeur either i wouldnt have thought there was a reason to mention him we dont agree mr demarco ahearn told him particularly since your chauffeur benny seppini has an extensive criminal record without looking at him nick knew what paul murphy was thinking why didnt my client tell me that benny is fiftyeight years old nick told ahearn as a kid he had no home life and became involved in a street gang while he was in his teens when he was seventeen he got sentenced as an adult to prison for burglary and served five years when he got out he started working for my father that was thirtyfive years ago when my father retired five years ago he began working for me he is a decent good man didnt his exwife get a restraining order on him ten years ago ahearn snapped bennys first wife died young his second was trying to get him to sign over their condo to her that was a phony trumpedup charge and she dropped it the minute she got the condo uhhuh mr demarco do you do much walking around greenwich village in the daytime of course i dont im a businessman did you ever see leesey andrews before monday night a week ago to the best of my knowledge absolutely not let me show you a picture we have of you mr demarco ahearn nodded to barrott who shoved copies of the enhanced photographs leeseys roommate had taken of her across the desk to nick and murphy recognize the fellow in the background of the second one mr demarco barrott asked of course thats me in the background nick snapped i remember that day i was meeting a real estate agent for lunch im interested in buying property in the area near where the old railroad tracks are being developed once that development starts the surrounding property will go skyhigh i saw all the paparazzi in action and looked over to see what was going on brad pitt and angelina jolie were there where were you having lunch at casa florenza right around the corner from where the picture was taken then you claim you didnt see leesey andrews being photographed by her friend i not only claim i didnt see her nick replied heatedly do you have the bill for that luncheon gaylor asked in a tone that suggested he would be surprised to see one no i do not the real estate broker is trying to sell me property so he paid if he succeeds his commission will keep putting gas in his car for a long time how long will you be able to continue putting gas in all your cars mr demarco ahearn asked youre stretched pretty thin financially arent you what do mr demarcos business affairs have to do with our presence here paul murphy demanded maybe nothing at all ahearn replied and maybe a great deal if the state decides to cancel the liquor license of the woodshed i dont think your client will make a living selling popsicles there and trust me we will find a reason to have it canceled if we even suspect that mr demarco is not being totally candid with us ahearn turned to nick do you have the unlisted phone number of the mackenzie home on sutton place unless its been changed im sure i have it somewhere i remember phoning mrs mackenzie after her husband died on do you think leesey andrews is dead i certainly hope not that would be a tragedy do you know if shes still alive what kind of unbelievable question is that were out of here nick murphy was on his feet ahearn ignored him mr demarco do you own a cell phone that is not registered to you one that uses a prepaid card the kind gamblers and wiseguys use thats it were not going to listen to any more of your cheap insinuations murphy shouted it was as though larry ahearn had not heard him and does your troubled chauffeur have a similar phone mr demarco and if he does did he respond to your frantic call to get leesey out of your loft apartment and if she wasnt already dead did he decide to keep her around for his own amusement and if that was the case has he kept you informed as to her welfare nick his fists clenched was almost at the door when he heard ahearns final question or are you protecting your college roommate mack mackenzie or perhaps helping his pretty sister to protect him you had a little têteatête with her last friday night didnt you a fter i left lucas reeves i met elliott at thurston carvers office in the metlife building instantly i realized that i had seen carver around court while i was clerking for judge huot he was a big man with a mane of hair that i guessed to be prematurely whitei doubted that he was more than fiftyfive years old i felt somewhat fortified by my meeting with reeves and told carver the theory he had suggested to me mack was missing that he called every year on mothers day was public knowledge and whoever had kidnapped leesey andrews was trying to throw suspicion on mack by the phone calls he was making elliott who looked tired and deeply concerned seized on that possibility he told me that last night my mother was so upset when they reached his apartment she broke down crying and sobbing to the extent that he was desperately worried about her now i realized last night that olivia has always been sure that something must have snapped in macks mind to make him disappear like that he explained to carver now she believes that if he is guilty of these disappearances he may be completely insane and might end up being shot when the police find him and she blames me i said carolyn she has to blame someone that wont last you know it wont youve been my rod and staff through all this thats what mom had said to me last week after macks call on the morning of mothers day i still had every faith that at some point she would understand why i had tried to bring macks situation to some kind of closure in the meantime she had elliott to help her and i realized how deeply grateful i was to him for being there for her now no matter how this turned out at that moment sitting in the elegantly paneled office of thurston carver i surrendered any jealousy i felt at the probability that elliott would replace my father in my mothers life later that day i called bruce galbraith after i had waited for what seemed an eternity he got on the phone and grudgingly agreed to meet me in his office on friday afternoon i must tell you carolyn he said i have neither seen nor heard from mack since the day he disappeared i cant imagine what you hope to learn from me i was chilled by the venom in his voice but did not give him the answer that was on the tip of my tongue i want to know why you hate mack so much on friday afternoon i was ushered into galbraiths office it was on the sixtythird floor of his building on the avenue of the americas and offered sweeping views of the city the only comparable view i can think of is from the rainbow room in rockefeller center my memory of bruce was blurry dad and mom had kept me away from the search for mack when they were going back and forth to his apartment after he disappeared i had a vague memory that bruce had sandy hair and rimless glasses his greeting was cordial enough and he chose to sit not in what i think would be his usual chair but in one of the two matching leather chairs on either side of his desk he began by offering sympathy for the way the tabloids were tying mack to the disappearance of leesey andrews i can only imagine what that is doing to your mother he said then he added after a pause and of course to you bruce i said you can understand how desperate i am not only to find mack but whether i find him or not to clear his name of any connection with the women who disappeared i absolutely understand that he said but the point is that mack nick and i merely shared an apartment mack and nick were tight they hung out together they dated together nick was at your house for dinner a fair amount hes a much better person to ask about mack than i am you might as well be talking to the rest of the graduating class at columbia for all i can tell you what about barbara i asked she came to dinner once i thought she was nicks girlfriend but he told me she had a crush on mack then she married you after mack disappeared have you ever talked with her about mack would she have any idea what was in his mind before he vanished barbara and i have of course talked about mack with all this recent publicity she is as bewildered as i am at the idea that he could be involved in any crime she said that certainly isnt the person she knew his voice was calm but i saw a deep flush creep up from his neck to his cheeks he does hate mack i thought is it jealousy and how far would that jealousy have carried him he was so buttoned up so contained an ordinarylooking man who judging from his success was an extraordinarily gifted real estate tycoon an image of mack with his stunning good looks his wonderful sense of humor his everpresent charm flooded my mind i remembered having heard that mack beat galbraith out by a fraction to be in the top ten of the graduating class that must have been a massive blow to galbraiths ego i thought and after mack disappeared barbara the girl nick said had been crazy about mack married galbraith maybe as her ticket to medical school i met barbara at my house years ago i said id appreciate a chance to talk with her im afraid that isnt possible galbraith said flatly her father is very ill he lives on marthas vineyard she flew up there with the children to be with him in his final weeks he stood up and i got the message the meeting was over he walked me to the reception room and i reached out to shake his hand i didnt miss the way he rubbed his palm on his trouser leg before he reluctantly accepted mine his was still sweaty and damp a plain man in an expensive suit his eyes shuttered i remembered that nick had called him the lone stranger i f there was one person lil kramer disliked more than howard altman it was steve hockney derek olsens nephew that was why when he arrived unannounced on friday morning lil felt thoroughly rattled howies advice to her and gusthat it would be unwise to rush to pennsylvania as if they had something to hidethey had originally welcomed with gratitude but she was totally aware of olsens shifting alliances between his nephew steve and his assistant howie and seeing steve alone terrified her howie is on the outs with olsen she thought and steve is going to take over she was glad gus had gone upstairs to change the filters in some of the air conditioners he was in a foul mood after cleaning the staircase between the second and third floors one of the college kids had spilled beer there during the night they must have been dragging up a keg he had grumbled minutes before hockney arrived spilled beer all over the whole flight wouldnt have killed them to have mopped it up themselves its a good thing gus noticed it before hockney got here she thought hell probably make a big show of checking out the halls and the staircases trying to find something wrong a sudden feeling of fatigue overcame her maybe after all it would be nice not to be busy all the time trying to sound civil she invited hockney in and asked if hed like a cup of tea he flashed her a broad smile as he strode past her he certainly is goodlooking she thought and he knows it he always was full of himself and when he was around twenty olsen had to bail him out of a few problems he almost went to jail now there was a certain insolent glitter in his eyes he declined the tea but settled on the couch his arm over the back his legs crossed lil he began my uncle turned eightythree last month i know it she said we sent him a card youre better than i am steve smiled again but i feel its time that i took over a lot of the management of his affairs you know him he wont show that hes feeling his age but i can see that he is i also know that howie altman is getting on his nerves a lot lately we get along with him lil said carefully hes been bullying you about giving up this apartment hasnt he i think thats over hes a bully i know my uncle would listen to you if you made him aware just how nasty howie has been and can be to you both why would i cause trouble when its none of my business what mr olsen thinks of howie its because i want your help lil you seem to forget that i was here in the building when mack mackenzie all but accused you of stealing his watch that was only a few days before he disappeared whitelipped lil stammered he found that watch he apologized did anyone hear him apologize i dont know i mean no i dont think so hockney unfolded himself from the couch lil youre lying about the apology i can tell but dont worry i never told anyone about macks watch and i never will we dont like howie do we lil by the way ill tell uncle derek that this building is the jewel in his crown thanks to the way you and gus keep it d erek olsen was far from being only the irascible petulant old man that his nephew steve and his buildings manager howie thought him to be he was in fact a shrewd investor who had watched his real estate holdings in strategically chosen apartment buildings turn into a personal fortune worth many millions of dollars now he had come to the conclusion that the time was right to begin liquidating his assets on friday morning he called wallace and madison and brusquely demanded to be put through to elliott wallace elliotts secretary long used to olsens behavior did not bother to tell him that mr wallace was on his way to an urgent meeting instead she asked him to hold and rushed down the corridor to catch elliot at the elevator its olsen she said with an exasperated sigh elliott retraced his steps to his office and picked up the phone derek how are you he asked his tone hearty im all right your socalled nephews in a lot of trouble i see as you well know mack has been missing for ten years it is absurd that the police are trying to connect him to any crime what can i do for you he caused me a lot of trouble by disappearing when he was living in one of my apartments anyhow thats not why i called my birthday was last month im eightythree years old its time to sell everything ive been suggesting that for the past five years if i had sold five years ago i wouldnt get the price ill get now im coming in to talk to you monday morning ten oclock okay for you monday at ten would be fine elliott said cordially when he was sure olsen had hung up he slammed the phone down into the cradle ill have to reschedule the entire day he snapped to his secretary as he hurried back to the elevator she watched him go with sympathetic eyes the meeting that had been scheduled was to decide who would assume aaron kleins responsibilities in the firm after staying home for four days klein had phoned in his resignation saying that it was impossible for him to work side by side with someone who was the champion of his mothers killer g regg andrews had set out a pattern for himself and he stuck to it after he left the hospital he went straight home grabbed something to eat and went straight to bed his alarm was set for one am by two am he was nursing a beer at the bar of the woodshed and stayed there until closing time then sitting in his car down the street he watched to see the pattern of how the waiters bartenders and band members exited the building checking to see that they all left within a few minutes of one another and that no one came out alone as theyd all claimed about the night leesey disappeared for the last three nights he had then walked the mile distance between the club and leeseys apartment stopping to talk to anyone he saw on the street and asking if by any chance they had been around at the time leesey vanished and perhaps had seen her the answer was always negative the fourth and fifth nights he drove back and forth covering other streets just in case she might not have taken the most direct route on saturday morning at after watching the employees lock the door of the woodshed he was about to start driving around the neighborhood when there was a rap at the window a man with streaks of dirt on his face and unkempt hair was staring in at him sure it was a request for money gregg rolled the car window down only a few inches youre the brother the man said his voice hoarse his alcoholladen breath sour instinctively gregg pulled his head back yes i am i saw her will you promise i get the reward if you can help me find my sister yes take my name down gregg reached into the glove compartment and pulled out a pad its zach winters i live at the shelter on mott street you think you saw my sister i saw her the night she disappeared why didnt you come forward at once nobody believes people like me i tell them i saw her next thing theyll be saying i did something to her thats what happens winters put a grimy hand on the car to steady himself if whatever you tell me helps us find my sister i will personally hand the reward to you what do you know she was the last customer out she started to walk that way he pointed then a big suv pulled up and stopped gregg felt his insides twist was she forced into it no way i heard the driver call hey leesey and she jumped right in the suv herself could you tell what kind it was sure it was a black mercedes o n saturday morning he was overcome with one of his periodic episodes of remorse he felt terrible about what he had done i didnt think id ever kill anyone again he thought i was scared after the first one i tried to be good but then it happened again twice i still tried to stop but i couldnt but then he made me do it againand again and after that i couldnt stop sometimes i feel like telling him but that would be crazy and im not crazy i have an idea that im thinking about it would be dangerous but then its always been dangerous i know someday ill be caught but i wont let them send me to prison ill go my own way and take whoevers around with me i havent touched the phone since wednesday night ill make the next phone call on sunday its such a good idea and after that ill find someone else it isnt time to stop yet e arly saturday morning gregg andrews called larry ahearns cell phone the words tumbling from his mouth to report that someone had seen leesey get into a black mercedes suv the night she disappeared and she knew the driver gregg insisted his voice hoarse with fatigue and strain he called out her name and she jumped right in in the eleven or twelve days since leesey had been reported missing ahearn had not slept more than four hours a night when his phone rang he was at home in a heavy sleep from exhaustion now fighting to awaken he looked at the clock gregg its in the morning where are you im on my way to my apartment i have zach winters a street person with me hes drunk ill let him sleep it off at my apartment then ill bring him in to talk to you im convinced he doesnt know any more than what i told you but its our first solid lead how about that nightclub owner the one who invited leesey to sit at his table what does he drive nick demarco was driving an suv that night ahearn thought he told us he used that vehicle because he was carrying his golf clubs im not sure if he said what color it is now fully awake he sat up slid out of bed and walked out into the hall closing the bedroom door behind him demarco has at least three different sets of wheels he said carefully lets find out if his suv is a black mercedes i think i remember that it is gregg well also have to check on this witness you said his name was zach winters thats right well look him up too if youre bringing him to your apartment be careful he sounds like a wino he is but i dont care maybe hell remember something more about leesey when he wakes up oh god gregg what is it larry im falling asleep i almost hit a cab that cut in front of me ill see you around ten oclock in your office a click told ahearn that gregg andrews had disconnected his cell phone the door from the bedroom opened larrys wife sheila still tying the sash on her robe said matteroffactly ill make coffee while you shower an hour later larry was in his office with barrott and gaylor it sounds fishy to me barrott said flatly gaylor nodded my guess is that if this guy whatshisname zach winters was on the woodshed block that night he was probably too drunk to see never mind hear what was said ill bet anything hes just trying to get the reward thats the way i read it ahearn agreed but lets start checking him out gregg said hed bring him in here around ten oclock gaylor was consulting his notes when demarco was here the first time he talked about having his suv in the loft garage because he was going to transport his golf clubs to the plane the next morning he looked at barrott and ahearn his suv is a black mercedes he said crisply so maybe after he left the club he went to his loft picked it up and decided to go back and try to connect with leesey ahearns lips were a tight narrow line i think its about time we put the heat on demarco and let the media know that hes a person of interest in leeseys disappearance barrott was opening the mackenzie file listen to this larry the first time the father came here after the son had been reported missing the guys took notes of what he said no reason for mack to take off hes on top of the world graduated in the top ten of his class duke law school bought him a mercedes suv as graduation present you never saw a kid so thrilled only a couple of hundred miles on it when he disappeared so what ahearn snapped he left it in the garage when he disappeared did you ask what color it was it was black im just wondering if its still macks favorite vehicle what happened to the one the father bought him i dont know maybe the sister can tell us give her a call ahearn commanded its not even six oclock gaylor pointed out were up arent we barrott said hold on ahearn held up his hand roy did you ask carolyn mackenzie to give you the note her brother left in the collection basket she handed it to me the day she came to see me two weeks ago barrott said somewhat defensively i gave it back to her it was a scrap of paper in block printing with ten words on it i thought it was useless to try to do anything with it we dont have her brothers fingerprints on file her uncle the priest at least one usher at the church mackenzie herself and her mother had handled it it probably is useless but i want a subpoena issued for it and for that tape she didnt give you the other night as well now call carolyn and ask what happened to her brothers car my guess is that after a year or two they sold it barrott admitted to himself that there was some satisfaction at waking carolyn so early her refusal to play the tape or give it to him on monday evening had convinced him that beyond any doubt she was protecting her brother he was pleased when she answered on the first ring suggesting to him that she had not been sleeping well neither have the rest of us he thought he spoke to her briefly from the startled look on his face ahearn and gaylor knew he had stumbled onto an interesting development when he disconnected barrott said shell check with her lawyer if he agrees she will turn over the tape and the note you may have heard me assure her that he will agree what about her brothers suv youre not going to believe this it was stolen out of the sutton place garage in the familys apartment building about eight months after mack took off stolen gaylor exclaimed were other vehicles taken ahearn asked quickly no that was the only one its not a large facility one kid was on duty asleep in the booth after midnight next thing he knew he had a bag over his head tape over his mouth and was handcuffed to the chair by the time he was found that suv was gone the three men looked at one another if mack stole his own wheels its entirely possible hes still driving it gaylor suggested my fatherinlaw has had his mercedes for twenty years and if hes still driving it and if the winos story checks out theres an equally good chance that leesey may have driven off with mackenzie not demarco larry ahearn said somberly all right lets get those subpoenas maybe that tape mackenzie made with the drama teacher will give us something to work with h oward altman was well aware of his bosss shifting loyalties but his first hint that something was seriously wrong occurred when mr olsen did not go out to brunch with him on saturday morning he had noticed olsen using the new montblanc pen and correctly guessed that it was probably a present from steve hockney olsens nephew steve is schmoozing the old man howard thought bitterly it would be just like olsen to leave everything to him the first thing steve would do is fire me then hed sell all the apartment houses and pocket the cash the building he lived in on ninetyfourth street was one of the smallest olsen owned it was four stories high with only two apartments on each floor most of the tenants had been there for years his apartment was the only one on the lobby floor sparsely furnished and immaculately neat the living room was dominated by his sixtyinch television set most of howards evenings were split evenly by his two favorite activities watching movies on television and visiting on the internet with buddies from all over the world he found them infinitely more interesting than the people he met in his daily life an excellent chef he always cooked himself a good dinner watched a movie while he had a couple of glasses of wine and ate from a tray table then turned off the television set and went directly to his bedroom computer howard loved this apartment which came with his job he loved his job especially now that he was in charge of all olsens buildings i earned it he told himself defensively i got it because i proved myself i can fix anything thats broken i can put up a wall to make two rooms out of one i can replace old wiring and build cabinets i can paint and wallpaper and scrape floors thats why olsen kept promoting me but what happens if he leaves everything to steve the question persisted in his mind for once he could not focus on the movie in his dvd player how could he get olsen to sour on his nephew and then the answer came to him he had a master key to all the apartments in the building where steve hockney lived hed put a security camera in steves apartment ive seen him when hes high and ive always suspected that he deals in drugs howard thought if i can prove it that would finish him with his uncle blood is thicker than water maybe pleased at finding a possible solution to the impending problem he turned off the television and went down the hall to his bedroom he smiled at the familiar whooshing sound he heard as he turned on his computer he realized how much he was looking forward to connecting with his friend singh in mumbai tonight i had barely slept friday night and the six am call saturday morning from detective barrott finished any hope i had of drifting off again for at least a few more hours why is barrott so interested in what happened to macks suv i asked myself as i replaced the receiver and got out of bed as usual i had left the windows of my bedroom open and padded across the room to close them the sun had already risen over the east river and it held the promise of a beautiful day the breeze was cool but i could see that this time the weather forecasters were rightit would be sunny and pleasant about seventy degrees by noon in short a perfect morning in late may which meant that right now there was undoubtedly an exodus from the city by people who hadnt already left for their summer place last night the residents of sutton place who didnt have a second home in the hamptons almost inevitably had one on the cape or nantucket or marthas vineyard or somewhere dad had never wanted to be anchored to one vacation home but before mack disappeared we always went away in august my favorite was the year i was fifteen when dad rented a villa in tuscany about half an hour from florence it was a magical month all the more so because it was the last time we were all together my mind snapped back to the present why did barrott call me about macks suv our garage is relatively small it only accommodates the automobiles of the residents of the building with about ten extra spaces for visitors dad had just bought the suv for mack a week before he disappeared mack had parked it in a garage on the west side near his apartment when hed been missing two weeks dad took the spare key and brought the suv back here i remember mack had obviously driven it in bad weather because it had some mud splatters on the side and on the drivers mat dad paid a guy in our garage to clean it and he did a great jobso great that nothing was recovered when the cops decided to check the car for prints when it was stolen dad had been sure that one of the garage attendants had spotted it and planned to steal it he always thought that the guy who had been tied up was in on the scheme but there was no proof and he quit soon after that why did barrott call me about macks suv it was a question that kept repeating itself in my mind as i made coffee and scrambled an egg the newspapers were at the door and i glanced through them as i ate the tabloids were still milking the leesey andrews disappearance and speculating about macks involvement aaron kleins accusation that mack had killed his mother to recover his tapes was still a hot story now on page three there was macks yearbook picture but it had been enhanced to show how he might look today trying not to cry i studied it macks face was a little fuller his hairline slightly higher his smile ambiguous i wondered if elliott had these same newspapers delivered and if so had mom seen them knowing her she would have insisted on seeing them i thought of what elliott had told me at thurston carvers officethat mom had always been convinced some kind of mental breakdown had caused mack to disappear now i wondered if she could be right and if so was it possible that mack had stolen his own automobile the prospect was so incredible to me that i realized i was shaking my head no no no i said aloud but i spoke to him two weeks ago i admitted to myself he left that message for uncle dev the only rational explanation for macks behavior may be that he is irrational mother is afraid that if he is responsible for leesey andrewss disappearance and is tracked down by the cops he may be shot if he resists arrest is that reasonable or possible i wondered neither mom nor dad nor i saw any hint of a change in macks behavior before he disappeared but maybe someone else did how about mrs kramer i asked myself between cleaning and doing the laundry she was in his apartment regularly she acted so nervous when i met her did she perceive me as a threat maybe if i could get her alone without her husband around i could get her to open up to me i thought bruce galbraith hates mack what happened between them to cause that nick suggested that barbara was crazy about mack is bruce simply jealous or did something happen that still makes him angry after ten years that train of thought made me speculate on dr barbara hanover galbraiths trip to marthas vineyard to see her ailing father i wondered how long she planned to stay there i remembered that bruce had responded heatedly when i told him id like to talk to her the thought occurred to me that he might have gotten her out of town to prevent my seeing her or the police from looking her up her name is in macks file as a close friend i reminded myself i put my few dishes in the dishwasher went into dads office and turned on the computer to see if i could get her fathers address and phone number on marthas vineyard there were several hanover couples judy and syd frank and natalie and one richard hanover listed in the vineyard i knew barbaras mother had died just around the time she graduated so taking a chance i dialed richard hanovers number a man answered on the first ring it was an older voice but certainly cheerful enough i had planned what i would say this is cluny flowers in new york i want to verify the address of richard hanover is it eleven maiden path thats right but whos sending me flowers im not sick dead or having a birthday he sounded fit and healthy oh im afraid ive made a mistake i said quickly the arrangement is for a mrs judy hanover no problem next time they might be for me have a good day when i disconnected my first reaction was to be ashamed of myself i had turned into an outright liar my second thought was that dr barbara hanover galbraith had left new york not because her father had suffered a heart attack but because she did not want to be around to be questioned about mack i knew what i was going to do i showered dressed and began to throw a few things in a bag i had to confront barbara facetoface if mom was right and mack had snapped ten years ago had she witnessed behavior that might have suggested mental illness i realized that i was becoming frantic to frame a defense for mack if he was really out there alive unstable and committing crimes i called elliotts cell phone the fact that he did not say my name and in a low voice promised hed call me back told me that mom was within earshot when he did call back half an hour later i could not believe what he told me your detective barrott came here looking to talk to your mother i told him we would have our lawyer present but then olivia screamed at him something like dont you realize my son had a breakdown dont you understand hes not responsible for any of this hes sick he doesnt know what hes doing my mouth was so dry i could only whisper though there was no need to what did barrott say he verified what your mother said that she believed mack may be mentally ill where is mom now carolyn she was so hysterical i called a doctor he gave her a shot but he feels she should be under observation for a few days im driving her up to a wonderful sanitarium in connecticut where shell be able to get some restand ah counseling what place i asked ill meet you there its sedgwick manor in darien carolyn dont come olivia doesnt want to see you and it will only upset her more if you insist on visiting her in her mind youve betrayed mack i promise ill take care of her and ill call you back as soon as she is settled in there i could do nothing but agree nothing could be worse for mack than having mom telling the police again that shes sure hes insane when i clicked off i went into my bedroom and got out macks tape and played it while i studied the scrap of paper on which he had printed the ten words he had written to uncle devon uncle devon tell carolyn she must not look for me i listened to his voice when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes i all alone beweep my outcast state and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries i could only imagine barrotts reaction if he was able to get his hands on that note and tape after hearing mothers outburst i had barely finished that thought when the concierge phoned to say that detective gaylor was on his way up im sorry miss carolyn he wouldnt let me announce him he showed me a subpoena he has to deliver to you before the bell rang i frantically called thurston carver our criminal defense lawyer on his cell phone he told me as he had when we met at his office that i could not refuse to turn over what was ordered in the subpoena when i opened the door for detective gaylor he handed me the subpoena his manner professional and impersonal it was for the note mack had left in the collection basket and the tape i had found in his suitcase shaking with fury i almost threw them at him i took some comfort in knowing that i had made a copy of each after he left i slumped into the nearest chair and again heard myself repeating over and over in my head macks taped quotation i all alone beweep my outcast state finally i got up walked to my bedroom and emptied the bag i had started to pack it was obvious that any plans i had been making to drive up to marthas vineyard would have to be postponed i was so deep into concentrating on what my next logical move would be that i didnt realize my cell phone was ringing i rushed to pick it up it was nick about to leave a message im here i said good this would have been a convoluted message carolyn he said tersely i think you should know that ive just been named a person of interest in the disappearance of leesey andrews i see from the papers that the cops other theory is that mack has been running around killing people i might as well tell you that when i was down at the das office on thursday they even suggested you and i might be cooperating to protect mack he didnt give me a chance to reply before he said im flying to florida this morning for the second time this week my fathers been in the hospital he had a mild heart attack yesterday i expect to be back tomorrow barring any reason i have to stay in florida can we have dinner tomorrow night then he added it was so good to see you carolyn im beginning to understand why i looked forward to being invited to dinner with your family and why it wasnt the same when macks kid sister wasnt around i told him that i hoped his father would recover quickly and that yes tomorrow night was fine i held my cell phone to my ear for a few moments after nick clicked off my mind was a mess of conflicting emotions the first one was that i acknowledged to myself id never gotten over my crush on him that all week id been hearing his voice remembering the warmth id felt sitting across the table from him the other night the second reaction was to wonder if nick was playing some kind of cat and mouse game with me the das office had named him a person of interest in leesey andrewss disappearance i knew that was very very serious practically an accusation of guilt but the police also believed he might be helping me to protect mack nick had not contacted me all week even though macks name had been in the headlines when we had dinner he had not been even remotely sympathetic to my fear that mack might need help had nick really been named a person of interest or was it just a device suggested to him by the police to disarm me and was nick close friend of his former roommateturnedcriminal now hoping to use his influence to persuade me to turn mack in if he contacted me again i shook my head as if to clear it of all these questions but they didnt go away worse still they didnt lead me anywhere d r david andrews had not left his home in greenwich since the phone call from leesey came in sleepless and now a gaunt shadow of the man he had been before his daughters disappearance he kept a vigil by the phone grabbing it at the first ring every time it rang he always carried the portable receiver from room to room with him when he went to bed at night he placed it on the pillow next to his head when he did get a call he immediately cut the conversation to a few words explaining that he wanted to leave the line open in case leesey called again his housekeeper of twenty years who usually left after lunch began staying into the evening trying to get dr andrews to eat something even if it was only a cup of soup or coffee and a sandwich he had made it clear to his friends that he did not want anyone to tie up the line and refused to allow them to stop by and see him im better off if i dont feel obliged to keep up a conversation he told them on saturday morning gregg took zach winters down to larry ahearns office but as he sat in while ahearn interrogated zach he saw his story about seeing leesey get into the black mercedes suv begin to unravel zach had said that he hung around on that block for about half an hour but the employees of the woodshed who left only a few minutes after leesey all swore they hadnt seen him on the street he admitted that he was a chronic drunk who had once been thrown out of the woodshed when he came in and tried to panhandle the customers he admitted that he was angry at nick demarco the owner for having him thrown out and that he knew nick owned a black mercedes suv after the lengthy interrogation gregg drove zach back to where he had found him exhausted gregg went straight to his apartment and fell asleep until nine oclock sunday morning then feeling clearheaded and focused again he showered dressed and drove to greenwich the change in his father in the one week since he had last seen him was shocking his fathers housekeeper annie potters who never came in on sunday was there he wont eat she whispered to gregg its eleven oclock and he hasnt touched a morsel since yesterday would you fix some breakfast for both of us annie gregg asked ill see what i can do after greeting him his father had immediately returned to his recliner in the living room the portable phone within reach gregg went back into the living room and sat on the chair nearest the recliner dad ive been walking the streets at night looking for leesey i cant do it anymore and you cant do this anymore were not helping leesey and were destroying ourselves ive been down to the district attorneys office there is absolutely nothing larry ahearn and his people arent already doing to find leesey i want you to come in and eat something then were going out for a walk its a beautiful day he got up and bent down to hug his father you know im right dr david andrews nodded then his face crumbled gregg embraced him dad i know i know now come on and leave the phone here if it rings well answer it he was cheered to see his father eat half the serving of scrambled eggs and bacon annie put before him gregg was nibbling on a slice of toast and drinking his second cup of coffee when the phone rang his father bolted up and raced from the table but he didnt reach the phone before the message began it was leesey unmistakably daddy daddy she wailed help me please daddy he says hes going to kill me the message ended as leesey began to sob dr david andrews lunged for the phone and grabbed it but by then he heard only a dial tone his knees buckled and gregg was in time to ease him into his recliner before he collapsed gregg was checking his fathers pulse when the phone rang again it was larry ahearn gregg that was leesey wasnt it gregg pressed the speaker button so that his father could hear absolutely larry you know that gregg shes still alive and were going to find her i swear that to you dr david andrews grabbed the receiver his voice hoarse he shouted youve got to find her larry you heard her whoever has her is going to kill her for gods sake find her for me before its too late e xhaustion was forgotten as larry ahearn played the tape of leeseys cry for help to the squad the call came in at eleven thirty exactly one hour ago he said it was made from midmanhattan of course there is always a possibility that the abductor made a tape of her voice and played it in a different location and if thats the case he may already have killed her barrott said quietly were going to go forward under the assumption that shes still alive ahearn snapped theres no question that whoever has her is on a short leash he wants attention ive talked to our profiler dr lowe he thinks that this guy is loving the headlines and the way the story is being covered by greta van susteren and nancy grace hes probably also anticipating the uproar when we release the fact that leesey called her father again and left that message too restless to sit any longer he stood and tapped his fingers on his desk i dont want to even think this but it has to be considered in another five days maybe seven the fact that leesey phoned will stay big news but without new information it wont be the headline anymore every detective from the squad room was crowded tightly into ahearns office for the briefing the expressions on their faces became increasingly grave as they followed the thought ahearn was voicing leesey went to that club on monday night and disappeared her message promising to call again on mothers day came the following sunday six days later after a oneweek interval this new call has come in its dr lowes opinion that our guy may not wait another week to give us a new headline mackenzies the one doing this roy barrott said emphatically you should have seen his mother yesterday when i went to her boyfriends apartment her boyfriend ahearn exclaimed elliott wallace the big investment banker aaron klein the drama teachers son worked for him for fourteen years klein told me they became really close when his mother was murdered wallace was still so distraught about mackenzies disappearance the year before that it gave them a common bond mack mackenzies father was in vietnam with wallace and they became lifelong friends its kleins opinion that wallace has always been in love with olivia mackenzie is she living with him ahearn asked i wouldnt call it that with all the media around sutton place she went home with him having said that klein wouldnt be surprised if she married wallace eventually he sure was quick to stash her away in a private psychiatric residence so she cant keep telling us her son is crazy is there any possibility shes in touch with her son barrott shrugged id say if mack has contact with anyone in his family its more likely with the sister all right ahearn turned to address the group i still say that demarco may be the one behind all this i want a tail on him i want one on carolyn mackenzie too well apply for a wiretap for any and all phones that arent already tapped mackenzie in her thompson street apartment in sutton place and on her cell phone demarco wherever he works or hangs his hat larry id like to make another suggestion bob gaylor said zach winters may be a wino but i think he saw something that night he curls up in doorways the fact that the band members and waiters from the woodshed didnt see him on the street doesnt prove anything and id swear he was holding back on us when he was here go talk to him again ahearn said he lives in that shelter on mott street doesnt he sometimes but when the weathers good he puts his stuff in a laundry cart and sleeps outside ahearn nodded all right were cooperating with the fbi but i want all of you to keep something in mind ive known leesey since she was six years old i want her back and i want us to be the ones who find her o n sunday morning using the service entrance to duck the media i went for a long long walk along the river i felt whiplashed after elliotts phone call about mom and sick with my doubts about nickand lets face it about mack the day had fulfilled its promisewarm with a light breeze the current of the east river often so strong seemed as mellow as the sunshine the boaters were out not too many of them adding to the scenery i love new york god help me i even love that blaring intrusive pepsicola sign on the long island city side of the river by the end of a threehour walk i was physically and mentally exhausted when i got back to sutton place i stripped showered and got into bed i slept all afternoon and woke up at six oclock feeling at least somewhat clearheaded and a bit more able to cope i dressed casually in a blue and white pinstriped shirt and white jeans i didnt care if nick showed up in a jacket and tie i wanted no suggestion of little carolyn dressing up for a date nick arrived promptly at seven oclock he was wearing a sport shirt and chinos i had intended to steer him straight out the door but his first words were carolyn i really need to talk with you and it might be better if we do it here i followed him into the library library sounds impressive it really isnt that pretentious its just a room with bookshelves and comfortable armchairs and a paneled area that opens to disclose a builtin bar nick went straight to it poured himself a scotch on the rocks and without asking a glass of white wine with a couple of ice cubes for me this is what you had last week i read somewhere that the duchess of windsor put ice in her champagne he said as he handed me the glass and i read that the duke of windsor liked his whiskey neat i told him married to her i shouldnt wonder he gave a brief smile joking of course i have no idea what she was like i sat on the edge of the couch he chose one of the armchairs and swiveled it around i remember loving these chairs he said i promised myself that if i ever got rich id have at least one of them and i asked never had time to think about it when i started to make money and bought an apartment i got an interior decorator she was into the western look when i saw it all finished i felt like roy rogers i had been studying him and i realized that the gray around his temples was even more pronounced than i had thought there were fresh pouches under his eyes and the concerned expression i had observed last week had now become one of deep worry he had flown to florida yesterday because his father had a heart attack i asked nick how he was doing pretty good it really was a mild attack they are releasing him in a couple of days then nick looked straight at me carolyn do you think mack is alive and if you do is he capable of what the cops think hes doing it was on the tip of my tongue to be honest to say that at this point i simply didnt know but i caught myself in time what on earth makes you ask that of course not i hoped that i sounded as indignant as i wanted to sound carolyn dont look at me like that cant you understand that mack was my best friend i never could figure out why he chose to disappear now i wonder if something was going on in his head that nobody realized at the time are you worried about mack or about yourself nick i asked i wont answer that carolyn the one thing i beg of you plead with you is that if he is in contact with you or if he does call you dont think youre doing him a favor by shielding him did you hear the message leesey andrews left for her father this morning he looked at me expectantly for a moment i was too shaken to speak then managed to say that i hadnt turned on the radio or television all day but when nick told me all i could think of was barrotts theory that mack stole his own car its crazy but it reminded me of the day i was five or six years old and mack suddenly had a terrible nosebleed daddy was home and he grabbed one of the monogrammed towels from a rack in the bathroom to stem the flow we had an elderly housekeeper at that time who adored mack she was so upset that she tried to yank the towel out of dads hand that ones for show she shrieked its for show daddy always got a kick out of telling that story but he always added poor mrs anderson was so worried about mack but to her the fancy towels just werent disposable i told her the towels have our name on them and mack can ruin them if he likes i could imagine mack stealing his own car but not mack holding leesey hostage and torturing her father i looked at nick i dont know what to think about mack i said i swear to you and to anyone who will listen that other than those mothers day calls i have not heard from mack or seen him in ten years nick nodded and my guess is that he believed me then he asked do you think that i am responsible for leeseys disappearance that i have her hidden somewhere i examined my heart and my soul before i answered no i dont i said but both of you have been dragged into this mack because i went to the police you because she disappeared from your club if its neither one of you then who is responsible carolyn i dont know where to begin to look for the answer to that we talked for more than an hour i told him i was going to try to see lil kramer alone because she was afraid to say anything in front of her husband we went round and round about the fact that just before he vanished mack had been upset with mrs kramer but hadnt told nick why i told nick how bruce galbraith had been so hostile about mack when i saw him last week and that i thought barbara had rushed to visit her father in marthas vineyard just to avoid being questioned im going to drive up there tomorrow or tuesday i said mother doesnt want to see me and elliott will take care of her nick asked me if i thought that mom would marry elliott i think so i said quite honestly i hope so theyre very good together mom certainly loved dad but he delighted in being a bit of a rebel elliott is actually more of a soul mate which of course is a little hard for me to swallow theyre both perfectionists and i think theyll be very happy together then i added words id never thought id say thats why mack was always her favorite he did everything right im too impulsive for moms taste witness going to the police and opening up this whole mess i was appalled that i had confided that to nick i think he was about to come over to me maybe put his arms around me but he must have known that wasnt what i wanted instead he said his tone light see if you can guess this one she sprang fullfledged from her fathers brow the goddess minerva i said sister catherine sixth grade man how she loved teaching mythology i stood up you did ask me to have dinner you know how about nearys i want a slicedsteak sandwich and french fries nick hesitated carolyn i have to warn you there are cameras outside my cars near the door we can make a run for it i dont think theyll follow us that was the way it turned out the camera lights flashed the moment we exited the building someone tried to shove a microphone in my face ms mackenzie do you think your brother nick grabbed my hand and we ran for his car he drove up york avenue until seventysecond street then turned and doubled back i think we should be okay now he said i didnt agree or disagree my one consolation was that mom was in a safe place where the media couldnt get at her nearys is an irish pub on fiftyseventh street a block away from sutton place its like a second home for many of us in the neighborhood the atmosphere is warm the food is good and the odds are that on any given night youll know half the diners if i needed moral support and god knows i did jimmy neary provided it when he saw me he crossed the room instantly carolyn its a disgrace what theyre insinuating about mack he told me putting a warm hand on my shoulder that boy was a saint you wait and see the truth will come out he turned and recognized nick hey kid remember when you and mack came in you bet me that your fathers pasta was a match for my corned beef we never put it to the test nick said and now my dad is in florida retired retired how does he like it jimmy asked he hates it so would i tell him to come back and well finally get the answer jimmy ushered us to one of the corner tables in the back that was where nick told me more about the visit to florida i begged my mother to keep the new york papers away from pop he said i dont know what it will do to him if he finds out ive been designated a person of interest in leeseys disappearance over slicedsteak sandwiches by unspoken mutual consent we drifted into neutral territory nick talked about opening his first restaurant and how well it did he hinted that these last five years hed moved too fast i think i read donald trumps success story once too often he admitted i got the idea that skating on thin ice was fun ive banked an awful lot on the woodshed its the right spot at the right time but if the state liquor authority wants to shut it down theyll find a way and if that happens im in big trouble we talked cautiously about barbara hanover i remember thinking how beautiful she was i told him she is and was but carolyn theres something else about barbara a kind of calculated whats best for barbara agenda its hard to explain but after we all graduated and i went for my mba mack was gone and as for bruce i didnt care if i ever saw him again we both had a cappuccino then nick drove me back to sutton place there was just one television van halfway down the block he rushed me into the building and to the elevator as the operator held the door open nick said carolyn i didnt do it and neither did mack hang on to that thought he skipped the social kiss and was gone i went upstairs the message light was blinking it was detective barrott ms mackenzie at eighty forty pm tonight you received another call from leesey andrewss cell phone your brother didnt leave a message l ucas reeves had not taken the weekend off he had spent it in his office working with his technicians charles mackenzie sr had hired him nearly ten years ago to find his missing son and the fact that he had never been able to uncover even the slightest hint of what happened to mack had given reeves a sense of failure that was never far from his consciousness now he considered it even more urgent that he find the answer not only to learn what had happened to mack but to find the real killer and perhaps save leesey andrewss life on monday morning lucas was back in his office on park avenue south at eight oclock his three permanent investigators had been told to get in early by eight thirty they were seated around his desk i have a hunch and some of my hunches have worked in the past he began so im going to act on it i am going to assume that mack is innocent of these crimes and i am going to assume that someone who knew him at least reasonably well is responsible by that i mean knew him well enough to hear about the mothers day calls and to have his familys unlisted phone number reeves looked from one investigator to the other we are going to start by concentrating on the people around mack by that i mean his two roommates nick demarco and bruce galbraith we are going to dig up everything we can learn about the superintendent couple lil and gus kramer from there we will concentrate on macks other friends from columbia who were with him in the nightclub the evening that first girl disappeared over the weekend our techs have gathered all the newspaper accounts and media clips that were headlines when each of those other three girls vanished we have enhanced the faces of everyone caught in those pictures whether he or she was identifiable or not study those faces memorize them lucas had come in so early that he had made his own coffee he took a sip grimaced and continued the media is camped outside sutton place one of you must be in the vicinity at all times have your cell phone out and be using it as a camera somebody also has to be on the street when the woodshed opens tonight taking pictures not only of guests entering and leaving but of people hanging around in the streets there are a couple of other clubs opening in soho this week be there with the paparazzi lucas thats impossible jack rodgers his most senior aide protested the three of us cant cover all that ground no one asked you to reeves snapped his normally deep voice several octaves higher get out the list of the guys we use when we need extra help we must have thirty retired cops available rodgers nodded okay reeves lowered his voice my hunch is that the perpetrator loves attention he may want to be onsite when theres a media rush the faces that show in every picture you snap will be enhanced in our lab i dont care how many there are and i assume there will be hundreds maybe just maybe one of them will be a match for someone who was around during the media frenzy that followed those other disappearances i repeat for the present we are going to assume that mack mackenzie is innocent he looked at rodgers why dont you say it jack all right lucas ill say it if youre right we may find a picture of a guy who shows up all over the place he may be fat he may be thin he may be bald he may have a ponytail hell be someone his own mother wouldnt recognize and hell be charles mackenzie jr d etective bob gaylor began searching for zach winters on sunday after the squad meeting he was not at the mott street shelter that was his offandon home he had not been seen on the streets since early saturday morning when he had been hanging around the woodshed and then had gone to gregg andrewss apartment he had been interrogated on saturday afternoon then presumably had gone back to his usual haunts but he had not gone back to the shelter zach usually shows up at least every other day joan coleman an attractive thirtyyearold volunteer kitchen worker on mott street confided to gaylor of course it depends on the weather he loves the club area in soho he brags that he gets better handouts there did he ever talk about being near the woodshed the night leesey andrews disappeared not to me but hes got a couple of what he calls his real good buddies let me talk to them she brightened at the idea of doing detective work ill go with you gaylor volunteered she shook her head not if you want to get any information you wont i dont usually come in for dinner but im subbing for a friend tonight give me your phone number ill call you bob gaylor had to be content with that he spent the better part of the day wandering through soho and greenwich village to no avail zach winters might have disappeared from the face of the earth t rue to his word derek olsen arrived at elliott wallaces office promptly at ten am his gait stiff his suit cleaned and pressed but shiny with age his remaining tufts of white hair plastered down on his skull there was a certain buoyancy about him elliott wallace observed him and correctly interpreted that olsen if he followed his plan to liquidate all his holdings was looking forward to telling his nephew steve his buildings manager howie and anyone else he could think of to go jump in a lake a cordial smile on his face wallace urged olsen to take a chair i know you wont refuse a cup of tea derek last time it tasted like dishwater tell your secretary i want four lumps of sugar and heavy cream elliott of course olsen barely waited for elliott to instruct his secretary before he said with a satisfied smile you and your advice remember you said i should get rid of those three brokendown town houses that have been closed for years elliott wallace knew what was coming derek youve been paying taxes and insurance on those dumps for years of course real estate has gone up but if you wish i will show you that if you had sold them and bought the stocks i recommended youd be ahead no i wouldnt i knew that someday theyd tear down those buildings on the corner of th street and developers would want my place the developers seem to have managed without it they already broke ground for those condominium apartments the same firm came back to me i close on the sale this afternoon congratulations wallace said sincerely but i do hope you remember that ive made you quite a lot of money investing on your behalf except for that hedge fund except for the hedge fund i agree but that was quite a while ago olsens tea and elliotts coffee arrived this is good olsen said after taking a wary sip the way i like it now lets talk i want to sell everything i want to establish a trust fund you can run it i want it to be used for parks in new york parks with lots of trees this city has too many big buildings thats very generous of you are you planning to leave anything to your nephew or anyone else ill leave steve fifty thousand dollars let him get a new set of drums or a guitar he cant look at me over a dinner plate without trying to figure how much longer ill last i heard from a couple of my building supers that he announced hell be taking over howies job as my overall manager he buys me a fountain pen and takes me to dinner and because i show good feelings to him he thinks he can take over my business him and his gigs every time he stops getting jobs at those club dumps he invents a new name for himself and his loser band finds the latest kind of weird outfit and hires a brokendown pr agent if it wasnt for his mother my sister god rest her id have given him the bums rush years ago i know hes been a disappointment to you derek elliott tried to maintain his compassionate expression disappointment hah by the way i want to leave howie altman fifty thousand dollars too im sure hell appreciate it does he know your plans no hes been getting pushy too i can tell he has the nerve to think hes entitled to a big inheritance from me dont misunderstand hes done a good job and i thank you for recommending him when that other guy didnt work out elliott nodded acknowledging the thanks one of my other clients was selling a building and mentioned his availability well hell soon be available again but hes not blood and he doesnt understand that when you have good workers like the kramers you dont squeeze them out of an extra bedroom or two george rodenburg is still your lawyer isnt he of course why would i change what i meant was that ill talk to him about setting up the foundation you say youre closing on the th street property this afternoon do you want me there rodenburg will handle it the offers been on the table for years its only the dollars that are different olsen got up to go i was born on tremont avenue in the bronx it was a nice neighborhood then i have pictures of my sister and me sitting on the steps of one of those little apartment buildings the kind i own now i drove up there last week its pretty bad theres a corner lot near where we lived its a mess weeds and beer cans and garbage while im still alive i want to see it become a park a beatific smile crossed his face as he turned to the door goodbye elliott elliott wallace walked his client through the reception room down the corridor to the elevator returned to his private office and for the first time in his adult life went to the bar refrigerator and at eleven am poured himself a straight scotch l ate on monday morning i drove up to macks old apartment building i pushed the kramers button on the intercom and was rewarded after a moment by a hesitant greeting i knew i had to talk fast mrs kramer this is carolyn mackenzie i need to talk to you oh no my husband is out this morning i want to talk to you not to him mrs kramer please let me come in for just a few minutes gus wont like it i cant mrs kramer you must be reading the newspapers surely you know that the police think my brother may be responsible for that girls disappearance i need to talk with you for a moment i thought she had hung up but then i heard a click as the door to the lobby unlocked i went in crossed the lobby and rang her bell she opened it a crack as though to reassure herself that i didnt have an army of people ready to storm the apartment then opened it just wide enough for me to enter the room that had so reminded me of my paternal grandmothers living room in jackson heights was in the process of being stripped and dismantled there were large cartons stacked in the corner the curtains and draperies had been taken down from the windows there were no pictures on the wall and the side tables were bare of the lamps and bricabrac id seen on my last visit were moving to our cottage in pennsylvania lil kramer said gus and i are more than ready to retire shes running away i thought as i studied her even though the room was cool she had tiny beads of sweat on her forehead her gray hair was pulled away from her face and anchored firmly behind her ears her complexion was the same dull gray as her hair i am sure she was unaware that her hands were massaging each other in a fretful nervous pattern uninvited i sat on the nearest chair i realized there was absolutely no use in not coming directly to the point mrs kramer you knew my brother do you think hes a killer she rubbed her lips together i dont know what he is then she burst out he told lies about me i was so nice to him i really liked him i took such good care of his clothes and his room and then he accused me accused you of what never mind it wasnt true but i couldnt believe my ears when did that happen a few days before he disappeared and then he ridiculed me neither one of us had heard the outside door open shut your mouth lil gus kramer ordered as he strode across the room he turned to face me and you get out of here your brother had the nerve to treat my wife the way he did and now look at what hes done to those young girls furious i stood up mr kramer i dont know what youre talking about i cant believe mack mistreated your wife in any way shape or form and i would stake my own life that he is not responsible for any crime keep on believing that and let me tell you what im talking about my wife is going to have a nervous breakdown worrying that when they catch your killer brother hell turn on her and accuse her with his dirty lies dont call him a killer i said dont you dare call him a killer guss face flooded with rage ill call him what i want to call him but ill give you this hes a killer who goes to church lil saw him the day he left the note in the collection basket didnt you lil i didnt have my glasses with me but im still sure lil kramer began to cry i recognized him he saw me looking at him i mean he had on a raincoat and dark glasses but it was mack in that church just for your information the cops were here an hour ago and we told them that gus kramer shouted at me now get out of here and leave my wife alone o n saturday evening after he was sure steve had left for one of his gigs howard altman had let himself into steves apartment carefully and skillfully he had placed hidden cameras in the living room and bedroom the video would be beamed directly into his computer why didnt i think of this sooner he asked himself as he set up the surveillance thanks steve for making it so easy for me steve had left lights on in both rooms as well as in the bathroom derek pays the gas and electric bill for him howard thought resentfully he charges me for mine and steve was a slob his bed wasnt made a couple of those stupid costumes he wore to some of his gigs were piled on a chair the hairpieces and wigs he used when he was acting out some of his characters were tossed in a cardboard box on the floor howard tried on one of them a wig with long darkbrown hair he stared at himself in the mirror then ripped it off he looked like a woman in it and that made him think of that teacher who had once lived in this apartment and had been murdered i dont know how steve hockney can live in a place that belonged to someone who was murdered he thought i have to get out of here on monday morning howard went to pick up mr olsen for one of their scheduled visits to the properties but he wasnt there the super in that building told him that olsen had already been picked up by a car service deeply uneasy howard went to their usual first stop the building where the kramers were the supers he was about to unlock the lobby door when it was flung open and a pretty young woman tears streaming down her cheeks ran past him carolyn mackenzie he thought whats she doing here he turned and raced after her catching her a half block away as remote in hand she opened the lock on her car door ms mackenzie im howard altman we met a couple of weeks ago when you were talking to the kramers he spoke in a hurry slightly out of breath he watched as she impatiently brushed away the tears that were still spilling from her eyes im afraid i really cant talk right now she said look ive been seeing your picture in the papers and reading all that stuff about your brother that was before i worked for mr olsen but i wish i could help you somehow thank you i wish you could too if the kramers have upset you in any way ill take care of them he promised she did not answer but gave his arm a push to oblige him to get out of the way of the drivers door howard stepped back and with a quick movement she had opened the door closed it and started the car she did not look at him again as she backed up a few feet turned the wheel pulled out of the parking space and was gone his face grim howard altman headed straight for the kramers apartment they did not answer the insistent ringing of their doorbell he tried to open the door with his key but the security lock was on gus and lil i have to talk to you he shouted go to hell gus kramer shouted from the other side of the door were out of here today you can have this job and this apartment and everything that goes with it and just so you know howie youd better watch your back if steve has anything to do with it youll be looking for a place to live yourself now get lost standing there in the hallway there was nothing howard could do except leave was steve making the rounds with olsen he wondered why else would olsen have ordered a car service this morning there was one way he could find out for sure if steve was around howard went back to his apartment and turned on his computer scanning the videocam footage he noted steve had been in and out of his apartment all day yesterday but he was always alone now there was no one in his living room so maybe he was out with olsen howard thought but then the bedroom camera showed steve sitting in his underwear on the edge of the bed trying on one after another of his wigs the last one he selected was the one with the long brown hair the camera caught him smiling at his image and blowing a kiss at the mirror then steve turned and looked straight into the lens howie i have my own security cameras installed here he said i need them some of my friends arent exactly trustworthy customers if youre watching this or when you do watch it have a nice day with trembling fingers howard turned off his computer a t noon on monday detective bob gaylor received a phone call from the young kitchen worker hed met at the mott street shelter hi its joan coleman she said sounding excited i promised to find out what i could about zach the squad room was noisy but gaylor blocked out everything but joan colemans voice okay he said what can you tell me hes on the streets for good no more shelters now that its warm he showed up with his stuff near the brooklyn bridge last night totally drunk he was telling his friends that he might get a reward in the leesey andrews case hes tried that i dont think its going to work my informant pete is a young guy who just might make it hes an addict but he keeps trying hes pretty clean right now so i trust what hes telling me she lowered her voice he says that winters claims he has some kind of proof but cant show it because theyll blame everything on him okay so winters was in the brooklyn bridge area last night yes near some kind of construction site and hes probably still around there from what pete told me he has a lot to sleep off joan if you ever want a job in this department gaylor said fervently youve got it no thanks ive got enough on my plate trying to do what i can for these poor guys thanks again joan gaylor got up went into larry ahearns office and briefed him ahearn listened quietly you thought winters was holding back on us he said looks as if you could be right find him and shake it out of him maybe hell still be drunk enough to spill his guts to you have you heard any more from leeseys family ahearn leaned back in his chair with a sigh i spoke to gregg this morning hes keeping his father pretty sedated he wont leave him until this is resolved one way or the other he shrugged having said that you and i both understand that we may never know what happened or what will happen to leesey i dont believe that gaylor said you were right yesterday when you felt this guy wants attention im also beginning to believe he wants to be caught but in a way that will be a spectacular blowup ahearns hands curled into fists gregg told me an hour ago that he feels so damn helpless well so do i as gaylor turned to go the phone rang again ahearn picked up the receiver listened for a moment and said put him through waving gaylor back he said its gregg andrews gaylor listened as larry ahearn said of course if your father wants an appeal printed in the media well pass it on to them he sat down and picked up a pen its from the bible okay he wrote as he held the phone to his ear stopping gregg andrews once to repeat something then said i have it ill take care of it with a deep sigh he put the receiver down this is what dr andrews would like to have read on the television stations and printed in the newspapers so that leeseys abductor understands just how desperately he needs to have her returned to him safe and sound its from the prophet hosea when you were a child i loved you it was i who taught you to walk took you in my arms i was to you like those who lift infants to their cheeks i bent down and fed you how could i give you up both mens eyes glistened with tears as detective bob gaylor left to search for zach winters visions of dollar bills stacks and stacks of them were dancing in zach winterss brain as he opened his eyes to see some guy standing over him he had been curled up in one of his favorite spots a construction site near the brooklyn bridge where the former parking garage had been pulled down but the new building hadnt been started yet the board fence had been ripped open and now that it was warm he and many of his friends used the site as their home base every ten days or two weeks the cops chased them out but after a day or so they all came back with their gear like zach they all understood that when construction actually started theyd be on their way again but until then it was a great spot to camp zach had been dreaming about the fiftythousanddollar reward he would collect as soon as he figured out a way to collect it without getting himself into trouble when he felt someone shaking his shoulder come on zach wake up a mans voice was demanding zach opened his eyes slowly a sense of familiarity seeped its way into his brain i know this guy hes police he was in that room when the brother took me to talk about seeing leesey be careful zach warned himself hes the one who was so nasty that day zach rolled over and slowly propped himself up on his elbows he had covered himself with his winter jacket and now he pushed it aside he blinked at the strong afternoon sun then looked around quickly to make sure that his grocery cart was still there he had slept with it flat on the ground next to him his legs straddling the handle so that no one could reach into it without moving him first it was safe enough though some of the newspapers he had tucked in at the top were slipping out he blinked again whadaya want he asked i want to talk to you get up all right all right take it easy zach groped for the wine bottle that had been next to him when he fell asleep its empty gaylor snapped he grabbed zachs arm and yanked him up sharply youve been telling your friends that you know something about leeseys disappearance something you didnt tell us the other day what is it i dont know what youre talking about yes you do gaylor bent down grabbed the handle of the cart and pulled it upright youve been telling your friends you have something that might earn you the reward thats been offered for leesey andrews what is it zach made a gesture of brushing soil from his jacket i know my rights get away from me he reached for the handle of his cart gaylor refused to let go of it and blocked his way the detectives tone was angry zach why dont you cooperate with me i want you to unload that cart and show me everything in it we know you couldnt have had anything to do with leeseys disappearance youre too much of a drunk to have managed it if youve got something in your stuff that helps us to find her youll get your reward i promise yeah sure you do zach reached out and tried to grab the handle from gaylor the cart swayed and some of the newspapers fell out beneath them a filthy mans shirt was partially wrapped around what gaylor instantly recognized as an expensive cosmetic case whered you get that he snapped none of your business zach righted the cart quickly and pushed the papers back into place im out of here he began pushing the cart briskly toward the nearest sidewalk staying in step with him gaylor grabbed his cell phone and dialed ahearn i need a search warrant to seize the contents of zach winterss cart he said hes got an expensive silver and black cosmetic bag that ill bet belongs to leesey andrews ill stick with him until you get back to me and find out from leeseys roommate if she knows what kind of cosmetic bag leesey was carrying that night forty minutes later backed up by two squad cars the warrant in his pocket gaylor was opening leesey andrewss cosmetic case i was scared youd think i stole it zach winters was whining when she was getting in the suv she dropped her pocketbook some stuff spilled out she picked most of it up but when they drove off i went over there to see if maybe a few dollars had fallen out of her bag you know what i mean and i saw this and i took it and ill be honest with you she had a fiftydollar bill in it and maybe i gave myself a little reward and and why dont you shut up bob gaylor interrupted if youd given this to us even on saturday it might have made a difference besides the usual cosmetics typical of a young womans accessories he had taken out a personal card it belonged to nick demarco and gave the address and phone number of his loft on the back of the card he had written leesey i can open some doors for you in show business and id be glad to do it call me nick w ith a satisfied smile derek olsen signed the last of the mountain of papers that transferred the dilapidated town house he owned on th street and riverside drive to twining enterprises the multimilliondollar real estate firm that was building an upscale luxury condominium next door he had insisted that douglas twining sr the chairman and ceo of the company personally attend the sale i knew youd pay what i wanted doug olsen said it was a lot of baloney that you didnt need my building i didnt need it i wanted it twining said quietly i could have done without it and not have the corner not have the view maybe have me sell it to someone who put up one of those dumb sliver buildings so your fancy people look west at a brick wall come on twining looked at his lawyer are we finished here i believe so sir twining stood up well derek i suppose i should congratulate you why not twelve million dollars for a fiftybyonehundredfoot lot with a brokendown house that i paid fifteen thousand for forty years ago thats inflation for you olsens gleeful smile disappeared if it makes you feel any better im putting this money to good use a lot of kids in the bronx kids who wont grow up in your fancyschmancy condos and wont go to the hamptons for the summer will now have some parks to play inderek olsen parks so when are you going to tear down the house the wrecking ball will be there thursday morning i think ill handle it myself i havent forgotten how to do it ill come watch goodbye doug olsen turned to his lawyer george rodenburg okay lets get out of here he said you can buy me an early dinner i was too excited to eat lunch and while were eating ill phone my nephew and howie and let them know that its coming down on thursday morning ill tell them i just got twelve million bucks for it and its all going for my parks i only wish i could see their faces theyll both have heart attacks a fter i left the kramers i drove straight into the garage at sutton place passed the flashing cameras went upstairs and threw some things in a bag wearing the biggest dark glasses i could find to cover my face i went back down in the elevator to the garage this time taking my mothers car to fool them then hoping to god i wouldnt cause an accident i barreled out onto the street and made a quick turn onto fiftyseventh street i drove up first avenue as far as ninetysixth street trying to make sure that i wasnt being followed i didnt want anyone to have any idea of where i might be going of course i couldnt be sure but certainly there was no media van in sight when i turned right on ninetysixth and got on the fdr drive north the drive of course was named to honor president franklin delano roosevelt that made me think of elliott the chilling thought came to me that if mack was guilty of all these crimes and was caught there would be months of publicity and a trial or trials elliott had lots of goldplated clients i know hes in love with mom but would he want to be associated with that kind of publicity if he were married to mom would he want to see her picture in the tabloids during a trial right now he was her protector but would that last if dad were alive now and mack ended up in that scenario i know dad would be there for him rock solid and moving heaven and earth to build an insanity defense for him i thought of elliotts too often repeated anecdote about fdrthat he chose a republican to be his hostess when eleanor was away because there was no democrat in hyde park who was his social equal i wonder what fdr or elliott would think about having the mother of a convicted serial killer around the way things were going i could almost hear elliott giving a lets just be friends speech to mom as i reached the ever miserable cross bronx traffic i tried to stop thinking and concentrate on my driving with traffic slowing to a crawl i called ahead and managed to get a reservation on the last ferry to the vineyard from falmouth then i made a reservation at the vineyard hotel in chappaquiddick and then i turned off my cell phone i didnt want to speak to or hear from anyone it was nearly nine thirty when i arrived on the island and checked into the hotel exhausted but still restless i went down to the bar and had a hamburger and two glasses of red wine then against all sound medical advice i took one of the sleeping pills i had found in moms night table and went to bed i slept for twelve hours straight a t pm nick demarco was in his midtown office when his phone rang it was captain larry ahearn with a crisp request that he come to his office immediately swallowing over the absolute dryness in his mouth and throat nick agreed as soon as he hung up he dialed his attorney paul murphy ill start right down murphy told him ill meet you in the lobby there i can do better than that nick said i was planning to leave in fifteen minutes anyway which means benny is probably outside right now circling the block ill call you when im in the car well swing by and get you at five past five benny at the wheel they were driving south on park avenue the way i see it its their way of rattling you murphy told him the only and i repeat only circumstantial evidence they can lay at your door are two facts one you invited leesey over to talk with you in the club and two you have a black mercedes suv which makes you one of thousands of owners of a black mercedes suv he shot a look at demarco of course you could have saved me from being surprised last time we were there murphy had dropped his voice almost to a whisper but nick still nudged him with his elbow he knew murphy was referring to the fact that bennys second wife had taken out a restraining order against him he also knew that benny had superb hearing and missed nothing the traffic was so unbearably slow that murphy decided to phone ahearns office just to let you know that were in the usual five oclock rush and cant do a thing about it ahearns response was simple just get here were not going anywhere is demarcos chauffeur benny seppini driving the car youre in yes he is bring him up too it was ten minutes of six when nick demarco paul murphy and benny seppini walked through the squad room to larry ahearns private office they all noticed the frigid stares from the detectives in the squad room as they hurried through it inside ahearns office the atmosphere was even colder ahearn was again flanked by detectives barrott and gaylor there were three chairs in front of the desk sit down ahearn said curtly benny seppini looked at demarco mr demarco i dont think its my place cut the servant routine you know you call him nick ahearn interrupted and sit down now seppini waited until demarco and murphy had taken their places then lowered himself into his chair ive known mr demarco for many years he said hes an important man and when im not alone with him i call him mr demarco thats touching ahearn said sarcastically now lets all listen to this he pressed the play button on a recorder and leesey andrewss voice pleading to her father for help filled the room there was a moment of intense silence following the recording then paul murphy asked what was the point of playing that recording for us im happy to tell you ahearn assured him i thought it might remind your client of the fact that as of yesterday leesey andrews was probably still alive we thought it might stir his better self to tell us where we can find her demarco sprang up from the chair i have no more idea than you do of where that poor girl is and id give anything i have to save her life if i could im sure you would barrott replied his voice dripping with sarcasm you thought she was pretty cute didnt you in fact you slipped her your personal card with the address of your cozy loft apartment he held up the card cleared his throat and read leesey i can open some doors for you in show business and id be glad to do it call me nick he slapped the card down on the table you gave it to her that night didnt you you dont have to answer that nick murphy warned nick shook his head theres no reason not to answer it those few minutes she was at my table i told her she was a beautiful dancer which she certainly was she confided that shed love to take a year off after college just to see if she could make it on the stage i do know a lot of celebrities so i gave her the card so what he met ahearns suspicious gaze you seem to have forgotten to mention it to us ahearn stated scorn in every syllable he uttered ive been here three times nick said clearly agitated now every time you come at me as if i had something to do with her disappearance i know you can find some way to have my liquor license suspended at the woodshed even if you have to create a violation stop it nick murphy ordered i wont stop it i had nothing to do with her disappearance the last time i was here you suggested im way overextended youre absolutely right if you shut down the woodshed ill be thrown into bankruptcy ive made some lousy decisions i dont deny that but hurting or abducting a kid like leesey andrews isnt one of them you gave her your card bob gaylor said yes i did when did you expect her to phone you at your loft my loft you gave her a card with the address of your loft and the phone number of the landline there thats ridiculous i gave her the card with my business address park avenue barrott tossed the card at him read it perspiration on his forehead nick demarco read the print on the card several times before he spoke that was two weeks ago today he said more to himself than to the others i had some cards made with just the loft address they came in that day from the printer i must have put one of them in my wallet i thought i was giving my office card to leesey why would you need an address card for the loft and the telephone number there unless you wanted to slip it to beautiful girls like leesey barrott asked nick we can get up and walk out of here right now murphy said thats not necessary ive got my fifth avenue apartment up for sale i plan to live in the loft i have too many friends i havent seen in a long time because ive been too busy trying to be a hotshot restaurant and club owner having those cards made was a gesture toward the future he placed the card back on the desk is one of the people you want to see in the loft mack mackenzies sister carolyn barrott asked cute picture of the two of you hand in hand rushing for your car last night it brought tears to my eyes ahearn turned to benny seppini benny lets talk to you now the night leesey disappeared you had taken nicks excuse me i mean mr demarcos black mercedes suv home with you to astoria isnt that right i drove his sedan home bennys scarred rough features began to turn a dull red dont you have a car surely you must get paid enough to have your own wheels i can answer that nick interrupted before benny could speak last year when benny told me he was trading his car in i told him it was stupid for him to be paying insurance and upkeep on a car when i was paying to house three vehicles in a manhattan garage at midtown prices no less i suggested that he drive the suv between his home and manhattan and then switch to the sedan at the garage when he drove me to appointments ahearn ignored him so benny you drove the black mercedes suv which your kindly employer offered you to use as your own vehicle to your apartment in astoria two weeks ago tonight the night leesey disappeared no mr demarco had the suv in the garage at the loft because he was going to drive to the airport in the morning with his golf clubs i dropped him off at the woodshed at about ten oclock in the sedan then drove home to my place that night you then went into your apartment and to bed uhhuh that was about eleven oclock benny the parking problem is pretty lousy in your neighborhood isnt it parkings lousy everywhere in new york city but you lucked out you got a spot for your employers vehicle right in front of your apartment building isnt that right yeah thats where i parked it i got home and got into bed and turned on jay leno he was really funny he was talking about i dont care what he was talking about i care about the fact that the black mercedes vehicle owned by nick demarco wasnt there thr whole night your neighbor in apartment d saw you pulling into a space in front of the building at about when he was leaving for work tell us benny where had you been did you get an emergency call from mr demarco had there been some kind of problem benny seppinis expression became angry and mulish none of your business he barked benny do you have a cell phone with a prepaid card ahearn demanded you dont have to answer that benny paul murphy shouted why not sure i do i place a few bets a hundred bucks here and there so arrest me didnt you buy one of those cell phones and prepaid cards as a joke birthday present for nick i mean mr demarco keep quiet benny paul murphy shouted benny stood up why should i ill tell you what happened that night i got a call around midnight from a very nice lady who is separated from a drunken bum husband she was scared the husband knows she and i like each other he left a crazy message on her cell phone threatening her i couldnt get back to sleep so i got dressed and drove over there her place is about a mile away from mine i sat outside her building in the car to make sure he didnt show up after the bars closed i stayed till five oclock then i went home youre a real sir galahad benny ahearn said who is this woman whos the guy threatening her hes a cop benny said flatly one of new york s finest she has grown kids who think hes the worlds best guy and just has a small problem with booze she dont want trouble i dont want trouble so im not going to say nothing more paul murphy stood up weve had enough he told ahearn barrott and gaylor im sure youll be able to confirm bennys story and i know my client would do anything to help the young girl who is missing he threw them all a scornful look why dont you stop barking up the wrong tree and go find the abductor of leesey andrews and those other young women and why dont you stop wasting your time trying to put round pegs in square holes while there may still be a chance to save her life the three detectives watched the men depart when the door closed behind them ahearn said that story is full of holes sure benny could have covered himself by being outside his girlfriends building for a while but he still had plenty of time to respond to an emergency call from nick and get leesey out of that loft they looked at one another in an agony of frustration each man hearing in his head once again leesey andrewss desperate cry for help a nd the walls came tumbling down was that an old gospel folk hymn something about joshua and the walls of jericho he wasnt sure the only thing that was sure was that time was running out fast i really really didnt want to end up like this he thought it was forced on me i really did try to stop after the first one that wasnt counting the real first one of course the one nobody knew about but then i wasnt allowed to stop not fair not fair the end is coming he thought feeling his pulse quicken i cant stop it its all over ill be found out but im not going to be arrested im going to die but im going to take someone new with me whats the best waythe most exciting wayto do it ill figure it out he told himself after all he always had m arthas vineyard is about three hundred miles northeast of manhattan and slower to warm up on tuesday morning when i woke up i looked out the window at the bright cold day feeling physically and emotionally stronger i got out of bed and considered what to wear when i confronted barbara hanover galbraith it was cool enough for the running suit i had thrown in my bag but that was not necessarily the outfit i would choose for our meeting i didnt want to seem either overdressed or too casual i wanted no sense of being macks little sister when i saw barbara she was a pediatric surgeon i was a juris doctoris an attorneyatlaw and had just completed a clerkship with a civil court judge my alternative was a darkgreen cashmere jacket white fitted camisole and white jeans i had taken from the closet at the last minute now i was glad that i had the option of wearing them although it was nearly lunchtime i called room service to order a continental breakfast and drank black coffee and nibbled on a cinnamon bun while i dressed i realized i was so nervous that my fingers were clumsy fumbling as they unpinned the cleaners tags from the clothes i was perfectly aware that i might be on a fools errand barbara and her children might be back in manhattan by now but i didnt think that would be the case i believed that she was hiding out up here to avoid being questioned about mack in which case shed have stayed put i was sure that if i called first she would put me off but if i simply showed up there was almost no civil way she could close the door in my face since she had once been a guest for dinner at sutton place at least i hoped not checking my watch i realized i needed to get moving if i wanted to catch barbara at home in the car i set the navigation system the street where richard hanover lived was about six miles away my plan was to drive to the house and ring the bell if no one was there id go into the center of town and walk around for a while then make periodic trips back to the house until she was in it seemed like a good plan but of course the days events didnt unfold that way i reached the house at about there was no one there i came back every hour until by then i had decided it was a totally wasted trip and was as thoroughly disheartened as any human being could possibly be then just as i was making a uturn a jeep with new york plates passed me and turned into the driveway i caught a glimpse of a woman at the wheel with a man beside her and some kids in the back i drove around for ten minutes or so then went back to the house and rang the bell a man in his early seventies answered the door he obviously had no idea who i was but his smile was cordial i introduced myself and said that bruce had told me his family was visiting come in he said you must be a friend of barbaras mr hanover i said stepping across the threshold im mack mackenzies sister i need to talk to her about him his expression changed i dont think thats a very good idea he said its not a matter of its being a good idea i said im afraid its necessary not giving him a chance to reply i walked past him into the living room the house was one of those early cape cods that had been expanded over the years the living room wasnt large but it was charming with early american furniture and a hooked rug overhead i could hear the sound of running feet and shrieks of laughter the children sounded young i thought i remembered hearing that barbara and bruce galbraith had a boy and twin girls richard hanover had disappeared presumably to tell his daughter i was here while i waited three little girls came pounding down the stairs followed by a girl of about eleven the little ones rushed over to me two of them were obviously twins the girls crowded around me pleased to be greeting a guest whats your name i pointed to one of the twins samantha jean galbraith she said proudly everybody calls me sammy and we took the ferry to cape cod today theyd been on an allday excursion to the cape i thought i pointed to the other twin whats your name margaret hanover galbraith im named after my grandmother who is in heaven and everybody calls me maggie both girls have their mothers blond hair i thought to myself and is this your cousin or your friend i asked indicating the other little girl this is ava grace gregory our very best friend samantha explained ava grace took a step closer to me and beamed samantha turned and tugged at the older girls hand and this is victoria somers she visits us here and sometimes we visit her at her ranch in colorado i go with them sometimes ava grace told me earnestly and my daddy took all of us to the white house ive never been there myself i told her thats wonderful i love kids i thought to myself someday im going to have at least four of my own i hope okay you guys go upstairs and get cleaned up before its time to go out for dinner the tone was light and the children were facing me so they could not see the expression on barbara hanover galbraiths face she looked at me with such intense dislike that the only emotion i could feel was astonishment i had met her once at dinner when i was sixteen years old i had been heartbroken because it had looked as if nick had a crush on her but now he claims that it was she who had a crush on mack suddenly i wondered if i was reading her expression correctly was it scorn that i was seeing in her narrowed eyes and tense body language or something else with a chorus of goodbyes the girls were on their way upstairs barbara said id rather talk in the den i followed her down the narrow hall there was a large country kitchen at the end that spilled into a family room the den was to the left before the kitchen if i were to guess i would say that this was where richard hanover spent his evenings when he was alone it had cheery wallpaper a patterned carpet a mediumsized desk and chair and a recliner that faced a wallmounted television there was a reading lamp to the left behind the recliner and a basket of books and magazines within easy reach i could visualize my father in that room barbara closed the door and sat behind the desk leaving me only the reclining chair which seemed too big and too deep for me i knew she was macks age thirtyone but she was one of those women whose early beauty doesnt last her face which i remembered as being flawless was too thin now her lips too narrow the cascade of blond hair that i had once both admired and envied was now drawn tight in a chignon but she was still compelling in a slender autocratic way i imagined that her commanding presence must be a comfort to the parents of her pediatric patients why did you come here carolyn she demanded i looked at her trying to reflect the same hostility that was emanating from her barbara i said from what i understand you and mack were dating ten years ago when he disappeared frankly ive been told that you were pretty crazy about him if as the police believe and as you surely have read in the newspapers mack is committing crimes there can only be one reason for it and that is that hes had a complete mental breakdown i need to know if you saw any sign of it she said nothing i stared back at her im telling you right now that when i met your husband at his office he showed such hostility about mack that i was floored what did mack ever do to bruce and did it have anything to do with his disappearance what reason do you have for rushing up here to avoid questioning if you think you can hide out up here youre wrong the media is camped outside our home on sutton place every time i go in or out they try to shove a microphone in my face unless i can get some honest answers from you and i am satisfied that you know nothing about the reason for macks disappearance then the next time im hounded by the media im going to tell them you and your husband are holding back information that may be helpful in finding leesey andrews i watched as the color drained from her face you wouldnt dare to do that oh yes i would i assured her i will do anything to find mack and stop him if he is committing these crimes or clear his name if he is innocent for all i know hes a victim of amnesia and may be living three thousand miles away i dont know where he is but i do know why he walked away barbara galbraiths chin began to tremble if i tell you will you swear to leave us alone bruce had nothing to do with his disappearance bruce loved me and saved my life its because of what mack did to me that he hates him what did he do to you i could almost not form the words i had been wrong i hadnt been seeing only hatred from dr barbara hanover galbraith i had been witnessing pain that she had been trying not to unleash i was crazy about mack we were going out together to him it was casual i know that but then i got pregnant i was frantic my mother was dying the health insurance was pitiful and all the money that had been put aside for medical school had been spent i had been accepted at columbia presbyterian and i knew i couldnt go i told mack she gulped to avoid sobbing he said he would take care of me he said wed get married and i could defer school for one year then start that sounds like mack i thought i believed him i knew he didnt love me but i was also sure i could get him to love me then he disappeared just like that i didnt know what to do why didnt you go to my parents i demanded they would have taken care of you maybe give me a handout to support their sons child no thank you barbara bit her lip i am a pediatric surgeon i thrill to touch a tiny baby and save its life i have saved babies so small that they fit in the palm of my hand i have the gift of healing but there is one baby i didnt save my own i had an abortion because i was desperate she averted her eyes and continued you know something carolyn sometimes in the pediatric nursery when a little one is crying i go over and pick it up and comfort it and when i do i think of the baby i had scraped out of my own womb she stood up your brother wasnt that sure about being a lawyer he told me that hed get the degree to please his father but that hed really have liked to try his hand at acting i dont think hes crazyi think hes out there somewhere and maybe even has the grace to be ashamed of himself by now do i think hes committing these crimes absolutely not i loathe him for what he did to me but he is not a serial killer im surprised youd even give that possibility a second thought im going to go and i promise i will never mention you in any way to anyone nor bother you again i said quietly as i stood up but i have one more question why does bruce hate mack so there is a very simple answer bruce loves me all through columbia from the time we were freshmen i knew that after i had the abortion i went to a hotel room and swallowed sleeping pills and then i decided i wanted to live i called bruce he came rushing to me he saved my life hell always be there for me and i love him for that and ive learned over time to love him for himself now do me a favor and get out of this house the downstairs of the rest of the house was quiet as i walked along the hall to the front door from upstairs i could hear the voices of the children and my guess was that richard hanover had kept them there so that they could not hear what we were saying if i could describe my emotions i would say i felt as though i were in a whirlwind being slammed back and forth against opposite walls at last i had the answer to why my brother disappeared mack had been unutterably selfish but he didnt want to go to law school and didnt love barbara and her pregnancy was what galvanized him into running away even the quote on the tape made sense when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyesi all alone beweep my outcast state and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries in his defense he must have counted on barbara going to my parents for support for his baby barbaras flat statement that mack was not responsible for these crimes her shock that i would even consider the possibility was both a reproach and a relief to me in my mind i had been trying to form an insanity defense for him now whatever fears i had that he was abducting and killing women were over i knew i would stake my immortal soul on the fact that he was innocent then who was doing this who i asked myself as i got into the car of course i had no answer i drove back to the hotel keeping my fingers crossed that i could extend my stay the place was really more of an inn than a hotel and only had eight or ten bedrooms i had planned to leave at six pm and was being billed for a late checkout thank god my room was available i didnt think there was any way i could have waited at the ferry and then driven home in my present frame of mind driven home to what i asked myself bitterly the media at my heels barrotts insinuating calls an absent mother who wanted no part of me a friend nick who was probably using me to help clear his own name i went upstairs the room was cold i had left a window open that the housekeeper hadnt closed i closed it now and turned up the thermostat then i looked in the mirror i looked gaunt and weary my hair which id left loose seemed limp on my shoulders i grabbed the courtesy bathrobe from the closet went into the bathroom and began to run the tub three minutes later i was feeling the warmth of the bathwater begin to permeate the chill in my body when i dressed i put on the running suit that thankfully i had brought with me it felt good to be wearing it zipped high at the neck only my face and head showing i twisted my hair back and pinned it then applied a little makeup to hide the stress i saw in my eyes and expression celebrities in dark glasses at night have always amused me i often wondered how they managed to read the menu in a restaurant this evening i put on the glasses i had worn while i was driving up yesterday they covered half my face and made me feel shielded i picked up my shoulder bag and went downstairs to the restaurant then was dismayed to see that except for a large middle table with a reservation sign on it there didnt seem to be anything available but the maitre d took pity on me there is a small table in a corner near the kitchen door he said i dont like to assign it but if you dont mind it will be fine i told him i had been settled there long enough to order a glass of wine and review the menu when they came into the dining room dr barbara hanover galbraith her father the four girls and one other person a boy about nine or ten years old a boy with sandy hair whose face i recognized as clearly as i would my own if i looked in the mirror i stared at him the wideset eyes the high forehead the cowlick the straight nose he was smiling macks smile i was looking at macks face my god i was looking at macks son i suddenly felt lightheaded as the realization hit me barbara had lied she didnt have the abortion she never went into any pediatric nursery and longed for the child she had destroyed she had borne that child and was raising him as bruce galbraiths son how much of the rest of her story was true i asked myself i had to get out of there i stood up and walked through the kitchen ignoring the stares of the workers i crossed into the lobby stumbled upstairs packed my bag checked out and caught the last ferry from the vineyard at two am i got back to sutton place for once there was no media truck on the block but detective barrott was standing in the garage obviously he must have known that i was on the way home and i realized i must have been followed i was dizzy with exhaustion what do you want i almost screamed carolyn dr andrews received another message from leesey an hour ago her exact words were daddy mack said that hes going to kill me now he doesnt want to take care of me anymore goodbye daddy i love you daddy barrotts voice echoed through the garage as he shouted and then she screamed no please dont he was strangling her he was strangling her carolyn we couldnt save her where is your brother carolyn i know you know where is that stinking killer youve got to tell us where is he now a t three oclock on wednesday morning as he was driving around soho looking for a vulnerable target his cell phone rang where are you a tense voice asked cruising in soho nothing special this was his favorite neighborhood lots of drunken young women stumbling home at this hour those streets are alive with cops you wouldnt try to pull anything stupid would you stupid no exciting yes he said his eyes still scanning i need one more i cant help it get home and go to bed i have someone else for you and shell make the biggest headlines of all do i know her you know her who is she he listened as he heard the name oh thats really good he exclaimed did i ever tell you that youre my favorite uncle t he horror of the recording of leeseys final goodbye to her father had shaken even the hardened detective squad to the core catching the serial killer before he could strike again had become a burning need for each of them over and over the full squad reviewed every fact that had come to light during the investigation on wednesday morning they were crowded into ahearns office again gaylor was reporting his findings benny seppinis story had checked out he was seeing anna ryan the separated wife of walter ryan a police sergeant who was known for his heavy drinking and volatile temper anna ryan confirmed that she had been speaking to benny monday night two weeks ago and expressed to him her fear of her husband when told that benny claimed he had been parked in his car outside her apartment building she had smiled and said thats just what benny would do that doesnt mean benny didnt get an emergency phone call from demarco that night ahearn pointed out but well never prove that ahearn began reading from his notes in the several days since he had been followed by plainclothes detectives nick demarco had done nothing unusual his wiretapped phone conversations had been mostly businessoriented several from a real estate agent confirmed that his park avenue apartment was for sale in fact an offer had been made that he said he would consider he had tried to phone carolyn mackenzie half a dozen times but she had obviously turned off her cell phone we know she was on her way to marthas vineyard ahearn said demarco didnt know and he was getting pretty worried about her ahearn looked up to make sure he still had everyones attention carolyn went to see her brothers exgirlfriend dr barbara hanover galbraith but she didnt stay long the husband wasnt up there then when the family came into the hotel where carolyn was staying she bolted and drove home carolyn didnt get any calls in the hotel she hasnt used her cell phone from the time she left town monday after she saw the kramers till now she was crying when she left the kramers monday morning we have a picture of her leaving the building then a guy followed her to her car this is a shot of him with her ahearn put down his notes and handed photos to barrott we checked him out his name is howard altman he works for derek olsen who owns a bunch of small apartment buildings including the one mack lived in altman didnt start the job until a couple of months after mackenzie disappeared the pictures were passed around and put back on ahearns desk our guys went back to see the kramers monday afternoon ahearns voice was increasingly weary in his head he could not stop hearing leeseys cry no please dont he cleared his throat gus kramer said he told carolyn that his wife saw mack at that mass when he left the note in the collection basket and that he was a killer and she should leave them alone carolyn started crying and ran out the first time we saw her gaylor said mrs kramer didnt tell us that she saw mack in church the morning he left the note because she didnt have her distance eyeglasses with her so she couldnt be sure it was him then monday afternoon she said that now shes convinced it was mack do we believe her i dont believe anything the kramers tell us ahearn said flatly but i dont think gus kramer is a serial killer he looked at barrott brief them on what carolyn mackenzie told you when you met her in the garage this morning the dark circles under roy barrotts eyes had given way to deep pouches we had it out in the garage she swore that her brother is innocent that just because leesey used his name doesnt mean she wasnt made to say it she said shes going to comb every statement we make or have made and read every word thats been published and if she finds anything that says her brother is a killer she will sue until the cows come home he paused rubbing his forehead she told me she was a lawyer and a damn good one and she was out to prove it to me she said that if her brother was guilty shed be the first to turn him in before he ends up in a shootout and then shed work like hell to create an insanity defense for him do you believe her chip dailey one of the newest detectives asked barrott shrugged i believe she believes hes innocent yeah i also now believe shes not in touch with the brother if hes the one who called her mothers apartment using leeseys cell phone its just another one of his games ahearns phone rang when he answered his expression changed then he said be sure theres no possibility of a mistake when he broke the connection he said lil kramer spent two years in prison when she was twentyfour years old she was working for an elderly woman when the woman died a lot of her jewelry was missing lil was convicted of stealing it did she admit it barrott asked never doesnt matter she was convicted at trial i want her and gus kramer brought down here now he looked around the room all right you all know your assignments his eye fell on barrott who was almost asleep on his feet roy go home and sleep youre truly convinced that carolyn isnt in touch with her brother yes then forget tailing her we know we dont have enough to detain the kramers but once they leave here i want both of them followed as the squad turned to file out ahearn said something that he had not been sure he was going to share ive listened to that recording at least one hundred times this may sound crazy but were dealing with a lunatic you hear leesey scream and then a gasping gurgling sound but then he disconnected her cell phone we didnt actually hear her die you seriously think shes still alive gaylor asked incredulously i think the guy were dealing with would not be above that kind of game yes a fter my shouting match with detective barrott i went upstairs to find concerned messages from both nick and elliott on the machine where are you carolyn please give me a call im worried about you that was from nick his final message had been left at midnight carolyn your cell phone isnt turned on when you get home please call me no matter what time it is elliott had left three messages the latest at pm carolyn your cell phone is off please call me im so concerned about you i saw your mother this evening and i feel that she is much stronger emotionally but i feel as if in my concern for her i may have been failing you you know how dear you are to me call me as soon as you get this message listening to all the messages the concern in both their voices felt like stumbling into a warm room after an ice storm i loved them both but i was hardly going to call either one of them at in the morning i had rushed out of the restaurant in marthas vineyard without having dinner and now i realized i was starving i went into the kitchen and had a glass of milk and half a peanut butter sandwich i hadnt eaten peanut butter in ages but somehow at that moment i craved it then i got undressed and fell into bed i was so wired that i didnt think i would sleep but the minute i closed my eyes i was gone gone into a maze of mournful dreams and weeping shadows and something else what was it what face was i trying to see that was eluding me taunting me it wasnt mack when i dreamt about him i saw a boy of ten with a cowlick and sandy hair and wideset eyes macks son my nephew i woke up around eight oclock put on a robe and still half groggy went down to the kitchen in the morning light the kitchen seemed reassuringly familiar whenever mom went on a trip she let our longtime housekeeper have a minivacation sue would come in only once a week to keep the apartment fresh all the little signs showed me that she had been in yesterday while i was at the vineyard there was fresh milk in the fridge and the mail that i had dumped on a counter in the kitchen was neatly stacked i was just grateful that shed been here the one day i was away i couldnt have endured having her commiserate with me about mack i didnt have the faintest desire for anything to eat but my head was clear and i had some decisions to make i tried to think them through over three cups of coffee detective barrott i honestly thought i convinced him that i was not protecting mack but on the other hand i had not told him about something that might have had everything to do with macks disappearance barbara had told me that bruces anger at mack was because of macks treatment of her but maybe there was a lot more to it than that bruce had always been desperately in love with barbara he obviously married her on her termsbe my babys father and send me to medical school did he have anything to do with forcing mack to run away did he threaten him and if so with what that simply didnt make sense to me macks child i had to protect him barbara didnt know i had seen him he was growing up as the son of a pediatric surgeon and a wealthy real estate entrepreneur he had two little sisters i could never shatter his world and if i tried to cast suspicion on bruce and barrott began digging into the relationship between barbara and mack before mack disappeared that could happen i needed someone to talk to someone whom i could trust implicitly nick no the lawyer wed hired thurston carver no and then the answer came and it was so simple i couldnt believe i hadnt thought of it sooner lucas reeves he had been in on the investigation since the beginning he had interviewed nick and barbara and bruce and the kramers i called his office it was only but he was already there he told me to come over as soon as i could make it he said that he and his staff were working on nothing but finding leeseys abductor even if its mack i said of course even if its mack but i absolutely do not believe the answer lies with him i showered then turned on the television and watched as i dressed the police had released to the media the fact that another call had been received from leesey the contents have not been revealed but a police source confirmed that there is a high probability that she is now dead the cnn anchor said as i pulled on jeans and a longsleeve cotton sweater i thought that at least by not releasing the exact contents of the conversation macks name had been kept out of it i like jewelry and i always wear earrings and something around my neck today i chose a thin gold chain with a pearl that daddy had given to me and then i fished in the drawer for the earrings that mack had presented to me on my sixteenth birthday they were a gold sunburst design with a tiny diamond in the center i felt close to both daddy and mack as i fastened them it was about a mile from sutton place to reevess office but i decided to walk after so much time in the car in the last few days i needed the exercise the question was how i could avoid the media i did it by going down to the garage and waiting for a few minutes until a resident of the building came along then i begged a ride he was a distinguishedlooking older man i had never met him could i just hide on the floor of your backseat until were a couple of blocks away i pleaded he looked at me sympathetically ms mackenzie i certainly understand why you want to get away without the media but im afraid im not the one who should help you im a federal judge i almost laughed in disbelief but then the judge signaled to someone who had just gotten off the elevator hi david he said this young lady needs help and i know youll provide it feeling my cheeks burn with embarrassment i thanked them both david whoeverhewas dropped me off at park and fiftyseventh i walked the rest of the way my thoughts as scattered as the scraps of paper that the breeze was picking up and depositing near the curb the month of may was almost over o mary we crown thee with blossoms today queen of the angels queen of the may we used to sing that every may at the academy of the sacred heart and one year when i was about seven i got to crown the statue of the virgin fastforward to the scene todayme kneeling on the floor of the car to avoid microphones and cameras when i got to lucas reevess office the sight of that small strongfeatured man with the resonant voice helped me to focus again he pumped my hand vigorously as if he understood i needed human contact come inside carolyn he said ive got quite a setup in here he led me into a large conference room the walls were covered with pictures in which faces had been enlarged some of them were inside shots others had obviously been taken outside these start when the first young woman disappeared ten years ago reeves explained weve culled them from newspaper pictures television clips security cameras they were taken in and around the clubs where the four young women disappeared i have invited the detective squad of the district attorneys office to come here and inspect them to see if just maybe one face will trigger a connection that has been missed so far why dont you look at them i walked around the room stopping when i saw the faces of mack and nick and some of their friends at that first club they looked so young i thought then i walked around all four walls from one collage to the next and then to the next my eyes searching and searching at one point i stopped that looks like i thought then almost laughed out loud how stupid i couldnt even see the mans face just his eyes and forehead anything lucas asked no just the obvious ones of mack and nick in that first club all right lets go into my office we settled in there the ritual coffee was delivered and then i told lucas reeves what i had learned in marthas vineyard he listened his expression becoming increasingly grave so it now seems that mack had a very good reason for disappearing a woman he did not love was bearing his child he did not want to marry her he did not want to go to law school so rather than risk the certain disappointment your parents especially your father would have felt he ran away the root cause of a vast majority of crimes is one of two factors love or money in macks case the primary motive for his disappearance would be his lack of love for barbara reeves leaned back in his chair people have run away for less ifand i repeat ifmack was involved in the death of that first young woman that also might explain the theft of the tapes from his former teacher when she was interviewed she could give no explanation for his disappearance except to say that he would have made an exceptionally fine actor but perhaps he confided too much to her and felt he had to retrieve his tapes somehow i have studied the records her death was caused not so much by the blow to her head that rendered her unconscious but by the fall itself onto the sidewalk that was what caused the bleeding in the brain that took her life he stood up and walked to the window carolyn there are questions here that we have not yet answered even if your brother is part of it i dont think he is all of it he paused then added when i called captain ahearn he did not divulge the full contents of the message leesey left but he did say she spoke about mack detective barrott told me what she said my throat closed as i quoted leeseys agonizing words and then i repeated what i had shouted at barrott and you are correct she may have been forced to use his name i keep coming back to the fact that bruce galbraith hates mack i said think how much he must have hated him when mack was involved with barbara suppose mack did just take off i started to speculate suppose bruce is still afraid hell show up someday and barbara will go running to him she claims she hates mack but i wonder if thats true mack was such a special human being he always said that bruce had zero personality when i saw bruce last week he was openly hostile so it was obviously not a normal social exchange but hes a plainlooking guy and while he may be hugely successful i bet that on a daytoday basis hes still the same dull and boring person nick said they called him the lone stranger and he was in the club the night the first girl disappeared i watched reeves as he considered all of this i wonder how thoroughly mr galbraith was investigated ten years ago reeves said ill look into it i got up i wont keep you any longer lucas i said but im glad to have you in my corner i corrected myself in macks corner too yes i am he walked with me through the reception area to the door carolyn if i may be personal you are living under a strain that would break the most hardy of men is there a place you could get away to to be by yourself or with a close friend he looked at me with concern im thinking about it i said but first im going to visit my mother whether she wants to see me or not as you know shes in that private sanitarium in connecticut where elliott brought her i do know at the door reeves took my hand again carolyn the entire detective squad from the district attorneys office will be in and out all afternoon maybe one of them will spot a face in that sea of faces that will open a door for us i walked home this time i did not try to sneak into the apartment building the doors of media vans that had been keeping vigil sprang open and reporters came rushing up to me as i approached our building carolynwhat do you think ms mackenzie would you broadcast an appeal to your brother to turn himself in i turned to face the microphones i will broadcast an appeal to one and all to presume my brother innocent of any and all crimes remember there is not one shred of proof against him everything is based on innuendo and supposition and let me remind all of you that there are libel laws and serious penalties for violating them i hurried inside not giving them a chance to respond i went up to the apartment and began to return the phone calls i had been ignoring the first was to nick his relief at hearing my voice seemed so spontaneous that i tucked it away in a corner of my mind as something to think about later carolyn dont do this to me ive been a wreck i even called captain ahearn to see if they were holding you there he said they hadnt heard from you they hadnt heard from me but they knew where i was i said evidently i was being followed i told nick that i had seen barbara in marthas vineyard but it had been a useless trip i selected carefully the information i would give him i agree with you she probably married bruce to get a ticket to medical school but she seems to be keeping her share of the bargain i also couldnt resist having a chance to slam her she let me know what a devoted and loving pediatric surgeon she is that sometimes when she walks through the pediatric nursery she goes over to a crying baby and picks it up to comfort it that would be barbara nick agreed carolyn how are you holding up just barely i could hear the exhaustion in my voice me too the cops have been raking me and benny over the coals again one good piece of news his tone brightened i sold my park avenue apartment the one that makes you feel like roy rogers i smiled exactly the agent tells me the buyer is planning to rip it to the studs and redesign it good luck to him where will you go to the loft im looking forward to it if theres anything i look forward to at this minute we caught a nineteenyearold with a phony drivers license in the club last night if wed served her we could have been shut down i wouldnt be surprised if she was planted by the cops to put more pressure on me nothing would surprise me at this point i said meaning it dinner tonight i want to see you no i dont think so im going to drive up and try to visit mom i need to see for myself how shes doing ill drive you no i have to go alone carolyn let me ask you something years ago mack told me that you had a crush on me and that i should be careful not to encourage it by playing up to you he paused clearly trying to keep his tone playful is there any way i could revive that crush or now is it going to stay onesided on my part i know there was a smile in my voice it was mean of him to tell you no it wasnt nicks voice became serious again all right carolyn ill let you go but hang on to the thought that were going to make it through this mess i started to cry i didnt want him to hear and clicked off but then immediately wondered if nick hadnt been starting to say together or did i only imagine hearing that word because i wanted so desperately for it to turn out that way then it occurred to me for the first time that it was possible my cell phone and the telephone line in the apartment were being tapped of course they must be i thought barrott has been sure im in touch with mack they wouldnt take a chance on not knowing if he called reflecting on my conversation with nick i wondered if their ears were burning at his suggestion that they might deliberately try to entrap him with an underaged drinker in the woodshed i hoped so l il and gus kramer sat nervously rigid in captain larry ahearns office ahearn eyed them carefully figuring out his approach to them it was obvious when gaylor ushered them in that lil kramer was on the verge of a total breakdown her hands were trembling there was a distinct twitch at the side of her mouth she was on the brink of tears start gently or let her have it he decided on the rough approach lil you didnt let on to us that you spent two years in prison for jewelry theft he snapped it was as if he had punched her in the mouth she gasped her eyes widened and she began to moan gus jumped to his feet you shut up he yelled at ahearn look up that case she was a young girl from idaho without a family caring for an old lady night and day she never touched that jewelry the old ladys cousins were the only ones who had the combination of the safe in her house they framed lil so that they not only had the jewelry but the insurance may they rot in hell i never met anyone who went to prison who wasnt framed ahearn said brusquely sit down mr kramer he turned back to lil did mack ever accuse you of stealing anything lil dont say a word these people are trying to frame you again lil kramers shoulders sagged i cant help it if they do no one will believe me just before he disappeared mack asked about his new watch if i had seen it i knew he was hinting that i had taken it i got so upset i yelled at him i said the three of you in that apartment are all so careless then when you cant find something you blame it on me who else blamed you ahearn demanded that nasty bruce galbraith he couldnt find his college ring as if i would have anything to do with taking it what would i do with it then a week later he said he had found it in the pocket of his slacks no apology of course no im sorry mrs kramer she was weeping now tired hopeless tears ahearn and gaylor looked at each other knowing they were thinking the same thing that would be easy to check then you dont know if mack found his watch before he disappeared no i dont and thats why im so afraid that when he comes back hell accuse me again lil kramer began to wail and thats why when i thought i saw him in church that day you thought you saw him in church ahearn interrupted you told us you were certain you saw him there i saw someone about his size then when i heard he had dropped the note i was sure but then i wasnt sure and i guess im sure now but why did you suddenly decide to move to pennsylvania gaylor interrupted because mr olsens nephew steve hockney overheard mack asking me about the watch and now steve is holding that over my head she screamed because he wants us to complain about howie to his uncle and get him fired andandi canttakeitanymore i just want to die i want to die lil kramer leaned forward and covered her face with her hands her thin shoulders shook as she sobbed gus knelt beside her and put his arms around her its all right lil he said its all right were going home now he looked up first at ahearn and then at gaylor this is what i think of you two he said and spat on the carpet t he other phone call after i finished speaking with nick was to jackie reynolds my psychologist friend who had been trying to reach me and whom id put off calling of course jackie had been reading the newspapers but we hadnt talked much since our dinner when all of this began remembering my suspicion that the phone might be tapped i gave very general answers to her questions i knew she caught on carolyn ive had a couple of cancellations she said have you any plans for lunch no then why dont you come up here and well send out for sandwiches and coffee that sounded good to me jackies office adjoins the apartment where she lives on east seventyfourth street and second avenue as i hung up i realized how much i wanted her guidance about my planned visit to mom which reminded me that i had not yet spoken to elliott i dialed his office and was put straight through to him carolyn i didnt know what to think when i couldnt reach you i heard the reproach in his voice and apologized i knew i owed him that i explained that i had gone to marthas vineyard and the reason for it then keenly aware of the probable wiretap i said that it was a wasted visit and that i was going to drive up later this afternoon to see mom if she refuses to see me at least i tried ill get there between four and five i told him i think that might be good timing he said slowly i hope to get up there around five myself i want to talk to you and olivia together with that we left it what did he want to talk to the two of us about i wondered surely in moms fragile state he wouldnt withdraw his support from her now please god not that she needed him i thought about the night only a few weeks ago after mack left the note and at dinner she announced she had decided to let him live his own life i thought of the way she and elliott had looked at each other and how he had planned to join her in greece i thought about the way their shoulders were touching when they walked down the street after we left le cirque elliott could make mom happy mom is sixtytwo she has every chance of living another twenty or thirty good yearsunless of course ive ruined it for her by blundering into the detective squad room and meeting barrott i changed into a jacket and slacks and as i did last night in marthas vineyard tried to mask the dark circles under my eyes with foundation and added color to my overall washedout appearance with mascara and lipstick i drove out of the garage this time in my own car andsurprise surprisefor the present the media vans were gone i guess they figured they had about as much out of me as they were going to get for the day when i got to seventyfourth street i left the car in jackies garage and went upstairs when she came to the door we hugged each other nothing like lots of stress as a daily diet she commented i havent seen you in two weeks and i bet youve lost at least five or six pounds at least i agreed as i followed her into her office its a mediumsized comfortable room with a couple of upholstered armchairs facing her desk i remembered she collects nineteenthcentury english prints of dogs and horses and admired aloud some really wonderful examples framed on the wall i imagined new patients remarking on them before revealing the problem that had driven them to seek jackies help we agreed on ham and swiss cheese on rye with lettuce and mustard and black coffee she phoned in the order then we settled down to talk i told her about my meeting with barbara holding back only the fact that she had given birth to macks son instead feeling dishonest i gave barbaras version that she had had an abortion its a viable reason for mack to escape she agreed but just suppose he had gone to your father andor your mother what would either or both of them have done do you think supported them in their decision to marry and have the baby put mack through law school put barbara through medical school i dont know knowing your father as i did he certainly wouldnt have put up with mack taking a crack at acting now that is a certainty i agree then i told jackie how worried i was that elliott might reconsider wanting to marry mom while the present suspicion of mack existed or if he ever was arrested and put on trial id worry too jackie agreed frankly appearances mean so much to people like elliott i know someone like that hes about elliotts age a widower one of the nicest people youd ever want to know but a snob i joke with him that hed be caught dead before hed date anyone who wasnt a socialite no matter how accomplished and beautiful she was what did he say when you told him that i asked jackie he laughed but he didnt deny it the desk called to say that the delivery was on the way we settled down to lunch and jackie started to remind me that i was planning to apply for a job in the district attorneys office then i knew she could have bitten her tongue can you just imagine the district attorney of manhattan hiring the sister of an accused murderer a ll afternoon either alone or in pairs the members of the detective squad visited lucas reevess office and studied the photos he had prepared for their inspection sometimes they lingered over one or several pictures they studied the enhanced shot of mack mackenzie as he might look today some of them held it up to compare with a headshot on the wall but in the end they all left shrugging their shoulders in disappointment and defeat roy barrott was one of the last to arrive at quarter of five he had gone home and crashed for three hours now freshly shaved and alert he went painstakingly through the hundreds of stills while lucas reeves waited patiently in his office finally at seven fifteen as lucas came in to check on him he gave up theyre all starting to look familiar he said i dont know why but i feel as if im missing something over there he pointed his hand to the far wall lucas reeves frowned oddly carolyn mackenzie paused at that area as well i had the feeling that something interested her but she must have dismissed the possibility otherwise i am sure she would have said something barrott stood in front of it again its not going to happen at least not tonight reeves reached into his pocket and pulled out a card i have written down my cell phone number for you if anything occurs to you and you want to come back here at any hour call me and i will instruct the security guard to let you in immediately good enough and thanks barrott went back to the squad room to find renewed energy crackling through it ahearn his tie pulled loose his face haggard and weary was pacing the floor in his office we may be onto something he said steve hockney the nephew of the owner of the apartment building mackenzie was living in has a sealed juvenile record we got a look at it serious stuff but nothing violent dealing marijuana burglary and theft his uncle was able to hire good lawyers who kept him out of a couple of years in a juvenile center according to lil kramer hockney was holding it over her head that mackenzie was missing his watch that was only a day or two before mack disappeared were looking for hockney his band has regular gigs in the sohogreenwich village locale and he uses a lot of costume changes even wigs and putty to alter his appearance how about the rest of what the kramers told you we spoke to bruce galbraith hes one cold fish he acknowledged that he did ask lil kramer about his school ring but she took it wrong he wasnt accusing her he claims he just asked her if shed seen it when she was cleaning up she hit the roof and got all upset knowing her background you can understand why she might have been hypersensitive about a question like that bob gaylor had come in while ahearn was speaking our guys just reached hockneys uncle derek olsen the old man who owns the buildings he confirmed that there was a rivalry between his assistant howard altman and his nephew steve hockney he said hes sick of both of them hes left messages on their phones that hes selling all the property and that the wrecking ball is hitting the th street town house tomorrow morning we didnt let on that were hunting for the nephew we told him we were confirming the kramers story what did he say about them hardworking good people hed trust them with everything he had have we got any pictures of hockney barrott asked i want to compare him with a face i saw in reevess office just now i feel as though ive missed something theres one of his publicity pictures with his band on my desk ahearn told him weve got dozens of them with our guys on the street barrott started rifling through the untidy clutter on ahearns desk then picked up a picture he found there this is the one he said aloud ahearn and gaylor stared at him what are you talking about ahearn demanded im talking about this guy he said pointing wheres that other picture of leesey posing for her friend the one with nick demarco in the background one of the copies of it is somewhere in that pile barrott rummaged then with a satisfied grunt said here it is he held up two photos comparing them an instant later he was dialing the cell phone of lucas reeves a s i expected the sanitarium where mom was staying was about as luxurious inside and out as i would have imagined any place that elliott would choose for her would be thick carpets soft lights fine paintings on the walls i got there around and the receptionist had clearly been briefed that i was on my way your mother is expecting you she said in one of those professionally melodious voices that seemed to me to fit in with the surroundings her suite is on the fourth floor with a beautiful view of the grounds she got up and led me to the elevator an ornately handsome object with an operator and a velvet seating bench inside my escort murmured ms olivias suite please mason and i remembered hearing that in some of these expensive psychiatric residences last names are not shared just as well i thought the other guests dont need to know that mrs charles mackenzie sr is in their midst at the fourth floor we got out and walked down the hall to the corner suite after tapping on the door my escort opened it ms olivia she called her voice slightly elevated but still finishingschool modulated i walked behind her into an exquisite sitting room i have seen photos of the suites in the plaza athénée in paris and i felt as though i was walking into one of them then mom appeared in the doorway from the bedroom without another word the escort was gone and mom and i looked at each other all the conflicting emotions the roller coaster of emotions that i had been experiencing this last week when mom took refuge in elliotts apartment rushed through me as i looked at her guilt anger bitterness then they all washed away and the only thing i felt was love her beautiful eyes were filled with grief she was looking at me uncertainly as though she didnt know what to expect of me i went over to her and put my arms around her im so sorry i said im so terribly sorry i guess that no matter how many times i say to myself if only i hadnt tried to find mack i can only tell you id give my life to undo that but i cant then her hands began running through my hair the way they did when i was a small child and upset about something they were loving and comforting and i knew that she had come to peace with what i had done carolyn well see it through she said no matter what it turns out to be if mack has done everything they say he has done there is one thing i can be sure of he is not in his right mind how much have they told you i asked her i guess everything yesterday i told dr abrams my psychiatrist that i didnt want to be protected anymore i can sign myself out of here anytime but id rather absorb everything that i have to know while i can talk it through with him this was the mother i thought i had lost the one who kept dad sane when mack disappeared the one whose first thought was for me when she knew dad was lost on i had been a junior in columbia then and had by chance slept home and was still asleep when the first plane hit horrified mom had watched it by herself dads office was on the rd floor of the north tower the first one to be hit she had tried to phone him and actually got through to him liv the fires underneath us he said i dont think well make it the connection had gone dead and minutes later she saw the tower collapse she had let me sleep until i woke up naturally about fortyfive minutes later id opened my eyes to find her sitting in my room tears streaming from her eyes then shed rocked me in her arms while she told me what had happened this was my mother as she was until year after year the annual mothers day call from mack tore her apart mom if youre comfortable here i wish youd stay a while longer i said you dont want to be on sutton place the way it is now and once the media got word you were back at elliotts apartment theyd be gunning for you there too i understand that but carolyn what about you i know you wouldnt come here but isnt there someplace you can get away from them you can run but you cant hide i thought mom i think its necessary for me to be around and visible i said because until we have absolute proof to the contrary i am going to believe and publicly swear that mack is innocent thats exactly what your father would do now mom smiled a real smile come on lets sit down i wish we could have a cocktail but thats not going to happen here she looked at me a bit anxiously you know that elliott is coming yes im looking forward to seeing him hes been a rock i admit i felt a twinge of jealousy and then felt guilty about it elliott was a rock two weeks ago mom had said that i was her rod and staff my guilt faded as i remembered that elliott might just be about to announce that he needed to separate himself from our problems jackies words played again in my mind appearances mean so much to people like elliott but when he arrived everything i feared turned out to be totally wrong in fact in his endearing formal way he was looking for my blessing to marry mom he sat next to her on the couch and addressed me earnestly carolyn i guess you know ive always been in love with your mother he said i always thought she was a shining star beyond my reach but now i know that i can offer her the protection of a husband at a very difficult time in her life i knew i had to warn him elliott if mack were ever to go on trial as a serial killer you have to be aware that the publicity will be awful clients of the caliber you have may not be pleased that their financial advisor is in the tabloids on a regular basis elliott looked at my mother then back at me with something of a twinkle in his eyes he said carolyn word for word that is the same speech i heard from your mother i can promise you this i would rather tell all my distinguished clients to jump in the lake before i give up one day of being at your mothers side we had dinner in one of the private dining rooms it was a lowkey celebration i agreed with their plan that they would be married as soon and as quietly as possible i drove home that evening feeling so much better about mom but also with the strange sensation that mack was trying to reach me i could almost feel his presence in the car why again there was no sign of the media on sutton place i went to bed and listened to the eleven oclock news a clip with part of my statement to the media was shown and i sounded strident and defensive by now it had leaked out or been allowed to leak out that leesey had named mack as her abductor i turned off the television love or money i thought as i closed my eyes thats what lucas reeves said were the causes of the majority of crimes love or money or lack of love in macks case at three am i heard the buzzing of the intercom i got out of bed and rushed downstairs to pick it up it was the concierge im so sorry ms mackenzie he said but someone just handed a note to the doorman and said it was a matter of life and death that you have it immediately he hesitated then said with all the publicity this may be someones terrible idea of a joke but send it up i interrupted him i stood at the door and waited until manuel came down the hall and handed me a plain white envelope the note in it was handwritten on plain bond paper it read carolyn i am sending this by messenger because your phone may be wiretapped mack just called me he wants to see both of us hes waiting on the corner of th street and riverside drive meet us there elliott t here he is barrott exclaimed on the street in front of the woodshed the night leesey disappeared if you look from the angle the security camera caught him he could see demarcos table and there he is again in the same frame as demarco watching leesey when she was posing for her roommate accompanied by the security guard who had been given permission to admit them they were in lucas reevess office they had studied hundreds of pictures in the wall montages until they could pinpoint the face they were seeking heres another one that looks like him but the hair is shorter gaylor said a note of excitement detectable in his voice it was half past ten knowing they had a long night ahead they hurried back to the office to begin to process information on one more potential suspect l ucas reeves did not sleep well on wednesday night love or money was the phrase that ran through his head in a singsong way at six am as he was waking up the question that had been eluding him popped into his head who would be interested in having a person who is dead seem to be alive love or money money of course it was beginning to fall into place like pieces of a puzzle so absurdly simple if he was right lucas a notoriously early riser never minded waking up someone when he needed the answer to a question this time fortunately his advisor a prominent estate lawyer was also an early riser can an inheritance trust be broken or is it always sacrosanct lucas asked him abruptly theyre not easily broken by any means but if theres a good and valid reason for dipping into it the executor will usually be amenable thats what i thought i wont disturb you any further thank you my friend any time lucas but not before seven next time okay i get up early but my wife likes to sleep i pulled on slacks slipped my feet in sandals grabbed a long raincoat to cover my pajama top and ran for the elevator shoving elliotts note into my shoulder bag as i rushed down the hall in my hurry to get to mack before he changed his mind about seeing me i forgot that the garage closed at three am manuel reminded me of that when i asked for the garage level i did the only thing i could dogot outside into the street and looked frantically around to flag down a cab there was none on sutton place but when i turned up fiftyseventh street i saw one of those gypsy town cars coming i must have seemed a wild sight to him as i waved both arms to catch his eye but he did stop i got in and he made a uturn to go west when we got to the corner of th and riverside drive there was no one there i paid the cabby and climbed out onto the quiet street then i noticed a van parked down the block and even though the lights were off i had a hunch that elliott and mack might be in it i walked closer to get a better look and made a pretense of reaching for a key as though i were going to the nearest apartment building across the street i could see a large construction site next to a boardedup old town house on the corner then a man stepped out of the darkened doorway of the next building for a moment i thought it was elliott but then i could see that he was a much younger person someone whose face was familiar i recognized him as being the representative of the owner of macks apartment building i had met him that first time i stopped at the kramers and he had spoken to me on monday after i left their apartment in tears what on earth was he doing here now i asked myself and where was elliott ms mackenzie he said hurriedly i dont know if you remember me im howard altman i remember you where is mr wallace hes with some guy i found camping out in that place mr olsen owns it every once in a while i check on it even though its closed he was nodding toward the boardedup corner building the guy i found gave me fifty bucks to call mr wallace for him then mr wallace promised me another fifty bucks if id write a message for you and deliver it theyre inside that building what does the other man look like hes about thirty i guess he started crying when mr wallace came in they both did mack was in there trying to hide in that crumbling ruin i followed howard altman across the street and along the construction fence to the back door of the house he opened it and gestured me to enter but as i looked into the darkened interior i panicked and stepped back i knew something wasnt right ask mr wallace to come out i told howard his answer was to grab me and pull me inside the house i was so stunned i didnt resist he yanked the door closed behind him and before i could scream or fight to free myself he shoved me down a flight of stairs somewhere on the way down i cracked my head and lost consciousness i dont know how long it was before i opened my eyes it was pitch dark the air i was breathing was unbearably foul my face felt caked with blood my head was splitting and there was something wrong with my right leg it was bent under me and throbbing with pain then i felt something move beside me and a whispery voice moaned water please water i tried to move but could not i knew my leg had to be broken i did the only thing i could think to do i moistened a finger in my mouth then groped in the dark until i could find the parched lips of leesey andrews w ith his everincreasing arthritis derek olsen often woke up during the night throbbing pain in his hips and knees on wednesday night when his aching joints woke him up he could not go back to sleep again the call from the police about his nephew steve meant of course that he was in some kind of trouble again so much for the fifty thousand i was going to leave him olsen thought he can go whistle for it the one bright spot was that in a few hours he was going to have the fun of watching the wrecking ball smash that decrepit old town house into smithereens every chip that flies in the air represents money i made on the deal he thought with satisfaction i wouldnt put it past doug twining to operate the rig himself thats how mad he is at having to pay me so much the pleasurable thought comforted him to the point that sometime before dawn he fell into the deep sleep that normally lasted till eight am but on thursday morning his phone rang at six it was detective barrott wanting to know where howard altman was he hadnt returned to his apartment all night am i his babysitter olsen demanded querulously you wake me up to ask me where he is how do i know i dont socialize with him he works for me what kind of car does howard drive barrott asked when he drives me he drives my suv i dont think he has a car of his own i dont care does he ever take your suv in the evening not that i know of he better not its a mercedes what color is it black at my age do you think i want a red one mr olsen we really need to talk about howard barrott said what do you know about his personal life i know nothing i want to know nothing hes been working for me nearly ten years hes done a good enough job did you check his references when you hired him he was recommended by an impeccable source my financial advisor elliott wallace thank you mr olsen have a good day you ruined most of it for me ill be tired all day derek olsen slammed down the receiver but not all of it he thought as he envisioned the wrecking ball striking a bullseye on his piggy bank at the other end of the phone barrott unable to conceal his exultation said elliott wallace recommended him for the job it ties in with lucas reevess theory ahearn agreed but we have to go easy wallace is a big shot on wall street yes but he wouldnt be the first executor who dipped into his clients funds if thats the way it plays barrott said any result on the fingerprints not yet we cant be sure the ones we lifted from the outer door of howards apartment are absolutely his but were running them anyway id swear that guy has a prior record gaylor said barrott checked his watch the security guard at wallaces building said he normally gets in at eight thirty well be waiting for him o nce again carolyn was not answering her cell phone nick phoned her at eight oclock on thursday morning with the idea of taking her out for breakfast he wanted to see her i need to see her he thought on the late news he had watched the clip of her on television passionately defending mack he wanted to know how she had made out on the visit to her mother he knew how hurt she had been by her mothers refusal to see her at least her cell phone was on it was ringing it had been turned off monday afternoon and all day tuesday a gnawing sense that something was wrong made nick decide to stop at sutton place and make sure that she was home the morning concierge had just come on duty i dont think shes back yet he said when nick asked for carolyn i understand she had an emergency message at about three am and went rushing out whoever handed the note to her doorman said it was a matter of life or death i hope everything is all right everything isnt all right nick thought frantically he began to dial the now familiar number of detective barrott t hank you for seeing us mr wallace barrott said politely thats all right is there any news of mack elliott asked no im afraid there isnt but we do have a few matters you can help us clear up of course he gestured for the detectives to take a seat you know howard altman yes i do he is the employee of my client derek olsen didnt you actually recommend altman to mr olsen ten years ago i believe i did how did you happen to know mr altman im not really sure as i recall a former client had sold some real estate and was looking to place him elliotts expression was blank who was that client im not even sure i can remember i dealt with him only briefly but it was one of those coincidences olsen had been in and mentioned he was having a terrible time getting good help and i passed altmans name along to him i see wed certainly appreciate having that clients name and im sure youd want to find him altman may be a suspect in the abduction of leesey andrews which of course would clear the name of mack mackenzie anything that would clear macks name would be priceless to me elliott told barrott his voice shaking with emotion barrott studied him taking in the beautifully tailored suit the crisp white shirt the handsome blue and red tie he watched as wallace took off his glasses polished them then put them back on what is it about this guy that im seeing he asked himself its the eyes and the forehead they looked familiar then he wondered is it possible my god he resembles altman he signaled to gaylor to take over the questioning mr wallace isnt it a fact that you are the executor of mack mackenzies estate i am the executor of all the mackenzie family trusts the sole executor yes what are the terms of macks trust it was set up by his grandfather he was not to receive income from it until he reached the age of forty in the meantime of course it continues to grow certainly it has been carefully invested what would happen if mack died the trust would go to his children and if he had none to his sister carolyn could mack have asked for an advance from his trust for what you as executor deemed to be a responsible reason it would have to be extremely responsible his grandfather wanted no playboy heirs how about the fact that he was about to get married that his future wife was pregnant with his child that he no longer wanted his parents to pay his way that he would put himself through college and would want to pay for his wife to go to medical school would all that be good and sufficient reason to dip into the trust it might be but that situation did not occur elliott wallace stood up as you can understand i have a busy calendar and barrotts cell phone rang it was nick demarco barrott listened determined to keep an inscrutable look on his face carolyn mackenzie was missing the new victim he thought wallace holding an arm out was attempting to usher them out of his office lucas reeves is right barrott thought it all fits into place he decided to trick wallace with false information not so fast mr wallace he said were not going anywhere we have howard altman in custody hes bragging about the abductions hes bragging about working for you he paused for a moment you didnt tell us you were related to him finally wallaces unruffled exterior showed signs of strain oh poor howie he sighed with one hand he leaned on his desk and with the other he reached into the top drawer hes totally delusional of course no he isnt barrott snapped elliott wallace sighed again my psychopathic nephew promised to die in a breathtaking fashion and take carolyn and leesey with him he couldnt even handle that well in a single quick motion elliott wallace removed a small pistol from his desk drawer and held it to his forehead as cousin franklin would have put it my fellow americans farewell he said and pulled the trigger l arry ahearn was in the squad room when the call came in from barrott larry we were right about wallace he just blew his brains out before he did he told us that altman is his nephew he said that altman has carolyn and leesey and hes going to kill them and then kill himself but he didnt tell us where they are with icy calm ahearn absorbed the stunning information as of the last few hours neither trace we have on those phones is giving us anything he said either the phones are turned off or theyre in an area where we cant get reception what about altman he must have a cell phone ill call his boss olsen on another line hang on d erek olsen camp chair in hand was about to go out and walk down the block to see the wrecking ball destroy his old town house irritated at the second phone call from the detectives he was even more irritated at the reason for it sure howie has a cell phone who doesnt sure i know his number its but im telling you something thats the one i pay for i get the bill i watch it like a hawk business only i guess he has another how should i know im on my way out for some excitement goodbye as barrott waited on the line for ahearn to check with olsen detective gaylor moved swiftly to secure the premises with one hand he locked the door of wallaces office and with the other dialed on his cell phone then he heard barrott explode as he reacted to what ahearn was telling him the business cell phone that olsen gave you for altman is turned off but wait a minute wallace would never have been stupid enough to call altman on that line anyway there must have been another number that he used to reach him hold on larry in two strides barrott was across the room and kneeling beside wallaces body rummaging through his pockets here it is he yanked out a small stateoftheart cell phone opened it and scrolled through the directory this has got to be it he thought as he spotted the initials ha he pushed and then the send button and breathing a prayer held the phone to his ear it rang twice and then was answered uncle elliott an edgy highpitched voice said we did our goodbyes last night i dont want to talk anymore theres only a few minutes left the connection broke within seconds barrott was back on his own phone giving howard altmans number to ahearn who was frantically waiting to pass it on to the phone technicians who would trace it h e came down to the basement three times during that long night as i lay next to leesey on that clammy dirt floor pain vibrating from my leg my face crusted with dried blood my fingers entwined in leeseys he alternately cried and laughed and moaned and giggled i dreaded the sound of steps on the stairs not knowing if this would be the time he would decide to kill us remember the zodiac killer he sobbed the first time he came down he didnt want to keep going neither do i he wrote a letter to a newspaper that he knew could be traced to him i wrote one too but i tore it up i am tortured but i dont want to go to prison the first girl was when i was sixteen i had put that behind me then it happened again i was the caretaker on an estate and the housekeepers daughter was so pretty when they found her body they suspected me my mother sent me to new york to be with her dear older brother my uncle elliott wallace elliott wallace uncle elliott but thats impossible i thought that cant be i felt his breath on my cheek you dont believe me do you you should my mother told him he had to help me or shed expose him for the fraud that he was but even before i met him it happened again right after i got to new york the first girl in the nightclub i weighed her body down and threw it in the river then i met uncle elliott and i told him about it and said i was sorry and he had to get me a job or id go to the police and turn myself in and tell the newspapers he was a phony altmans voice became sarcastic of course he said hed find me a job his lips touched my forehead you believe me now dont you carolyn leeseys breath had become a soft terrified whimper i squeezed her hand i believe you i said i know youre telling the truth do you know that im sorry yes yes i know that thats good it was so dark i couldnt see him but sensed that he had moved away from us then i heard him going up the stairs again how long would it be before he came back i asked myself frantically i had been so foolish no one knew where i had gone it might be hours before someone looked for me nick i thought nick be worried know that somethings wrong look for me look for us i think a couple of hours passed and then i screamed he had been so quiet that i had not heard him come back his hand covered my mouth it doesnt do any good to scream carolyn he said leesey screamed in the beginning id come down here and tell her about her picture being in the newspapers she didnt want to record those messages for her father but i told her that if she did i might let her go but i didnt mean it now dont scream again if you do i will kill you he was gone again my head was pounding the pain in my leg was unbearable would lucas reeves or detective barrott try to reach me would they and nick realize that something was wrong the last time he returned i had the sense that it was morning i could see his shadow on the stairs i was never going to commit another crime carolyn he said i really did like managing those buildings and i loved the friends i made on the internet i still thought i could stop i really tried then uncle elliott said that now i owed him a favor he needed me to get rid of your brother mack went to elliott he wanted to tap into his trust fund his girlfriend was pregnant and mack wanted to get married and pay for his own education and hers too but uncle elliott had cleaned out most of the income from both of your trust funds hed invested tons of money in something that fell apart he tried to put mack off but he knew that mack was suspicious i had to kill him i had to kill him i had to kill him mack is dead i thought bitterly they murdered him elliott had to keep everyone thinking mack was alive so that the trust funds wouldnt be examined i made mack say the words that you heard on the first mothers day phone call before i shot him then a year later elliott made me kill the teacher and steal the tapes she had of mack so he could make new mothers day calls elliott is a technical genius for years he mixed what mack had said on those tapes for the calls your brothers buried right here with the other girls look carolyn he directed the thin beam of a flashlight across the basement floor i raised my head see where the crosses are your brother and the other girls are buried there next to each other mack had been dead all these years that we had been hoping and praying for him to come back to us the reality that mack was buried here in this miserable filthy basement filled me with an overwhelming grief somehow i had always believed i would find him mack mack mack altman was laughing a highpitched giggly sound sure elliott was born in england his mother is from kansas she was a maid with an american family that was transferred to england she got pregnant in london and was sent home after the baby was born she helped him make up all those stories about being a relative of president roosevelt they made them up together she helped him get that swanky english accent hes good with voices the last three years hes even been doing macks voice himself he knows you already had compared macks real voice with home movies had you fooled didnt he altmans voice was becoming more and more shrill we only have fifteen minutes before its all over theyre going to demolish this building but i want to tell you i dropped that note in the collection basket uncle elliott was worried that you were going to start looking for mack elliott had me leave it there lil kramer saw me in church i saw her look at me a couple of times but then she thought i was mack because you told her hed been at that mass goodbye carolyn goodbye leesey for the last time i heard his steps retreating fifteen minutes this building was going to be demolished in fifteen minutes i am going to die i thought and mom is going to marry elliott leesey was trembling i was sure she understood what he had said i kept holding her hand and moistening her lips talking to her begging her to hang on that everyone was looking for us but now i did not believe what i was saying i believed that leesey and i would be the final victims of this madman and elliott wallace in that moment i thought that at least i would soon be with mack and daddy w eve got him hes on th and riverside drive larry ahearn yelled an alarm went out to all the squad cars in the vicinity sirens wailing they rushed to the scene the wrecking ball was in place a delighted derek olsen saw that his business rival doug twining was inside the cockpit of the crane one derek jumped up and began to count two then his triumphant cheer died on his lips someone was pushing open the boarded window on the second floor of the old town house someone was swinging his legs over the sill and waving altman it was howie altman the wrecking ball was swinging toward the house at the last instant twining spotted altman and swung the controls so that the ball missed the house by inches squad cars tires screeching were rounding the corner come back come back a screaming howie altman was running along the roof of the porch waving his arms at the crane as he began to jump up and down the rotted wood caved in and the house began to crumble floor by floor toppling into each other seeing what was happening altman dove back through the window in time to have tons of debris crash down on him police poured out of the squad cars the basement one of them yelled the basement if theyre there its their only chance t he ceiling was falling around us i pulled myself up and tried to throw my body over leesey who was now barely breathing i felt a chunk of plaster hit my shoulder and then my head and arm too late too late i thought like mack and those other girls leesey and i were doomed to end our lives here then i heard the sound of the outside basement door being pulled open and shouting voices approaching me from above that was when i let myself drift off and escape from the pain i guess they sedated me pretty heavily because it was two days before i really woke up mother was sitting on a chair by the window of the hospital room watching over me as she had done on as we had that day we cried together in each others arms this time for mack the honorable young man son and brother who had died because he wanted to accept his responsibilities epilogue one year later w hen the books were checked we learned that elliott had robbed us of a fortune it was clear as altman had ranted that mack had realized something was wrong with his trust fund and the realization had cost him his life it was a miracle that leesey was still alive she had been tied up on that dirt floor for sixteen days and nights unable to move altman alternately threatening to kill her and then taunting her about jumping into the suv outside the woodshed when he told her nick had sent him to drive her home he had given her only a few sips of water each day starving and dehydrated she was in extremely critical condition when she arrived at the hospital just as mom had kept her vigil at my side leeseys father and brother kept theirs in her hospital room coaxing and begging her back to life the andrews have become our very good friends dr david andrews leeseys dad regularly invites mom and me for dinner at his club in greenwich their friendship has been a great comfort as mom and i struggle with the pain of macks death i know we have been a help to leesey as she recovers emotionally from her terrible ordeal mother sold the sutton place apartment and now lives on central park west i notice that dr david comes down frequently to go to dinner and the theatre with her we managed to keep from the media the full story of macks reason for becoming suspicious that his trust fund was not in order of course i told mom about macks son it was not my place to keep it from her dr barbara hanover galbraith came to see us and told us how much she regretted believing that mack had abandoned her even then she was not completely honest she did not admit that she had borne macks child until i confronted her then she begged us to wait until he is older to tell him the truth and we have reluctantly agreed mom and i wish with all of our hearts that we could know and be close to macks son we have quietly attended plays and concerts at his school st davids and it is like seeing mack again they called him gary to mom and me he will always be charles mackenzie the third the kramers are enjoying life in pennsylvania when they learned the truth about macks disappearance they came to apologize to mother and me lil told us that because she had gone to prison for stealing when she was a young woman she was hypersensitive when mack asked her about his watch it was found in howard altmans apartment well never know whether he stole it from macks college apartment or took it after he killed him lil also explained what she had found in macks room that had made gus so angry it was a silly note making fun of me saying that i wanted him to take me dancing but it hurt my feelings she said that of course was the note nick had written and then thrown away obviously he had been right about the fact that lil was a bit nosey when i asked him about it he said he had crumpled it and thrown it in the wastebasket near macks desk that is why lil thought mack had written it im happy to report that im one of the busy assistant district attorneys of manhattan and regularly work with the detectives who started by suspecting me and now are my close friends and colleagues nick and i were married three months ago we have turned the loft into a charming new york apartment the woodshed is doing well one of our favorite eating places is his fathers newly reopened pasta and pizza in queens ive always said i would have four children and were looking forward to having the first one before too long i hope its a boy his name will be charles mackenzie demarco well call him mack
