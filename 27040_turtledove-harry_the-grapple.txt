the grapple harry turtledove i funereal music poured out of the wireless set on brigadier general clarence potters desk for three days confederate stations had played nothing but somber tunes and even more somber commentaries praising the courage of the army whose survivors had just surrendered in pittsburgh potters mouth twisted behind steelrimmed spectacles his cold gray eyes flashed that army should have taken pittsburgh away from the damnyankees with their great industrial center gone the usa should have had to make peace from everything the intelligence officer knew pittsburgh was a wreck that would hurt the united states but the army that should have conquered it was gone every man a casualty or a prisoner that would hurt the confederate states even more the latest dirgetempo march ended an announcer came on the air courage selfdenial modesty and the willingness to make every sacrifice are the highest virtues of the confederate soldier he said it was not the lust for conquest which caused the confederacy to take up arms this war was forced upon us by the destructive aims of our enemies well what else could the man say if he came right out and announced that jake featherston wanted to go to war long before he became president of the csa it wouldnt look good potter knew perfectly well that it was true he also knew that what was true and what made good propaganda often had not even a nodding acquaintance with each other our soldiers are completely imbued with the importance and the value of the ideas now championed by the freedom party the announcer said for better and for worse potter knew how true that was the announcer went on the confederate soldier is convinced of them to the very depths of his innermost being and that is why the confederate armed forces form an invincible bloc having as its spiritual foundation the sublime ethics of a soldierly tradition it is moreover inspired by belief in its high mission of protecting the confederate states against the longtime enemy to the north the enemy who would gladly deny our great nation its very right to exist again he wasnt wrong this was the fourth war between the usa and the csa in the past eighty years but if the confederates were so bloody invincible what went wrong in pennsylvania potter a confirmed cynic would think of something like that would the average confederate who was listening maybe not we see the most magnificent example of this in the sacrifice of the troops fighting at pittsburgh the announcer went on that let our armies farther west build up new dams to hold back the raging yankee torrent and continue to preserve the confederacy from the annihilating rule of the usa cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements surrounded by implacable foes they fought on with bayonets and entrenching tools after their ammunition was exhausted truly their courage and devotion will live forever the music swelled once more yet another sorrowful tune potter sighed putting a good face on disaster was always hard he wondered why he kept listening knowing what the rest of the country was going through was useful that had something to do with it the rest was akin to picking at a scab the pain held a perverse attraction he started a little when the telephone rang turning down the music he picked up the handset potter here if anybody needed to know what he did that person had got hold of him by mistake hello potter there the voice on the other end of the line was a harsh rasp every confederate citizen recognized at once i need you to be potter here soon as you can get on over yes mr president on my way potter hung up he turned off the wireless when jake featherston said he wanted to see you as soon as you could come you needed to get to the gray house in a hurry potter went upstairs the door by which he came out on the ground floor had something innocuous painted on the frostedglass window you would never open it unless you already knew where it led workmen labored to repair bomb damage the damnyankees hit the war department as often as they could more and more of the business here went on undergroundhow far underground even potter wasnt sure any more the men who bossed the work parties were whites too old or too crippled to help the war effort some of the men in the crews were colored though a lot of negroes had already been removed from richmond more workmen were mexicans up from francisco joses ramshackle empire to find betterpaying work in the csa some offices on the ground floor were still usable the officers and clerks who worked in them took a sour pride in staying at those battered desks as long as they could several men waved to potter as he walked past he nodded in return all the motorcars outside the war department were ordinary civilian models every so often us fighters streaked low over richmond in broad daylight shooting up whatever they could no point giving them any special targets as if at a cab stand potter got into the forwardmost auto the gray house he told the driver yes sir the soldier started the engine and put the birmingham in gear more work crews repaired streets and gas lines and water mains and electric lines and telephone wires andanything else that could be damaged when bombs fell on it or near it hardly any glass windows faced the world these days plywood and cardboard covered even the ones the damnyankees hadnt blown to smithereens again mexicans did a lot of the work negroes would have handled before the confederate states would be a different country when the war was through whites had anxiously watched blacks for much too long well soon thered be far fewer blacks to need watching potter had long opposed the freedom party but he didnt mind its taking a shot at the negro problem he didnt know any white man who did as hed expected the driver had to detour several times before he got to the presidential mansion craters made some streets impassable one block had sawhorses and warning signs all around danger unexploded bomb the signs shouted in big red letters maybe the bomb was a dud maybe a time fuse ticked inside it either way potter didnt envy the men who worked to get the ordnance out of there they were skilled technicians no matter how skilled they were their average life expectancy was measured in weeks the snouts of sandbagged antiaircraft guns poked up from the gray house grounds not much of the building was left above ground the damnyankees kept doing their best to level it they wanted jake featherston dead not only because losing him would take the wind out of the confederacys sails but also because confederate bombs had killed us president al smith here you are sir the driver pulled to a stop in front of the rubble pile thanks clarence potter got out of the birmingham with a clash of gears it rolled away guards waited in among the wreckage lets see your papers sir one of them said no one got anywhere in the csa without proper papers these days potter displayed his once the guards were satisfied about who he was one of them used a telephone that done he nodded to his pal together they opened a heavy steel trap door potter went down the stairs they bent several times to foil blast that might penetrate the door above in due course he got to another door this one even thicker he pressed the button next to it it swung open from the inside more guards nodded to him come with us sir one of them said i know the drill potter said they ignored him hed figured they would all of what went on at the gray house went on underground these days people who spent a lot of time down there were as pale and pasty aspeople who spent a lot of time underground at the war department potter looked at the backs of his own hands and at the veins clearly visible there he wasnt a vampire to whom the sun was death but he often behaved as if he were lulu jake featherstons longtime secretary nodded to him hell be with you in a moment general he said thank you maam potter answered you treated lulu with respect or you were sorry no one ever talked about the authority secretaries and other such people had which didnt make it any less real the moment stretched to about five minutes featherston wasnt in the habit of making people cool their heels just to be sitting something had to be going on and something was nathan bedford forrest iii the head of the confederate general staff came out of the presidents office he didnt look happy he looked even less happy when he saw potter in the waiting room potter wasnt happy to see him either they werent quite conspirators if it looked as if jake featherston was dragging the csa down to ruin someone would have to try to dispose of him if that worked someone would have to try to run the country afterwards as far as potter could see nathan bedford forrest iii made far and away the best candidate forrest wanted the job as much as he wanted another head that didnt mean he wouldnt try to do ithe had a strong sense of duty it meant he hoped everything would turn out all right even though he was the one whod first wondered whether jake featherston was going round the bend did featherston know about those wary discussions if he did would nathan bedford forrest iii still be free potter didnt think so you can go in now general lulu said thank you very much potter said from most confederates that would have been thank you kindly hed never lost the more than halfyankee way of speaking he picked up to fit in while he was at yale hello potter jake featherston said the president of the csa was in his early fifties tall and rawboned his closecropped brown hair going gray his eyes had dark pouches under them that hadnt been there a few years before they still blazed though if ruthless determination could pull the csa through featherston was the man to give it whats up sir potter asked hoping it had nothing to do with nathan bedford forrest iii i need you to light a fire under professor fitzbelmont i dont care if you promise him prime pussy or promise youll shoot his kids if he doesnt get his ass in gear but get him moving we really need that uranium bomb featherston said the confederate uranium program had got off to a slow start because the president didnt believe in it at first potter couldnt blame him for that who in his right mind would have believed it but when the confederates learned the united states were going after uranium explosives as hard as they could theyd had to follow suit if lighting a fire will do anything ill do it potter wasnt sure it would separating u from u was proving fiendishly hard and fiendishly expensive they could use more money and more men too whatever they need well give it to them featherston vowed if the damnyankees are ahead of us on this one were screwed if we beat em to the punch we win even pittsburgh wont matter at all its about that simple or will you tell me im wrong he glared a challenge at potter no sir potter meant it he might despise jake featherston the man but jake featherston the leader was dead right here major jonathan moss became a flier at the start of the great war because he thought it would prove a cleaner more chivalrous way of fighting than the mess on the ground and he was rightfor a while after a career as a lawyer in occupied canada he came back to flying not long before the newthe greaterwar broke out with his wife and daughter killed by a canuck bomber he threw himself into aviation as much to stay sane as for any other reason and he got shot down over virginia and spent a while languishing in the confederates andersonville pow camp if not for a tornado that flung barbed wire in all directions he would have been there yet now he was a foot soldier not because he wanted to be one but because he had no choice the negro guerrillas who found him would have killed him if he didnt join their band chickens and chunks of pork roasted over campfires in the pine woods of southwestern georgia the white man from whose farm theyd been taken didnt need to worry about his livestock any more neither did his family the usa and the csa followed the geneva convention when they fought each other the usa and the mormon rebels in utah played by the rules too the mormons were if anything more scrupulous than their us foes about keeping them between black guerrillas and confederates rules went out the window it was war to the knife smells goddamn good captain nick cantarella said the infantry officer much younger than moss had escaped from andersonville with him with his knowledge of how to fight on the ground cantarella had to be more valuable to the negroes than moss was be ready soon the black who led the guerrillas called himself spartacus he wasnt far from moss age hed fought for the csa in the great war and reminded moss of a career noncom in the us army jake featherston didnt want any negroes fighting on his side spartacus used everything hed learned fighting for the confederacy to fight against it now after moss got outside of some hot greasy pork and a tin cup of chicorylaced coffee he asked what do you aim to do next he had no trouble treating spartacus as his co and it wasnt just because the black man could kill him with a word like most whites in the usa moss hadnt had much to do with negroes there werent many in the united states and most whites were happy to keep it that way hed always thought of negroes as inferior he hadnt had much reason to think otherwise but spartacus would have commanded respect as a man if he were green with blue polka dots he tossed a chicken bone back into the fire well i was thinkin o comin down on plains again his voice was a smooth rich baritone moss stared the band had raided the small town the autumn before you dont think theyll be laying for us reckon not when spartacus grinned his teeth gleamed white in his dark face reckon the ofays dont think even a niggerd be dumb enough to come back so soon nick cantarella laughed out loud i like it fuck me if i dont hed grown up in new york city and sounded like it sometimes he and spartacus had trouble understanding each other for that matter sometimes moss who was from chicago had trouble understanding cantarella he rarely did with spartacus the negro might drawl and slur but at least he spoke slowly cantarellas harsh consonants and clotted vowels came at machinegun speed got me a couple people lookin the place over spartacus said dont seem like nobody doin nothin special there they reckon they done got hit once so theys immune now he grinned again it dont work dat way all right by me moss said but the raid didnt come off spartacus didnt want to move till he had everything just the way he wanted it from a regular army commander moss might have thought that too cautious but regular army commanders had men to spare and regularly proved it spartacus didnt he needed to be careful not to walk into a trap while he was waiting and getting ready the situation changed two companies of soldiers who wore yellowish khaki uniforms and helmets of unfamiliar shape came into the area mexicans nick cantarella said in disgust goddamn beaneating greasers wonder how the hell featherston pried em outa francisco jose screw that spartacus didnt let the mexican soldiers faze him what i wonder is can them fuckers fight when the us army broke through in pennsylvania last fall it broke through against the mexicans cantarella said uhhuh but yall got barrels an airplanes an all that good shit spartacus was nobodys fool all we got is us an we aint got so many of us he frowned in concentration make them come at us mebbe an see how good they is always better to meet them where you want to not where they want to moss said make sense spartacus agreed now we got to cipher out how them greasers can reckon they is doin what they wants when they is really doin jus what we aims to have em do arranging to have a letter intercepted in plains turned out to be the easiest thing in the world moss only worry was that the mexicans would decide it was too obviously a fraud it told a fictitious comrade in the town where spartacus band would be and what they planned to do for the next four days one of the blacks sneaked into plains at night and dropped the envelope that held the letter not far from the little hotel where francisco joses soldiers were garrisoned another black one who lived in town brought word the envelope had been found as spartacus hoped the mexicans moved down the road from plains toward preston the next town farther west they marched in good order with scouts well forward and with men out to either side to make sure they didnt get hit from the flank but the scouts saw nothing the guerrillas didnt want them to and the flank guards werent out far enough spartacus approached field fortifications with the eye of a man whod seen plenty of trench warfare he had eight or ten riflemen dug in at the top of a tiny swell of ground jonathan moss was one of them he clutched his tredegar with sweaty palms and hoped none of the blacks in the trench with him noticed how nervous he was the one thing he felt he could tell them was dont open up too soon we want to make the mexicans bunch up in front of us remember the negroes nodded some of them still automatically acted deferential toward whites when they werent trying to kill them that was a funny business moss had only a few minutes to wonder about it before the mexicans scouts came into sight their pale khaki might make good camouflage in northern mexico but it didnt do so well against the green woods and red dirt of georgia the guerrillas waited till the scouts got close then shot all three of them down moss thought he hit one of them and also thought they went down before they were sure where the killing fire came from those gunshots brought the rest of the mexicans at a trot they came in loose order so nobody in front of them could pick off too many men at once they would soon have overwhelmed the negroes in that trenchif those were the only men spartacus had but their commanding officer did what the guerrilla leader hoped he would in concentrating on what lay ahead he forgot all about what might might be waiting off to the flank and he paid for it what waited off to the flank was an artfully concealed machine gun the negroes didnt take it with them everywhere they went it was heavy and clumsy to move but when they could set it up ahead of time when they could set it up ahead of time it was the concentrated essence of infantry the mexicans hurried forward to deal with the roadblock in front of them the machinegun crew couldnt have had a better target for enfilading fire if theyd set up the enemy themselves when the machine gun started stuttering the mexicans toppled like tenpins they were close enough to let moss hear their cries of fear and dismay and agony some of them tried to charge the machinegun position that was brave but it didnt work the gun itself might have held them at bay in case it didnt other blacks with rifles were there to help protect it realizing theyd run into a trap helped break the mexicans when they took heavy casualties without taking the machine gun they fled east back toward plains some of them threw away their weapons to run faster the guerrillas galled them with gunfire till they got out of range after the negroes emerged from cover they methodically finished off the wounded mexicans some of the guerrillas carried shotguns or smallcaliber hunting rifles they replaced them with boltaction tredegars taken from francisco joses men a handful of the mexicans carried submachine guns those also went into the blacks arsenal none of the dead men had the automatic rifles that gave confederate soldiers so much firepower moss wasnt much surprised the confederates didnt have enough of those potent weapons for all their own frontline troops nick cantarella went up to spartacus who was pulling clips of ammunition from the equipment pouches on a dead mans belt we better haul ass outa here and i mean now the us officer said those greasersll be back either by themselves or with the local freedom party stalwarts aint gonna make the same trick work twice not here you dont reckon so the guerrilla leader didnt sound convinced them mexicans aint smart an the ofays who yell freedom all the goddamn time theys dumber quickest way to end up dead is to think the guy youre fighting is a damn fool cantarella said second quickest way is to get greedy you try both at once youre askin for it you hear what im sayin spartacus looked at him jonathan moss thought another quick way to end up dead was by pushing the negro too far spartacus didnt take kindly to listening to whites but cantarella had the certainty that went with knowing what he was doing he wasnt trying to show spartacus up just to give good advice and he wasnt much inclined to back down himself muttering to himself spartacus looked along the road toward plains reckon mebbe yous right he said unwillingly we done stuck em pretty good an thatll have to do he raised his voice to a shout lets git time to move out the negroes and their white advisers streamed away from the ambush moss didnt see how spartacus could have wanted much more he wondered if the mexicans would push hard after the guerrillas again or if one introduction like this would show them that wasnt a good idea when he asked nick cantarella the infantry officer only shrugged have to find out he said pretty plain they never saw combat before whether they cant stand up to it or whether they figure theyve got something to prove nowwell well see before long i figure guerrillas did well moss remarked yeah cantarella looked around then spoke in a low voice wouldntve thought the spooks had it in em but if your ass is on the line i guess you do what you gotta do no matter who you are we just did moss said nick cantarella blinked then nodded scipio was almost too far gone to notice when the train stopped the negro and his wife and daughter were scooped up in augusta georgia a week earlierhe thought it was a week but he could have been off by a day or two either way along with so many others from the terryaugustas colored districtthey were herded into a boxcar and the door locked from the outside it was too crowded in there to sit down let alone to lie down scipio wasnt off his feet for a minute in all that time however long it was he couldnt make it to the honey buckets that were the only sanitary facilities so he fouled himself when he couldnt hold it any more he wasnt the only onefar from it he got a couple of sips from a dipper of water that went through the miserable throng but nothing more if the boxcar held any food he never saw it by the time the train finally got wherever it was going his nose told him the car held dead bodies had they made this journey in high summer everyone would have died he was as sure of that as he was of his own namesurer since hed gone by xerxes for many years scipio was still a wanted man in south carolina for his role in the red negro uprisings during the great war but it was february so heat and humidity didnt add themselves to starvation and overcrowding what a mercy scipio thought bathsheba he croaked through a dustdry throat antoinette he heard no answer from either of them maybe they were dead maybe they were just too dry to talk maybe they couldnt hear his huskfilled voice or maybe the noise other people were making covered their replies his ears werent what they had been once upon a time he was getting close to seventy hed been born a slave back in the days before the confederate states reluctantly manumitted their negroes there was a bitter joke technically free blacks didnt have a prayer of equality with whites even in the best of times here in the worst of timesscipio wasnt worried about seeing another birthday now he wondered if he would see another day period then what seemed like a miracle happened the door to the boxcar opened a cold biting wind blew in fresh air hit scipio almost as hard as a slug of whiskey would have his eyes opened very wide he thought his heart beat a little faster out white mens voices harsh as ravens croaks roared out the word come on out o there you goddamn shitty niggers form two lines men on the left women and pickaninnies on the right move move move a few people stumbled out of the boxcar a few corpses fell out that eased the pressure that had held scipio upright for so long he started to sag to the planking of the floor if he did though he didnt think hed be able to get up again and the way these ofaysguards he could see they were guardswere screaming at people to come out he could guess what would happen to a man who couldnt rise he wanted to live he wondered why after what hed gone through dying might have come as a relief but he stumbled forward and awkwardly got down from the boxcar men on the left women and pickaninnies on the right the guards yelled again then one of them smacked a black man with a club he pulled from his belt you dumb fucking coon dont you know which ones your right and which ones your left get your lazy ass over where you belong blood pouring down his face the negro staggered into the proper line somebody touched scipios hand there stood bathsheba with antoinette beside her they looked like hell or maybe a little worse scipio tried not to think about what he looked like himself it didnt matter nothing mattered except that they were all alive we gots to get in our line bathsheba said in a voice like ashes the good lord keep you safe darlin we see you when we can his wife had always been a churchgoing woman shed got scipio to go with her a good many times they were captured in church in fact education and marxism had corroded scipios faith if they hadntwell the trip hed just finished would have turned st thomas aquinas into an atheist somehow though it hadnt shaken bathsheba not that way you move old man the mexicanlooking guard who gave the order had three stripes on the left sleeve of his gray uniform tunic you move or you be sorry he didnt sound particularly mean he just sounded like a man doing his joband a man who would do it whatever that took was it better that he didnt seem to enjoy tormenting his captives or did that make it worse the guard sergeant no in a gray uniform hed have some kind of silly freedom party rank waited to see if scipio would obey or maybe if he could obey his wife and daughter had already gone off to their line nothing held him here except exhaustion thirst and starvation i goin he said and discovered his feet still worked after all the mexican guard nodded and went to prod another sufferer into moving standing in line wasnt easy several men begged for water the guards ignored them one of the negroes fell over a man in a gray uniform kicked him when the negro didnt respond the guard peeled back his eyelid then felt for a pulse the white straightened wiping his hand on his thigh son of a bitch is dead as belt leather he said gotta haul his worthless carcass outa here a skinny black man in ragged shirt and dungarees out at the knee dragged the corpse away by the feet a crew of similar wraiths were pulling bodies out of the train cars once one of them called this here fella aint dead a guard stood over the live negro and fired a burst from his submachine gun sandbagging fucker is now he said the man whod announced the survival hauled away the body as if such things happened whenever a train came in they probably did jesus god you are the smelliest most disgusting bunch of niggers i ever seen a guard officer shouted what else could we be scipio thought he knew how filthy he was he knew he didnt have any choice about it either none of the lurching unfortunates in the line had any choice the officer went on strip naked and well hose you down get the worst shit off you what about our clothes somebody asked clean clothes inside the officer said get out of them duds move it despite the cold wind scipio was glad to shed the suit in which hed gone to church highpressure hoses played over the black men he feebly tried to wash and drink at the same time he got a couple of swallows of water and he got rid of some of his own filth when he stood there naked and dripping the north wind really did cut like a knife the blacks whod hauled away corpses took charge of the discarded clothes too some of the men whose clothes they were pulled long faces maybe theyd managed to hang on to money or valuables since scipio hadnt he was just as well pleased to be rid of his bins of shirts and trousers and drawers and shoes and socks waited for the black men as scipio found clothes that more or less fit he wondered whod worn them before and what had happened to him this time his shiver had nothing to do with that biting wind better not to know maybe losing his clothes also lost scipio his passbook in a way that was a relief without it he could claim to be anyone under the sun in another way though it was as ominous as those bins of clothing a negro couldnt exist in the csa without a passbook if the inmates of this camp didnt need passbooksif they didnt wasnt that an argument they didnt exist any more line up in rows of ten a guard shouted rows of ten yall hear we got to get you coons counted soon as we do that we can get your asses into barracks food suh water several men called the desperate question at the same time yall can get water once youre counted the guard answered food comes at regular time tonight now line up goddammit cant do anything till we count you another man fell over dead waiting to be counted more ragged skinny negroes seemed to materialize out of thin air to drag off the body would the clothes he had on go back into the bin scipio would have bet on it he got assigned to barracks which differed from the halls on either side only by its number the wind blew right through the thin wallboard pails and cups told where the roof leaked when it rained bunks went up five and six high healthier younger stronger prisoners claimed the ones closest to the potbellied stove in the middle of the room scipio got a miserable bunk in the outer darkness near the wall the only good thing about it was that it was on the second level so he didnt have to climb very high a burlap bag did duty for a blanket another smaller one stuffed with sawdust made a pillow of sorts that was the extent of the bedclothes he staggered out and went looking for water he found lines snaking up to three faucets the lines were long he wondered if hed live till he got to the front of his he did and then drank and drank and drank that brought some small fragment of life back to him it also made him realize how hungry he was but he wouldnt starve to death right away while thirst had almost killed him he went back to his bunk lying down seemed a luxury after his time on the train he fell asleep or passed outwhich hardly mattered he would have slept through supperhe would have slept the clock aroundif somebody didnt shake him back to consciousness he wasnt sure the man did him a kindness he was almost as weary as he was hungry standing in line in someone elses clothes in shoes that didnt quite fit was a displeasure all its own what he got when they fed him was another displeasure grits and beans and greens all in all it wasnt enough to keep a fouryearold alive his pants felt a little tight he didnt think hed need to worry about that for long after supper came the evening roll call line up in rows of ten a guard yelled scipio wondered how often he would hear that command in the days to come more often than he wanted to he was sure of that the count went wrong for one thing thered been the influx of new prisoners for anotherthe scrawny negro standing next to scipio muttered these ofays so fuckin dumb they cant count to twentyone without playin with themselves in spite of everything scipio snorted thank you he whisperedhed already seen making noise during roll call could win you a beating fo what the other black man said aint nothin to thank nobody for not here is vitellius who you be the real vitellius if scipio remembered straight had been a fat man this fellow didnt live up to the name is xerxes scipio replied that was funny too in the wrong kind of way hed used xerxes for years fearing his own handle might get him sent to a camp well here he was what more could they do to him one way or another hed find out major general abner dowlings guns pounded lubbock texas confederate artillery in and behind the city sent highexplosive death northwest toward dowlings eleventh army back east the eleventh army wouldnt even have made a decent corps it had about a division and a halfs worth of men but the war out here in the wide open spaces ran on a shoestring as the last one had dowlings men outnumbered the confederates defending lubbock jake featherstons soldiers were fighting with everything they had though he couldnt push them out of lubbock and he couldnt flank them out either up till recently it hadnt mattered as long as he kept them too busy to send reinforcements east to help rescue their army in pittsburgh he was doing his job but now pittsburgh wouldnt fall to the csa now lubbock became valuable for its own sake or as valuable as a city of in the middle of nowhere could be dowlings headquarters lay in littlefield the last town northwest of lubbock he studied the map hed tried outflanking the confederates to the south maybe if he swung around to the north this time his adjutant stuck his head into the map room ive got some new aerial recon photos sir major angelo toricelli said toricelli was young and handsome and spry dowling was in his sixties built like a breakfront and wore a large unstylish gray mustache even when he was young he hadnt been spry hed played in the line at west point just before the turn of the century no he hadnt been spry but hed been tough several chins wobbled as he nodded to toricelli lets see em he said both sides here were short on airplanes too both sides here were short on everything under the sun as a matter of fact these are the deeppenetration photos sir toricelli said as he spread out the prints on top of the map they go all the way down to snyder and to thatthing outside it snyder lay southeast of lubbock it was a bigger town than littlefield but not a whole lot bigger normally dowling wouldnt have worried about it not where he was now it was too small and too far away snyder was too small yes thething was another story altogether it was called camp determinationso intelligence said anyhow and it was not small at all how many niggers have they got crammed in there dowling asked many many thousands thats the best intelligence is willing to do sir toricelli said dowling thought he put it an interesting way but didnt push him the younger officer went on theres a lot of incoming train traffic too if there is then this place must get fuller all the time right dowling said toricelli shook his head dowling raised an eyebrow not right no sir his adjutant pointed to another photo looks like the overflow goes here dowling studied the picture trucksthey looked like ordinary cs army trucksstood next to a long wide trench the scale they provided gave him some notion of just how long and wide the trench was it seemed to be full of bodies dowling couldnt gauge its depth but would have bet it wasnt shallow the photo also showed several similar trenches covered over with dirt the trenches went out of the picture on either side dowling couldnt tell how many filledin trenches it wasnt showing either they go there huh his stomach did a slow lurch how many corpses lay in those trenches how many more went into them every day any idea how they get from the camp to the graveyard how they get killed you mean toricelli asked yes dammit dowling usually despised the language of euphemism that filled military and bureaucratic life here though the enormity of what he saw made him unwilling to come out and say what he meant intelligence isnt quite sure of that his adjutant said it doesnt really matter does it it does to them dowling jerked a thumb at that photo with the trenches lord knows im no niggerlover major but theres a difference between not loving somebody and setting up a factory to turn out deaths like shells for a well yes sir major toricelli said what can we do about it though we arent even in lubbock and this snyder place is another eighty miles even if lubbock falls well be a long time getting there same with our artillery and what good would bombers do well just be killing spooks ourselves if we use em i know what im going to do dowling said im going to send these photos back to philadelphia and im going to ask for reinforcements now that pittsburghs ours again we ought to have some men to spare we need to advance on this front major we need it a lot more than we do some other places yes sir i think youre right toricelli said but will they listen to you back east they see things funny on the other side of the mississippi we found out about that when we were trying to hold the lid down on the mormons didnt we just dowling said tell you whatlets light a fire under the war departments tail can you get another set of those prints made im sure i can sir bully every once in a while dowling still came out with slang whose best days lay back before the great war toricelli loyally pretended not to notice dowling went on send the second set of prints to congresswoman blackford shes been up in arms about how the confederates are treating their niggers ever since jake featherston took over if she starts squawking were likelier to get those troops thatsdownright byzantine sir major toricellis voice held nothing but admiration dowling resolved to look up the word to see whether it carried praise or blame he nodded to his adjutant get me those extra prints ill draft the letter to the general staff well want to encrypt that before we send it oh yes toricelli said when you were fighting a war with somebody who spoke the same language you did you had to be extra careful about what you said openly the only good news there was that the enemy had to be as careful as you were sometimes he slipped and you could make him pay sometimes he pretended to slip and you could outsmart yourself in a hurry if you werent careful do that yourself if youd be so kind major dowling said yes sir ill take care of it dowlings adjutant didnt even blink this was a hell of a war all kinds of ways when you couldnt be a hundred percent sure of the men in the cryptography sectionyou did without them whenever you could or whenever you had something really important rolling a sheet of paper into his underwood upright dowling banged away at it machinegun style with his forefingers the machine was at least twenty years old and had an action stiff as a spavined mules fancy typists used all ten fingers dowling knew thatknew and didnt care being able to type at all put him ahead of most us generals he tried to imagine george custer pounding on a typewriter the man under whom hed served as adjutant during the great war and for some years afterwards would have counted himself progressive for using a steel pen instead of a quill dowling wondered how many letters hed typed up for custer over the years a whole great pile of them anyhow the old tartar had had a legible hand dowling who could fault him for plenty of other things couldnt deny that of course custer had spent more than sixty years in the army he was one of the longestserving soldiers if not the longestserving in the history of the united states back when his career started you had to be able to write with tolerable neatness if you couldnt no one would be able to make out what you were saying dowling read through his draft pencorrected a typo that had escaped him while the paper was on the platen and took it to major toricelli get this off to philadelphia as fast as you can he said ill tend to it right away toricelli had already taken the code book out of the small safe that accompanied eleventh army as it advancedand at need as it fell back too good thanks now i need to get a letter ready for those photos thatll go to flora blackford dowling had met her before in that shed questioned him when he testified before the joint committee on the conduct of the war he hadnt appreciated her prodding then if he could get her to prod in a way that did him some good though that was a different story he wagged a finger at toricelli make sure we get that other set of prints pronto too yes sir now his adjutant sounded resigned dowling knew he was guilty of nagging how often had he sounded like that when custer gave him the same order for the fourth time at least hesometimesnoticed when he repeated himself he wrote the letter signed it and gave it to major toricelli the younger officer who was deep in fiveletter code groups nodded abstractedly when dowling walked out of the house hed commandeered for a headquarters the sentries in front of the porch stiffened to attention as you were dowling said the sentries had foxholes into which they could dive in case cs artillery reached littlefield or enemy bombers came overhead a thick barbedwire perimeter isolated headquarters from the rest of the small west texas town the wire was far enough from the house to keep an auto bomb from doing too much damage if one blew up outside it soldiers and matrons frisked people entering the perimeter to make sure none of them carried explosives dowling didnt think he was important enough to make much of a target for a people bomb but he didnt take chances either headquarters occupied one of the few undamaged houses in littlefield the confederates had made a stand here they fought wherever they could find an advantageous position they didnt like retreating but this country was so wide they didnt have enough men to hold on to all of it hed flanked them out here he wasnt having so much luck with that around lubbock the stars and stripes floated above the house littlefield had been in the us state of houston till the confederacy won the plebiscite here a little more than two years earlier now it was back in us hands and the locals liked that no better than they had before dowling cordially despised the locals too he wished he could put up photographs of the murder camp and the mass graves outside snyderput em up all over town he wished he could parade everybody in littlefield past those graves let people see what thousands of bodies looked like let them find out what thousands of bodies smelled like you sons of bitches this is what you bought when you went around yelling freedom all the goddamn time how do you like it now what really scared him was they were liable to like it just fine he could easily imagine them looking down at all those contorted corpses and saying well so what you lousy damnyankee theyre only niggers for cryin out loud he scowled out at littlefield wishing his imagination didnt work quite so well all at once he wanted nothing more than to wipe the town and everybody in it off the face of the earth major jerry dover knew how to give men orders hed commanded at about the platoon level during the years between the wars bossing the cooks and waiters and busboys at the huntsmans lodge in augusta georgia gave him most of the experience he needed to put on the uniform and tell people in the confederate quartermaster corps what to do being white and the boss had given him authority over the staff at the restaurant military law made a good enough substitute in the field dover hadnt been out there long before one of his subordinates exclaimed jesus sir you work us just like a bunch of niggers good dover answered which made the grumbling corporal goggle and gape good goddammit dover repeated he was a foxyfeatured man wiry and stronger than he looked with graying sandy hair and mustache weve all got to work like niggers if were going to whip those bastards on the other side he drove himself at least as hard as he drove anybody under him he left a trail of chainsmoked raleigh butts and empty coffee cups behind him he tried to be everywhere at once making sure all sorts of supplies got to the men at the front when they were supposed to the men who worked under him didnt need long to figure that out they swore at him as they shivered in the snow in southern ohio but his kitchen staff had sworn at him the same way while they sweltered over their stoves the soldiers might not love him but they respected him his superiors didnt know what to make of him most of them were regulars men whod stayed in butternut all through the lean times before jake featherston started building up the cs army again a colonel named travis ww oliphanthe got very offended if you left the ww out of any correspondence addressed to him no matter how trivialsaid you know major youll just kill yourself if you try to run through every brick wall you see instead of going around some of them yes sir dover ground a cigarette out under the heel of his left boot boot marching officers field size c he lit another one and sucked in smoke without a cloud of smoke around him he hardly felt real if youll excuse me sir those damned idiots south of the ohio finally got us about half as many of the shells weve been screaming for as we really need gotta move em up to the people who shoot em out the guns travis ww oliphant scratched his head he looked like a british cavalry colonel or what jerry dover imagined a british cavalry colonel would look like see here dover are you trying to mock me he said mock you no sir dover scratched his head too why would you say that im just trying to do my job youre not a regular the senior officer said no sir dover agreed so what i can still see what needs doing i can still get people to do it or else do it myself there are people in this unit who think youre trying to show them up colonel oliphant said dover scratched his head again he blew out another stream of smoke sir dont the yankees give us enough trouble so we havent got time to play stupid games with ourselves i work hard i want everybody else to work hard too we wont get the job done if we wonder about each otherthats for sure oliphant said weve all got to pull together what am i supposed to do when i see some people who wont pull dover asked you know some wont as well as i do sir plenty of men in the quartermaster corps who like it here because theyre in the army so nobody can complain about that but they arent what youd call likely to see a damnyankee with a piece in his hand and blood in his eye youre in the quartermaster corps colonel oliphant pointed out so are you sir dover stamped out the latest cigarette and lit a replacement you want to send me up to a line battalion go right ahead i happen to think i help the country more where im at on account of i really know what the fuck im doing here but if you want to ship me out go on and do it i was in the line last time around reckon i can do it again where were yousir travis ww oliphant didnt answer right away he turned red which told dover everything he needed to know had oliphant ever fired a rifle or even an officers pistol in anger dover didnt believe it not even for a minute you are insubordinate major oliphant said at last about time somebody around here was wouldnt you say dover saluted and walked away if the high and mighty colonel wanted to do something about it he was welcome to try jerry dover laughed what was the worst oliphant could do get him courtmartialed maybe theyd drum him out of the army in which case hed go back to the restaurant business in augusta maybe theyd throw him in a military prison where hed be housed and fed and out of the war about the worst thing the goddamn stuffed shirt could do was leave him right where he was did oliphant have the brains to understand that did the colonel know his ass from his end zone dover only shrugged he didnt really care oliphant would do whatever he did in the meantime dover would do what he had to do as soon as he stepped out of the butternut tent a cold breeze from the northwest started trying to freeze his pointed nose off his face fuck he muttered he hadnt been up in ohio long but the weather was really and truly appalling augusta got a cold snap like this maybe once in five years ohio could get them any time from november to march by what hed seen he wondered why the hell the csa wanted to overrun country like this in the first place not all the trucks into which cursing confederates were loading crates of shells had started life down in birmingham some were captured us machines with slightly blunter lines slightly stronger engines and suspensions that would shake a mans kidneys right out of him on a rough road they had butternut paint slapped on over the original greengray they had butternut paint slapped on their canvas canopies too rough use and rough weather were making it peel off dover hoped that wouldnt get some luckless driver shot by somebody on his own side the drivers were safe if those trucks didnt get moving dover rounded on a quartermaster sergeant whats the slowdown about he demanded sir we were suppose to get a couple dozen military prisoners to help us load and they aint showed up the sergeant said stolidly were doin what we can with what we got aint like the last warno nigger labor gangs up here jerry dover muttered discontentedly hed never been a big freedom party man he thought jake featherston was more a blowhard than anything else without negroes the huntsmans lodge either couldnt have operated at all or would have had to charge three times as much negroes had done a lot for the army in the great war not this time around featherston didnt trust themand hed given them abundant good reason not to trust him before saying anything dover eyed the quartermaster sergeants hands they were muddy and battered with a couple of torn fingernails hed been humping crates just like everybody else nobody could complain about effort all right sergeant do the best you can ill track those damn convicts for you thank you sir the noncom said the convicts wouldnt work the way negroes would have in the last war theyd know they were doing nigger work and theyd do it badly just to remind people they werent niggers and the work was beneath their dignity that they might get their countrymen killed because they worked badly wouldnt bother them that they might get themselves killed wouldnt bother them either showing they were good and proper white men counted for more were dover a convict he knew he would act the same way no less than the men whod fallen foul of military justice he was a confederate white man hed probably had more experience with negroes than any white since the days of overseers that had nothing to do with the price of beer there were some things a confederate white man wasnt supposed to do of course one of the things confederate white men werent supposed to do was lose a war to the usa if not losing meant they had to do some other things they wouldnt normally then it did that was all so dover thought anyhow some of his countrymen seemed to prefer death to dirtying their hands shells burst a few hundred yards away dover didnt flinch didnt duck didnt dive for cover theyd have to come a lot closer than that before he started flabbling back in the last war hed learned to gauge how dangerous incoming artillery was the knack came back in a hurry this time around most of the older men working with these crates had it some of the younger ones didnt what did worry dover was that the damnyankees guns were close enough to strike what should have been the confederates safe rear in ohio that showed how badly things had gone wrong with so many men dead or captured in and around pittsburgh the defenses farther west were crumbling one us thrust was coming west from pennsylvania and eastern ohio the other southeast from northern indiana and northwestern ohio if they met they would enfold even more irreplaceable confederate troops in a pocket dover went over to the field telephone station the state of the art there had improved a lot since the great war then people used morse more often than they shouted into field telephones just to make sure their message got through now you knew the guy on the other end of the line would hear you whether he felt like listening to you might be a different story for years dover had battled people who tried to palm off lowerquality meat and seafood and vegetables on him and to give him what he needed later than he needed it now he turned all his suavity and charm on the confederate military policemen who hadnt delivered the promised convicts on time this heres major dover in the quartermaster corps south of columbus he rasped where the hell are they you lazy sons of bitches yall tryin to lose the war for us howre we supposed to get the shit to the front if you hold out on uswhat do you mean i cant talk to you that way im doin it aint i an if those convicts dont show up in the next hour ill sic my colonel on you and well see how you like that he slammed down the phone without giving the mp he was talking to the chance to answer backalways a favorite ploy he knew travis ww oliphant was useless in these turf battles he knew it but the mp didnt and the unhappy fellow evidently didnt care to take chances with an angry senior officer the convicts arrived less than half an hour later about fucking time dover snarled at the driver who brought them you should have got em here when you said you would and saved everybody the aggravation sir i dont have nothin to do with that the driver said they load the truck they tell me where to go an how to git there an i do it dover wanted to tell him where to go and how to get there too he feared hed be wasting his breath instead he glowered at the convicts you are going to work like mad sons of bitches or else or else what one of them said scornfully or else i will personally shoot your worthless ass off and ill laugh while i do it too dover replied you reckon im funnin with you you go ahead and try me he waited the convicts worked hed expected nothing else sergeant michael pound had been in the us army a long time hed spent a lot of that time getting barrels to do what he needed them to do he wasnt just one of the better gunners who wore greengray coveralls though he was that he was also a damn good jackleg mechanic a lot of barrel men were the more repairs you could make yourself the less time you had to spend in the motor pool the less time you were out of action the more trouble you could give the confederates distributor cap i bet he said when the mechanical monster wouldnt start up one rainy morning east of columbus ohio damn thing gets wet inside too easy its a design flawit really is can you fix it asked second lieutenant don griffiths the barrel commander he was perhaps half pounds age a puppy like most second lieutenants unlike a lot of shavetails he had a fair notion of what he was doing he also didnt seem to think asking questions threatened his manhood yes sir along with a pound carried a formidable set of tools on his belt and in his pockets he had the engine louvers off in nothing flat and got the distributor cap off the engine almost as fast one glance inside made him nod condensation sure as hell the loader cecil bergman held a shelter half over his hands while he worked the rain would only make things worse what can you do about it griffiths asked a dry rag even better than that sir pound said he was stocky and wideshoulderedbuilt like a brick really his brown hair had begun to go gray and to retreat at the temples his eyes were pale in a broad face more scots than english marksmans eyes he pulled out a small bottle half full of clear liquid absolute alcohol he explained ill rub a little where itll do the most good it evaporates like anything and itll take the moisture with it he suited action to words the distributor cap went back on so did the louvers that protected the engine from smallarms fire while letting its heat escape pound scrambled down from the engine compartment fire it up bergman yelled to the driver there was a cough a bang and then the flatulent roar of a barrel engine coming to life nicely done sergeant griffiths said thank you sir pound clambered up to the turret and opened his hatch he paused before climbing in and sitting down behind the gun shall we get on with it i hope so anyway griffiths answered if this rain starts thawing out the ground though were liable to bog down pound didnt think that likely it was a little above freezing but only a little he guessed the rain would turn to sleet or snow before long but he didnt want to argue with griffithswhich considering how firmly armored in his own competence he was was no small compliment to the young officer they rattled west in company with six or eight more barrels and several squads of foot soldiers only two of the barrels were the old models with an inchandahalf gun the improved machines of which pounds was one featured an upgunned uparmored turret and a more powerful engine to handle the extra weight their inch cannon still werent a match for the threeinchers new confederate barrels carried but they were the biggest guns the turret ring in the chassis would allow and they were good enough to give the us machines a fighting chance against the best the enemy could throw at them after pittsburgh moving so fast seems strange griffiths said yes sir pound nodded in pittsburgh theyd measured progress in blocks per day sometimes houses per day not miles per hour that was a fight of stalks and ambushes and strongpoints beaten down one by one now they were out in the open again rolling forward only a crust here pound said once we break it they havent got so much behind it as if to give him the lie a confederate machine gun opened up ahead of them even through the turret pound had no trouble telling it from a us weapon it fired much faster with a noise like ripping canvas the confederates with fewer men than the usa threw bullets around with reckless abandon can you see where thats coming from sir he asked lieutenant griffiths griffiths peered through the periscopes built into the commanders cupola he shook his head afraid not sergeant he answered want me to stick my head out and have a look he didnt lack for nerve the barrel was buttoned up tight now you could see more by opening the hatch and looking around but you also ran a formidable risk of getting shotespecially anywhere in the neighborhood of one of those formidable machine guns i dont think you need to do that sir pound said now that hed found a junior officer he could stand he didnt want the youngster putting his life on the line for no good reason sometimes you had to pound understood as much was this one of those times he didnt think so but griffiths said maybe id better that gunll chew hell out of our infantry he flipped up the hatch and stood up so he could look around head and shoulders out of the cupola along with a flood of cold air his voice floated down to pound i dont like staying behind armor when the foot soldiers are out there naked michael pound made an exasperated noise down deep in his throat yes a crewman in a barrel had facehardened steel between himself and the enemys attentions an infantryman had nothing but his helmet which wouldnt even keep out smallarms fire on the other hand nobody used antibarrel cannon or antibarrel mines or featherston fizzes to try to knock out individual foot soldiers lieutenant griffiths wasnt thinking about that there it isabout one oclock griffiths said do you see it now sergeant as pound traversed the turret he looked through the gunsight sure enough there was the malignantly flashing machinegun muzzle yes sir he said and then to the loader he he bergman loaded a whitetipped highexplosive round into the breech the gun roared the noise was tolerable inside the turret to lieutenant griffiths out there in the open it must have been cataclysmic soldiers joked about artillerymans ear but they were kidding on the square when the machine gun kept firing pound swore a inch he shell just didnt carry a big enough bursting charge to be very effective hed seen that in pittsburgh and he was seeing it again in among the trees here give me another round he told cecil bergman you got it sarge the loader slammed the shell home an instant before pound fired don griffiths groaned pound didnt let himself pay attention till the second he round was on the way he saw the confederate machine gun fly one way and a gunner or some of a gunner fly another but he had no time to exult griffiths was slumping down into the turret how bad is it sir pound asked swearing at himselfif hed knocked out the gun first try the lieutenant might not have got hit arm griffiths answered through clenched teeth he had to be biting down hard on a scream sure as hell his left sleeve was bloody and blood dripped from his hand down onto the shell casings on the fighting compartment floor can you wiggle your fingers pound asked griffiths tried but gasped and swore and shook his head hed had a bone shattered in there thenmaybe more than one pound took a morphine syrette from the wound pouch on his belt stuck it into griffiths thigh and pushed home the plunger then he said lets bandage you up he had to cut away the sleeve to get at the wound he dusted it with sulfa powder and packed it with gauze as soon as he could hed get griffiths out of the barrel and send him to the rear with some corpsmen youve got yourself command here whether you want it or not the lieutenant sounded eerily calm which meant the morphine was taking hold even if i did want it sir i wouldnt want it like this pound said which was true youll be back soon he hoped that was true he stuck his own head out of the cupola with the machine gun gone all he had to worry about were ordinary confederate infantrymen and maybe snipers in the trees he looked around sometimes luck was with you though he wished it would have shown up a little sooner but he did see a couple of corpsmen with red crosses on smocks and armbands and helmets he waved to them whats up one of them yelled before pound could answer a bullet cracked past he ducked he knew it was a useless reflex which didnt mean he could help himself he hoped it was a random round if it wasnt the medics would have two casualties to deal with unless of course i get killed outright he thought cheerily got a wounded officer forearmbroken bones he called after he straightened up all rightwell take care of him the corpsman said can you swing sideways so the barrel covers him while you get him out of the hatch pound liked that idea about as much as he liked a root canal expose the barrels thin side armor to whatever guns the goons in butternut had up ahead but the medics werent armored at all neither was lieutenant griffiths and hed gone and proved it sometimes you needed a root canal it was no fun but you had to go through with it this wouldnt be any fun either if they hustled though they ought to get away with it will do pound called to the medics he ducked down into the turret and told the driver to make a hard right and stop jesus you sure the protest came back through the speaking tube damn straight i wouldnt ask you if i wasnt pound answered come on step on it the lieutenants bleeding all over everything back here its not so bad now griffiths sounded as if he hadnt a care in the world the morphine must have hit him hard well good snorting the barrel turned the movement wasnt so sharp as it might have been try too tight a turn and you might throw a track in which case you wouldnt go anywhere for a while when pound was satisfied he yelled stop and the barrel did he undogged the side hatch and sketched a salute to don griffiths out you go sir you did good hope i see you again one day he meant it he wasnt the sort to waste compliments on people who didnt deserve them thank you sergeant awkwardly griffiths scrambled out of the barrel pound helped him leave the corpsmen took charge of him once he got through the hatch they eased him down to the ground and got him moving away from the front they were probably relieved to help somebody able to move on his own they didnt have to lug him in a stretcher after waiting till theyd gone some distance from the barrel pound clanged the hatch shut and dogged it he yelled into the speaking tube all right mirandasquare us up again you bet sarge the barrel jumped as the driver put the thicker steel of the glacis plate and the turret between the crew and the enemy peering through the periscopes in the commanders cupola pound saw the heaviest action off to his left he ordered the barrel over that way for now it was his ii clouds and rain and sleet shrouded the north atlantic a few hundred miles to the west of the josephus daniels lay newfoundland to the east of the destroyer escort probably lay trouble the british never stopped sending arms and men to newfoundland and to canada to give the rebellion against the usa a helping hand lieutenant sam carsten and the skippers of his fellow picket ships did everything they could to keep the limeys from getting through he halfheartedly swore at the weather it made enemy ships all that much harder to find the rain and sleet even interfered with the yranging gear the wireless waves bounced back from raindrops too a good operator could peer through the interference but it sure didnt make life any easier and the oldfashioned mark one eyeball had a very short range here he swore only halfheartedly because the weather suited his own needs very well he was a short step away from being an albino his skin was pink his eyes pale blue and his hair white gold it was even whiter these days than it had been when he was youngerhed spent almost thirtyfive years in the navy now summer in the tropics was a neverending misery for him summer in seattle was a misery for him and that took doing his executive officer was a young auburnhaired lieutenant named pat cooley if not for sam the exec might have been the the fairest man on the ship cooley had gone through annapolis while sam was a mustang who hadnt made ensign till some years after the great war cooley was a comer a hotshot hed have a ship of his own before long sam didnt want the exec promoted out from under him but he knew things worked that way as for himself when he walked into the recruiting office all those years ago he never dreamt he would wear two stripes on his sleeve hed just been looking for a way to escape walking behind the north end of a southbound mule for the rest of his life the josephus daniels pitched down into the trough between two waves seas on the north atlantic werent quite so fierce and mountainous as they had been earlier in the winter but they werent any fun either you all right mr cooley sam asked when the exec grabbed for something to steady himself yes sir just clumsy cooleys eyes were green as a cats just now he looked like a cat that had rolled off a bed and was trying to pretend it hadnt insides not turning inside out sam had rounded the horn more than once those were the only seas he knew that put the north atlantic to shame he hadnt been seasick he might sunburn in anything this side of a cloudburst but he had no trouble keeping his grub down pat cooley was a good sailor the north atlantic seemed intent on showing good sailors they werent as good as they thought here though the exec shook his head not giving me any trouble right this minute he said a precise mans cautious answer skipper that was a very young very junior lieutenant junior grade named thad walters the officer responsible for the care and feeding of the yranging gear he looked up from the green blips on his oscilloscope screens ive got something showing a ship sam asked even troubled by the weather the yranging set was more likely to pick up limeys trying to run the us gauntlet than lookouts were but the jg shook his head no sir its an airplane have we got a carrier in the neighborhood if we do nobody told me thats for damn sure sam answered nobodyd warned him a british carrier was operating in the neighborhood either that could be very bad news a beat slower than he might have he heard exactly what walters said wait a second an airplane yes sir yranging gear sees one speed two hundred bearing rangerange is twentyfive miles and closinghes heading our way just one though sam persisted not a bunch of them walters shook his head sure doesnt look like it the set could pick them out at that range all right carsten turned to the exec call the men to general quarters mr cooley if he finds us in this slop well have to try to shoot him down hed been attacked from the air before even back in the great war he didnt enjoy it not even a little bit general quarters aye aye sir cooley said klaxons hooted sailors started running like men possessed they dashed into the turrets that held the josephus daniels two inch guns and they manned all her twin mm antiaircraft guns and thecaliber machine guns that supplemented them the unknown airplane would get a warm reception anyhow as soon as sam heard the snarl of an airplane engine off in the distance he said evasive action mr cooley evasive actionaye aye sir cooley was a better shiphandler than sam was sam had never had his hands on a wheel till he took over the josephus daniels he was a lot better now than he had been then but the exec was better still all ahead full cooley called down to the engine room and the throb of the destroyer escorts own engines picked up cooley started zigzagging the ship across the ocean lurching now to port now to starboard at random times and angles but the josephus daniels was only a destroyer escort not a fullfledged destroyer she had a smaller crew a smaller hull and a smaller powerplant than a destroyer proper she couldnt come within several knots of a real destroyers speed one of these days that would hurt her sam felt it in his bones he hoped today wasnt the day the airplane with the bluewhitered british roundel broke through the clouds all guns open fire sam shouted they did the racket was impressive even the popguns that were the josephus daniels main armament could fire antiaircraft shells black puffs of smoke appeared around the british aircraft sam nodded to himself in more than a little satisfaction he was still no great shakes as a shiphandler no but gunnery aboard the josephus daniels was far better than it had been when he took over the ship hed been part of a fiveinch gun crew before becoming an officer he knew what was what there that airplane jinked and dodged like the destroyer escort though much faster it had a bomb slung under its belly it also had floats under the belly and each wing despite its maneuvers it bored in on the josephus daniels the bomb fell free the airplane raced away cursing pat cooley swung the ship hard to starboard with a roar and a great gout of water hurled into the sky the bomb burst about a hundred yards to port the airplane vanished into the clouds for all the shells the gunners threw at it sam didnt think theyd hit it he hoped no splinters from the bomb casing had sliced into his crew nice job pat he said thank you sir the exec answered every so often this looks like work doesnt it maybe a little carsten answered they smiled at each other both glad to be alive sam went on well we dont have to worry about a limey carrier anyway sir cooley said oh i guess you were kind of occupied sam chuckled under his breath son of a bitch was a floatplane a freighter could catapultlaunch it let it scout around and then haul it out of the drink with a crane damn my hats off to the pilot cooley said i sure as hell wouldnt want to try putting a plane down on the water in seas like this good point sam hadnt thought of that but he nodded when i was on the remembrance we wouldnt launch or land aircraft from the flight deck in this let alone try to get down on the sea but thats not my worry mr walters sir the yrange operator said you still have that airplane on your screen whats his course flying out at sirgoing out on the reciprocal of the vector he came at us on all right sam turned back to the exec mr cooley bring our course to lets see if we can follow him back more or less down his trail and find the ship that sent him out changing course to sir cooleys smile was predatory youd make a good duck hunter thanks youve got to lead them a little sam said the limeyll still be heading west if we get close the yranger will spot him heres hoping anyway walters said youve done it before sam said if we do find the ship lets just hope shes not loaded for bear like the last one we met well be ready this time anyhow pat cooley said sam nodded the british had taken to mounting guns on some of their freighters the josephus daniels got a nasty surprise the first time she ran into one of those shed outfought the karlskrona but sam still shuddered thinking about what might have happened if one of those big shells had hit his ship he wondered how far that floatplane had come from if it was a hundred miles the destroyer escort would never find the ship that had launched it he wouldnt have wanted to try to find the ship after flying a hundred miles each way through this kind of weather hed seen the limey pilot had guts but wasnt there a difference between having guts and being out of your skull hed sailed east and a little north for about an hour when lieutenant walters stirred at his set something sam asked hopefully the josephus daniels was up at the crest of a swell which let the yranging gear see a little farther ithink so sir the jg answered and then grimaced gone now theyd slid into the trough he waited till the ocean carried the ship higher again then nodded yes sir range eight miles bearing nice navigating sir cooley said thanks change course to sam answered in good weather he would have seen the strangers smoke before he got within eight miles but the weather wasnt good and wouldnt be for weeks he drew within a mile of the freighter before he spotted her the message he blinkered over was hard and uncompromising heave to surrender any false moves and we fire without warning once bitten twice shy he thought through binoculars he could see the airplane that tried to bomb the josephus daniels stowed aft of the bridge the rustbucket ran up a white flag even as he ordered a shot across her bow he wasnt the only man scanning her for anything the least bit wrong if canvas was thrown aside to clear hidden gunsbut it wasnt not this time feeling piratical he sent across a boarding party armed with rifles and pistols and submachine guns the british sailors offered no resistance ow the bleedin ell did you find us their skipper asked when the americans brought him back to the josephus daniels sam almost told him why not the limey wasnt going anywhere but the urge to take no chances prevailed just luck he answered and smiled to himself yeah just luck twice built twice destroyed sergeant armstrong grimes strode through the wreckage of temple square in salt lake city the mormons had risen during the great war and been brutally smashed they waited for years they finally got their civil rights back from president al smith and then no doubt with confederate encouragement they rose against the usa again and now the temple and the mormon tabernacle were rubble again perhaps more finely pulverized rubble than they had been a generation earlier armstrongs eyes flicked now this way now that since lieutenant streczyk got wounded hed commanded a platoon one of these days a new junior officer might take charge of it armstrong wasnt holding his breath the war in utah got what the war against the csa didnt need since the war against the csa needed everything the war in utah gothind tit corporal yossel reisen walked through the wreckage too like armstrong the jew from new york city held his springfield at the ready reisen took a drag at the cigarette that hung from the corner of his mouth well here we are weve liberated temple square he said yeah armstrong looked around he didnt see a piece of rock bigger than about two by two the united states had expended a lot of bombs and shells on this place weve liberated the living shit out of it havent we here and there mormon civilians whod lived through the fighting were starting to come out of their holes they said they were civilians anyway orders were to treat them as civilians unless they showed signs of being dangerous armstrong didnt know why the us government was trying to win the locals hearts and minds that had been a losing game for more than sixty years now but he didnt shoot at people he would have tried to kill not long before that didnt mean he wanted the mormons coming anywhere near him one of the ways they could show signs of being dangerous was by blowing themselves up along with whatever us soldiers happened to be within range of the blast mormons had invented people bombs and still used them to deadly effect and they werent the only ones who did plainly theyd hit upon an idea whose time had come blacks in the csa used people bombs to strike at the freedom party half a dozen balkans groups were using them against austriahungary armenians blew themselves up to hit back at the ottoman turks in russia the reds had lost a long brutal civil war to the tsar now their remnants had a new weapon too other soldiers in greengray kept chivvying the emerging mormons away from them most of the civilians were women that cut no ice with armstrong grimes the first person hed seen using a people bomb was a woman and plenty of mormon women picked up rifles and grenades and fought alongside their husbands and brothers and sons you everpay a mormon gal back he asked yossel reisen reisen was watching the women too he shook his head not like that you no armstrong said not many mormon women let themselves be captured they had reasons for fighting to the death too the revenge us soldiers took was basic in the extreme gangraping captured mormon women was against orders which didnt mean it didnt happen off to the north artillery boomed us airplanes buzzed overhead some spotting for the guns others dropping bombs on mormon positions the confederates would have hacked the lumbering obsolescent bombers out of the sky with ease against enemies who didnt have fighters and didnt have much in the way of antiaircraft guns they were good enough blow all the bastards to hell and gone armstrong picked up a chip of granite that might have come from the temple then we can get on with the real war he flung the stone chip away it bounced off a bigger rock and disappeared in the rubble yossels expression changed he bent and picked up a bit of stone too tossing it up and down he murmured i wonder what jerusalem is like these days huh armstrong knew what jerusalem was like a sleepy ottoman town full of arabs and jews where nothing much had happened for centuries but his buddy said we had our temple destroyed twice too he didnt usually make a big deal out of being a jew any more than he made a big deal out of being a congresswomans nephewand not just any congresswoman but one whod also been first lady you guys are real americans armstrong said hell youre a gentile herejust ask a mormon i know i think its a scream yossel reisen said yeah were real americansor we try to be anyhow but we sure didnt make real romans a couple of thousand years ago thats why the second temple got it i guess except for what little armstrong remembered from a highschool history class and from julius caesar in english lit ancient rome was a closed book to him we think the mormons are nuts and we treat em that way and what happens yossel said bang they rise up we treat jews all right and theyre happy and quiet the romans thought my ancestors were nuts and they treated em that way and what happened bang the jews rose up bunch of bullshit if you want to know what i think armstrong said we were nice to the mormons right before the war and what did we get for it they kicked us anyway soon as we got busy with featherstons fuckers he might not know ancient history but he remembered the end of the occupation of utah fat lot of good ending it did anybody yeah there is that yossel allowed maybe you just cant make some people happy better believe you cant armstrong said these bastards have spent the last god knows how long proving it too he was some small part of what the us government had done to utah but that never entered his mind neither side by then worried much about whod started what and why they both knew they had a long history of hating mistrusting and striking at each other past that they didnt much care yossel reisen pointed to another corporal trudging through the wreckage of temple square he nudged armstrong you recognize that guy armstrong eyed the twostriper he looked like anybody else not too young not too old not too big not too small but he didnt look like anybody armstrong knew or even knew of maybe that didnt mean anything now that temple square had finally fallen it drew its share of gawkers but maybe it did mean something the usa had trouble fighting the mormons just because they looked so ordinary they had no trouble getting us uniforms either down in the csa the freedom party knew who was a negro and who wasnt herearmstrong unslung his springfield lets go check him out the corporal wasnt doing anything to draw notice he ambled around with his hands in his pockets once he bent down and picked up a bit of rock and stowed it away to mormons pieces of the temple were sacred relics but to us soldiers whod gone through hell to get here they made good souvenirs carrying one didnt say a thing about what you were hey armstrong said quietly slipping off the springfields safety you want something sarge the corporal sounded like anybody else too mormons did yeah lets see your papers sure the noncom started to take something out of his pocket hold it right there yossel reisen snapped armstrong didnt like the way the strangers hand bunched either he sure looked as if he was grabbing something bigger than a set of identity documents take both hands out nice and slow yossel told him if they arent empty when you do youre dead got it who are you clowns the corporal demanded you mormons trying to hijack me you wont get away with it if he was trying to put the shoe on the other foot he had balls armstrong gestured with his springfield do like my buddy says his own balls tried to crawl up into his belly if this guy was a mormon and what he had in there was a detonatorbut his hands came out empty yossel reached into that pocket and pulled out a pistol not an army but a smaller revolver a civilian piece armstrongs suspicions flared then yossel found the other corporals papers he looked from the photo to the man and back again he shook his head lets see armstrong said his pal showed him the picture it was of a guy noticeably darker and noticeably skinnier than the fellow in the uniform armstrong gestured with the rifle again come on get moving you got a bunch of questions to answer i havent done anything the corporal said one thing he hadnt done was swear not even once most us soldiers would have mormons watched their mouths better well youll get the chance to prove it armstrong said yossel grab his rifle carefully yossel reisen unslung the other corporals springfield move he told the man still squawkingbut still not cursingthe soldier who might not be a soldier moved they led him back over the ground for which the mormons had fought so long and so hard the ground that was cratered and crumpled and crushed the ground over which the stench of death still hung that would only get worse when the weather warmed up armstrong wondered if it would ever leave the land or if the foul clinging odor would linger forever an unseen but unmistakable monument to what salt lake city had gone through sentries outside of regimental headquarters popped up out of the foxholes where they spent most of their timenot every sniper had been hunted down and killed what the fucks going on here one of them demanded he talked the way most us soldiers did we caught this guy up by the temple armstrong answered yossel here spotted him it didnt occur to him till later that he might have taken the credit himself he didnt want to screw his buddy we figure maybe hes a mormon his papers dont match his face and he was carrying this little chickenshit pistolshow em yossel reisen displayed the revolver the sentry eyed the corporal who didnt seem to be a corporal waddayou got to say for yourself mac he asked his voice colder than the weather theyre full of baloney themaybetwostriper said not shitbaloney he added i dont like akicks too hard huh the sentry said no doubt noticing as armstrong did that thatmaybemormon didnt say anything about his papers the sentry nodded to armstrong and yossel bring him on in theyll find out whats going on with him and if it is what you think it is he didnt go on or need to if it was what they thought it was the fellow theyd captured was a dead man he wouldnt die quickly or cleanly either oh what a shame armstrong thought and led him on cincinnatus driver hadnt been under fire for more than twentyfive years hed forgotten how much fun it wasnt if he hadnt forgotten he never would have volunteered to drive a truck in a combat zone again he would have stayed back in des moines and found work in a war plant or tried to bring his dead moving and hauling business back to life but hed been flat on his back in covington kentucky when the state passed from the usa back to the csa he supposed he was lucky the car that hit him didnt kill him it didnt seem like luck while he was recovering from a broken leg and a fractured skull and a smashed shoulder even now almost two and a half years later he walked with a limp and a cane and sometimes got headaches that laughed at aspirin he was finally exchanged for a confederate the usa was holdingus citizenship meant something even for a negro it didnt mean everything negroes in the united states couldnt join the army couldnt pick up rifles and go after the enemies who were tormenting their brethren south of the masondixon line with his age and his injuries cincinnatus wouldnt have been able to join the army if he were white this was the next best thing hed driven trucks for more than thirty years hed driven for the usa during the great war here he was doing it again part of a long column of greengray machines hauling ammunition and rations to the us troops trying to drive the confederates out of western ohio the state of the art had improved over the past quartercentury the chevy truck he drove now had a much more powerful much more reliable engine than the white hed used then it had a fully enclosed cabin too and a heater it boasted a selfstarter he didnt have to crank it to life its headlights were electric not acetylene lamps with allwheel drive it could get through terrain that would have shaken the white to pieces but the driving wasnt much different neither was the fear when shells started bursting in the field to either side of the road cincinnatus mouth went dry his sphincters tightened he wanted to stop and turn around and get the hell out of there a lay on the seat beside him he couldnt afford to let the confederates capture him it wasnt just that he was colored though no black man in the usa wanted to think about falling into confederate hands but he was also on the csas list of dangerous characters when they removed him from covington they made it very plain they didnt want to have anything to do with him ever again they might regret it if they did but he would never get over it next to those bursting shells the seemed like small potatoes next to the dreadful immensity of the war cincinnatus himself seemed like small potatoes just one man and an ordinary man at that but all you could do was all you could do everybody was just one person doing what he or she could do added together all those people made up the usa and the csamade up the war if added together all the people of the usa could do more they better cincinnatus said there alone in the cab of the chevrolet truck imagining a north america dominated by the confederacy and the freedom partyhe didnt want to do it hed seen what covington was like after the stars and bars replaced the stars and stripes thinking of that happening everywhere made him a little sick or more than a little one of the incoming shells hit a truck a couple of hundred yards ahead of him the truck loaded with the same sort of cargo as his went up in a fireball luckily it careened off the road instead of blocking it all the same cincinnatus hit the brakes he didnt want to get any closer than he had to till that ammo finished cooking off could have been me he thought and shuddered it would have been him if one of the confederate artillery men had paused to scratch an itch or stick a fresh chaw in his mouth before pulling the lanyard about fifteen seconds later his truck would have been where that shell landed he sped up when he went past the shattered deuceandahalf not a chance in hell the driver got out he hoped the man died fast anyhow given the size of that explosion the odds seemed good another shell left a crater in the road forcing cincinnatus over onto the soft shoulder to get around it with power to all six wheels he managed to get by without bogging down he hoped the trucks that came after his would be able to do the same each one chewed up the ground more and more the truck column rolled into findlay about five minutes later here and there around the town tall columns of black greasy smoke rose into the air oil wells torched by the retreating confederates a team of us engineers was trying to put one out as cincinnatus came into town he wondered if retreating us soldiers had fired the wells a year and a half earlier leaving the confederates to get them working again he wouldnt have been surprised he didnt get long to worry about it come on come on over here a sergeant bellowed waving like a man possessed cincinnatus did his best to follow the noncoms instructions at last the sergeant threw up both hands as if hed just scored a touchdown he stopped a swarm of soldiers descended on the truck transferring the munitions and rations to several smaller trucks for the trip to the front it wasnt far away findlay itself had fallen only a few days before shells still came down on the town as theyd landed on the road to the northwest the faster the explosives left cincinnatus truck the happier he would be of course as soon as the deuceandahalf was empty he had to drive back to the big depot in defiance to load up again for another trip to findlay the csa had heavily bombed defiance earlier in the war not many enemy airplanes came over these days us fighters and bombers took off from airstrips on the outskirts of town antiaircraft guns by the score poked their long snouts up toward the sky camouflage netting masked some of them others stood out in the open as if warning the confederates they were there cincinnatus gulped a sandwich and drank coffee while they filled his truck again there was one other negro driver in his transport unit douglass butler came from denver of all places he talked like a white man cincinnatus son and daughter had grown up in des moines and lost a lot of their confederate negro accent cincinnatus had lost some of it himself hed noticed that when he got stuck in covington but douglass butler didnt have any and apparently never had had any he puffed on a cigar waiting for his truck to get reloaded my dad went out to colorado to see if he could get rich mining he said every vowel sharp every consonant distinct he didntonly a few people didand he ended up running a grocery store i started driving a truck for him but i found i liked driving more than i liked the grocery business folks out there give you a lot of trouble on account o cincinnatus brushed two fingers of his right hand across the back of his left to remind the other negro what color they were well i know what nigger means thats for damn sure butler shrugged but jews are kikes and chinamen are chinks and irishmen are micks and mexicans are greasers and italians are wops and even poles are lousy polacks for gods sake i dont get too excited about it hell my brothers married to a white woman that made cincinnatus blink work out all right he asked theyve been married almost twenty years people are used to them the other driver said every once in a while johnll hear something stupid if hes standing in line for a film with helen or out at a diner or something like that but its not too bad he chuckled of course hes my big brotherhe goes about sixthree maybe twofifty i dont care if youre greenyou want to be careful what you say around him he was of ordinary size himself does make a difference cincinnatus agreed he wondered if john butler was named for john brown with two ss in his first name douglass butler was bound to be named for frederick douglass before he could ask somebody shouted that their trucks were ready to roll got to get moving butler said i want to parade through nashville or birmingham or one of those places and if i hear some confederate asshole yell freedomwell i want to pull out my and blow his fucking head off he sounded altogether matteroffact about it the way a us white man would have but for the color of his skin he might as well have been a us white man he seemed as sure of his place in the world and as comfortable with it as any white man whether from the usa or the csa cincinnatus whom life had left forever betwixt and between envied him for that he climbed into the cab of his truck slammed the door turned the key in the ignition and put the beast in gear south and east he rolled back toward findlay no shellfire fell on the road this time us guns or maybe dive bombers had silenced the confederate batteries that were shelling it cincinnatus approved unlike douglass butler he didnt want to use his for anything he had it he could use it if he had to but he didnt want to what if jake featherston was right in front of you he glanced over to the pistol well you could make exceptions for everything dream as he would though he didnt expect to be sharing a diner with the president of the csa any time soon when he rolled into findlay he got waved through the town whats goin on he called to a soldier with wigwag flags we broke through again thats what the white man answered they need their shit farther forward i like that cincinnatus said and drove on shells were falling not far from the new unloading area but theyd been falling in findlay and beyond it only a couple of hours before the men who hauled crates out of the back of his truck had an air of barely suppressed excitement they didnt seem to think the confederates would be able to slow this latest push do jesus let em be right cincinnatus thought that ohio should be liberated didnt matter so much in and of itselfnot to him anyway but he could see that us soldiers would have to clear the confederates out of their own country before they started doing what really did matterto him anyway if the united states were going to lick jake featherston they would have to do it on featherstons turf cincinnatus thought about the last time hed driven trucks full of munitions through kentucky and tennessee he thought about the confederate diehards whod shot up his column more than once then he thought about us artillery and bombers blowing all those people to kingdom come war was a filthy business for everybody no doubt about it cincinnatus wanted a little more filth to come down on the other side he didnt think that was too much to ask brigadier general irving morrell was a man in a hurry he always had been ever since his days as a company commander at the start of the great war he took the first position he ever attackedand he got shot charging with the bayonet when he ran out of ammunition that taught him an important lesson like anything else being in a hurry had its disadvantages it also had its advantages though massing barrels and smashing confederate lines made the csa say uncle in at the barrel works at fort leavenworth after the great war morrell designed a machine with all the features a modern barrel needed a reduced crew a powerful engine a big gun in a turret that turned through degrees and a wireless set he designed itand he found nobody in the usa much wanted it the great war was over wasnt it thered never be another one would there being a man in a hurry sometimes put you too far ahead not only of the enemy but also of your own side by the time it became clear the great war wouldnt be the last one after all the state of the art all over the world had caught up with morrells vision germany and austriahungary built barrels incorporating all the features hed envisioned more than fifteen years earlier so did france and england and russia and so did the confederate states so did the united states but belatedly and halfheartedly when the fighting started morrell had to try to defend ohio without enough machinesand without good enough machines he failed even in failure he alarmed the confederates a sniper gave him an oakleaf cluster for his purple heart and put him on the shelf for weeks returning to duty he didnt have much luck in virginia a narrow land bristling with fortifications but he was the architect of the us thrust that cut off surrounded and destroyed the confederate army that fought its way into pittsburgh now the armored force he led was driving west through ohio he knew exactly what he wanted to do if somewhere south of columbus his force could meet up with the one pushing southeast from northwestern ohio and indiana they would trap all the confederates to the north of them in another pocket he didnt think jake featherston could afford to lose one army he knew damn well the president of the csa couldnt afford to lose two what could be better then than giving jake exactly what he didnt want right this minute morrell was bivouacked with his lead barrels atop mount pleasant in lancaster ohio the foot sandstone rise looked down on the whole town it had not lived up to its name not being fools the confederates put an observation post and several artillery batteries atop the rise and protected them with pillboxes and machinegun nests clearing them out was a slow bloody expensive job morrell believed in bypassing enemy strongpoints wherever he could letting slowermoving infantry clean up in the armors wake some strongpoints though were too strong to bypass this unfortunately was one of them dive bombers helped pound it into submission several s sprawled in the snow knocked ass over teakettle by pound bombs dead soldiers in butternut lay there too some of them wore white camouflage smocks over their uniforms which struck morrell as a good idea good idea or not it didnt save them along with soot their blood streaked the snow crows and a couple of turkey vultures were feeding on the bodies standing up in his barrels cupola morrell waved his arms and yelled yaaah a few of the birds flew away most of them ignored him the gunner tapped him on the leg what the hell sir corporal al bergeron said plaintively you scared the crap out of me there sorry frenchy morrell answered bergeron was a good man and a good gunnermaybe not quite so good as michael pound who was one of a kind in several different ways but damn good just the same morrell explained why he made his horrible noise oh bergeron thought about that for a little while then he said yeah those damn things are filthy all right tell you one thing though im glad theyre chowing down on featherstons fuckers and not on us me too morrell said though he knew the carrion birds didnt care whether their suppers came wrapped in butternut or greengray for that matter the crows and vultures feasted on dead civilians too whats it look like off to the west bergeron asked before answering morrell scanned the way ahead with binoculars visibility wasnt everything he wished it were but he could see enough to get some idea of what was going on sure looks like theyre pulling back he said corporal bergeron summed up his reaction to that in two words well shit you said a mouthful frenchy morrell really had hoped he could cut off as many confederates with this thrust as he had in and around pittsburgh then jake featherston forbade his men to withdraw morrell had hoped he would do it again but evidently he was able to learn from experience too bad morrell thought the confederates were heading south in anything that would roll truck convoys barrels commandeered civilian motorcars bombers and artillery and saboteurs did everything they could to knock the railroads out of action but ohio had such a dense net of tracks that it wasnt easy every soldier every barrel every gun every truck that got out now was a soldier a barrel a gun a truck the usa would have to put out of action later on morrell scanned the horizon again he knew he was being foolish but he did it anyhow if he could have seen the us forces coming down from the northwest the confederates would have been in even worse trouble than they really were when he sighed the vapor threatened to cloud the field glasses lenses that western column wasnt so strong or so swift as this one even so we get the country put back together again frenchy bergeron said you didnt need to be a general to see that a noncom would do just fine the confederates armored thrust had carried them all the way from the ohio river up to sandusky they cut the united states in half for more than a year and a half goods and men moved from east to west or west to east by air risky on the waters of the great lakes also risky with cs airplanes always on the prowl and over the canadian roads and railroads north of the lakes of limited capacity and vulnerable to sabotage even before the canucks rebelled itll be better morrell agreed it probably wouldnt be a whole lot better any time soon the confederates were professionally competent they would have done their best to wreck the eastwest highways and railroad lines they were now sullenly abandoning putting the roads and railways back into action wouldnt happen overnight especially since cs bombers would go right on visiting northern ohio but now the confederates were reacting to what morrell and his countrymen did for the first year of the war and more the enemy had the united states back on their heels the csa called the tune no more as morrell watched artillery rounds began falling near the confederate convoy the first few shells missed the road bursting in front of or behind it the trucks sped up if they could get out of troublebut they couldnt not fast enough a round hit the road the convoy had to slow down to go onto the shoulder and then a truck got hit and began to burn that was all morrell needed to see he was commanding a large complex operation but he was also a fighting man himself when he saw trucks in trouble he wanted to give them more his barrel carried a large complicated wireless set he could talk with his fellow armored units with artillery with infantry or with bombers and fighters he didnt want to not here he used the company circuit any barrel commander might have clicked to weve got a confederate convoy stalled on the road a few miles west lets go get em along with the others nearby his own machine rumbled down off mount pleasant even after giving up the high ground they had no trouble tracking their quarry the pyre from that one burning truckand maybe from more by nowguided them straight to it they met a warm reception when they got there the confederates had to know trouble was on the way they didnt stay in the trucks waiting around to get shot up some of them made their way south on foot and others had manhandled an antibarrel gun into position and opened up on the us machines as soon as they came into range the confederates hit one too fortunately with a round that glanced off instead of penetrating front morrell said identified frenchy bergeron answered he the gunner called to the loader the barrel stopped he fired a couple of highexplosive shells at the gun he wasnt the only barrel gunner shooting either the confederates serving the cannon had only a small splinter shield to protect them they soon went down brave bastards morrell thought watching with his head and shoulders out of the cupola smallarms fire came his way but not a lot of it he ignored it with the stoicism of a man whod known worse one bullet was all he needed to make this as bad as it could be but he didnt think about that then something different happened a projectile trailing smoke and flame seemed to come out of nowhere it slammed into a us barrel and set it afire morrell couldnt see if any of the men got out he didnt think so what the fuck was that bergeron must have seen it through the gunsight ill be goddamned if i know morrell answered he didnt have to wait long a couple of minutes later another one of those darts of fire lanced out to incinerate a us barrel its some kind of rocket like on the fourth of july frenchy bergeron said how the hell did they come up with that how i dont know but they sure did morrell ducked down into the turret did you see where theyre shooting it from yes sir the gunner answered behind that stone fence there near the road all right if they pop up again try and shoot them before they can let go with it ive got to get on the horn to my people he flipped to the circuit that would connect him to senior armor officers the confederates have a portable antibarrel device something an infantryman can use to knock out a machine at a couple of hundred yards i say again a foot soldier can use this thing to knock out a barrel at a couple of hundred yards life suddenly got more complicated if foot soldiers really could fight back against armor without the suicidal impulse required to fling a featherston fizzwe need something like that ourselves morrell thought the coaxial machine gun chattered got the son of a bitch bergeron said plainly the cs rocket was new plainly the confederates here didnt have many rounds just as plainly the damn thing worked and how many factories would start turning it out as fast as they could morrell swore yes life was a lot more complicated all at once when jake featherston wanted to fly into nashville his bodyguards didnt just have kittens they had puppies and lambs and probably baby elephants too their chief was a group leaderthe freedom party guards equivalent of a major generalnamed hiram mccullough mr president he said your airplane could crash featherston scowled at him my train could derail too if i go that way he growled yes sir group leader mccullough agreed stolidly that gave featherstons everready anger no good place to light mccullough went on the other thing that could happen is the damnyankees could shoot you down the country needs you too much to let you take the chance without false modesty jake knew the country needed him too he couldnt think of anyone else with the driving will to hold the csa together if anything did happen to him that was only the second half of what mccullough said though as for the firsthow could the damnyankees shoot me down they wont know im in the air till ive landed sir you dont know that for sure neither do i mccullough had a round red face pitted with acne scars he was good at looking worried as a bodyguard should be he looked very worried now we dont know for a fact how many of our codes the yankees can read we dont know for a fact that they dont have spies whod pass on where youre going and when if you give the orders ill follow em but do you want to take a chance you dont have to damn you jake thought since turning fiftyand since surviving two assassination tries one by his own guardshe was more careful about his own safety no one could question his courage not after the record hed racked up in the great war however much he wanted to he couldnt deny that group leader mccullough had a point all right hiram he said ill take the goddamn train thank you mr president mccullough said in glad surprise those doleful features hardly seemed able to contain the smile that lit them now featherston held up a bony hand dont thank me yet well keep the train real quieti mean real quiet what you put out through the regular secure channels is that i am going to fly send my regular pilot send my regular airplane give it the regular fighter escort put somebody who looks like me on it if the yankees jump it you win if they dont ill damn well fly when i feel like it you got that yes sir mccullough said ill take care of it just like you want me to just about everyone said that to the president of the csa it was what he liked to hear most mccullough got to his feet freedom freedom jake echoed two days later an armored limousine took someone who looked like him from the ruins of the gray house to the airport outside richmond escorted by hound dogs his personal transport took off for nashville with no ceremony at all jake went to the train station and headed west in a pullman car he got to the capital of tennessee six hours later than he expected to us bombs had knocked out a bridge he was glad he wasnt scheduled to speak till that evening delaying his talk because of what the enemy did would be embarrassing hiram mccullough went to nashville a day ahead of him to make sure security was tight the group leader met jake at the train station as soon as he could he took featherston aside in a low voice he said mr president two squadrons of yankee fighters jumped your airplane before it got out of virginia they shot it down and they shot down three of the hound dogs with it too jesus christ jake exploded yes sir mccullough said im mighty glad you stayed on the ground mr president that was i told you so but jake didnt care he was glad too he said so he didnt see how he could avoid it then he asked how the hell are those bastards picking up our codes dont know sir mccullough answered im going to be looking at that thoughyou better believe i will and ill tell you something else too i wont be the only one either better not be featherston said dammit im gonna have to do more talking with clarence potter potter was smartsometimes too damn smart for his own good but smart and a breach like this would make him focus all of his formidable brainpower on it unless hes the one who fed the damnyankees the codes in the first place in jake featherstons shoes you worried about everybody all the time and for every possible reason but featherston couldnt make himself believe clarence potter would sell the csa down the river potter didnt love him hed known that for many years but the intelligence officer was a confederate patriot if you didnt understand that you didnt understand anything about him i brought an armored car to the station sir to take you to the hotel mccullough said just in case thanks featherston couldnt deny that that made sense if the yankees knew he was on the way to nashville they might have people here who would try to strike at him of course they might also be thinking theyd just killed himin which case they were all probably out getting drunk and trying to lay their secretaries he let out a nasty chuckle before long theyd know he was still alive and kicking all right the armored car looked impressive as hell it had six big tires with cleated treads its angles were harsh and military it sported a barrellike turret with a cannon and a coaxial machine gun but factories werent making very many of them these days and most of the ones that did get made were used against rebellious negroes not against the damnyankees armored cars made tolerable scout vehicles their steel sides kept out smallarms fire but they were horribly vulnerable to any kind of cannon and even with six wheels and allwheel drive they werent as good away from roads as tracked machines were this one though was fine to get him to the hermitage hotel he peered out at nashville through firing slits and periscopes the city hadnt been bombed nearly so hard as richmond had it was farther from us airstrips than the capital and not so vital a target but it had suffered too so much to rebuild when this is over jake thought a scowl made his rawboned features even harsher than they were already as long as the united states needed to put more back together it didnt matter everybody at the hermitage hotel was nervous though featherston had stayed there on earlier visits to nashville the manager said i hope the suite will be satisfactory about three times in the space of two minutes dont worry about it itll be fine jake told him the manager had to be scared hed get skinned alive if the rooms werent fancy enough that only proved he didnt know the president of the csa jake liked habana cigars and good whiskey but that was as far as he went along those lines he hadnt got into politics hoping for riches and luxury power drove him nothing else he didnt stay at the hermitage very long just long enough to freshen up after the train trip then he went across the street to the nashville memorial auditorium a ponderous concrete building that went up after the great war he didnt have a full house in the auditorium but he didnt care this speech was for the wireless and the newsreels not for the people actually in the hall when it was filmed the place would look full whether it was or not saul goldman didnt hire cameramen who didnt know what they were doing im jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth hed been opening with that line ever since he discovered the wireless that was twenty years ago now he found it hard to believe but it was true when he said it he believed it his speeches wouldnt have worked half as well if he didnt the truth is we are going to win this war when he said that the party stalwarts and fat cats in the memorial auditorium started yelling as if it were going out of style maybe he inspired them maybe they were scared shitless and needed a pat on the fanny to make em feel better if they did he would give them one we are going to win he repeated they cant beat us because we damn well wont quit well never quit not while weve got one free white man who can stand on his own two feet and aim a rifle at the enemy more applause came echoing back from the ceiling the noise made jakes heart beat faster talking in a wireless studio was one thing talking in front of a living breathing sweating crowd was something else something better something hotter truth is the freedom partys had the right idea for twentyfive years now jake went on and if an ideas right to begin with it will take up arms and struggle in this world and once it does nobody can beat it nobody you hear every time someone persecutes it that only makes it stronger freedom somebody in the audience yelled an instant later everyone took up the cry it washed over jake featherston he scowled toward the north if the damnyankees thought the confederate states would fold up and die because things hadnt gone perfectly in pennsylvania and ohio they could damn well think again were in this for the long haul he shouted this isnt any ordinary war and everybody needs to remember it this is the kind of fight that will shape the new millennium a war like this doesnt come along every day it shakes the world once in a thousand years were on a crusade here a crusade for freedom the roar was louder this time featherston nodded thats right friends we cant quit now we wont quit now either if the confederate people give up they wont deserve anything better than what they get if they give up i wont be sorry for them if god lets them down he paused to let that sink in then softly asked but we wont give up will we well never give up will we no no hesitation no backsliding if they were there he would hear them as always the confederate states were going where he took them and he knew where that was well buckle down then he said well work hard at home well whip the damnyankees yet for every ton of bombs they drop on us well drop ten tons on their heads same as weve been doing all along and well never get stabbed in the back again on account of were putting our own house in order by god that drew more frantic applause most of nashvilles negroes were already in camps lots of negroes went into camps in alabama and mississippi and louisiana and texas they went in but they didnt come out that suited most of the whites in the csa just fine and if the confederate states of america werent a white mans country then there was no such thing not anywhere in the world since the war started wireless broadcasting was a tricky business the usa and the csa jammed each others stations as hard as they could as often as not snarls of static strangled and distorted music and comedies as well as news but that wasnt the only reason the tune coming out of the wireless set in flora blackfords office sounded strange to her satchmo and the rhythm aces werent an ordinary us combo they were colored men whod escaped to the usa after being sent north into ohio to entertain confederate troops nobody in the united states played music like new orleans jump if the negroes werent minor heroes because of their daring getaway they never would have got airtime for anything with such peculiar syncopations as things were they had a minor hit on their hands congresswoman blackford was happy for them shed met satchmo and his less memorable bandmates they were talented men to her they were a symbol of everything the confederate states were wasting with their constant war against the negro she clucked unhappily to her countrymen satchmo and the rhythm aces were a curiosity nothing more most people in the usa didnt want to hear about negroes didnt want anything to do with them and didnt want to be told what the confederates were doing to them shed tried her best to make her countrymen pay attention her best wasnt good enough new orleans jump struck her as fitting background music for what she was reading the transcript of jake featherstons recent speech in nashville shed got it from the war department the captain who gave it to her seemed angry that he had to flora wondered what that was all about she didnt think the young officer had any reason to be angry at her personally shed never set eyes on him before she wasnt trying to cut off fundingwho would these days you gave the army and the navy what they said they needed and you hoped they found ways to shoot all the money at the enemy so why was the captain steaming then she picked up the telephone and called the assistant secretary of war who was somewhere between a conspirator and a friend hello flora franklin roosevelt said genially what can i do for you today a captain just brought me a copy of featherstons latest speech flora said jakes a son of a bitch isnt he roosevelt said pardon my french theres certainly no give in himas if we didnt know that flora said but that isnt why im calling or not exactly anyhow this captain seemed to be doing a slow burn and i wondered why its not like i ever met him before oh i think i can tell you that on the telephone roosevelt said its not as if the confederates dont already know it dear jake gave that speech in nashville right yes flora found herself nodding though of course franklin roosevelt couldnt see her he had a gift for inspiring intimacy if infantile paralysis hadnt left him in a wheelchair he might have tried to follow his cousin theodore into the white house and he was a solid socialist too unlike theodore the democrat what about it flora went on this about it we knew featherston was going to nashville we hoped wed arranged things so he wouldnt get there roosevelt sighed obviously we didnt hes a suspicious soandso and he dodged the bullet i wouldnt be surprised if thats why your captain was steaming im steaming too to tell you the truth oh flora nodded again well now that i know so am i if we could bump him off wouldnt it be lovely franklin roosevelt said it sure would flora was sure she and the assistant secretary of war shared the same beatific vision the confederate states of america thrashing around like a headless snake if jake featherston got it in the neck she had no idea who would or could replace featherston if he got it in the neck she doubted the confederates had any more idea than she did jake featherston made the csa tick if he wasnt there wouldnt the country stop ticking the other bad thing about it is now they know weve broken some of their codes roosevelt said theyll change them and that will complicate our lives for a while till we break them again he had to mean too bad flora said too bad all the way around in fact thanks for letting me know that does make me pretty sure the captain wasnt mad at me personally anyhow always a relief roosevelt agreed the last thing anybody wants or needs is a secret unadmirer eryes flora tasted the phrase but its a shame featherstons unadmirers here didnt stay secret enough well so it is the assistant secretary of war said the confederates didnt break off the flight because theyre reading our codes i think they put a decoy on it because one of their security people got jumpy the good ones do from everything ive heard and lord knows featherston needs good ones plenty of people on both sides of the border who want to kill him all right flora said did you notice inflation is coming back to the confederate states no roosevelt was suddenly and sharply interested after the great war the confederate dollar collapsed when things were at their worst enjoying a beer took billions what do you mean it would be wonderful if their economy went down the drain again but flora didnt mean that however much she wished she did not what i was thinking she said sadly when the war was new though featherston promised to drop three tons of bombs on our heads for every ton we landed on the csa now hes up to ten tons oh franklin roosevelt laughed id call that deflation myselfas his spirits go down his threats go up he was lying then and hes still lying now the confederates werent that far ahead at the start of things and theyre behind us now were landing more on them than they are on usquite a bit more as a matter of fact good flora said wondering how he knew if she asked him hed probably tell her it was a very precise statistic hed just made up odds were neither side knew exactly how much it was getting and receiving she asked a different question instead how are things out west theyre doing quite well roosevelt sounded enthusiastic as he often did it really does look like general dowling will take lubbock away from the confederates if he does we may proclaim the state of houston again that will give the people in west texas something to flabble aboutsomething to fight among themselves about no oneexcept maybe themwould be sorry about that flora said it would also give him a base to go after camp determination the camps where the confederates systematically got rid of their negroes sickened her as nothing else ever did well maybe franklin roosevelt didnt sound so enthusiastic about that he spelled out his reasons its farther from lubbock to the camp than it is from the border to lubbock quite a bit farther those are the wide open spaces out there and detaching men from more urgent things farther east may not be easy either flora could have argued that nothing was more urgent than saving the lives of untold thousands of innocent human beings she could have but she knew the assistant secretary of war wouldnt pay any attention if she did he would say that wouldnt win the war and winning the war was the most urgent item on the agenda she would have a devil of a time showing he was wrong too so again she took a different tack how are things farther west than that had roosevelt started giving her chapter and verse about the skirmishes on the border between new mexico and sonoraand thered never been more than skirmishes on that border even though the war was heading towards its second birthdayshe would have got angry but he didnt that seems to be going as well as expected too he said im glad to hear it flora didnt expect to hear anything more not over the telephone the project centered on hanford washington sounded like something from the pages of a pulp magazine with bugeyed monsters and scantily clad girls on the cover in fact though someone had told her that those magazines had a lot of subscribers in hanfordthey were much more popular with scientists and engineers than with the general public she hoped the confederacys spymasters didnt know that i do think were making progress i really do roosevelt said heres hoping flora didnt think shed ever heard of uranium till after the war began now she knew there was more than one kind if the could be separated from the or if the could somehow make some new element altogetherit all sounded more like medieval alchemy than sciencethe bombs that resulted might blow whole cities off the map with luck those would be confederate cities without luckany word on how theyre doing with this on the other side of the line well they do seem to be trying the assistant secretary of war sounded less jaunty than was his wont fear clogged floras throat if the cities blown off the map belonged to the usa jake featherston would win his war in spite of the disasters the confederates had suffered in pennsylvania and ohio what can we do about that she asked can we do anything we wont let them get away with it if we can possibly stop them i promise you that roosevelt said good flora said before she asked herself how good it really was what had roosevelt promised to stop the csa from building a uranium bomb no hed promised to try to stop the confederates from building one of course the united states would do that flora found one more question what can they do to stop us they havent tried anything yet roosevelt saidanother answer that wasnt an answer he went on they may have done some reconnaissancewere not sure about that if they did they wont be able to do it again weve tightened up since the last time we think they came around why werent things tight right from the beginning flora admired her own restraint she didnt raise her voice at all no matter how much she felt like yelling her head off because we were asleep at the switch roosevelt could be disarmingly frank we arent any more we wont be either thats about the best i can tell you flora all right she said and hoped it was im sure well do everything we can she said her goodbyes then she hoped the usa bombed the confederates uraniumproducing plants to hell and gone she hoped the csa didnt do the same to the one the united states had was such hope enough the only answer that occurred to her was painfully cliched which made it no less true shed have to wait and see iii mail call that shout always made the guards at camp determination hurry up to see what they had troop leader hipolito rodriguez wasnt as good at hurrying as some of his younger sprier comrades he was still on the sunny side of fifty but moved like an older man hed almost got electrocuted a year and a half earlier and hed never been the same since he belonged to the confederate veterans brigades men who couldnt hope to fight at the front but who could still serve the csa behind the lines all the men at camp determination whether from the veterans brigades or not were freedom party guards with the funny ranks that accompanied party positions rodriguez had three stripes on the left sleeve of his gray uniform he thought of himself as a sergeant he did a sergeants job and got a sergeants pay if they wanted to call him something silly who was he to tell them they couldnt because he had three stripes on his sleeve rodriguez didnt need to hurry as much as ordinary guards did they got out of the way for him they never would have if he hadnt been promoted to most confederates greasers from chihuahua and sonora were only a short step up from niggers rank carried more weight than race though and a short step could be the longest step in the world hipolito rodriguezhip to men who grew up speaking englishwasnt the only guard with mexican blood on the other side of the barbed wire were untold thousands of mallates and the camp outside of snyder texas existed for one reason and one reason only to kill them off as fast as possible the twostripe assistant troop leader with the sack of mail started pulling out letters and stacks of letters held together by rubber bands and calling off names as each guard admitted he was there the corporal tossed him whatever he had rodriguez the noncom a white man made a mess of the name confederates born anywhere east of texas usually did here rodriguez knew the ways they usually butchered it he raised his hand the corporal gave him three letters he fanned them out like cards they were all from magdalena his wife he opened the one with the oldest postmark first she wrote in the englishflavored spanish middleaged people in sonora and chihuahua commonly used his childrens generation further removed from the empire of mexico spoke and wrote a spanishflavored english another couple of generations might see the older language disappear altogether but that thought flickered through rodriguezs mind and was lost he needed the news from baroyeca he hadnt been back since he joined the confederate veterans brigades and he might not get home till the war was over magdalena had heard from the confederate red cross pedro was a pow in the united states hipolito rodriguez let out a sigh of relief his youngest son was alive he would come home one of these days hed done everything he could against the usa and he was safe no one could ask for more especially since the news out of ohio where hed fought was so bad from what rodriguezs wife wrote his two older sons miguel and jorge were also well by an irony of fate pedro had gone into the army ahead of them he was in the first class after the csa reintroduced conscription where his older brothers missed out till it was extended to them miguel was in virginia now while jorge fought in the sputtering war on sonoras northern border trying to reclaim what the damnyankees annexed after the great war compared to that news nothing else mattered much magdalena also talked about the farm the farm was doing all rightnot spectacularly because it wasnt spectacular land and she had trouble keeping things going by herself but all right the family had no money problems with her getting allotments from her husband and three sons they probably had more in the way of cash than theyd ever had before robert quinn was wearing the uniform that rocked rodriguez back on his heels quinn had run the freedom party in baroyeca since not long after the great war hed put down as many roots as anyone who wasnt born in the village could hope to do and now he was gone the war was longer and harder than anyone imagined it could be carlos ruizs son was wounded the doctors said he would get better that he would was good news that hed been hurt in the first place wasnt rodriguez and ruiz had been friendsforever they grew up side by side in each others pockets i have to write him rodriguez thought and a couple of women were sleeping with men who werent their husbands since the men who were their husbands went to the front rodriguez sighed that kind of gossip was as old as time however much you wished it werent back in the great war jefferson pinkard the man who was comandante at camp determination had had the same kind of woman trouble other guards read their letters from home as avidly as rodriguez tore through his letters reminded you what was real what was important they reminded you why you put on the uniform in the first place helping the country was too big and too abstract for most people most of the time helping your home town and your familyanybody could understand that not all the news was good one guard crumpled a letter and stormed away his face working his hands clenched into fists a couple of his friends hurried after him can we help josh one of them said that goddamn no good twotiming bitch josh said which told the world exactly what his trouble was rodriguez wondered if the letter was from his wife telling him shed found someone new or from a friendor an enemytelling him she was running around what difference did it make something hed thought fireproof was going up in flames rodriguez crossed himself hoping he never got a letter like that he didnt think he would what he and magdalena had built over the years seemed solid but josh didnt expect anything like this either the trouble you didnt see coming was always the worst kind he thought about that when he patrolled the womens side of the camp north of the railroad spur that came out from snyder he and the two guards with him all carried submachine guns with big drum magazines if they got in trouble they could spray a lot of lead around in a hurry but lifeanddeath trouble mostly wasnt the kind guards had to worry about here in the mens side south of the train tracks you were liable to get knocked over the head if you were stupid or careless here your biggest worries were probably syphilis and the clap like anybody else the negro women used whatever they had to keep themselves and their children alive what they had was mostly themselves and a lot of them were diseased before they came here mistuh sergeant suh a pretty colored woman in her twenties purred at rodriguez like most people she knew what three stripes were supposed to mean and didnt give a damn about freedom party guard ranks mistuh sergeant you git me some extra rations i do anything you wantan i mean anything if he had any doubts about what she meant a twitch of the hipsdamn near a burlesquequality bump and grindwould have erased them he didnt even change expression he just kept walking when he did she called him something that reflected badly on his manhood i wouldnt mind me a piece of that not even slightly said one of the younger men with him you want her you take her rodriguez answered with a shrug you think you pass shortarm inspection afterwards they had those now jefferson pinkard pitched a fit when four men came down with the clap inside of three days rodriguez had a hard time blaming him the guard looked back at the woman i dont reckon shes got anything wrong with her he said rodriguez didnt try to argue with him she had a large firm bosom and round hips and that was all the younger man cared about to rodriguez one of the things her looks meant was that she hadnt been here very long eat prisoner rations for a bit and the flesh melted off of you another black woman nodded to him hello sergeant she said she wasnt trying to seduce him her gray hair said she was older than he was but she greeted him every time she saw him some people were just nice some people were nice enough to stay nice even in a place like thisnot many but some she was one of them hello bathsheba he had trouble pronouncing her name which had two sounds right in the middle of it that mexican spanish didnt use her smile said hed done pretty well today her daughter came up beside her even though the girl was darker than her mulatto mother he found her very pretty but she wasnt one of those who tried to screw their way to safety maybe she realized there was no safety to be had or maybe she kept her morals some women did she nodded too sergeant she said politely senorita antoinette rodriguez nodded back can you take a message to the mens side her mother asked some women would do anything to get word to husbands or lovers is against regulations rodriguez said its not anything bad not anything dangerous bathsheba said just tell xerxes we love him an wes thinkin about him antoinette nodded rodriguez didnt even if i find himhe didnt say even if hes still alivemaybe its code i dont take no chances please mistuh guard suh antoinette said aint no codeswear to jesus aint nothin but a christian thing to do please suh unlike her mother she was young and pretty even so she didnt promise to open her legs or go down on her knees if rodriguez did what she wanted oddly her not promising made him take her more seriously not less he lost track of how many times he heard promises like that more than he wanted to collect more than he could collect too he sighed i see this xerxeshe stumbled over the peculiar namemaybe i tell him this maybe he wouldnt make any promises of his own not where the guards with him could hear the older woman and the younger both beamed at him as if hed promised to set them free god bless you they said together he nodded gruffly then scowled at the other two guards in gray come on get moving he said as if theyd stopped for their business not his all they said was yes troop leader that was what he said when someone with a higher rank came down on him now he hadsome rank of his own anyway he enjoyed using it would he pass on the message if he found that man on the other side he didnt really believe it was code he also didnt really believe it mattered one way or the other before long that xerxes was a dead man and bathsheba and antoinette were dead women too one of the confederates up ahead of first sergeant chester martin squeezed off a short burst from his automatic rifle martin had been about to jump out of his foxhole and move forward maybe twenty feet maybe even fifty instead he decided to stay right where he was for the next little while hed been wounded once in the great war and once in this one as far as he was concerned that was enough and then some didnt the confederates know they were supposed to be on the run in this part of ohio didnt they know theyd already pulled out of columbus and they were hightailing it down toward the ohio river didnt they know they would have to fall back across the scioto river into chillicothe on the west side didnt they know they couldnt hold chillicothe either by the way they were fighting they didnt know any of that they were bastards yeah no doubt about it but they were tough bastards more automaticweapons fire came from the west somebody not nearly far enough from chester martin let out a screech and then hollered for a corpsman that was a wound but it didnt sound like too bad a wound martin knew what badly wounded men sounded like hed hear those shrieks in his nightmares till the day he diedwhich given the way things worked might be any day now from a hole in the ground not far from chesters second lieutenant delbert wheat called mortars put some bombs down on those gunners mortar rounds started dropping on the confederate line mortars were handy things to have they gave infantry platoons instant artillery support without even adding boiling water lieutenant wheat made a pretty fair platoon leader too before him martin had served with a couple of much less satisfactory officers one of the things a first sergeant was supposed to do was keep the shavetail set over him from making too big a jackass of himself most second lieutenants never understood that they labored under the delusion that they were in charge of their platoon a lot of them got killed laboring under that delusion a first sergeant was also supposed to keep them from killing too many other people on their own side the second lieutenants who survived went on to bigger and better things first sergeants who survived got brandnew second lieutenants to break in martin saw only one thing wrong with lieutenant wheats order just about every confederate soldier carried either an automatic rifle or a submachine gun the confederates understood right from the start that theyd be outnumbered they used firepower to make up for it these days more than a few us soldiers used captured cs automatic rifles the biggest problem with them was that they needed captured ammunition to stay usable back when the confederates were always pushing forward captured ammo was hard to come by now martins countrymen often overran cs positions both rifles and cartridges were in pretty fair supply lieutenant wheat stuck his head up like a groundhog looking around to see if it cast a shadow another burst of confederate fire made him duck in a hurry he popped up again a couple of minutes later which was asking to get his head blown off you want to be careful there sir martin said you show yourself twice running the bastards in butternut are liable to have time to draw a bead on you he didnt want this particular platoon commander to stop a slug with his face wheat had a pretty good idea of what he was doing odds were anyone who replaced him would be worse or maybe nobody would replace him for a while officers werent thick on the ground and the brass might figure a first sergeant could handle a platoon for a while martin figured he could too he led a company for a while during the great war when everybody above him got killed or wounded they lost officers even faster in that war than they were losing them in this one but having proved he could command a company martin didnt want to take over the platoon now theyd never make him an officerwho ever heard of a fiftyyearold second lieutenant he had plenty to do the way things were thanks for the tip sergeant wheat said as calmly as if chester advised him to lead the fourth highest from his longest and strongest suit im trying to see how we can cross the scioto we as in the division or we as in this platoon chester asked more than a little apprehensively before long us forces were bound to get over the scioto somewhere the luckless bastards who crossed the river first would pay the price in blood though they always did this platoon if we can wheat answered and damned if he didnt stand up and look around one more time were only about a mile from the river and the confederates are pulling back across it they may not even notice weve got the bridgehead on the other side till were too strong to throw back what have you been smoking martin wanted to yell the soldiers in butternut were alert just because they were the enemy that didnt mean they were morons most of this war was fought on us soil that at least argued the dummies were the ones in greengray another sputter of bullets made wheat duck down again before chester could say anything at all and then the confederates threw something new at them that screaming in the sky wasnt any ordinary artillery martin had ever heard and ordinary rounds didnt come in trailing tails of fire you mostly couldnt see ordinary rounds at all till they burst rockets chester thought featherstons men were firing them at barrels these were differentmuch bigger and nastier they slammed down and went off with roars like the end of the world he didnt know how many burst all at once a dozen two dozen something like that however many it was he felt as if god stamped on the platoon with both feet he wasnt ashamed to scream hell he was too scared not to nobody heard him not through that roar even if somebody did hear him so what he wouldnt be the only man yelling his head off he was sure of that and he didnt even get hurt except for being bruised and battered and half stunned by blast he was one of the lucky ones as his stunned ears came back to life he heard soldiers screaming to the right and left and behind him he scrambled over to the closest wounded man shrapnel had gouged a chunk out of the soldiers leg as chester dusted sulfa powder onto the wound and slapped a dressing over it the soldier said what the fuck was that sarge beats me johnny martin answered i just hope to christ we never see it again he injected the soldier with a morphine syrette knowing all too well the confederates would play with their new toy over and over again why would they do anything else wherever that salvo of rockets came from it did a better job of plastering a wide area with explosives than any other weapon hed ever seen fuck johnny said again biting his lip against the pain when do we get something like it that was another good question soon i hope martin said which was nothing but the truth now that his side knew the other side had something new and nasty how long would they need to copy it or come up with something on the same order months he thought glumly gotta be months that meant us soldiers would be on the receiving end for months too which was anything but a cheery idea chester yelled for the medics so did johnny they didnt come right away he wasnt surprised they had to be dealing with a lot of casualties if another salvo came in and then one did the incoming rockets shrieks put him in mind of damned souls he did some more shrieking himself when they crashed down blast picked him up and smashed him into the dirt oof he said struggling to breathe he tasted blood in his mouth if the confederates threw in a counterattack just then they could push as far as they wanted the platoonhell probably the whole damn regimentwas in no shape to stop them boy johnny said its a good thing they didnt have those a little while ago or theyd still be in pittsburgh he sounded detached almost indifferent the morphine was working its magic chester wished he could be indifferent to the chaos and carnage around him you aint kidding he said these rockets were very bad news somebody over in richmond was probably kicking somebody elses ass around the block for not thinking of them sooner or for not getting them into production fast enough motion behind him made him whirl ready to plug whoever made it easy buddy the soldier there said the man wore the same uniform he did even that didnt have to mean anything the confederates sometimes put their guys in greengray to raise hell behind us lines but this fellow had a red cross on his helmet red cross armbands and a white smock with big red crosses front and back you got a wounded guy here thats me johnny sounded halfway proud of himself part of that was the morphine talking and part of it was knowing he had a hometowner his wound wasnt enough to ruin him for life but it was plenty to keep him away from the front for a while chesters wound in the great war was one like that he actually did go back to toledo for a while to recuperate maybe johnny would get to see his family and friends well haul him out of here the corpsman yelled for buddies they manhandled johnny onto a stretcher and lugged him back toward the closest aid station chester hoped the rockets didnt knock it flat they sure did a hell of a job up here even if he got himself a hometowner this time around they wouldnt ship him over to los angeles he was as sure of that as he was of his last name yes the csas retreat from northern ohio meant the united states were no longer cut in half but it would be quite a while before anything but the most urgent supplies and people crossed the gap a general with a hometowner might fall into that category a sergeant damn well didnt a bullet cracking past made him flatten out on the ground like a runover toad he didnt want to get shot again not even with a hometowner and life didnt come with a guarantee you might not pick up a hometowner you might turn into graves registrations business not some corpsmans rita would never forgive him if he got himself killed not that hed be able to appreciate her anger half an hour later a thunderous us artillery barrage came down on the heads of the confederates withdrawing across the scioto every gun the usa had handy opened up on the men in butternut some of them would be screaming for medics no doubt about it but would all those guns match the horror the confederates inflicted with a couple of salvoes of rockets chester martin wasnt sure maybe the rockets seemed worse because hed been shelled too many times before and maybe they seemed worse because they were worse he feared he would see them again often enough to make up his mind in a way dr leonard odoull wasnt sorry to get back under canvas again it meant the front was moving forward hed spent longer than he wanted to working out of the university of pittsburghs medical center as the battle for the city swayed back and forth he didnt want to think about how much work he did there operating in a tent a few hundred yards back of the line also had its drawbacks what hed done at the medical center reminded him of that hed worked in fully equipped operating rooms with nurses at his beck and call and with xray equipment right down the corridor he had it easy in other words now he was on his own again doing the emergency work that patched people up well enough to get them farther back so other doctors could do a more thorough job if they had to it was or could be satisfying workhe saved a lot of lives and he knew it but he also knew he might save more still if he had everything here that he had back at the hospital he worked like a man possessed trying to save a private whod got caught in the open by one of the confederates newfangled rockets who would have thought wed see a new kind of wound he said tying off a bleeder and extracting a chunk of casing with a forceps half blast half shrapnel best of both worlds happy day granville mcdougald said arent we clever because odoull had an md he held officers rankthey made him a major when they talked him out of the republic of quebec and back into us uniform for the first time in a quarter of a century that didnt mean he would ever have to command a battalion a good thing for the battalion too he thought it did let him give orders to the men he worked with granny mcdougald was a sergeant hed been a medic as long as odoull had been a doctorhe didnt leave the army after the great war the way odoull did his knowledge was much narrower than the physicians but within its limits it was just as deep he was all too intimately familiar with the multifarious ways in which human bodies could get mangled he knew how to fix them too even without formal training he made a damn good surgeon he was a more than capable anesthetist too odoull knew mcdougald could do most of his work if anything happened to him the medic said i wonder when theyll figure out how to pack gas into those rockets above his mask his gray eyes were grim bite your tongue granny odoull exclaimed but what a us medic could imagine so no doubt could a cs engineer morosely odoull said probably just a matter of time uhhuh mcdougald said hows he doing there i think hell make it odoull answered ive got most of the wound cleaned up the blast damage to his lungs thoughdamn rocket might as well have been a bomb lucky they didnt point those things in our direction mcdougald said doesnt look like they can aim em for hell tabernac odoull muttered he still swore in quebecois french every once in a while it was almost the only language he spoke for half his life he never gave up reading english because so much medical literature was written in it but not much of his birthspeech came out of his mouth while he was living in riviereduloup you get the nicest ideas granny yeah well you go through a couple of wars and you figure anything that can come down can come down on your head odoull had his own fair share of the cynicism so many medical men wear when you spend your days looking at the way the human body can go wrongor in war can be made to go wrongyou are unlikely to believe as candide did that this is the best of all possible worlds but granny mcdougald had his fair share and what seemed like two or three other peoples besides you know what we really need mcdougald went on as odoull put in suture after suture tell me im all ears odoull replied must make sewing up that poor bastard kind of clumsy but all right the senior medic said what we really need is a bomb so big and juicy they wont waste it on the battlefield theyll drop it on new york city or new orleans and boomitll blow the whole place right off the map like that he snapped his fingers calisse odoull said and then son of a bitch why would you want a bomb like that because its the only thing i can think of thats so awful that after you use it a few times and everybody sees how awful it is itll scare the shit out of people and they wont want to use it any more if we had bombs like that and the csa did and england and france and germany and austriahungary and russia and the japs how the hell could you fight a war carefully odoull answered he set down his scalpel as granville mcdougald laughed ive got this guy stabilized or as stabilized as i can get him if his lungs arent wrecked and if the tissue the blast tore up doesnt go gangrenous on him chances are hell pull through good job doc i wouldnt have given more than about four bits for his chances when the corpsmen hauled him in mcdougald said a couple of minutes later at leonard odoulls direction the corpsmen sent the wounded man back to a real hospital several miles to the rear he might finish his recovery there or he might go farther back still odoull would have bet on the latterthis guy would live he thought but wasnt likely to put on a helmet and pick up a springfield again any time soon odoull shed his mask and tossed it in a trash can he washed the soldiers blood off his hands and chucked his surgical instruments into a tub of alcohol if he had time hed autoclave them before he used them again if he didntwell alcohol made a good disinfectant im going outside for a smoke before they bring in the next poor miserable soandso he said come with me you bet mcdougald said grab all the chances to loaf you canthey may not come your way again with ether and alcohol and other inflammables inside the aid station lighting up in there was severely discouragedwith a blunt instrument if necessary once odoull had stepped away from the greengray tent he took out a pack of niagara falls oh come on doc mcdougald pulled a horrible face havent you got anything better than those barge scrapings fraid not odoull admitted smoked my last confederate cigarette a couple of hours ago us tobacco wont kill me and its like coffeebad is better than none at all like booze too the medic said and the doctor didnt deny it mcdougald reached into his pocket and extracted a pack of dukes here bad is better than none but good is better than bad thanks granny i owe you odoull said the noncom was a better scrounger than he was some headline that made odoull took a cigarette and stuck it in his mouth mcdougald gave him a light he inhaled then smiled my hats off to the dukes i ought to make you put up your dukes for one that bad granville mcdougald paused except mine was even worse wasnt it sure wasnt any better odoull allowed but this tobacco is and i thank you for it any time mcdougald said not like i havent mooched butts from you a time or three the roar of artillery from behind them drowned his last couple of words the fire from the big and medium guns went on and on and on some of the shells flying west gurgled as they spun through the air leonard odoull winced at that sound gas rounds he tried to look on the bright side of things sounds like were finally going over the river and through the woods yeah but wheres grandmothers house mcdougald said while odoull was still digesting that the medic went on about time we got across the damn scioto dont you think hanging on to chillicothe like they have the confederates must have pulled god only knows how many men and how much materiel out of northern ohio you sure you dont belong back at corps hq or something odoull said mcdougald laughed at him they had time to finish their cigarettes and that was about it then the familiar and hated shout of doc hey doc rang out again im here odoull yelled more quietly he added well lets see what weve got this time they had a corporal with a bullet through his calf he was cussing a blue streak hey keep your shirt on pal granville mcdougald said if thats not a hometowner theres no such animal fuck hometowners the corporal snarled and fuck you too jack for one thing it hurts like shit and besides i dont want any goddamn hometowners i want to blow the balls off some more of featherstons fuckers a man of strong opinions odoull thought his voice dry he said its not usually smart to swear at the guy whos going to help fix you up you might find out it hurts even more than you expected and before you tell me where to head in you need to know im a major cussing out an officer was a good way for an enlisted man to run into more trouble than he ever wanted to find the noncom opened his mouth to draw in a breath about then though the novocaine odoull injected by the wound took effect what came out was oh yeah thats not so fucking bad now you can go ahead and sew me up he caught himself you can go ahead and sew me up sir odoull decided hed been given the glove by granny mcdougalds barely smothered snort he thought the same thing but the corporal scrupulously stayed within regulations odoull cleaned out the wound and sewed it up like it or not pal youve got a hometowner he said i know youd be happier if you didnt get shot but you could have stopped it with your face or your chest too oh yeah i know ive seen he broke off then shook his head i started to say ive seen as much of that shit as you have but i probably havent depends odoull answered we see plenty of nasty wounds but the poor guys who get killed on the spot dont make it back to us maybe it evens out hot damn the corporal said tell you one thing thoughits a bunch of fuckedup shit any which way buddy you are preaching to the choir granville mcdougald said solemnly odoull decided he couldnt have put it better himself from the deck of the uss townsend george enos watched two new escort carriers come into pearl harbor like the pair that had previously sailed from the west coast down to the sandwich islands the tripoli and the yorktown were as ugly as a mud fence they were built on freighter hulls with a flight deck and a little island slapped on topside they had a freighters machinery too and couldnt make better than eighteen knots unless they fell off a cliff but each one of them had thirty airplanes fighters dive bombers and torpedocarriers they werent fleet carriers since the loss of the remembrance more than a year earlier the usa had no fleet carriers operating in the pacific still they were ever so much better than no carriers at all which was what the united states had had in these waters for most of the time since the remembrance went to the bottom well doesnt look like the japs are going to drive us back to san francisco after all george remarked he spoke with the flat vowels and swallowed rs of the boston fisherman he was before he joined the navy to make sure the army didnt conscript him damn well better not said fremont blaine dalby the cpo who commanded the twin mm antiaircraft gun for which george jerked shells didnt look so good when they were bringing their carriers down from midway and knocking the snot out of us here george said they had their chance now its our turn chief dalby was a man who knew what he knew even his name showed that it showed he came from a rockribbed republican family in a country where the republicans caught between the socialists and the democrats hadnt amounted to a hill of beans since the s about time too fritz gustafson the gun crews loader talked as if the government charged him for every word he said if we can get midway back george said thatd be pretty good dalby agreed he wasnt shy about talkingnot even a little bit run the japs out there run em off wake too so they dont come back to midway and then we can stop worrying about the real sandwich islands the ones down here for a while gotta hang on to hotel street gustafson said george and fremont dalby both snorted hotel street not only had more saloons and cathouses per square inch than any other street in honolulu it probably had more than any other street in the world sailors and soldiers and marines might not give a damn about the sandwich islands as a whole but theyd be bound to fight like men possessed to keep hotel street in american hands think four of these baby flattops are enough to take midway george asked dunno i aint no admiral dalby said as a cpo he had a much smaller sphere of authority than a man with a broad gold stripe on his sleeve but within that sphere his authority was hardly less absolute tell you what thoughi hope like hell theres a couple more of those babies somewhere halfway between here and the coast yeah george nodded there was a gap in the middle of the eastern pacific that neither aircraft from oahu nor those from the west coast could cover very well japan had done her best to get astride the supply line between the mainland and the sandwich islands and starve the islands into submission it didnt quite work but it came too close for comfort both metaphorically and literally thinking of us warplanes looking for enemy aircraft and ships made george notice the combat air patrol above pearl harbor fighters always buzzed overhead these days yranging gear should be able to give us forces enough warning to scramble airplanes but nobody seemed inclined to take chances wonder how come jap engines sound screechier than ours george said japanese carrierbased fighters had strafed the townsend more than once he knew the sound of those engines better than he wanted to they take em out of the washing machines they used to buy from us dalby suggested george laughed any joke a cpo made was funny because a cpo made it the townsend sailed a couple of days later escorting the tripoli and the yorktown north and west toward midway they wouldnt get there in a hurry not at the escort carriers lackadaisical cruising speed george wasnt enthusiastic about getting there at all hed gone north and west from oahu too many times and sailed into danger each and every one of them you always ran to your battle station like a madman when general quarters sounded when you didnt know if it was a drill or the real mccoy you ran even harder run as he would george couldnt get to the twin mm mount ahead of fremont dalby the gun chief seemed drawn there by magnetism instead of his legs which were shorter than georges what can i tell you he said when george asked him about it i know ive got to be here so i damn well am in a way that didnt make any sense at all in another way it did up above the bridge the yranging antenna spun round and round round and round it would pick up incoming japanese aircraft long before the naked eye could how much good picking them up ahead of time would do was an open question they werent any easier for guns on the destroyer to shoot down with luck though fighters from the carriers could drive them off before they got within gunnery range few of the islands north and west of kauai were inhabited if not for its position midway wouldnt have been either albatrosses and other sea birds nested on the rocks and reefs rising above the pacific some of the enormous birds glided past the townsend and the other ships in the flotilla pointing to a longwinged albatross george said im surprised yranging doesnt pick up those things theyre damn near as big as a fighter he exaggerated but not too much i hear from the guys on the hydrophones that theyve got to be careful or else they really can mistake a whale for a suband the other way round fremont dalby said that wouldnt be good george said no shit no fritz gustafson didnt talk a lot but he got plenty of mileage out of what he did say as they got closer to midway tension built george didnt want to do anything but stick close to his gun the townsend had come through a couple of ferocious attacks blazing away with everything you had gave you a chance to come through but the pilots in the enemy airplanes were the guys in the drivers seat these days dive bombers and escorting fighters roared off the escort carriers and flew up toward midway still not obvious the japs have yranging dalby said if they dont we can plaster their aircraft on midway before they even know were on the way wouldnt break my heart george said bastards tried to do it to us at pearl harbor not like we dont owe em if theyd done it i bet they would have followed up with a landing the gun chief said maybe well be able to do the same up here before long that wouldnt break my heart either george said the more time went by without a warning over the pa that the yranging gear was picking up enemy airplanes the happier he got maybe the american bombers really were knocking the daylights out of whatever the japs still had on midway then the speakers crackled to life george groaned and he wasnt the only one may i have your attention the exec said as if he didnt know he would our aircraft report the japanese appear to have abandoned midway may i have your attention our aircraft report the japanese appear to have abandoned midway fuck me fremont dalby said reverently wow george agreed little yellow bastards know how to cut their losses dalby said if they cant take the sandwich islands whats midway worth to em its out at the ass end of nowhere and its got to be even more expensive for the japs to supply than it is for us what do you want to bet theyve bailed out of wake too george said i wouldnt mind the gun chief told him beats working fritz gustafson said oh hell yes dalby said if theyre gone from midway and wake what are we gonna do go after em charge through all their little islands and head for the philippines we need the philippines like we need a hole in the head amen george said if they want to call this mess a draw i dont mind i dont mind a bit the rest of the gun crew nodded theyd all developed a thoroughgoing respect for japanese skill and courage the japs had already come too close to killing them more than once george knew he wouldnt be sorry never to see any more maneuverable fighters with meatballs on their wings but that raised another question george asked it if the japs are pulling back here where are they going to use their ships and airplanes he assumed japan would use them somewhere in a war that was what you did fremont dalby suddenly started to laugh malaya singapore what do you want to bet malayas got tin and rubber and singapores the best goddamn harbor in that whole part of the world but they belong to england george objected england and japan are on the same side were fritz gustafson said dalby nodded i think you nailed that one fritz englands busy in europe englands busy in the atlantic against us what can the fuckin limeys do if japan decides to go in there jack shit far as i can see when churchill hears about this i bet he craps his pants so lets see george said japans at war with us and englands at war with us but away from all that theyre at war with each other you ask me theyre trying to set a world record better them than us dalby said only way englands stayed in the far east as long as she has is that japans let her if japan doesnt want her around any morewell she may hang on to india her goose is really cooked if she doesnt george said yeah thats why shes got to try i expect the gun chief said but japans already in indochina shes already in the east indies siams on her side not englands what with all that no way in hell the limeys keep her out of malaya japan has all that stuff shell be really nasty twenty thirty years down the line fritz gustafson said lets worry about winning this one first george said and neither of the other men chose to disagree with him even though jefferson pinkard had run camp determination since the day it started going up on the west texas prairie he got his news on the wireless just like everybody else in the csa in heavy defensive fighting just southeast of lubbock confederate troops inflicted heavy losses on the yankee invaders the announcer said that same bulletin probably went out all over the confederate states if you didnt have a map handy and you didnt bother working out what lay behind what actually got said it sounded pretty good like a lot of people though jeff knew what lay behind it and he didnt need a map to know where lubbock was defensive fighting meant the confederates were retreating just southeast of lubbock meant the town had fallen heavy losses on the yankee invaders meantnothing probably and lubbock was just up the road from snyderand from the camp just up the road in texas meant about eighty miles soldiers in greengray wouldnt be here day after tomorrow jefferson pinkard and camp determination were ready if the damnyankees did come close the trucks that asphyxiated negroes would drive away the bathhouses that gassed them would go up in explosions that ought to leave no sign of what the buildings were for the paperwork that touched on killings would burn nothing would be left except an enormous concentration camp and mass graves jeff didnt know what to do about those he didnt think he could do much of anything oh bulldozers could cover over all of the trenches but nothing could dispose of all the bodies and bones he got to his feet and stared out at the camp from the window in his office he looked like what he was a middleaged man whod been a steelworker when he was younger yes his belly hung over his trousers and he had a double chin but he also had broad shoulders and a hard core of muscle under the weight hed put on as the years went by and he had the straightforward stubbornness of a man whod worked with his hands and expected problems to go away if you put some extra muscle into them not all of a camp administrators problems disappeared so conveniently he knew that hed gained guile as well as weight over the years still his first impulse was to try to smash whatever got in his way he couldnt smash the damnyankees singlehanded hed fought in west texas during the great war as a private soldier even now he had no particular clout with local army officers his freedom party rankgroup leaderwas the equivalent of major general but he had no authority over army troops no direct authority anyhow he did have friends or at least associates in high places when he got on the phone to richmond he didnt call the war department he called the attorney generals office he didnt love ferdinand koenig who kept piling responsibility onto his back as if he were a mule here though the two of them were traveling the same road pinkard hoped they were anyhow what can i do for you today koenig asked when the connection went through he assumed pinkard wanted him to do something and he was right any chance you can get more soldiers on this front sir pinkard asked if lubbocks gone we got us some real trouble well now you know that isnt my proper place koenig said cautiously i cant come out and tell the army what to do yes sir i know that i damn well ought to damn soldiers wont listen to me neither jeff spoke with the resentment of a man whod tried to get them to move but couldnt but does the president want the damnyankees to take camp determination away from us you know he doesnt now koenig spoke without hesitation well i sure hope he doesnt anyway but if he doesnt we better have the men out here to keep the usa from doing it jeff said weve got trouble other places too the attorney general reminded him oh yes sir you dont need to tell me that jeff said but we got trouble here too and were out in the back of fucking beyondpardon my frenchso who ever hears about it yankee general hasnt got much more than a scratch force himself some more men some more airplanes some more barrels we can run him right back over the border i cant promise you anything ferdinand koenig said ill talk to the president and thats as much as i can tell you thank you kindly sir thats all i wanted jeff lied he wanted a couple of divisions rolling through snyder on their way to driving the damnyankees back from lubbock he thought camp determination deserved to be protected wouldnt want the united states going on about this place if they grabbed it no we dont want that koenig agreed ill see what i can do and thats all i can say all right jeff knew he wouldnt get anything more he tried to make sure he did get something doesnt even have to be regular confederate soldiers most of what we need out here is bodies so the damnyankees cant just go around us mexicans would do the trick or freedom party guards wont be mexicans koenig said the emperor doesnt want em going into combat against the usa not any more only way the president talked him into giving us more was by swearing on a stack of bibles he wouldnt use em for anything but internal security freedom party guards though he paused thoughtfully pinkard was a fisherman from way back when he knew he had a nibble trying to set the hook he said this might be a good place to let the guards show what they can do if they fight harder than soldiers he paused too the freedom party guards were ferd koenigs own personal private bailiwick if they fought better than soldiers or at least as well then koenig had his own personal private army he might not mind that no he might not mind that at all he was nobodys fool either if jefferson pinkard could see the possibilities he would also be able to but all he said was well ill see what the president wants to do he was a cool customer he didnt get all excitedor he didnt show it if he did and the odds were that somebody was tapping his telephone too sure he went back forever with jake featherston all the more reason for featherston to make sure he didnt get out of line wasnt it pinkard got off the phone when you were talking with the higherups you didnt want to waste their time hed done everything he reasonably could now he had to wait and see if the attorney general could run with the ball and he had to make sure the camp went on running smoothly regardless of where the yankees were ever since he first started taking care of prisoners during the mexican civil war in the s hed been convinced the only way you could keep your finger on the pulse of what was going on was by seeing for yourself a lot of ways his office looked like any other confederate bureaucrats most bureaucrats though didnt have a submachine gun hanging on the wall by their desk pinkard grabbed the weapon attached a big snaildrum magazine and went out to take a look around a couple of junior guards fell in behind him when he did that was all right nobody armed had any business going into the camp alone except in an emergency the puppies wouldnt cramp pinkards style they wouldnt know where he was going and what he was doing because he wouldnt know himself till he started doing it that often made his subordinates despair but more than once it let him nip what could be trouble before it got too big to be easily nippable the guards at the barbedwirestrung gates between the administrative compound and the camp proper saluted him group leader they chorused at ease at ease he said returning the salute part of him liked being treated like the equivalent of a major general another part the part that was a private during the great war thought it all a bunch of damn foolishness right now that part had the upper hand after the guards let him and his watchdogs through the inner gate they closed it behind him then they opened the outer gate he and the younger men walked into the camp even the stink seemed stronger on this side of the barbed wire maybe that was jeffs imagination he couldnt prove it wasnt but his nose wrinkled at the odors of unwashed skin and sewage skinny negroes stared at him as if hed fallen from another world by the difference between his life and theirs he might as well have the wreathed stars on either side of his collar drew the black men as honey drew flies you gots to let me out suh one man said you gots to is an innocent man kin we have us mo food another negro asked my fambly said another is my fambly all right everybodys in here for a reason jeff spoke with complete certainty he knew what the reason was too youre a bunch of niggers oh the freedom party still ran camps for white unreliables too the whole camp system cut its teeth on them but not many white unreliables were left any more the party also had better ways to get rid of them these days slap a uniform on an unreliable stick a rifle in his hands put him in a punishment battalion and throw him at the damnyankees most of those people loved the united states anyway only fair they should die at us hands and if they took out a few soldiers in greengray before they got theirs so much the better food that second negro said wes powerful hungry suh im spreading out the ration best way i know how pinkard said which was trueall the inmates starved at the same rate if i had more id share it out too that was also true he was cruel because he found himself in a cruel situation not because he enjoyed cruelty for its own sake he understood the difference whether a scrawny black prisoner didmattered very little to him when the scrawny black looked at him it wasnt at his fleshy face but at his even fleshier belly you aint missed no meals the thought hung in the air but the negro knew better than to say it he turned away instead hands curling into useless fists as for the man with the family he was already gone he must have realized he wouldnt get any help from jeff pinkard and he was right he wouldnt other blacks came up with their futile requests jeff listened to them not that it did the blacks much good every once in a while though somebody betrayed an uprising or an escape plot all by itself that made these prowlthroughs worth doing the ones who did squeal got their reward too a big supper where the other inmates could watch them eat and a ride out of camp determinationin one of the sealed trucks that asphyxiated their passengers that was a shame but what could you do the csa had no room for negroes any more not even for negroes who played along guards kept a long file of men moving toward the bathhouse come on one of them called come on goddammit you dont want to be a bunch of lousy stinking niggers when we ship your asses out of here do you jeff pinkard smiled to himself by the time the negroes got out of the bathhouse they wouldnt care one way or the otheror about anything else ever again but as long as they didnt know that beforehand everything was fine you there si you mallate scipio stared in alarm were he white he would have turned whiter the guard with the sergeants stripes was pointing at him he hadnt been in camp determination long before he realized you didnt want guards singling you out for anything at all and mallate from a sonoran or chihuahuan as this fellow plainly was meant the same thing as nigger from an ordinary white confederate he had to answer the only thing worse than getting singled out by a guard was pissing one off yes suh what you need suh you named uh xerxes asked the swarthy blackhaired sergeant yes suh thats my name at least the man wasnt asking for him as scipio even though he used it here himself hearing it in a guards mouth might mean his revolutionary past in south carolina had popped up again if it had he was a dead mana little sooner than he would be anyway once you landed in here your chances werent good any which way the guard gestured with his submachine gun you come here did some special school teach guards that move they all seemed to know it it was amazingly persuasive too is comin scipio said if you told a guard no that was commonly the last thing you ever told anybody legs light with fear scipio stepped away from barracks even is comin might be the last thing he ever told anyone that sergeant and his two white flunkies looked ready to chalk him up to shot while attempting to escape you know two women named bathsheba and antoinette the guard demanded in his mouth scipios wifes name came out as batcheba scipio almost didnt recognize it but he nodded yes suh i knows dey he said fear and hope warred leaving his voice husky is deyis dey all right he had to fight to get the words out they all right si the guard nodded too they say they hope you all right too do jesus relief flooded through scipio thank you suh thank from from de bottom o my heart you see dey again you tell dey is doin fine no black in camp determination was doing fine his wife and daughter were bound to know that as well as he did they didnt want him to worry though and he didnt want them to either i tell em the guard sergeant from sonora or chihuahua gave him one more brusque nod then strode away the two bigger men still at his heels bathsheba and antoinette were still alive there was still hope and lubbock belonged to the yankees like a lot of negroes in the csa scipio would have been a patriot if only the whites around him let him the confederate states were the only country he had but if his own homeland set out to do horrible things to him and the people he loved then its enemies became his friends he laughed not that it was funny from everything hed heard the mormons up in utah were as firm in denying negroes equality as white confederates were even if they had different reasons he sympathized with them now no matter what they believed what the united states were doing to them wasnt that different from what the confederate states were doing to blacks and yet you never could tell even in this hellhole that guard went out of his way to deliver the message from bathsheba and antoinette he didnt have to do that he could have refused them straight out he could have promised to pass along their words and then gone on about his business he hadnt decency cropped up in the strangest places scipio looked north he could see the womens barracks there on the other side of the railroad line that brought his family here not one but two barbedwire perimeters separated him from his loved ones he drew himself up a little straighter the train ride from augusta didnt kill him if it didnt could anything he didnt believe it he wouldnt believe it his gaze swung from the north the unattainable toward the northwest the yankees might well come down to camp determination if lubbock was gone other west texas towns could fall he just had to stay alive till us troops arrived just that made it sound easier than it was he still didnt know how many people died in that cattle car he didnt know why he still lived either plenty of men and women younger and stronger than he was were dead if he could make the yankees listen to his story maybe his survival would mean something bathsheba would say so she believed things happened for reasons she believed god watched over people scipio wished he could do the same he also wished god did a better job of watching over the negroes in the csa he wished god did any kind of job of watching over them as far as he could see god was out to a film leaving them to fend for themselves the only trouble with that was the freedom party had a lot more fending power than the negroes did labor gang a guard shouted need fifty volunteers for a labor gang labor gangs left the camp with men chained to one another like criminals they worked killing hours on little food when they came back the men in them were worn to nubs the guard could have got five hundred volunteers or five thousand work on a labor gang was real work and you did come back when you went out nobody knew what happened when you got shipped to another camp a lot of people muttered about that if you muttered too loud you had a way of getting shipped out yourself then other people muttered about what happened to you except for the labor gangs there was nothing to do inside the camp but stew and starve if the confederate authorities were smart they could have set up factories where the negroes theyd dragged from the cities and countryside could make things for them the authorities didnt bother they just didnt care the only sport in camp was watching new fish come in scipio had been a new fish himself not so long before now he watched other dazed thirsty halfstarvedor sometimes more than thatmen stagger into camp determination their astonishment was funny as his must have been to those who arrived before him what you lookin at a black man would yell at the newcomers yall reckon yous in new yawk city scipio didnt understand why but talking about new york city never failed to send the prisoners into gales of laughter for as long as he could remember the biggest town in the usa had been the symbol of degeneracy and depravity to white confederates in films made in the csa new york city seemed entirely populated by villains and lounge lizards and slutty women maybe that was part of it but new york city was also full of riches and luxury no matter how white confederates despised the place they couldnt deny or ignore it that probably made the camp jokes funnier and sometimes things didnt have to make any sense at all to be funny sometimes not making sense was the point of the joke you park your cadillac car outside befo you come in the wit would call to the new fish it was always a cadillac car never just a cadillac scipio didnt know why that was so but it was it was one more thing that made the jokes funnier sometimes a new fish would have spirit enough to say something like you niggers crazy that would send the camp veterans into capers as wild as they had the energy to perform we sure is crazy someone would say if you aint crazy in dis here place you gots to be nuts at one level that made no sense at all at another level it held a profound truth scipio was used to thinking in terms like that anne colleton made sure he was thoroughly educated not for his sake but so he made a better butler a better ornament for the marshlands plantation marshlands was a ruin today anne colleton was dead killed in the early days of the war when us carrierbased bombers hit charleston and here i am in camp determination much good my education did me scipio thought the one thing that mattered in the csa was his color how smart he was that he could quote shakespeare from memory nobody white cared a bit the negro whod made the crack about craziness was just making a joke scipio was sure he didnt see that he was kidding on the square he talked like a field hand he certainly wasnt educated he probably wasnt very smart what difference did it make here he was and here scipio was they had equality of a sortequality of misery this batch of new fish had no trouble finding bunksa large number of men were transferred to other camps just a couple of days before they got here people came into camp determination they went out nobody seemed to stay very long that could have been why all the rumors swirled around the trucks and the bathhouses scipio hoped that was the reason and then he got the chance to find out for himself when his barracks lined up for roll call one morning a guard shouted were gonna ship your asses to abilene head on over to the bathhouse dont want you bringin lice an fleas an shit like that with you so were gonna wash you off and delouse you befo breakfast somebody said in dismay youll get breakfast on the trucks that take you east the guard said they got bread an all kinds of good stuff from what i hear they feed you better in abilene than we do here that sent a buzz through the assembled negroes whatever the food in abilene was like it couldnt very well be worse than it was here nobody raised any particular fuss as the guards marched the negroes to the bathhouse anyone who did raise a fuss would have been sorry the guards carried automatic rifles as well as submachine guns and looked very ready to use them among the guards was the mexicanlooking sergeant whod delivered the message from bathsheba and antoinette seeing him made scipio feel better he didnt think the man would let anything bad happen to him inside the bathhouse the guards ordered the negroes to take off their rags and store them in cubbies one of the grayuniformed men who watched them do it said remember where your shits at anybody tries stealing somebody elses duds hes gonna wish he was never born a sign pointed the way to the delousing station the naked black men walked along the corridor in that direction it was a big chamber but they filled it up scipio noticed the door was steel with rubber gasketing around the edges his unease began there but for a few metal columns with grillwork at the bottom the chamber was bare a sign over a door in the far wall said to the baths hed heard veterans both white and black go on about great war delousing stations either theyd changed the way things worked since or some kind of gas started pouring out of the grillwork even a tiny whiff of it set scipios lungs on fire he ran toward that door in the far wall other blacks got there ahead of him they screamed in despairthe door didnt open they fooled us scipio thought they fooled us good damn them half crushed in the panic half poisoned by the gas he crumpled blackness enfolded him iv up until a few years earlier sharecroppers lived in this sorry little collection of shacks now the buildings stood sad and vacant under georgias mild spring sun where did everybody go jonathan moss asked did the freedom party catch the people who were here and send them to a camp to his surprise spartacus shook his head dont reckon so the black guerrilla leader answered reckon they went to town to look for work there werent no mo work here thats fo damn sure why the hell not nick cantarella asked you got nothin but miles and miles of cotton farms and tobacco farms and shit like that spartacus surprised moss again this time by chuckling in grim amusement you is a city fella spartacus said not unkindly you is a city fella an you dont see how the country work used to be plenty jobs fo nigger field hands yeah then the freedom party make all these tractors an harvesters an shit throw lawd only know how many niggers outa work goddamn bastards thats not all it did cantarella said factories they built to turn out those tractors and harvesters theyre making barrels and armored cars nowadays you can bet your ass on that sly moss said sly twice because it let them drive the negroes off the fields and let them gear up for turning out war machines without making the usa flabble about it fuck me spartacus said looking from one of them to the other i seen the first part o dat on account of it happen to me an mine but the other halfdidnt worry bout dat none yeah well those freedom party fuckers wouldnt be half so dangerous if the guys running the show for em were dumb cantarella said featherstons a maniac but hes a goddamn smart maniac you know what i mean jonathan moss did and wished he didnt fighting the war against the confederates hadnt proved anything to him one way or the other soldiers were soldiers and sometimes where they came from hardly mattered military life had rhythms of its own but his time since escaping from andersonville told a different story hed wondered how the confederates could hold down the countryside with so many whites of military age off fighting the usa now he knew if negroes in the countryside lost their jobs a lot of them had to go to the csas cities and towns where they were easier to keep track of and get hold of no the people at the top of the freedom party werent dumb at all too damn bad meanwhile some of the blacks still in the countryside did their best to make the confederates unhappy spartacus said reckon we kin spend the night heah aint nobody round seen us go in bettern sleepin on bare ground moss didnt argue with that his middleaged bones thought anything was better than sleeping on bare ground war was a young mans game as a fighter pilot hed made up in experience what he lacked in exuberance even so hed needed more rest and more regular rest than his young comrades and he wasnt able to fly as many missions here on the ground in georgia his years shoved themselves in his face in all kinds of ways he got tired he got hungry when the shooting started he got scared spartacus black guerrillas were mostly young and entirely fearless when they attacked whites they did it with a fierce joy almost an exaltation that left him admiring and astonished he didnt think hed ever felt that ferocious in an airplane over canada in the last war of course he hadnt had such good reasons for ferocity either he went into one of the cabins it smelled all musty it had been deserted for some time and water and mold had their way inside but even brandnew it would have indicted the system that produced it no running water no plumbing no electricity no gas not even a woodburning stoveall the cooking was done over a fireplace ive seen horses with better stalls than this he said yeah nick cantarella nodded tell you something else toohorses deserve better than this so do people not much was left inside the cabin to show how the people who used it had lived a cheap pine stool lay tumbled in a corner a few dishes just as cheap some of them broken sat on a counter when moss put the stool back on its legs he found a rag doll face leprous with mildew forgotten behind it did some little colored girl cry and cry because that doll was lost hed never know now any more than hed know whether that little girl was still alive cant even light a fire cantarella grumbled anybody white sees smoke coming out of the chimney hell sic the mexicans on us yeah well it could be worse moss said they could have guys after us who really want to fight nick cantarella laughed though he wasnt kidding francisco joses soldiers rapidly discovered the black guerrillas were desperately in earnest spartacus men didnt need long to figure out that the soldiers from the empire of mexico werent at least if not under direct attack the mexicans didnt want to be in georgia they resented cs whites almost as much for making them come up here as they resented cs blacks for having the gall to shoot back it wasnt quite a plague on both your houses but it came close what do we have for food cantarella asked ive got some ham and cornbread how about you cornbread too and ive still got a couple of ration cans from that dead mexican we found cantarella grimaced damned if i know how the confederates go on eating that slop i mean the stuff we have is lousy but this is a hell of a lot worse its pretty bad moss agreed pilots ate better than soldiers in the fieldmost of the time anyway he went on its better than what we got in andersonville though except when the red cross packages came through rations for pows were supposed to be the same as what the captors soldiers got theory was wonderfuleither that or the confederate states were in more trouble than anybody north of the masondixon line suspected they shared what they had it filled their bellies although a chef at the waldorfastoriaor even a mess sergeantwould have turned up his nose or more likely his toes despite lacking a fire moss appreciated being able to sleep with a wall no matter how drafty between him and the outside world what georgia called winter had been mild by the standards of ontario or chicago but it still got chilly spring days were warmer spring nights didnt seem to be then again moss suspected he could sleep through an artillery duel in the middle of a blizzard any chance for sleep he got he grabbed with both hands he knew his age was showing knew and didnt care captain cantarella shook him awake much too early the next morning any time before the next afternoon would have been too early but the sun was barely over the horizon moss yawn almost made the top of his head fall off already he croaked fraid so cantarella answered theyve got coffee going out there if that makes you feel any better not much moss said but he sat up what they call coffeell be nothing but that goddamn chicory anyhow maybe a little bit of the real bean cantarella said and chicoryll open your eyes too yeah but it tastes like youre drinking burnt roots moss said thats cause you are cantarella said cheerfully if you dont get your ass in gear though you wont get to drink any burnt roots on account of everybody else will have drunk em all up there was a threat to conjure with moss got to his feet he creaked and crunched but he made himself move after a tin cup full of essence of burnt rootsand maybe a little bit of the real beanlife looked better or at least less blurry moss munched on a chunk of cornbread spartacus squatted beside him nigger come out from americus in the night the guerrilla leader remarked he say theres a train comin we gots to blow gots to sabotage he spoke the last word with sardonic relish and jonathan moss liked the idea of striking a train better than he liked going into these halfassed georgia towns and shooting them up shooting up a town annoyed the confederates and made them flabble wrecking a train though meant the men and munitions aboard either wouldnt get into the fight against the usa or would get there late sounds good he said whats on this one do you know oh i know all right spartacus sounded thoroughly grim niggers is on it huh even after the mostly ersatz coffee moss wasnt at his best niggers spartacus repeated from noth carolina i reckon theys headin for them camps they git there they dont come out no mo so we gots to make sure they aint gonna git there rescuing a trainload of blacks wouldnt do the usa much good but moss didnt even dream of trying to talk the guerrilla chieftain out of it spartacus had his own worries his own agenda when those took him on a track that also helped the united states he didnt mind when they didnt he didnt care one of his men knew more about dynamiting train tracks than nick cantarella did and cantarella was no blushing innocent the us officer did suggest a diversionary raid a few miles away to give the explosives manhis name also likely a nom de guerre was samsona chance to work undisturbed spartacus liked that sneaky fucker you he said nothing but admiration in his voice he sent off a few of his men to shoot at trucks on the highway that would be plenty to draw the confederates attentionand that of their mexican stooges too the rest of the band lurked close by where samson did his job the train pushed a heavily laden flat car ahead of the locomotive that kept samsons bomb from wrecking the engine itself against some kinds of sabotage it might have mattered but the bomb still made the train stop then the guerrillas sprayed the engine and the men inside with gunfire steam plumed from the punctured boiler some of spartacus men ran forward to open the passenger cars and freight cars in the train others stayed back to cover them jonathan moss was one of those who hung backhe doubted the negroes in there would welcome any white face just then blacks began spilling out more and more and more of them sweet jesus cantarella said how many smokes did those freedom party bastards cram in there too many moss said and then now i believe every atrocity story i ever heard you dont pack people in like that if you dont mean to dispose of them he watched in horrified fascination as the negroes scattered over the countryside they didnt know where they were going where they would sleep or whatif anythingthey would eat but they were sure of one thing and so was he whatever happened to them here they would be better off than if this train got to where it was going most of the time irving morrell didnt like getting called back to philadelphia for consultation some things though were too big to plan on the back on an envelope what to do once the usa drove the csa out of ohio seemed to fall into that category brigadier general john abell met him at the broad street station the tall thin pale general staff officer was as much a product of the war department as morrell was of the field morrell was sure abell distrusted him as much as he distrusted the other man and for reasons probably mirroring his own good to see you under these circumstances abell said shaking his hand good to be here under these circumstances morrell answered better by far to come to philadelphia to plan the next attack than to figure out how to defend the city more than eighty years had passed since a confederate army reached philadelphia morrell devoutly hoped the city never saw another one as they walked from the station to the auto abell had waiting the general staff officer said when we beat the confederates this time were going to beat them so flat theyll never give us trouble again well beat them so flat they wont even think about raising a hand against us from now on i like that morrell said the enlisted man driving the governmentissue chevrolet sprang out to open the back door for his exalted passengers after morrell slid into the greengray auto he went on can we bring it off militarily i think we can it wont be easy or cheap but we can do it abell sounded coldly confident we can and we need to and so we will as if to underscore his determination the chevy rolled by a downed confederate bomber behind a barricade of boards on sawhorses technicians swarmed over the airplane partly to see if the enemy had come up with anything new and partly to salvage whatever they could oh yeahi think we can whip em too morrell said but we have to occupy them once we do otherwise theyll just start rearming on the sly the way they did after the great war john abell nodded you and i are on the same page all right he let out a small chuckle theyd known each other for close to thirty years and that wasnt the kind of thing either one of them said every day then he went on plans for doing that are already being prepared good are the planners working out how much itll cost us morrell asked abell made a questioning noise morrell explained they hate us down there they hate us bad maybe they hate their own negroes worse but maybe they dont too and its awful easy to make a guerrilla war hurt occupiers these days auto bombs people bombs land mines time bombs these goddamn newfangled rockets it was bad when we tried to hold down houston and kentucky itll be worse now freedom he added the last word with sour emphasis general abell looked painednot so much for the wit morrell judged as for what lay behind it maybe its a good thing youre here for more than one reason abell said you ought to write an appreciation with all that in mind no one will appreciate it if i do morrell said that made abell look more pained still but he said you might also be surprised were looking at this were looking at it very seriously because we think we need to if you point out some pitfalls that will be to everyones advantageexcept the confederates of course he was serious the war department was serious then whatever else you could say about john abell he made a good weather vane if we occupy the csa we wont even pretend to be nice people any more morrell warned itll be like utah only more so well have to kill anybody who gives us a hard time and maybe kill the guys brotherinlaw to make sure he doesnt give us a hard time afterwards that is the working assumption yes abell agreed matteroffactly morrell let out a soft whistle lord he said if the confederates are killing off their own negroes the way we say they are they are abells voice went hard and flat thats not just propaganda general they really are doing it however many times morrell had heard about that he didnt want to believe it because the confederates fought clean on the battlefield he wished they played fair with their own people too but abells certainty was hard not to credit sighing morrell went on well if theyre doing that and if we kill off any whites who get out of line people are liable to get thin on the ground down there yes thats true spring was here but abell remained blizzardcold and so he envisioned massacre as calmly as jake featherston did the only difference was he might let whites in the csa live if they stayed quiet featherston killed off negroes whether they caused trouble or nothis assumption was that negroes were trouble period the distinction didnt seem enormous morrell clung to it nonetheless either this town was already as beatup as it could be or it hasnt taken a whole lot of new damage since the last time i was here he remarked the confederates still come over abell said maybe not so muchand we can hurt them more when they do that sounds good morrell said but when he got to the war department he went undergroundfar underground brigadier general abell had to vouch for him before he even got into the battered building the stars on his shoulders meant nothing to the guards at the entrance that was how it should be as far as morrell was concerned no one has been able to blow himself up inside yet abell said with what sounded like pride they went down endless flights of stairs morrell revised his notions about whether people around here ever got exercise climbing those stairs on the way back up would be no joke how close have they come he asked somebody dressed like a major took out a guard crew at the eastern entrance a couple of weeks ago abell answered one of the men there must have seen something he didnt like and so yeah and so morrell said i wonder how long itll be before they start using twoman suicide crews the first fellow blows himself up then the next one waits till the place is crowded before he uses his bombeither that or he uses the confusion to sneak into wherever he really wants to go it works with auto bombs i know the negroes in the csa have done it it might work with people bombs too youre just full of happy thoughts this morning arent you john abell said well put that in your appreciation too if you can think of it we have to believe those mormon bastards can too he made a sour face probably not going to be many people left alive in utah by the time thats all done either no morrell agreed his own name for planning had suffered when a great war attack against the rebels there didnt go as well as it might have he was banished from the general staff back to the field thena fate that dismayed him much less than his banishers thought it would he said one thingif we need to sow the place with salt we wont have to go very far to get it erno abell didnt know what to make of foolishness he never had to morrells relief he left the stairwell before they got all the way to china the map room is this way he said reviving a little separate a general staff officer from his maps and he was only half a man officers ranging in rank from captain to major general pored over maps on tables and walls those maps covered the uscs frontier from sonora all the way to the atlantic some of the men in greengray used their pointers decorously like schoolteachers others plied them with brio like orchestra conductors still others might have been knights swinging swords they slashed and hacked at the territory they wanted to conquer morrell was a slasher himself he grabbed a pointer from a bin that looked like an archers quiver and advanced on a map showing the border between the appalachians and the mississippi this is what i want to do he said and executed a stroke that would have disemboweled the confederacy if it went across the real landscape instead of a map john abells pale eyebrows rose you dont think small do you ive been accused of a lot of things but rarely that morrell said we can do it you know we should have started building up a little sooner but i really think we can do it abell studied the map he borrowed the pointer from morrell and walked over to another map his slash was as surgical as morrells if less melodramatic this would be your followup he inquired absolutely morrell set a hand on the other mans shoulder if were thinking along the same lines chances are this will really work because we never do that or we never didnow its twice in just a little while more likely were both deluded the general staff officer replied morrell laughed hoping abell was joking abell studied the map himself this may be a twoyear campaign you know not just one thatspossible morrell said reluctantly but i dont think the confederates will have a whole lot more than wind and air once we breach their front they shot their bolt and they hurt us but they didnt quite kill us now its our turn and lets see how they like playing defense defense is cheaper than offense abell warned and they have some new toys of their own these multiple rocket launchers are very unpleasant he hadnt come within a hundred miles of those rocket launchershe was that kind of soldierbut he spoke with authority even so where are our new toys morrell asked i thought you might be wondering about that with the air of a stage magician plucking a rabbit from a hat john abell took a folded sheet of paper out of his breast pocket tell me what you think about this morrell paused to put on reading glasses a concession to age he hated but couldnt do without he unfolded the paper and skimmed through it the more he read the wider his smile got well well he said this is more like it but there isnt anything about when theyll be ready are we talking about soon or is this in the great byandby soon abell said immediately as a matter of fact theyre coming off the lines in pontiacand in denvereven as we speak whatever you do this summer youll be able to use them thats the best news ive had in quite a while morrell said quite a while weve always had to play catchup to confederate armor if weve got better barrels for a change that just makes it more likely we can give them a good sickle slice and cut em off at the roots depending on what theyre doing themselves along these lines abell said our intelligence isnt perfect really i never would have guessed morrell said abell gave him a sour stare but with that piece of paper in his hand with the idea for that campaign in his head irving morrell wasnt inclined to pick a fight with his own side perfect or not general he went on well manage i really think we will confederate shells crashed down outside of lubbock inside the texas town major general abner dowling was not a happy man after lubbock fell to his eleventh army hed hoped he could go on biting chunks out of west texas but it didnt work out like that the confederates to his surpriseto everybodys surprisethrew fresh troops into the fight and those men didnt seem to care whether they lived or died they werent here in more than brigade strength but that was plenty to stabilize the line and even to push us forces back toward lubbock major angelo toricelli stuck his head into dowlings office it did belong to a bank manager but he took a powder before us troops occupied lubbock sir you said you wanted to question one of those confederate fanatics toricelli said weve got one for you do you dowling brightened fractionally well bring him in maybe well have a better notion of what were up against his adjutant saluted yes sir in came a large burly confederate soldier escorted by three large burly us soldiers with submachine guns the confederate had two stripes on his tunic sleeve tunic and trousers werent the usual cs butternut but a splotchy fabric in shades of tan and brown ranging from sand to mud who are you dowling asked sir i am assistant troop leader lee rodgers freedom party guards the prisoner said proudly he recited his pay number assistant troop leader dowling pointed to rodgers chevrons you look like a corporal to me sir they are equivalent ranks rodgers said the freedom party guards have their own rank structure this is to show that they are an elite he still sounded proud he also sounded as if he was rattling off something hed had to learn by rote dowling had heard that before though he didnt know the guards actually went into combat he thought they were just prison warders and secret policemen and freedom party muscle but they fought all right and they fought well their tactics left something to be desired but not their pluck whats your unit dowling asked sir i am assistant troop leader lee rodgers freedom party guards rodgers gave dowling his pay number again under the geneva convention i dont have to tell you anything else he was right of course sometimes that mattered more than it did other times had dowling thought rodgers held vital information he might have squeezed him there were ways to do it that technically didnt violate the convention as things were though dowling only asked do you tell the negroes in that prison camp down the road about their rights under the geneva convention no sir rodgers answered without hesitation they arent foreign prisoners theyre internal enemies of the state we have the right to do whatever we need to do with them he eyed dowling they might as well be mormons he was sharper than the average corporal if the freedom party guards really were an elite dowling supposed that made sense we follow the geneva convention with the mormons we capture dowling said which wasmostlytrue then again the mormons had more than a few female fighters they generally fought to the death when they didnt us soldiers often avenged themselves in a way they wouldnt with mormon men that was against regulations and officially discouraged which didnt mean it didnt happen assistant troop leader lee rodgers only snorted if you do it just means youre weak and degenerate enemies of the state deserve whatever happens to them that sounded like another lesson learned by heart how many freedom party guards units are in combat dowling asked more every day rodgers said which gave the us general something to worry about without giving him any real information the prisoner folded his right hand into a fist and set it on his heart freedom he shouted the us soldiers guarding him growled and hefted their weapons rodgers seemed unafraid or else more trusting than most new pows dowling scowled take him away he said yes sir one of the men in greengray said shall we teach him not to mouth off too never mind dowling said well see how mouthy he is when we start advancing again that seemed to satisfy the soldiers they werent more than ordinarily rough with the freedom party guard at least where dowling could see them the general commanding eleventh army sighed hes a charmer isnt he yes sir major toricelli said thats why you wanted to see him isnt it i wonder if theyre all like that all the party guards i mean dowling said well they sure fight like its going out of style his adjutant answered those people are fanatics and the freedom party is taking advantage of it huzzah dowling said sourly do you suppose we have to worry about them turning into people bombs thats what fanatics do these days it seems like toricelli looked startled hadnt thought of that sir they havent done it yet if theyre going to well thats good i suppose it is anyhow dowling said of course maybe they just havent thought of it yet or maybe theyre going to put on civilian clothes instead of those sillylooking camouflage outfits and start looking for the biggest crowds of our soldiers they can find or maybe theyll start looking for you sir toricelli said the confederates like to assassinate our commanders i know im not irreplaceable dowlings voice was dry i suspect the confederates can figure it out too besides how would they get me im not about to go strolling the streets of lubbock he yawned id bore myself to death if i did lubbock held many more people than the other west texas towns dowlings troops held for the usa it wasnt much more exciting and the people here were as stubbornly proconfederate as in those small towns when this part of texas was the us state of houston there were collaborators hereabouts but theyd had the sense to get out when jake featherston conned al smith into a plebescite that returned houston to texas and the csa the ones who didnt have that kind of sense ended up in camps themselves under both the stars and stripes and the stars and bars whose display now violated martial law lubbock had been a dry town dowling tried to win some popularity among local drinkers by declaring it wet a couple of saloons opened upand a minister promptly petitioned him to close them down the reverend humphrey selfe looked as if hed never had a happy thought in his life he was long and lean all vertical lines he wore stark white and funereal black his voice sounded like that of a bullfrog that had just lost its mother wine is a mocker he told dowling aiming a long skinny forefinger at him like the barrel of an automatic rifle strong drink is raging judge not lest ye be judged dowling answeredhed loaded up with his own set of quotations ahead of time reverend selfe glowered he was good at glowering his physiognomy gave him a head start but he had talent too do you make sport of me he demanded as if hed take dowling out behind the woodshed if the answer was yes dowling however declined to be intimidated by a west texas preacher skinny enough to dive down a soda straw not at all he lied but you need something more than fire and brimstone to tell me why a man shouldnt be able to buy a shot or a bottle of beer if he feels like it because god says drinking is a sin selfe said i was trying to illustrate that for you but he also says things like and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved that goeth down sweetly dowling saidsweetly how do you pick and choose remember drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake humphrey selfe looked like a man who needed wine for his stomachs sake he certainly looked like a man whose stomach pained him you are a sinner he thundered i shouldnt wonder if youre right dowling answered fondly recalling a certain sporting house in salt lake city but then who isnt i have at least as many quotations that say its all right to drink as you do to say its wrong shall we go on sir ill show you sinner selfe said again even the devil can quote scripture for his purposes no doubt dowling said which of us do you suppose hes speaking through and how do you aim to prove it one way or the other you do mock me the pastor said dowling shook his head he was enjoying himself even if the reverend selfe wasnt no you said wine was a mocker he said i havent had any wine for weeks he didnt mention strong drink lest selfe start raging shall we go on with our discussion it was getting interesting dont you think humphrey selfe wasnt interested in discussing like a lot of people he wanted to lay down what he saw as the law i shall denounce you from the pulpit he said furiously remember the line about rendering unto caesar too your reverence dowling said lubbock is under martial law if you try to incite riot rebellion or uprising i promise youll be sorry i shall preach on the subject of saloons selfe said you do that dowling told him im sure they can use the advertising it will be fascinating to see how many of your congregantsis that the worddecide to wet their whistles once you let them know where they can the reverend selfe left most abruptly the way he slammed the door a large shell might have gone off major toricelli opened the door againto dowlings surprise it was still on its hingesand asked what did you do to him talked about the scriptures dowling answered really theres no making some people happy uhhuh angelo toricelli said why do i think you made a nuisance of yourselfsir because you know me dowling suggested then he added sunday well need people listening to the quarrelsome fools sermon if he goes overboard well make sure he pays for it that will be a pleasure toricelli said after his adjutant withdrew once more dowling cursed hed wanted to ask the reverend humphrey selfe what he thought of that camp for negroes down by snyder then he shrugged odds were the preacher would have said hed never heard of the place odds were that would be a big juicy lie but dowling wouldnt be able to prove it more cs artillery came in some of those rounds sounded as if they were hitting in town not just on the southern outskirts maybe dowling thought hopefully theyll knock reverend selfes church flat he laughed who said he wasnt an optimist another downstate ohio town having grown up in toledo first sergeant chester martin looked on the southern part of his own state with almost as much scorn as a chicagoan viewed downstate illinois maybe people down here didnt marry their cousins but they were liable to fool around with themso he uncharitably thought anyhow hillsboro had a couple of foundries and a couple of dairy plants it sat on a plateau in the middle of highland county because it lay on high ground the confederates were hanging on to it as an artillery base to shell the us forces advancing from the north and east martin was frustrated at the way the war in southern ohio was going we should have trapped all the confederates in the state he grumbled as he waited for water to boil for his instant coffee we should have given them the same business we gave the butternut bastards in pittsburgh isnt there a difference sarge asked one of the privates huddled around the little campfire like what chester said what was the younger generation coming to when he was a buck private he wouldnt have dared talk back to a first sergeant when they were in pittsburgh they had orders not to pull back till after it was too late and they couldnt the kid answered here they are falling backlooks like theyll try and make the fight on their side of the ohio everybody thinks he belongs on the damn general staff chester said but that wouldnt quite do well rohe when youre right youre right i forgot they had those orders and it does make a difference somewhere off to the left and ahead a confederate fired a short burst from one of their submachine guns a us machine gun answered so did a couple of shots from the guys with the springfields who helped protect the machinegun crew another confederate fired this one with an automatic rifle the machine gun answered again silence fell by then chester and the rest of the soldiers around the fire had their weapons in their hands ready to hurry to help the machinegun position if they had to the confederates in front of hillsboro defended aggressively probing as if they intended to go over to the attack any minute now martin didnt think they would but you never could tell gotta hand it to those bastards said one of the privates by the fire they still have their peckers up that wasnt far from what chester was thinking but brash private rohe said yeah well i wish i did that got a laugh one of the other men said hey you cant get laid around here you aint tryin these ohio broads are mighty gladi mean mighty gladwe ran off those butternut bastards several men nodded from what chester had seen the private wasnt wrong some of the local women seemed convinced they had a patriotic duty to celebrate the return of the stars and stripes do your prophylaxis just like theyre whores he said a sergeantly growl they arent though sarge thats what makes em so much funtheyre nice gals rohe said more nods you think you cant come down venereal from laying a nice gal you better think twice chester said remember some of those nice gals were probably screwing featherstons boys while they were here theyre laying you to take the whammy off they wouldnt do that two young men spoke in identical dismay chester laughed hell they wouldnt there are collaborators on both sides always have been always will be he looked at his men you may be handsomer than the bastards in butternutbut if you are the confederacys got more trouble than it knows what to do with the infantrymen jeered at him he sassed them back if they were laughing and loose theyd fight better they didnt worry about anything like that but he did that was why he had those stripes and the rockers under them airplanes droned by overhead chester and the rest of the men looked for the nearest hole in case those airplanes carried the confederate battle flag but they unloaded their ordnance on hillsboro great clouds of smoke and dust rose above the town hope our people got out of there rohe said eyeing the devastation a couple of miles away some of the locals probablyno certainlyhadnt war worked that way us soldiers and armored vehicles started moving toward hillsboro chester martin sighed he knew what would happen next and it did lieutenant wheat called come on men now that weve got the confederates softened up its time to drive them out of there once and for all chester heaved himself to his feet you heard the man he said lets get moving stay on your toes as we move forward the confederates may not be as beat up as we hope they are he feared they wouldnt be hed seen too many massive bombardments in the great war yield little or nothing he wouldnt be surprised to see the same thing all over again here rohe took point as the platoon moved up he was small and skinny and sly a good man to spot trouble before he tripped over it the guys chester had lugging the platoons machine guns were the ones who would have played the line in a football game he would have been the sort to lug one himself in the last war he also had four or five men carrying captured cs automatic rifles he blessed the extra firepower they gave the whole platoon kept its eyes open for dead confederates scrounging ammo never ceasedthey didnt want to run dry just when they needed it most theyd got about halfway to hillsboro when mortar rounds started falling out of the sky down chester yelled dig in there were plenty of shell holes that needed only minimal improvement to become foxholes some of them were already pretty good chester dove into one of those dirt flew as if he were part mole pretty good wasnt good enough he wanted outstanding the veterans in the platoon all dug in as fast as he did new replacements stood around gaping and wondering what the hell was going on nobodyd had time to show them the ropes and they didnt own enough combat experience to do what needed doing without having to think about it the extra few seconds they stayed upright cost them one was gruesomely killed two more went down wounded both screaming their heads off corpsman other soldiers shouted over here corpsman a veteran scrambled out of his hole to help a wounded rookie and another fragment bit him he howled in pain and howled curses at the same time in due course us artillery thundered the mortars fell silent biding their time martin thought gloomily but he was one of the first ones out of those newly enlarged and improved holes come on he called to the rest of the men weve got a job to do it was a nasty unpleasant job the ground over which they advanced offered little cover to the confederates in hillsboro they had to look like bugs walking across a plate smoke rounds helped but only so much if featherstons boys had one of those rocket launchers up there they could put a hell of a crimp in anybodys morning us barrels rattled forward chester always liked to see them they could do things infantry simply couldnt and they always drew enemy fire away from foot soldiers he wasnt the only one who knew they were dangerousthe confederates did too one of the things the barrels could do was lay down more smoke that helped shield the advancing men in greengray from the confederates on the high ground the confederates kept shooting but now they had trouble finding good targets chester trotted on ducking and throwing himself into shell holes whenever he thought he had to out of the smoke loomed a man in the wrong uniform dirty butternut instead of dirty greengray a helmet of not quite the right shape chesters springfield swung toward the confederates chest the enemy soldier droppedin fact violently cast awayhis submachine gun and threw up his hands dont shoot yankee he moaned you got me what do we do with him sarge one of martins men asked chester thought but not for long they didnt really have time to deal with pows take him on up the road he said right the us soldier said he gestured with his springfield come on you pathetically eager the prisoner came martin went on advancing a shot rang out behind him and then another one he swore softly it was too bad but they just didnt have the time if hed told his men to take the confederate to the rear that would have removed at least one of them from the fight and so he used the other phrase and the man was dead at least he wouldnt have known he was about to die till it happened that was something though not much martin was sure the confederates played the game the same way it was too bad but what could you do if taking a prisoner didnt inconvenience or endanger you youd do it why not but if it didit was a tough war and it didnt get any easier shame he didnt have one of their automatic riflessubmachinegun cartridges dont matter so much martin thought well the guy who plugged him will get his cigarettes and whatever else he has thats worth taking and that was what a mans life boiled down to cartridges and cigarettes yeah it sure was a tough war artillery and the barrels pounded the confederates ahead the gun bunnies were in good form hardly any rounds fell short more soldiers in butternut came out of their holes with hands high chester did let them surrender when men gave up in a group it was too easy to have something go wrong if you tried to get rid of all of them at once hillsboro fell that afternoon the enemy pulled back when us barrels threatened to cut off his line of retreat to the ohio he did a professional job of it moving his guns out hitched to trucks and commandeered motorcars he even paused to fire a few parthian shots as he went south we licked him here private rohe said inspecting what was left of hillsboro we licked him yeah but he aint licked yet chester was thinking about the same thing as long as we keep licking him the rest doesnt matter sooner or later hell be licked whether he likes it or not yeah rohe weighed that then nodded yeah sounds right sarge so when do we go over the ohio beats me chester said lets bundle the other guys across first then we can worry about us right rohe nodded again major jerry dover watched from the south bank of the ohio as trucks and infantrymen crossed the bridge back into kentucky the span was laid about a foot below the surface of the river the damnyankees still hadnt figured out that trick when no one was on the bridge it was invisible from the air us bombers didnt keep coming over and trying to blow it to hell and gone the foot soldiers on the bridge looked like men walking on water dover turned to colonel travis ww oliphant and said if we keep it up sir we can start our own religion whats that colonel oliphant didnt get it i might have known dover thought with a mental sigh then the light dawned on his superior oliphant scowled i dont find that amusing major i dont find that amusing at all he said i find it the next thing to blasphemous as a matter of fact sorry sir dover lied damned stuffed shirt it wasnt as if he didnt know as much he did any man who got huffy over not one initial but two couldnt be anything but a stuffed shirt colonel oliphant went on trumpeting and wiggling his ears and pawing the ground after a little while dover stopped listening to him he was watching the stream of men and machines to make sure all the field kitchens safely returned to the csa oliphant was supposed to be doing the same thing he was too busy ranting if we make god turn his face away from us in disgust how can we prevail he demanded dover thought about negroes disappearing in atlanta he thought about the people he lost from the huntsmans lodge in cleanouts he wondered what was going on since he put on the uniform and went away was xerxes still there he could hope but that was all he could do sir do you know about the camps he asked colonel oliphant in a low voice what the other officer stared at him as if he were suddenly spouting choctaw what are you talking about the camps dover repeated patiently the camps where niggers go in but they dont come out he wondered if travis ww oliphant would deny that any such things existed a little to his surprise oliphant didnt yes i know about them so what he said well sir if god will put up with those i dont think hell get too disgusted about a bad joke of mine dover said oliphant turned red the one has nothing to do with the other major he said stiffly the negroes deserve everything that were giving them your socalled joke on the other hand was completely gratuitous god told you the negroes have it coming did he jerry dover asked see here dover you dont have the right attitude colonel oliphant said whose side are you on anyway im on the confederacys sidesir dover answered if you think a stupid joke will put us in bad with god im not so sure you are though hed managed the huntsmans lodge too damn long he wasnt inclined to take guff from anybody even if the guffslinger wore three stars on either side of his collar while dover had only one i will write you up for this insubordination major oliphant said in a low furious voice youll get a courtmartial by godyes by god he failed to impress dover who said go ahead one of three things will happen theyll throw my ass in the stockade and ill be safer than you are or theyll take the uniform off my back and ship me home and ill be a lot safer than you are orand heres my bettheyll tear you a new asshole for wasting their time with this picayune shit and theyll leave me the hell alone so sure courtmartial me colonel be my guest ill thank you for it travis ww oliphants mouth opened and closed several times he might have been a freshly hooked perch subordinates were supposed to react to the threat of a courtmartial with terror not gloating anticipation after his wordless tries he finally managed to choke out youre not a proper soldier at all dover that depends sir if you want me to keep people fed ill do it like nobodys business dover said if you feed me bullshit and tell me its breakfast im gonna puke it all over your shoes colonel oliphant retreated in disorder shaking his head no summons to a courtmartial ever came dover hadnt expected one since he wasnt going to the stockade he had plenty to do the confederate units that got out of ohio were in a horrible tangle they had to try to improvise a defense where theyd thought they wouldnt need to the csa hadnt had much time to fortify kentucky before the war broke out and neglected it afterwards confederate thinking was surely that ohio was more important but now ohio was back in the damnyankees hands whatever happened next would happen because the united states wanted it to not because the confederate states did how good was the confederacy at playing defense nobody knew probably including jake featherston when supplies didnt come up from farther south fast enough to suit him dover acquired an evil reputation with farmers all over northern kentucky he requisitioned what he needed paying in confederate scrip some of the farmers screams reached richmond they got dover a letter of commendation in his promotion jacket colonel oliphant ignored it colonel oliphant ignored jerry dover as much as he could from then on out too that suited dover down to the ground he got more work done without colonel oliphant than he would have with him he moved depots closer to the river than oliphant liked too he didnt think oliphant was a cowardhed seen the man blazing away at strafing us fighters with a submachine gun cool as you please but the colonels ideas about logistics formed during the great war and didnt move forward with the easy availability of telephones and wireless sets and trucks frontline soldiers appreciated what dover did regardless of whether travis ww oliphant understood it dover got to the front himself whenever he could the best way to make sure things worked as you wanted them to was to check them with your own eyes he knew that from the restaurant business and he promptly caught one potbellied supply sergeant diverting rations to the local civiliansfor a nice little rakeoff of course of course he landed on the enterprising noncom like a thousandpound bomb after the sergeant went off in ironsnobody wasted time being nice to mere noncomsthings elsewhere along the line of the ohio tightened up remarkably because of all his time at the huntsmans lodge dover knew better than to believe hed worked miracles he didnt labor under the delusion that hed changed human nature thieves and grifters were going to keep right on being thieves and grifters but he forced them to be careful for a while which was better than a poke in the eye with a carrot way to go major a first lieutenant running a company right on the southern bank of the river told him weve got more grub here than i reckoned wed ever see good dover said good youve got it now i mean not so good you gave up thinking you ever would yeah well what can you do shit happens the lieutenant answered we were up on the other side of the border for a long time we could swap smokes with the damnyankees for some of their rations and we could requisition on the farms when we ran low but that dont go over so good when youre requisitioning from your own people so we were making do and getting by down here but its a damn sight better now dammit this country grows enough food this country cans enough food dover saidand requisitioning from his own side bothered him not a bit we ought to be able to get that stuff to the people who need it the most we ought to be able to do all kinds of shit the lieutenant said and paused to light a cigarette we ought to still be up at lake erie we ought to still be in pittsburgh fuck we ought to be in philadelphia he looked at dover he did everything but blow smoke in dovers face and if you want to report me for defeatism go right aheadsir its not like i give a good goddamn im not going to report you i think youre right only later did dover wonder if the other officer was trying to entrap him no hardfaced men in gray trenchcoats swooped down on the tent where he slept during the wee small hours no one hauled him away for bright lights and hard knocks and endless rounds of questions that didnt keep him from almost getting killed just as the confederates were trying to strengthen their defenses on the southern bank of the ohio so the damnyankees were building up north of the river the first two summers of the war the confederates struck when and where they chose this time the united states enjoyed the initiative what they would do with it remained to be seen one of the things they did with it was strike at the cs positions south of the ohio from the air bombs blasted field fortifications fighters streaked low to shoot up anything that moved confederate airplanes were bound to be doing the same thing on the other side of the river but that didnt help dover when a yankee fighter strafed his birmingham oh shit the driver said when he saw the airplane in the rearview mirror he jammed the gas pedal to the floor which shoved dover back in his seat then he did something his passenger thought smarter than hell even if it almost put dover through the windshield he screeched the brakes hoping to make the fighter overshoot it almost worked too most of the us fighters machinegun bullets chewed up the asphalt in front of the birmingham mostbut not all acaliber slug almost blew off the drivers head bone and blood and brains showered jerry dover two more bullets or maybe three slammed into the engine block flames and smoke spurted up from under the hood if the driver werent already stopping the auto would have gone off the road at high speed and probably rolled over and exploded as things were it limped onto the soft shoulder dover yanked open the door jumped out and ran like hell he managed to get clear before the fire reached the gas tank a soft whoomp and the birmingham was an inferno jesus dover looked down at himself he was as spattered with gore as if he were wounded himself he could smell it his stomach heaved but he kept breakfast down looking back at the pyre that marked his drivers last resting place he felt guilty about not getting the man out the rational part of his mind said that was ridiculousyou couldnt possibly live with nothing left of your head from the ears north he felt guilty even so maybe for living where the other man died another birmingham painted butternut stopped the officer inside stared from the burning motorcar to jerry dover you hurt pal you need a lift he asked im all right i do need a lift dover answered automatically then he said christ what i really need is a drink the officer held up a silvered flask dover ran for the other birmingham cincinnatus driver rolled into cincinnati ohio his name didnt have anything much to do with the town even if he was born in covington kentucky right across the ohio river negroes in the csa had long been in the habit of giving their babies fancy names either from the days of ancient greece and rome or less often from the bible when you didnt have much but your name to call your own you got as much out of it as you could cincinnati looked like hell the confederates made a stand here before pulling back across the ohio into covington as the usa taught the csa in pittsburgh attacking a builtup area could be hellishly expensive the bastards in butternut did their damnedest to make it so here great flocks of metallically twittering starlings darkened the sky as they rose when cincinnatus truck convoy rolled by the war didnt bother them much except for the ones unlucky enough to stop bullets or bomb or shell fragments those made only a tiny tiny fraction of the total back when cincinnatus father was a little boy there were flocks of passenger pigeons instead cincinnatus had seen only a handful of those they were in a steep decline when he was a boy around the turn of the century they were all gone now every one of them confederate artillery fire killed the last surviving specimen a female in the cincinnati zoo early in the great war by the same token he remembered starlings arriving in the area not long after the war ended some crazy englishman brought them to the usa in the s and theyd moved west ever since he wondered if they filled up some of the hole in the scheme of things that was left when passenger pigeons disappeared and then he had more urgent things to wonder about like whether hed live long enough to deliver the shells he was carrying in the back of his truck the confederates on the far side of the river went right on lobbing their own shells into the ruins of cincinnati trying to make them even more ruinous fountains of upflung dirt and smoke rose from not nearly far enough away cincinnatus kept on driving why not he was just as likely to stop a fragment standing still as he was moving forward the trucks in the convoy stayed well separated from one another if a shell blew one of them to hell and gone even one carrying munitions the blast wouldnt take out the trucks in front of and behind it everybody hoped it wouldnt anyhow he pulled to a stop in front of the city jail a lot more than one shell had fallen on that squat ugly building the confederates must have made a stand there that made sensea place designed to keep unfriendly people in would also be pretty good at keeping unfriendly people out when cincinnatus got down from the cab of his truck he was laughing to beat the band whats so funny asked one of the other drivers a white man named waldo something way youre going on anybody would think you did a couple months in there he jerked a thumb toward the wreckage of the jail a big grin took the sting from his words you aint so far wrong cincinnatus answered damn confederates jugged me across the river over in covington but when they went an exchanged me they stopped here an got some other guys out too so i aint sorry to see this place catch hell not even a little bit suits me waldo said the more jails they blow up the happier i am ive done stretches in too goddamn many of em never any big shit but i like to drink and when i drink i like to fight and so his face showed that hed caught a few lefts and rights or maybe more than a few as well as dishing them out he sounded proud of his escapades a moment later in fact he went on i wonder if they got any saloons open in whats left of this town you sure you want to find out cincinnatus asked you got the government tellin you what to do they can give you a lot more grief if you get in trouble than some city police can waldo thought it over he nodded makes sense thanks if hed left it there everything would have been fine but then he added youre pretty goddamn smart for a nigger you know the worst part was he meant it for a compliment thanks a bunch cincinnatus said sourly a few more s came whistling in but none of them burst close to where swarms of young soldiers unloaded the trucks watching them cincinnatus remembered how hed done the same thing during the great war a lot of years had landed on his shoulders since a lot of years and that encounter with the motorcar he didnt see before it almost killed him he still didnt remember getting hit he didnt suppose he ever would a second lieutenant who looked even younger than the soldiers doing packmule duty wandered through the unloading zone with a clipboard in his hands it made him seem official so official that cincinnatus got suspicious the confederates would have no trouble putting one of their people in a us uniform and sending him up here to see what he could see they were supposed to do stuff like that all the time cincinnatus hoped the usa did it too then the young lieutenant talked to an officer who came down with the truck convoy that made cincinnatus feel better a spy wouldnt talk to anybody if he didnt have toor so it seemed to cincinnatus anyway the older officer nodded he said something cincinnatus was too far away to make out what driver the second lieutenant yelled plainly reading the name from his clipboard cincinnatus driver alarm sleeted through cincinnatus what the devil did they want with him and who were they anyhow im here he said and picked his way through the rubble over to the shavetail whats up my superiors need to talk with you the babyfaced officer said he wore greenandwhite arm of service colors on his collar a combination cincinnatus hadnt seen before a badgea wreath with the letters int insidegave him a pretty good idea of what those colors meant intelligence that made him feel better not worse hed got out of covingtonand got out of its colored districtonly a little while before if the us army was looking for ways to use covingtons negroes he had some ideas he also had the names of people they could get in touch withand names of people to stay away from at all costs sentries in greengray uniforms stood in front of what used to be an office building the young lieutenant needed to exchange password and countersign with them before they let him in nobody trusted anybody these days cincinnatus hoped that was just as true on the side of the line where the men wore butternut a whitehaired fellow in civilian clothes was talking with a lieutenant colonel and a major when cincinnatus followed the lieutenant into the room where they sat the mans eyes were the light almost golden brown of a hunting dogsa most unusual shade for a man cincinnatus stiffened he knew those eyes anywhere and the clever engagingly homely face that housed them luther bliss was trouble with a capital t when kentucky belonged to the usa between the wars luther bliss headed the kentucky state police an outfit that hunted confederate diehards and black radicals with equal enthusiasm cincinnatus spent almost two years in a kentucky state police jail bliss was a law unto himself and paid attention to other law only when he felt like it he nodded to cincinnatus now as long as youre against the freedom party were on the same side he said to the officers he added weve had our runins cincinnatus and me but hes all right im glad his card came up cincinnatus wasnt sure he was glad his cardwhat cardturned up forced to choose between luther bliss and jake featherston he would choose bliss no black man could possibly disagree there forced to choose between bliss and anyone elseanyone else at allbut that wasnt the choice he had bliss went on i was hooked in with lucullus wood and the other colored activists but only from the outside he brushed one hand across the back of the other noting his own white skin cincinnatus here though he knows all that stuff from the inside out well thats what were looking for the major said we want to try to stir things up in covington so the confederates will be busy when we go over the river you gonna stir things up with the whites too or just with the blacks cincinnatus asked what business of yours is that the lieutenant colonel demanded in a voice like winter cincinnatus scowled at him when the negro eyed luther bliss he saw that the secret policeman understood what he was talking about just the niggers rise up he told the light colonel you let the freedom party bastards put em down an then you move i know how you work you get the csa to solve your nigger problem for you and your own hands stay nice an clean the officer with the silver oak leaves on his shoulder straps gaped like a boated bream luther bliss laughed you see ray he said hes nobodys fool he didnt come to town on a load of turnips cincinnatus had come to town on or at least with a load of mm shells you aint got no white folks to rise up i aint talkin bout no niggers his own accent came out more strongly with every sentence they got enough troublesthey got too goddamn many troubleswithout me givin em mo you are insubordinate the major growled bet your ass cincinnatus said proudly tell him whats going on luther bliss advised he wont blab he never said anything to me that he shouldnt have and i squeezed him too most irregular the lieutenant colonelraymuttered reluctantly he said the unrest will involve members of both principal racial groupings in covington he means whites and negroes luther bliss put in why dont he say so then cincinnatus asked bliss laughed the lieutenant colonel looked irate and indignant cincinnatus didnt care if the man meant whites and negroes why did he have to hide it behind a bunch of fancy talk you going to give us a hand luther bliss asked thisll happen with you or without you it may work a little better kill more of the right people and not so many of the wrong ones if you give us a hand how does that sound sounds like the best deal im gonna get cincinnatus said he talked about the red network centered on lucullus woods barbecue shack bliss already knew a lot about that hed dealt with lucullus himself cincinnatus also talked about the probable confederate informers at the brass monkey a saloon not far from his fathers house he told the intelligence officers everything he knew and he hoped to heaven that it did some good v with a theatrical flourish brigadier general john wade pinned a silver star on michael pounds chest then he pinned a small gold bar onto each shoulder strap on pounds new shirt the division commander stuck out his hand congratulations lieutenant pound he said warmly a flashbulb flared as a photographer immortalized the moment thank you sir pound feared he sounded as enthusiastic as he felt he didnt want to be an officer hed also done things a lot more dangerous than the ones that got him this medal nobodyd paid any attention to them though this time the wounded lieutenant griffiths went on and on in writing about what a wonderful fellow he was and sohe had the decoration which he didnt mind and the promotion which he did youll have a platoon of barrels general wade said im sure youll fight them as bravely and effectively as you fought your own machine after the commander got hurt ill do my best sir pound liked giving orders only a little better than he liked taking them the other four barrel commanders in the platoon would be sergeants who didnt want to hear from a lousy second lieutenant even if pound wasnt your everyday shavetail getting them to pay attention to him would be a pain in the neck or probably points south of the neck but then wade said because of your excellent service and your long experience lieutenant well give you a platoon of the mark iii machines these are some of the first ones we have just down from the factories in michigan suddenly michael pound didnt mind the promotion he didnt mind the prospect of giving orders to sergeants who didnt want to take them he didnt mind a thing he tore off a salute that would have turned a drill sergeant green with envy thank you very much sir he exclaimed are they here can i see them hed heard about the new machines but he had yet to set eyes on them brigadier general wade smiled he was somewhere close to pounds age with a chestful of medals and service ribbonsand with a scar on his face and a finger missing from his left hand that said hed really and truly earned his decorations i know enthusiasm when i hear it lieutenant he said why dont you come with me sir id follow you anywhere pound said and john wade laughed hamilton ohio was an industrial town of about people maybe a third of the way from cincinnati up to dayton it sat in a bowl of hills on both sides of the great miami river the west side of town was the nice side or had been before the confederates made a stand there wade had formally commissioned pound in the soldiers sailors and pioneers memorial building a twostory structure of limestone blocks that housed a museum dedicated to us wars two cannon from old fort hamilton stood in front of the building the names of the men from hamilton whod served in the mexican war the war of secession the second mexican war and the great war were carved into the walls now some new military hardware had joined those lateeighteenthcentury guns michael pound eyed the sleek lines of the new barrels with as much admiration as he would have given those of daisy june lee even if of a slightly different sort the armor on the greengray machinessplotched here and there with darker green to help break up their outlineswas as well sloped as anything the confederates had ever built and that long inch gun would make any cs barrel including the enemys latest and greatest say uncle brigadier general wade looked as proud of the new barrels as if hed designed them himself well lieutenant he said genially what do you think pound knew what he was supposed to say he was supposed to burble on about how wonderful the new barrels were and what a howling wilderness they would make of the confederate states if john wade expected him to say things like that it only went to show the general didnt know his newest and most junior officer very well sir theyre fine machines pound said and general wade beamedhis new lieutenant was on the right track pound promptly proceeded to drive off it id like them a lot better if we had them at the beginning of the war and we could have you know general wades smile faded that wouldnt have been easy he said the geniality leaking out of his voice word by word in fact i doubt it would have been possible oh yes it would sir pound didnt mind correcting an officer with a star on each shoulder strapwade was wrong and anybody who was wrong needed correcting no wonder he went gray before making officers rank himself he went on we had everything we needed in place to build machines like this twenty years agoand then we turned our backs on barrels because they were too expensive and we probably wouldnt need them any more if wed just followed up this is where we would have been going into the war this or better and what makes you so sure of that lieutenant brigadier general wade asked unwisely sir i was general morrells gunner at the barrel works in fort leavenworthhe was only a bird colonel back then of course pound answered i remember the prototype he designed it was just a oneoff in mild steel but it pointed straight ahead to those machines about the only thing missing was the sloped armor and that would have come or if it didnt we would have built thicker instead and used a stronger engine to haul around the extra weight isee wade said in slightly strangled tones officers often used those tones when talking to or about michael pound wade aimed a forefinger at him if you were there then lieutenant why in gods name arent you a major or a colonel by now i liked being a noncom pound spread his hands as if to say there isnt that simple ive turned down more promotions than you can shake a stick at if you gave me any chance to do it i would have turned this one down too my god john wade muttered hed never even dreamt of turning down a promotion no one who aspired to high rank ever did didnt you ever want to use your expertise on a wider scale my expertise is barrel gunnery sirand everything that has to do with keeping a barrel running too but anybody whos been in barrels a while gets good at that pound said but i can only shoot one cannon at a time and the gun doesnt care whether im a sergeant or an officer besides now that im going to be commanding a platoon i wont get the chance to do my own shooting any more my god wade said again youre an unusual man lieutenant dont let anyone tell you any different ill shoot the next soandso who tries pound agreed which only seemed to fluster the division commander more he went on when do we go into kentucky and start chewing up the confederates soon i hope so they dont have much time to strengthen their defenses we push southeast maybe we can cut them in half if general wade gaped before he downright goggled now pound had seen that expression on officers faces before they often didnt believe men in the ranksor in his case just up from the rankscould think on their own wade managed a ragged laugh i put bars on your shoulders and you think youre ready for the general staff oh no sir that might have sounded suitably modest had pound left it there but he didnt i was wondering about this when i was still a sergeant as long as weve got the initiative we need to use it jake featherston is the worlds biggest son of a bitch but he understands that do we john wade gave him a wry grin if i tell you that i tell you things i havent told some members of my own staff you tend to your knitting there and ill tend to mine i dont think youll end up disappointed michael pound ended up disappointed with most of what his superiors did even he could see that saying so wouldnt win him any points and he did have new knitting to tend to he saluted and said yes sir this time wades smile wasnt wry pound smiled too if only to himself yes they always liked that but the general wasnt wrong without waiting for permission pound started crawling all over the new barrel he eyed the drivers seat and the bow gunners spot next to it then he went into the turret he sat in the gunners seat then got up from it with a sigh of real regret up till now us barrels were always outgunned a us machines main armament could defeat a cs barrel most of the time though taking on a newmodel cs barrels frontal armor with the inch gun on the oldest us barrels was an invitation to suicideyou had to hit them from the flank to have any kind of chance now though he would have the advantage this gun would penetrate enemy armor at ranges from which the confederates couldnt hope to reply he shook his head he wouldnt have the advantage his gunner would hed be stuck telling other people what to do with another sigh he sat down in the commanders seat he stood up so he could look out of the cupola seeing what was going on mattered more than maybe anything else on the battlefield sometimes though you would get killed if you tried to look out he closed the cupolas lid and peered through the builtin periscopes the view wasnt nearly so good but it wasnt hopeless either this barrel happened to have a platoon commanders wireless set like the one hed be using he studied that with extra care he would have to keep track of four machines besides his own they would have to become extensions of his will all working together to give the bastards in butternut a good kick in the teeth he frowned thoughtfully hed never tried anything like this before maybe officers earned their money after all he climbed out of the turret with a certain sense of relief brigadier general wade eyed him with amusement youre thorough wade said sir its my neck pound answered again were he speaking to a less exalted personage some other part of his anatomy would have occurred to him yes escaping the turret did bring relief with it he felt as if he were leaving a platoon commanders responsibilities behind logically that was nonsense but logic and feelings had little to do with each other he peered down through the engine louvers at the powerplant anything special i should know about the motor sir he asked have they found any gremlins some growing pains with the fuel pump ive heard wade answered engine seems fairly well behaved thoughits a scaledup model of the one weve been using in the older barrels i thought so from the look of it pound said well well see how it goes how soon will we see how it goes one more probe couldnt hurt it also didnt help much chuckling general wade said it wont be too long and pound had to make what he could of that armstrong grimes still had his platoon no eager young second lieutenant had come out of the reppledepple to take his place he would have bet the replacement depot had no eager young second lieutenants he was still very young himself but not very eager nobody whod been in utah for a while was eager any more except the mormons they were getting pounded to bits a block at a time but they had no give in them a commendation letter sat in armstrongs file for capturing the corporal who turned out not to be a corporal theyd promoted yossel reisen to sergeant for his part in that armstrong didnt flabble about not getting bumped up to staff sergeant for one thing he cared more about coming out in one piece than he did about rank and for another getting promoted up to sergeant was pretty easy adding a rocker to your stripes wasnt his whole regiment was out of line for r and r or what passed for r and r in utah real beds food that didnt come out of cans hot showers and a perimeter far enough out to make it hard for the mormons to snipe at you or drop mortar bombs on your head no women but there was an ncos club where armstrong could buy beer rank did have its privileges he enjoyed them while he could now he couldnt any more in a clean uniform he trudged back up toward the fighting the dirty ragged unshaven men coming south for r and r of their own eyed him and his comrades with the scorn veterans gave to anybody who looked new and raw does your mama know youre here one of them jeeredthe oldest gibe in the world ah fuck you answered one of the privates in armstrongs platoon it wasnt even a challengemore an assertion that the man whod spoken wasnt worth challenging the vet coming back understood that tone sorry buddy he said you didnt look like youd been through it before yeah well fuck you anyway the private said this time he did smile when he said it come on keep moving armstrong said weve got so much to look forward to funny yossel said tell me about it armstrong said im gonna grow a long blue beard and join the engels brothers that made his buddy shut up armstrong could see the wheels going round in yossels head he would be thinking that armstrong had to know the engels brothers dyed their beards all the colors of the rainbowdidnt he he would also be wondering how armstrong intended to grow a blue beard since armstrong was wondering the same thing himself he let it go there as soon as they got into the outskirts of salt lake city the sniping started armstrong swore as he hit the dirt this was supposed to be territory the usa controlled civilians here were supposed to be disarmed with utah under martial law the penalty for keeping firearms was death so was the penalty for harboring mormon fighters no one seemed to worry about that after a few minutes and a burst of machinegun fire the sniping stopped the soldiers got to their feet again and tramped on nice to be back at the same old stand isnt it armstrong said lovely yossel reisen modified the word with a participle that brought a sour smile to armstrongs face the mormons still held the military compound northeast of downtown salt lake city that the united states with the tact that made the central government so beloved in utah called fort custer before becoming a national hero in the second mexican war george armstrong custer hanged john taylorbrigham youngs successorand several other prominent mormons on the grounds of that fort afterwards custer said his biggest regret was not hanging abe lincoln too us artillery and aircraft pounded the mormon garrison up there the mormons replied with mortars and screaming meemies and whatever else they could get their hands on a lieutenant led the platoon armstrong and his men were replacing the officer showed no particular surprise at briefing a noncom a sergeants got the other platoon in this company too he said just dumb luck i havent stopped anything myself a cigarette hung from the corner of his mouth he looked beat to hell but for the gold bars on his shoulders he might have been a noncom too because hed been through the mill armstrong gave him more respect than he would have otherwise hope you stay safe sir he said they got anything special up ahead of us i ought to know about places where they like to put mortars sniper spots infiltration routes ha youre no virgin sure as hell the lieutenant said bet your ass armstrong told him and then uh yes sir bet your ass will do fine the lieutenant laughed dont slip and say it back of the line thats all or itll be your ass he pointed out the trouble spots on the other side of the line and the places where us soldiers had to keep their heads down if they didnt want to turn into sniper bait and he added brighams bastards have some kind of headquarters about half a mile ahead of us thats what i figure anyhow more foot traffic up therehe pointedcarefullyto show wherethan anything else is likely to account for you put snipers on em armstrong asked oh hell yes the lieutenant said theyre sneaky as snakes about it now but the traffic wont go away maybe some mortarsll shift em armstrong said maybe theyll go away and be somebody elses headache hell thatd do the lieutenant laughed again for all the world as if he were kidding after the other platoon pulled back armstrong put his own snipers into some likely looking spots he told them to pick off the first few mormons they spotted one of the snipers said i got it sarge you dont want those shitheels figuring were a bunch of damn greenhorns right the first time urban armstrong answered as soon as they know we know what the hell were doing theyll find somebody easier to pick on hell i would one of the mormons took a shot at him as he left that nest the bullet cracked past his head he flattened out and crawled for a while after that yes the guys on the other side were seeing what they were up against they tried a trench raid that night having acquired a nastily suspicious mind in the course of almost two years of fighting armstrong was waiting for it he sited a couple of machine guns to cover the route he thought the enemy most likely to take and he guessed right the mormons retreated as fast as they couldfrom the cries that rose some of them were wounded his platoon didnt lose a man they left him and his men severely alone for the next two days that suited him fine even if it did make him wonder what they were up to he assumed they were up to something they usually were on the third morning a mormon approached under flag of truce armstrong shouted for his men to stop shooting one thing the mormons didnt do was violate a ceasefire they were scrupulous about that kind of thing they always played fair even if they played hard armstrong stared at the mormon you he said you the mormona majorechoed theyd met before armstrong had made him strip to his drawers to prove he wasnt a people bomb the mormons did their best to pay him back by turning him into a casualty they didnt quite manage but not for lack of effort the officer went on youd better let me through this time oh yeah that automatically made armstrong suspicious how come because the mormon choked on his answer and had to try again because im coming to try to work out a surrender thats why he looked like a man who badly desperately wanted to scream god damn it he didnt though in all too many ways the mormons were made of stern stuff oh yeah in spite of himself armstrong didnt sound so hostile this time the mormon majors fury and frustration embittered his face as well as his voice yeah again the mormons fastidiousness seemed to handicap him if we dont you people will murder all of us the same as the confederates are murdering their colored people why should you piss and moan about featherstons fuckers armstrong said youre in bed with em for christs sake he got a look full of hatred from the mormon major the enemy of my enemy is my friend the mormon quoted you ever hear that one you people send guns to the negroes the confederates give us a hand when they can it evens out oh boy it evens out armstrong said in a hollow voice how do we know you guys wont keep using people bombs even after you say youve given up because well be hostages thats how the mormon major looked and sounded like death warmed over how many of us will you murder every time anything like that happens youll set the number highand you know it like you wont deserve it armstrong said i dont have to dicker with you and i thank god for that the mormon said will you please pass me through to your officers theyre the ones who can say whether theyll let any of us live armstrong thought about making him strip again he didnt do it this time he wanted nothing more than getting out of utah in one piece a truce or a surrender or whatever you called it made that more likely he did say come forward so i can pat you down you still may be a people bomb do whatever you think you need to the mormon said by itself that went a long way toward convincing armstrong he wasnt loaded with explosives the man came up to him lowered the white flag and raised his hands armstrong frisked him and found the nothing he expected yeah youre clean armstrong said when he was satisfied come on with me ill take you back youre not gloating as much as i thought you would the mormon major remarked sorry armstrong said i just want to get this over with so we can go on with the real war you know what i mean oh sure the enemy officer said bitterly were just the sideshow along with the trained ponies and the flea circus and the freaks you said it pali didnt armstrong replied the mormon gave him another dirty look he ignored it he passed the mormon major on to behindtheline troops then went back to his platoon you think anything will come of it yossel asked him beats me armstrong said even if it does are we ever gonna let up on these snakes again every time we try it they give us one right in the nuts be nice to get the hell out of utah yossel said wistfully yeah and if they let us leave you know where theyll ship our asses next armstrong waited for yossel to shake his head then went on up to fucking canada thats where were good at putting down rebellions so theyll give us another one yossel a look of horror on his face flipped him the bird armstrong gave it right back he knew how the war departments mind workedif you called that working flora blackford and robert taft glared at each other in the small conference room the congresswoman from new york and the senator from ohio were friends on a personal level though she was a socialist and he a conservative democrat their views on prosecuting the war hadnt been very different they hadnt been but they were now we have jake featherston to deal with flora said hes more important we can worry about the mormons later weve got them on the ropes now we ought to finish them off taft said then we wont have to worry about them later how do you aim to finish them flora inquired if you dont make peace when they ask for it dont you have to kill them all taft gestured toward the front of congressional hall along with confederate bombs from the air it was also scarred by mormon auto bombs and people bombs arent they doing their best to kill us all or as many of us as they can he said but they cant and we can she said theyre only trouble to us we can destroy them isnt that reason enough not to how many bites do they get robert taft returned whenever we get in trouble with the confederate states the mormons try to take advantage of it they did it in the second mexican war they did it in the great war if they just stayed quiet in utah this time around and enjoyed being citizens again nobody would have bothered them at all enjoyed being citizens again flora echoed do you think they might resent us a little for occupying them for twenty years maybe taft answered calmly do you think we might resent them a little bit for making us conquer the whole state of utah house by house in the great war how many casualties did they cause how many divisions did they tie down and now theyre doing it again do you think they can just walk away and say all right weve had enough and get off easy your nephews there isnt he what does he say about that yossel says hed sooner fight the confederates thats the war that really counts flora answered he also said he worried about getting sent to canada instead she understood that if a division showed it could put down one rebellion wouldnt the war department figure it was good at the job and ship it off to help put down another one even if the mormons do surrender or claim theyre surrendering how many troops will we have to leave behind in utah to disarm them all and make sure they dont start fighting again as soon as our backs are turned robert taft asked just licking them isnt the only problem we have to remind them that theyre licked and that theyll catch it even worse if they give us any more trouble even now theyre probably stashing guns and explosives as fast as they can they probably were too she couldnt tell him he was wrong but she said if we say no you cant surrender what will they do fight till theyre all dead send people bombs all over the country and auto bombs and poison gas if they can arrange that theyll play samson in the temple except they wont be playing now taft gave her an unhappy look because that also seemed only too probable youre saying we dont win even if we win and they dont lose even if they lose oh they lose all right flora said but so do we maybe we ought to kill them all in that case taft said now flora violently shook her head no robert im going to quote the new testament at you even if i am jewish for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul youve seen the photos of those confederate camp guards grinning while they hold their rifles and stand there on trenches full of dead negroes do you want pictures like that with our soldiers in them she waited if taft said yes their cautious friendship was just one more war casualty but he shook his head too no those photographs sicken mealmost as much for what massacres like that do to the guards as for what they do to the poor colored people i dont want to murder the mormons like that but if they die in battle i wont shed many tears the question is can we make real us citizens out of the mormons flora said weve been trying since before the war of secession and we havent had much luck taft said almost two thousand years earlier hadnt roman senators and imperial officials in palestine asked the same kind of questions about the jews there they didnt come up with any good answers discrimination and maltreatment sparked one jewish revolt after another the revolts sparked mass slaughter plus more discrimination and maltreatment finally the romans ended up throwing most of the surviving jews out of palestine altogether floras head came up i wonder if that would work here she murmured if what would work here robert taft asked expelling the mormons from utah after they surrender flora answered where would you put them if you did that some place where they wouldnt make so much trouble flora explained what shed been thinking about her own peoples past are they tied to salt lake city the way the jews were to jerusalem in days gone by taft asked i have to tell you i dont know the answer to that does anyone somebody would probably be able to tell us but where would you put them in houston now that we have some of it back wouldnt they join the confederates against us would you send them up to canada wouldnt they just stir up the canucks arent the canucks stirred up enough already newfoundland wouldnt they start waving across the atlantic to the british those were all good questions disagree with him or not you judged robert taft a fool at your peril flora said maybe we could ship them to the sandwich islands it looks like well be able to hold on to those now wouldnt the mormons yell for the japanese taft snorted laughter and wouldnt they deserve each other maybe we could keep them off the island with honolulu and pearl harbor on it flora said the others dont matter so much to the military what im thinking is that if we get them out of utah we can search what they take with them they wouldnt have years and years worth of guns and ammunition and explosives squirreled away and hidden so well we couldnt find them they wouldnt when they left no taft agreed how long would they need to start getting hold of them though twenty minutesmaybe half an hour if we take them all the way out to the sandwich islands flora said i know that robert but we have to do something with those people and i dont want to kill them all i dont want to leave them in place either thats just asking for the whole thing to start all over again in another generation it wont if we keep an eye on them robert taft sighed and ran a hand over the bald crown of his head he was a much slimmer man than his father but william howard taft had kept his hair till his dying day with another sigh the senator from ohio went on i dont suppose its in the range of human nature to hold somebody down for much longer than a generation is it we couldnt even do it to the confederates after the great war will we after this one flora asked if we dont what will they eventually do to us because we didnt whatever they can probably we put off the evil day as long as were able to thats all taft said i suppose so flora also supposed she sounded uneasy if taft knew about the us project out in western washington hed never given any sign of it flora didnt want to talk about the possibility of splitting atoms or about the possibility of one bombs being able to destroy a whole city the confederate states werent so big a country as the united states but they were plenty big enough to conceal a project like that if the confederacy lost the war that kind of project would also fall to pieceswouldnt it it would take lots of money and lots of equipment a beaten csa wouldnt be able to afford or to hide but the fastest way to go from a beaten country to one ready to stand on its own two feet again was to make a bomb like that the mormons she got back to the issue at hand if were not going to slaughter them all weve got to accept their surrender i dont see any other choice do you really nooo taft sounded most reluctant to accept his own conclusion for which flora could hardly blame him but what can we do with them once we do sit on them in utah or sit on them somewhere else flora said those are the only two things we can do which would you rather if we drive them out we bring gentiles into utah to take their place taft said that wont be easy or cheap either robert from now on nothing this government does will be easy or cheap flora said taft pursed his lips as if biting down on an unripe persimmon democrats hated letting the government spend money except on guns but he didnt contradict her she went on we have to worry about whether we do the right thing finding it wont always be easy but we have to try right now nothing comes ahead of beating jake featherston taft said nothing well i dont think youll find many people in the usa to tell you youre wrong flora said i sure wont hes a danger to us and hes a danger to his own country and if he gets one of those uranium bombs hes a danger to the whole world again she swallowed that worry i dont like to speak ill of the dead but you were right and al smith was wrong in we never should have allowed the plebiscites that gave kentucky and houston back to the csa featherston uses the empty space in west texas as a shield against us and he used kentucky as a springboard to attack us he said he was going to taft said he told us what he had in mind and we didnt listen to him it almost makes you think we deserve whats happened since arent we paying for our own stupidity were paying for our own decency flora answered its not quite the same thing or i hope its not and that brings us back to the mormons im afraid can we be right and decent at the same time if we dont wipe them off the face of the earth if we do accept their surrender how do we make sure we dont give them a chance to pay us back for letting them live taft asked thats what it comes down to occupy the land they still hold disarm them as thoroughly as we can maybe ship them out of utah i dont know hostages for good behavior i suppose flora grimaced she didnt like that but she could see that it had a better chance of controlling the mormons than a lot of other things did taft nodded at each suggestion then she said freedom of worship as long as they render unto caesar she laughed shed quoted the new testament twice in the space of a few minutes theyll use it as an excuse to take lots of wives theyll use it as an excuse to get together and plot against us too taft said we have to give them a carrot along with the stick flora said otherwise theyll just keep fighting wouldnt you if you didnt get anything by quitting and do you know what else as long as all their marriages after the first one are unofficial im sick of flabbling about them life is too short taft grumbled discontentedly he was a straitlaced man but when they discussed the surrender offer in the joint committee on the conduct of the war he didnt oppose her when she made the same proposal she hoped that was a good sign from pittsburgh to cincinnati in one way dr leonard odoull thought that was progress when hed labored in the hospital on the university of pittsburgh campus the confederates still had a chance to break through to run wild in the second year of the war as they did in the first that didntquitehappen now after a hard winter and a rugged spring the enemy was gone from us soil east of the mississippi this summer the united states would have the chance to show what they could do granville mcdougald summed up odoulls worries in one pithy sentence how are we going to fuck it up this time even more than to be or not to be that was the question the us push toward richmond had shown a lot of the ways not to fight a war daniel macarthur seemed to do his best to acquaint the war department with every single one of them he hadnt come west to lead whatever the united states would do out here that struck odoull as at least mildly encouraging but when he looked around at what was left of cincinnati when he thought about all the devastation between pittsburgh and here he came close to despairing his church taught that despair was the one unforgivable sin and he understood why but it was hard to avoid anyway have we got enough left to do what we need to do he asked have the confederates got enough left to stop us mcdougald returned that was the other side of the coin all right plainly the confederates had put everything they had into the invasion of ohio and pennsylvania they arent running up the white flag odoull said the ruins of cincinnati proved that too after sullenly pulling back across the ohioand after rescuing most of the force they had north of the riverfeatherstons men started methodically shelling the ohio city from emplacements in kentucky their attitude seemed to be that if the united states wanted to use cincinnati as a base from which to invade cs territory they were welcome to try most of the casualties us doctors were treating came from artillery rounds bombs caused the rest confederate airplanes didnt come over every night but they came whenever they could us bombers also did their best to smash up targets on the far side of the river when do you think the balloon will go up mcdougald asked the hospital where they worked was painted white and had big red crosses on the walls and roof odoull didnt think the confederates shelled and bombed it on purpose that didnt mean it didnt get hit every now and again cs bombs and shells didnt have eyes they couldnt see exactly where they were going odoull remembered other offensives in days and years gone by when weve gathered everything together so theres no possible doubt about where were going or what were doing he answered when weve given the confederates all the time they need to get ready to knock us for a loop mcdougald raised an eyebrow toward the bald crown of his head youre in a cheerful mood today arent you doc well hell granny you asked odoull said tell me thats not how we usually do things cant granville mcdougald admitted wish to god i could but i damn well cant besides it looks like were filling cincinnati up with everything under the sun so we can pop the confederates in the nose doesnt it just odoull said and dont you suppose theyve got a suspicion that we might want to cross the river here wouldnt you not me ive given up having suspicions they end up getting confirmed and then im unhappy the medic said i dont like being unhappy it makes me sad when i am erright odoull said mcdougald smiled back calm as a cynical buddha before either one of them could go any further with it they got called into an operating room they had no room for a difference of opinion there what needed doing was only too obvious nothing any surgeon in the world could do would save an arm mangled like that one want to do the honors granny odoull said ill pass gas for you if you care to sure if you dont mind mcdougald answered a straight amputation i can manage and hell get the same result from me as he would from you its the complicated stuff where youve got an edge on me to some degree that was true the degree was less than mcdougald made it out to be scrupulously polite the medic didnt pretend to have an mds skills but he did have close to thirty years of experience at repairing wounded men plenty of doctors knew less than he did and were more arrogant about what they did know odoull knew he was an amateur anesthetist himself hed knocked out patients back in quebec before operating on them hed done it in the field too but he wasnt all that confident in his own skills here though everything was straightforward as soon as the man went out mcdougald got to work with scalpel and bone saw taking the mangled arm off above the elbow he tied off bleeders one after another closed the dreadful wound and sighed whatever that poor guy was he wont be when he wakes up maybe he was lefthanded odoull said mmmaybe mcdougald was a lefty himself odds are long though and even if a onearmed man has his good arm hes still got a hard road in front of him better than dying odoull said i suppose youre right i never once heard a dead man say hed rather be the way he was than short an arm mcdougald said you never odoulls voice trailed away as he worked through the possibilities in that how many dead people do you usually talk with oh not that many granville mcdougald said harder than anything getting a straight answer out of em i believe you odoull said have you noticed its pretty damn hard getting a straight answer out of you too out of me nah mcdougald shook his head im as transparent as glass the only problem with that is too many of our people are as breakable as glass which isnt so good he could spin out nonsense or sometimes stuff that seemed like nonsense but wasnt faster than odoull could pin him down on it odoull mostly didnt try only the sheer outrageousness of the medics latest effort pulled a protest out of him before he could do any more squawking an officer who pretty plainly wasnt a doctor came into the or major odoull the stranger asked when odoull admitted he was himself the newcomer said im vic hodding im a captain in intelligence granny mcdougald let out a soft snort above hoddings surgical mask his catgreen eyes swung toward the medic mcdougald blandly stared back nobody could prove a thing even if the editorial message came through loud and clear well captain what can i do for you odoull asked wondering if he really wanted to know weve got a wounded man we brought back from the other side of the ohio hodding replied he knows some things we really need to find out what are the drugs that would help pull them out of him rack and thumbscrews often work wonders mcdougald said hardly bothering to hide his scorn hodding glanced toward him again who is this man he inquired of odoull with a certain dangerous formality never mind odoull answered if you need help from me you dont need to know and if you dont need help from me ill be damned if i tell you and ill do everything i know how to do to stop you from making trouble for him captain hodding took that more calmly than odoull expectedmore calmly than he would have himself he thought he must be good at what he does the intelligence officer remarked odoull said nothing hodding went on anyway we need answers from this guy strongarm stuff may just get us liesand besides we dont like to do it no matter what mr high and mighty there says what goes around comes around and the confederates are too likely to pay us back if we get rough odoull could see what granny mcdougald was thinking so then they pay us back with needles instead oh boy but needles were less likely to wreck a man for life than some of the other things interrogators did what do you think this guy knows odoull asked vic hodding stood mute odoull made an impatient noise look im going to be there while youre questioning him right so what the hell are you flabbling about you dont want me there go find some other guy to do this for you after some thought and an apparent wrestle with himself hodding nodded yeah youre right doc you have needtoknow the way he brought out the phrase would have told odoull he was in intelligence even without any other evidence he continued we infiltrated some people down south of the river and extracted this guy what he doesnt know about their trains and trucks in kentucky and tennessee isnt worth knowing we should have got him out clean but he put up more of a fight than we figured he shrugged these things happen in films the guy always has the secret for the new poison gas odoull said yeah and the blonde with the big boobs teases it out of him and he loves every minute of it hodding said doctors in films never treat ringworm either but if the confederates have trouble moving supplies that makes our life a hell of a lot easier he wasnt wrong granville mcdougald murmured pentothal odoull nodded best chance ive got he turned to the intelligence officer sodium pentothal may make him not care so much about what he says or it may not drugging a guy and making him spill his guts is another one of those things that work better in films all right do what you can hodding said hes likelier to blab with the stuff in him than without it right odoull nodded againthat was true and didnt commit him to anything captain hodding gestured toward the door come on then the confederate officer was wounded in the leg and shoulder he glared at odoull i am travis ww oliphant colonel cs army he gave his pay number pleased to meet you colonel im major odoull im a doctor and im going to give you something to make you feel a little better odoull said colonel oliphant looked suspicious but he didnt try to fight as odoull injected him after a little while the confederate said i do feel easier pentothal sneaked up on you it didnt make your troubles go away but it did mean you werent likely to remember them once you came out from under it captain hodding started questioning oliphant the logistics specialist didnt seem to worry about what he said a lot that came out was drivel but enough wasnt to keep hodding scribbling notes odoull gave the colonel more pentothal too much and hed stop making sense altogether not enough and hed clam up odoull found what seemed the right dosage by experiment thanks major hodding said when colonel oliphant ran dry i think you helped well good odoull answered and wondered if it was would he want to look in a mirror the next time he passed one instead of going off to the peaceful even bucolic campus of washington university clarence potter summoned professor henderson v fitzbelmont to richmond potter wanted the nuclear physicist to see what the war was doing to the capital of the csa maybe then fitzbelmont wouldnt think of his experiments as abstractions that could move along at their own pace maybe if some florida cinema studio needed a professor out of central casting it could do much worse than henderson fitzbelmont he was tweedy he was bespectacled clarence potter wore eyeglasses too and had since he was a young man but he didnt look perpetually surprised at the world around him the way professor fitzbelmont did he met the physicist in capitol square across ninth street from the war department the bench on which he waited was the one where he and nathan bedford forrest iii hadnt quite plotted against jake featherston it gave a fine view of the bombedout ruins of the capitol of the craters whose dirt sported new grass and even flowers as spring advanced and of the sandbagged statues of george washington and albert sidney johnston if you looked around you could see more of what almost two years of yankee air raids had done to richmond professor fitzbelmont came into capitol square at two oclock just when potter asked him to potter stood up and waved he kept waving till fitzbelmont spotted him a look of relief on his face the professor waved back and picked his way over the battered ground to the bench hello uh general fitzbelmont said sticking out a hand professor potter shook hands henderson fitzbelmont did have a respectable grip potter gestured to the bench have a seat weve got some things to talk about all right professor fitzbelmont looked around i must say ive seen views that inspired me more you surprise me potter said i do why the physicist said its dreary its battered its sadi cant think of one good thing to say about it thats why it ought to inspire you potter said behind the lenses of his spectacles henderson v fitzbelmont blinked potter went on it shows you that your countrys in trouble if any one man can get us out of trouble youre him if we have uranium bombs we win its that simple mr potter fitzbelmont began general potter please potter broke in he saw the faint scorn the other man didnt have the sense to hide nettled he did his best to explain it means as much to me as professor does to you and i had to go through a lot to earn itnot the same kinds of things you did but a lot henderson fitzbelmont weighed that he evidently didnt find it wanting for he nodded im sorry general potter ill remember from now on you must understand we are doing everything we know how to do to make a uranium bomb one of the things were finding out unfortunately is how much we dont know how to do when you go through unexplored territory that happens i wish it didnt but it does he was calm sensible rational clarence potter had no doubt that made him a splendid scientist it didnt help a country at war a country fighting for its life a country whose fight for its life wasnt going any too well how do we go faster potter asked whatever you need youll get president featherston has made that very clear yes i certainly cant complain about the support im getting especially after thesad events in pittsburgh fitzbelmont saidmaybe he did own something resembling discretion after all but then he went on what this project needs most of all is time if you can give me back all the months when the president believed it a foolish waste of money and effort we will be better off i guarantee you that so there potter thought youre the physicist he said if you can undo thathell if you can do that forget about the uranium bomb time travel is for the pulp magazines im afraid fitzbelmont said no evidence that its possible and plenty that it isnt the bomb on the other hand is definitely possibleand definitely difficult too i remember your saying before that working with uranium hexafluoride was giving you fits potter said are you doing better with that now somewhat fitzbelmont answered the physicist didnt blink when potter got hexafluoride out without stumbling he chose to take that as a mild compliment henderson fitzbelmont continued weve come up with some new chemicalsfluorocarbons were calling themthat the uranium hexafluoride doesnt attack nothing else seems to either theyll have all kinds of peacetime usesim sure of it for now though they give us much better control over the uf uf potter wondered then he realized it was another way to say uranium hexafluoride if he werent used to hearing co for carbon dioxide he would have been baffled all right he said after a pause he hoped fitzbelmont didnt notice so youve got better control over it what does that mean it puts fewer people in the hospital it doesnt eat through so much lab apparatus those are good starting points fitzbelmont said and potter could hardly tell him he was wrong now we actually have a chance to separate the uf with the u from the uf with the u you havent done that yet potter said in dismay its not easy the two isotopes are chemically identical fitzbelmont reminded him we cant add say bicarbonate of soda and have it do something with one and not with the other it wont work the difference in weight between the two molecules is just under one percent thats what weve got to take advantage ofif we can and potter said so far we seem to be having the most luck with centrifuges henderson fitzbelmont said the degree of enrichment each treatment gives is small but its real and the centrifuges were using now are a lot stronger than the ones we had when we started they need to bethe old ones arent worth much not for this kind of research and when you treat the slightly enriched uh uf you get slightly more enriched uf is that right potter asked its exactly right by the way fitzbelmont beamed hed just got an a on his midterm after enough steps we do expect to achieve some very significant enrichment how far away from a bomb are you potter asked bluntly well i wont know till we get closer professor fitzbelmont said potter made an impatient noise hastily the physicist continued if i had to guess id say were two years away assuming everything goes perfectly since it wontit never doestwo and a half years maybe three seems a better guess so we wouldnt have this tilllate maybe potter shook his head we need it sooner than that professor we need it a hell of a lot sooner than that all those months jake featherston wasted were coming back to haunt the csa the damnyankees sure didnt waste any time when they realized a uranium bomb was possible which raised another questionhow soon will the united states get one of these things youd do better asking someone in philadelphia fitzbelmont said clarence potter made another wordless noise this one full of frustration he was doing his best to spy on the us uraniumbomb project without much luck yankee authorities were holding their cards so close to their chest they were almost inside their ribs fitzbelmont added you can do something about when the united states get theirs you know hows that again full of his own gloom potter listened to fitzbelmont with half an ear jake featherston was going to come down on him like a thousandpound bomb featherston wouldnt blame himself for stalling the confederate project he never blamed himself for anything but the confederacy couldnt afford the late start the united states had more scientists and more resources they had enough left over that they could afford mistakes everything had to go right to give the csa a decent chance to win for a while it had for a while you can delay the us bomb general henderson v fitzbelmont said if you damage or destroy the facility where the yankees are working on it youll make them deal with what youve done instead of going forward on their own work he wasnt wrong he wasnt even slightly wrong son of a bitch potter muttered the us project was hard for the csa to reachway the hell out there in washington state where theres a will theres a lawyer he thought bemusedly the confederates could figure out how to attack it if they needed to badly enough the way things looked now they did potter shook his head hed seen the race to the uranium bomb as just that a race if the united states started out ahead and ran faster anyhow what would happen theyd get to the finish line first and when they did richmond would go up in heat like the center of the sun and that would be the end of that but it wasnt just a race it was a war in a race youd get disqualified if you tripped the other guy and threw sand in his eyes in a war you might buy yourself the time you needed to catch up and go ahead this time clarence potter grabbed fitzbelmonts hand and pumped it up and down professor im damn glad i called you into richmond he said damn glad good the physicist said as for me i look forward to returning to my work as long as im here can i ask you send me oh five skilled workers were desperately short of them and it seems next to impossible to pry the kind of people we need out of war plants youll have em by god potter promised can you tell me who told you no whoever it is hell be sorry he was ever born grim anticipation filled his voice fitzbelmont reached into the inside pocket of his herringbone jacket i have a list right here no this is a list of some of the things my wife wants me to shop for while im in richmond he frowned then reached into the other inside pocket ah here we are he handed potter the list he needed ill take care of these folks professor theyll find out what priority means you can count on that potter carefully put the list in his wallet he even more carefully refrained from mentioning or so much as thinking about how well fitzbelmont played the role of an absentminded professor thank you general are we finished fitzbelmont asked when potter nodded the physicist got to his feet he looked around at capitol square sighed and shook his head he started off then stopped and looked back uh freedom freedom potter hated the slogan but that didnt matter in jake featherstons csa not responding was inconceivable henderson v fitzbelmont walked north toward fords hotel under one name or another the hotel had stood across the street from capitol square since before the war of secession watching the physicist go clarence potter sighed anne colleton always stayed at fords when she came up to richmond potter had stayed there himself too but his thoughts were on the south carolina woman hedloved he nodded no other word for it even if it was a crossgrained jagged kind of love and one much marred by politics shed backed jake featherston when the freedom party was only a little cloud on the horizon potter laughed hed never leaned that way himself he still didnt come to that but now anne was dead killed in a yankee air raid on charleston one of her brothers got gassed by the yankees in the great war and was murdered at the start of the red negro uprising the other went into pittsburgh tom colleton wasnt listed as a pow so he was probably dead a whole family destroyed by the usa we need that bomb potter murmured jesus do we ever wow george enos said as the townsend approached san diego harbor the mainland i wondered if id ever see it again ill kiss the pier when we get off the ship fremont dalby said the gun chief added too goddamn many times when i didnt just wonder if id see it againi was fucking sure i wouldnt hed been in the navy sincewell not quite since steam replaced sail but one hell of a long time he could say something like that without worrying that people might think he was yellow george couldnt which didnt mean the same thought hadnt gone through his mind dalby nudged him you can hop a train go on back to boston see the wife and kiddies all you need is a couplethree weeks of liberty right he laughed and laughed funny george said funny like a broken leg nobody was going to get liberty like that the brass might dole out twentyfour and fortyeighthour passes enough to let sailors from the destroyer sample san diegos bars and brothels and tattoo parlors and other dockside attractions george had never been here in his life but he was sure theyd be the same as the dives in boston and honolulu sailors were the same here werent they as long as they were the attractions would be too hey nobodys shooting at us for a little bit fritz gustafson said ill take that from the loader it was quite a speech for a while yeah dalby agreed wonder where well go after they fuel us and get us more ammo and all that good shit probably down south against the mexicans and the confederates i guess that sounded like nasty unpleasant dangerous work to george hed seen enough nasty unpleasant dangerous work already maybe theyll send us up off the canadian coast so we can keep the japs from running guns to the canucks dream on dalby said fuck if they send us up there theyll probably send us to whatever the hell the name of that other place isyou know with the russians alaska gustafson said the cpo nodded there you go thats it nothing but emperors for us weve been messing with the mikados boys for too long now we can tangle with the tsar and the seas up there are worse than the north atlantic george started to say that was impossible he knew the north atlantic well and knew how bad it could get but hed also rounded cape horn that was worse maybe the pacific was godawful up in the polarbear country too russians hardly give a damn about alaska anyway fritz gustafson said well jesus would you dalby said its more siberia theyve got enough siberia already if somebody ever found gold in it or something youd have to remember it was there till then shit who cares san diego wasnt honolulu the weather wasnt quite perfect it got cooler at night than it did in the sandwich islands it was just very good to somebody whod grown up in boston that would do fine george sent a telegram to connie letting her and the boys know he was all right the clerk at the western union office said it may take a while to get there sir we still dont have as many lines as wed like to carry eastwest traffic the man who was more than old enough to be georges father held up a hand when he saw him start to get mad dont blame me sir i dont have anything to do with it im just telling you how things are you got to blame somebody go and blame jake featherston everybody in the usa had good cause to blame jake featherston for something or other a telegram delayed was small change ohios being torn to pieces badly enough to delay the telegram was rather larger george didnt dwell on ohio the telegram ticked him off like politics grievances were personal sure enough he got a twentyfourhour liberty he wished it were fortyeight but anything was better than nothing with the rest of the mm gun crew he drank and roistered and got his ashes hauled he felt bad about that afterwardswhat was he doing going to bed with a whore with saggy tits right after sending his wife a wire he felt bad afterwards but it felt great while it was happeningand that was what he was doing lying down with the chippy he also got a tattoo on his left bicepsa big anchor that didnt feel good while it was happening even though he was drunk but fritz gustafson was getting a naked woman on his right biceps so george sat still for it he wasnt about to flinch in front of his buddy only later did he wonder if fritz took the pricking in silence because he was there getting tattooed too his arm felt worse the next morning he wasnt drunk then he was hungover all of him felt worse but his arm especially itll get easier in a day or two fremont dalby said that was rough sympathy not hardheartedness dalby had ornaments on both arms and a small tiger on his right buttock he turned out to know what he was talking about by the time the townsend sailed a week later george almost forgot about the tattoo except when he looked down and saw the blue marks under his skin he also liked gustafsons ornament but connie would clout him if he came home with a floozy on his arm fritz was a bachelor and could get away with stuff like that the townsend sailed south toward the not very distant border with the empire of mexico she was part of a flotilla that included three more destroyers two light cruisers a heavy cruiser and two escort carriers the baby flattops were just like the ones that helped make sure the japs wouldnt take the sandwich islands away from the usa they were built on freighter hulls and had a freighters engines inside going flat out they could make eighteen knots but each one carried thirty airplanes that gave them ten or twenty times the reach of even the heavy cruisers guns although the flotilla stood well out to sea it wasnt very long before yranging gear picked up a couple of airplanes outbound from baja california to look things over goddamn mexicans dalby said as george ran up to the antiaircraft gun what did you expect a big kiss george asked dalby told him what francisco jose could kiss and why the cpo might have embroidered on that theme for quite a while but fritz gustafson said next to what the japs threw at us this is all chickenshit take an even strain fighters roared east off the flight decks of the monitor and the bonhomme richard they came back in less than half an hour a couple of them waggled their wings as they flew over the carriers escorts no mexican airplanes appeared over the flotilla score onei mean twofor the good guys george said yeah fremont dalby nodded but now the greasers will start screaming to the confederates gotta figure were in business to yank jake featherstons tail feathers anyway so pretty soon well be playing against the first team confederates dont have any carriers in guaymas george said no but theyve got landbased air and theyve got subs and who knows what all shit they do have in the gulf of california dalby said i guess thats what were doingfinding out what kind of shit theyve got there such a thing as finding out the hard way george said when the flotilla got near the southern end of baja california bombers and fighter escorts left the escort carriers decks to pummel the mexican installations at cabo san lucas scuttlebutt said the installations werent just mexican but also confederate george wouldnt have been surprised cabo san lucas warded the gulf of california which led to confederate sonora and the place was isolated enoughwhich was putting it mildlyto keep word of confederate soldiers doing mexicans jobs from spreading too far or too fast cabo san lucas lay at about the same latitude as honolulu even lying well offshore the townsend got much hotter weather than she did in the sandwich islands george wondered why maybe the north american continent screwed up the winds or something that was all he could think of then he stopped worrying about the weather now hear this now hear this the loudspeakers blared we have two damaged aircraft returning from the raid on the mexicans they will come as far as they can before ditching and we are going to go out after them we dont want to strand anybody if we can help it roger that george exclaimed he imagined floating in a life raft or maybe just in a life jacket praying somebody would pluck him out of the pacific before the sharks or the glaring sun did him in he shuddered it was worse than going into the drink after your ship sank because youd be all alone out there the townsend two other destroyers and a light cruiser peeled off and raced toward the mexican coast up there in the sky the pilots would be nursing everything they could from their shotup airplanes every mile west they made bumped up their chances of getting rescued a swarm of intact aircraft flew over the ships they were heading home to the carriers their pilots had to be thanking god they could get home then george spotted a dive bomber low in the sky and trailing smoke even as he watched the airplane went into the pacific the pilot put it down as well as anybody could hope to it skidded across the surfaceit didnt nose in did he ditch well enough only one way to find out the townsend was closer to the downed airplane than any of the other ships she sped toward where it went down by the time she got there the dive bomber had already sunk but george joined in the cheers on deck an inflatable life raft bobbed in the blue blue water two men crouched inside a third in a life jacket floated nearby they all waved frantically one of them fired a flare pistol though daylight overwhelmed the red glow lines with life rings attached flew over the ships side the downed fliers put them on eager sailors hauled the men up on deck god bless you guys said the one whom george helped rescue youre prettier than my wife right now he had a nasty cut over one eye and burns on his face and hands all things considered he was lucky the fellow who wore the life jacket couldnt stand broken leg somebody by him said get him down to sick bay i dont mind the injured man said as they laid him on a stretcher i figured id be holding a lily but jack there he did a fuck of a job i hear somebody else was in trouble too said the flier with the cuts and burnsjack i hope some of you sailor fellows find him too well look for him pal thats what were here for a sailor said ought to get you down to sick bay too i bet you need stitches for what jack didnt even seem to know he was hurt they took him below anyway a fighter was flying slow circles over where the other airplane went down about forty miles east of the townsends rescue but all the destroyers and cruiser found when they got there was an oil slick and a little floating wreckageno sign of the crew too bad george said cant win em all fremont dalby said we broke even way things usually work out that puts us ahead of the game i guess george said the rescued men were here yes but the poor bastards who didnt make it out of their airplanethey didnt break even they lost breaking even only mattered if you were on the outside vi jefferson pinkard watched confederate soldiers set up antiaircraft guns around camp determination he went over to the major in charge of the job an officer named webb wyatt how much good dyou reckon thisll do he asked wyatt shifted a chaw from one cheek to the other and spat a stream of tobacco juice much too close to pinkards highly polished boots well ill tell you he drawled its a hell of a lot bettern not doing anything than not doing anything sir pinkard snapped the major in butternut looked him up and down he was suddenly and painfully conscious that he wore freedom party gray himself well ill tell you wyatt said again i say sir to people who i reckon deserve it what did you ever do to make me reckon that rage ripped through jeff it thickened his voice as he ground out ill tell you what i did you little chickenshit asshole i fought in the trenches when you were still in short pants i joined the party before you had hair on your nuts ive been runnin camps since jake featherston got to be president of the csa my ranks the same as major general you want me to call up ferd koenig and ask him if he reckons you ought to call me sir you cocksucking whistleass how soon you reckon youll see the inside of one of these here camps for your very own self well motherfucker answer me god damn you major wyatt went very red then as he realized how much more than he could chew hed bitten off he went white instead pinkard knew damn well he could send wyatt to a camp and he knew damn well he would too and enjoy every minute of it seeing that anticipation of pleasure yet to come helped break the army officer please excuse me sir wyatt mumbled and saluted as if on the drill grounds at vmi i beg your humble pardon sir you fuckin well better beg jeff said who ever told you you could talk to a superior officer that way wyatt bit his lip and stood mute pinkard knew what he wasnt saying that he didnt think a camp guard really was his superior regardless of what rank badges might show too bad for him hed picked the wrong man to rile lets try it again pinkard told him how much will these guns help sir if the damnyankees send a whole big swarm of bombers over youre screwed did wyatt sound as if he hoped the usa did just that if he did he wasnt blatant enough to let jeff call him on it he went on for small raids or for driving off reconnaissance airplanes theyll do a lot there you see you really can answer when you set your mind to it jeff said nowhow come we dont have more fighters to drive off those yankee fuckers before they get here on account of all that stuff is back east sir major wyatt answered far as richmond is concerned west texas is strictly nowhere only good thing about that is its strictly nowhere for the damnyankees too he had a point but less of one than he thought snyder texas and even lubbock texas were indeed strictly nowhere to both csa and usa but camp determination damn well wasnt it was the biggest of the camps the freedom party was using to solve the confederacys negro problem that made it vital to the country and the party and the yankees used it for propaganda against the csa can you use those guns against ground targets too jeff asked reckon we can if we have to sir major wyatt said antiaircraft guns make pretty fair antibarrel guns no doubt about it but i think youre flabbling over nothing if you figure well need to usa wont get this far well if the damnyankees dont get this far you know how come thatll be pinkard demanded his temper rising again on account of freedom party guards stopped emmore than the army could do by its lonesome and you know who asked em to send in the guards me thats who he jabbed a thumb at his own chest uh yes sir wyatt was wising up he wasnt wising up fast enough to suit jeff you think maybe people in uniforms that arent the same as yours deserve a salute every now and then major how about that huh what do you think yes sir i think they do i was wrong before as if to prove the point major wyatt saluted pinkard returned the salute he wasnt about to let the army man accuse him of not following etiquette but as far as he was concerned wyatt didnt prove a damn thing except that he had maybe enough sense to try to save his own neck with a small sigh jeff decided that would have to do he couldnt make the man in the butternut uniform love him all he could do was make wyatt treat him with military courtesy i damn well did that he thought anything else major pinkard asked no sir wyatt saluted again jeff returned it again the major said permission to leave sir he wasnt taking any chances now granted jeff said and wyatt got out of there as if the seat of his pants were on fire he probably thought his drawers were smoking watching the army mans ignominious retreat jeff smiled a slow sated smile almost the smile he might wear after going to bed with edith this was a different kind of satisfaction but no less real he was somebody by god he could throw his weight around one hand rested on his belly he had plenty of weight to throw too not bad for somebody whod figured on spending the rest of his life making steel at the sloss works in birmingham no not bad at all another sign hed arrived was the driver who took him back into snyder when his shift at camp determination was up some evenings he spent on a cot in the administrative compound not tonight though he smiled again as the camp receded behind him thinking about the kind of smile hed have after going to bed with edith made him want to put on that kind of smile back in the days before the war he might have had a colored chauffeur he didnt suppose anybody had a colored chauffeur any more times were changing in the csa an ordinary camp guard had to do that was all right the guard was the party equivalent of a private and privates got stuck with nigger work that was true in king davids day and julius caesars and william the conquerors and it was still true now the brakes squeaked when the driver parked the birmingham in front of jeffs house in snyder got to get that seen to jeff thought the driver jumped out and opened the door for him here you are sir thanks cletus jeff made a point of learning the mens names it didnt cost him anything and it made them feel good see you in the morningor sooner if anything goes wrong he never stopped worrying that was probably why things went wrong so seldom yes sir cletus had no trouble remembering that he needed to salute he jumped back into the auto and drove away when pinkard walked into the house his two stepsons were playing a game on the floor of the front room it seemed to involve wringing each others necks they broke off as soon as he came in papa jeff they both squealed in the shrill smallboy register just below what only dogs can hear hi papa jeff they tried to tackle him they werent big enough even together but they were a lot bigger than when he married their mother the year before one of these days he didnt want to think about that and he didnt have to not when edith came out of the kitchen and gave him a kiss hello jeff she said wasnt sure if youd be back tonight wouldnt miss it he said and gave her an extra squeeze to show what he had in mind what smells good he added an alluring odor followed her ive got a nice beef tongue cookingwith cloves and everything the way you like it she paused to eye her sons why dont you boys go out and play ive got something to tell papa jeff why cant we hear asked frank the older because i want to tell papa jeff not youthats why his mother answered now beat it before i send you to your room instead he disappeared even faster than major wyatt had so did his brother willie whats up pinkard asked im going to have a baby jeff had gone so long without getting a woman pregnant he wondered if he was shooting blanks well ill be he said then he realized edith had to be looking for something better than that wonderful he hugged her and kissed her and with the boys out of the house set a possessive hand on her backside she smiled thats how this started i didnt reckon it was any other way jeff answered jesus yeah not us dont you start edith was a churchgoing woman she took her faith much more seriously than jeff took his he believed in jake featherston the way she believed in jesus from everything he could see jesus didnt deliver lately though jake featherston wasnt delivering either the confederate states were gone from just about all the us territory they took when the war was new not even the professional optimists on the wireless were predicting when the csa would reinvade the usa all the talk these days was of defense and of outlasting the enemy the freedom party guards ferdinand koenig threw into the fight had stopped the damnyankees not far beyond lubbock they couldnt retake the town though and they couldnt push us forces back very far a goodsized chunk of west texas remained under the yankee boot heel all right jeff said to edith and then in what had to seem like a change of subject to her but didnt to him i hear the united states are going to start up that uh darn state of houston againgive the collaborators something to do thats dreadful she exclaimed theyre so wicked theyve got no business doing anything like that she paused then asked how are things at the camp going well enough he rarely gave her a detailed answer when she asked something like that she wasnt really looking for one either she both knew and didnt know what went on inside the barbed wire she didnt like to think about it for that matter neither did pinkard he said what shall we name the baby if its a girl id like to call her lucy after my mother edith said jeff nodded all right its a good name and if its a boy what do you think of raymond she asked he hesitated her first husband was called chick what the devil was his real name jeff didnt want his son named after the camp guard whod killed himself chick blades real name wasleroy jeff almost snapped his fingers he was so glad to remember raymondll do fine he said that was easy he ate more than his share at supper so did his stepsonsthey liked tongue he smiled to see them stuff themselves maybe it would make them sleepy sooner than usual and it did he smiled again things were going his way edith even let him leave the light on she usually liked darkness better youre beautiful he said while he stroked her and kissed her while she touched him he believed it and he made her believe he believed it too oh jeff she said and then a little later oh jeff her nails dug into his back he spent himself at the same time as she quivered beneath him the damnyankees even the camp seemed a million miles away they wouldnt in the morning though and that was a crying shame boston lieutenant sam carsten said as a pilot guided the josephus daniels through the minefields that kept submersibles and surface raiders away from the harbor bostons a good town oh yes sir pat cooley agreed the exec went on good restaurants theaters all kinds of things you can do here yeah sams voice was dry when he was a rating his liberties here revolved around saloons and whorehouses restaurants theaters those were for other people people with time on their hands and without money burning a hole in their pocket the pilot swung the helm a little to port how did you know to do that then cooley asked simple sir last time i didnt i blew up the man answered deadpan thatll teach you pat carsten said teach me what cooley said in tones more plaintive than they had to be the pilot chuckled and turned the ship again when he thought he needed to the josephus daniels didnt explode sam was in favor of not exploding an hour later the destroyer escort was tied up at a pier in the us navy yard across the river from boston properand boston improperin charlestown the first liberty party went off to roister just as sam would have without gold stripes on his cuffs since he had them he went through the navy yard to report to his superiors he gave a lot of salutes and returned just about as many to his own amusement he caused a lot of confusion here he was a middleaged man with several rows of fruit salad on his chest young lieutenant commanders and commandersthe upandcomers in the navywould assume he had to be at least a captain if not of flag rank their right arms would start to go up then they would see he was only a lieutenant and stop in the middle of their salute till sam bailed them out with one of his own sometimes they wouldnt notice they outranked him when that happened he gravely returned a salute with one of his own he left a trail of bemused officers in his wake he messed up their mental yranging gear the men to whom he reported had no doubt about his grade they were his age and had the rank he could have aspired to if he werent a mustang reporting as ordered sir he said to the fourstriper who headed things he saluted first returning the courtesy captain william mcclintock said take a seat carsten thank you sir sam said though he wasnt sure he was grateful hed got used to being skipper of the josephus daniels a potentate who gave orders and had to worry about receiving them only from a distance now under the eyes of five senior officers he felt more like a bug on a plate than a potentate youve had a busy time in the north atlantic mcclintock observed his craggy features and sunbaked skin said hed spent a lot of time at sea yes sir sam answered what mcclintock said was trueand any which way it was hard to go wrong saying yes sir to your superiors one of the other captains across the table looked down at some papers through bifocals tilting his head back to read sam wore reading glasses but still saw well enough at a distance youve done pretty well for yourself seems like said the captainhis name was schuyler moultrie thank you sir sam saidone more phrase where it was hard to go wrong have you had anyspecial disciplinary problems aboard the josephus daniels carsten captain mcclintock asked sam knew what that meant any mustang would have no sir he answered i try to keep a tight rein on my cposnot tight enough to choke em you understand because they have to do their jobs but tight enough so they cant get away with murder mcclintocks mouth twitched in what looked like a swallowed smile sam knew what that meant toohed said the right thing a mustang who still behaved like a cpo himself was liable to let his chiefs run wild and that wasnt good for the ship one of the best pieces of advice he got after his promotion was to remember he was an officer he always did his best to follow it how badly are you hurting the british captain moultrie asked sir you would know better than i do sam said moultrie raised an eyebrow and waited sam went on i know what we stop ive got an idea of what the other ships in the squadron stop but i dont think any of us knows how much gets through in spite of us good answer said ken davenport the captain at sams far left seems to be worthwhile what were doing mcclintock said he eyed carsten from across the table anything special youd like to tell us lieutenant anything youve found out that other skippers ought to know not to trust the limeys as far as you can throw them sam said at once that freighter with the big guns the catapultlaunched fightertheyre sneaky bastards mcclintocks grin startled sam he hadnt thought the rugged badlands of that face could rearrange themselves so then what does that make you the senior officer asked whatever they threw at you you beat i dont know that for a fact sir carsten answered i wish i did but i dont if they were sneaky enough they slid on by me and i never knew the difference not too likely not with yranging gear captain davenport said which only proved he didnt know much about the north atlantic in dirty weather by the way captain mcclintock stirred he was thinking the same thing before he could say anything davenport went on i will say that recognizing the possibility does you credit well thats true enough mcclintock said weve got ourselves a raft of officers who think theyre smarter than they really are finding one who thinks hes dumber than he really is makes for a refreshing change he eyed sam well lieutenant do you want to go back on patrol when your refits finished sir ill go wherever you send me sam said real destroyers are probably better suited to that job than escorts like my ship though theyve got more legs so they can cover more ocean fewer things are likely to get past them he is a smart one captain moultrie remarked so he is good for him mcclintock said placidly he turned back to sam you arent wrong the only trouble is we havent got enough real destroyers to go around were gaining on it but we arent there yet and the ones we do have in the north atlantic we need farther east speed counts for even more there than it does on patrol duty all right sir where to send ships wasnt sams decision if you want the josephus daniels back out there thats where shell go youre the fellow who landed those marines on that confederate coastal island arent you moultrie asked yes sir i did that sam wondered if he should have said he was panting to go back out on patrol coastal raiding made for exciting films but if you were doing it for real you kept all your sphincters puckered tight till you got out of range of confederate landbased air we have anything like that in the hopper davenport asked well we could if we had an experienced skipper to handle it moultrie answered they talked as if sam werent there he wished he werent he wasnt eager to volunteer for a dangerous mission but he knew he wouldnt turn it down if they gave it to him you didnt do that not if you were an officer you didnt if you were a rating either gives us something else to think about captain mcclintock sounded pleased of course he didhed be giving somebody else the shitty end of the stick but the ribbons on his chest said hed done warm work himself he nodded to sam we need to talk to some people ourselves lieutenant if you stay in port an extra day or two im sure itll break your crews hearts wont it sir youll probably hear them crying all the way over in providence sam said that made two or three of the captains snort mcclintock said im sure i will all right carstenyoull hear from us one way or the other before long you have anything to say before we let you go whatever you give me whatever you give my ship well take a swing at it sam said i guess thats it ohand my exec is ready for a command of his own past ready i hate to say it because i hate to lose him but its true we know about lieutenant cooleyindeed we do the senior captain replied the others nodded just how fast a track was pat on mcclintock continued as for the otherwell plenty of worse things you could tell us all rightdismissed for now when sam got back to the josephus daniels lieutenant cooley asked whats up skipper well i dont exactly know sam answered he didnt say anything about the senior officers regard for cooley that would come out in its own time if it did maybe theyll send us out on patrol again or maybe theyll give us something else to do something hushhush and sneaky cooley said something where our ass is grass if the bad guys find out about it they didnt say that in so many words sam said it sounded that way to me though they remembered that time we carried the leathernecks they would the exec said darkly they didnt tell you what huh nope sam shook his head doesnt sound good nope sam repeated sure doesnt way i figure it well sail up the james to richmond land our marines to scoop up jake featherston and shell the tredegar iron works while we wait for them to bring the son of a bitch back cooley looked at him i hope you didnt tell the brass anything like that theyd take you up on it in a redhot minuteand if they did we wouldnt sail up the james wed go up that other creek insteadwithout a paddle too dont i know it sam said no i didnt give them any fancy ideas i may be dumb but im not that dumb besides they can come up with all kinds of fancy ideas all by themselves they dont need any help from me maybe theyll shift the whole crew to a river monitor so we can help when our guys go over the ohio cooley suggested theres a cheery thought carsten shivered during the great war both sides put monitors on the ohio and the mississippi some of them carried guns worthy of a battleship they gave heavy cannon mobility the big guns couldnt get any other way but even then they were vulnerable to mines which both sides sowed broadcast in the rivers and monitors were even more vulnerable these days they were slow and they had little room to maneuver which meant dive bombers cleaned up on them sam supposed he would rather command a river monitor than try to defuse unexploded bombs but neither job was his idea of fun while waiting for orders sam did some discreet roistering at places where officers could roister discreetly he enjoyed himself he would have had more fun at the raucous joints where he went before he became an officer but he kept that to himself a mustang who still behaved like a petty officer wasnt a good officer sam had seen enough men who proved the point pat cooley plainly had a good time at those discreet establishments but then he was an upandcomer with an annapolis ring he was supposed to know how to enjoy himself like a gentleman they both happened to be aboard the josephus daniels when the orders arrived as if from on high sam read them without a word he passed them on to cooley well well the exec said brightly when he finished going through them doesnt this look like fun now that you mention it sam said no troop leader hipolito rodriguez was starting to dread duty on the womens side of camp determination whenever he went over there bathsheba and antoinette looked for him so they could give him messages to take to xerxes over on the mens side and he had to make up messages from xerxes to give to them otherwise they would realize the truth this is what you get for being kind even once rodriguez thought unhappily he delivered one message after that he took the old mallate to the bathhouse xerxes didnt care about anything any more and he wasnt about to send messages back to the womens side on his own but how was rodriguez supposed to tell the mans wife and daughter that he was dead he saw no way however much he wished he did they would wail and scream and blame him and he was to blame too didnt he shepherd everybody in that barracks into the bathhouse it needed doing more negroes filled the building now pretty soon they would get what was coming to them too when rodriguez sent swarms of men and women he didnt know into the bathhouse or into the trucks that asphyxiated them it was only a job the way planting corn and beans on his farm outside of baroyeca was only a job he didnt think about it he just did it didnt he back the freedom party because it promised to do something about the negroes in the csa and because jake featherston kept his promises when it came to bathsheba and antoinette though they werent just mallates any more they were people and thinking about killing people was much harder and much less pleasant than thinking about getting rid of abstractions even abstractions with black skins part of him hoped they would go in a population reduction while he was over on the mens side then they would be gone and he wouldnt have to worry about it any more but they kept hanging on no matter what the guards orders were they didnt clean out the womens side as efficiently as the mens even those hardbitten men found their hearts softeningsome at least naturally that meant the womens side got more crowded than the mens just as naturally jefferson pinkard noticed rodriguez remembered when jeff came back from what was plainly a disastrous leave during the great war pinkard went hard and merciless himself after that he hadnt changed sinceif anything he was more so now what with the job he had to do that wasnt surprising he lectured the guards about not softening uponce when that didnt work he found a new way to solve the problem a work gangmale prisonersran up new barracks on the womens side of camp determination before long new guards filled them they wore the gray of freedom party guardsbut instead of gray tunics and trousers they wore gray blouses and skirts jefferson pinkard or somebody set above him decided that female guards would be as tough on women as male guards were on men and it worked to hipolito rodriguezs way of thinking it worked appallingly well the new guards were all whitesno women from sonora or chihuahua they were all toughlooking rodriguez would much rather have dallied with colored prisoners than with any of them they carried the same submachine guns as their male counterparts and they knew how to use them they wasted no time proving it to the negro women either the first few days they started patrolling the north side of camp determination they shot three women in separate incidents it was as if they were warning dont give us any guff youll pay for it if you try and they didnt waste any time sending negro women to the bathhouse on that side and for oneway rides in the asphyxiating trucks they hardly bothered pretending the eliminations were anything but eliminations the womens side began to bubble with terror with the female guards building up numbers over there rodriguez took a turn on that side less and less often that wasnt bad in a lot of ways it was a relief but he didnt like what he saw when he did a shift there and he especially didnt like what he felt the hair on his arms and at the back of his neck kept wanting to stand on end that side was an explosion waiting to happen because he was who he was he had no trouble getting in to see jeff pinkard saluting his buddy from the trenches always felt funny but he did it whats on your mind hip pinkard asked you arent one of those people who flabble for the fun of flabbling i hope not senor jeff rodriguez answered but those guards on the womens side those lesbianoshe didnt know if they were or not but if some of them werent hed never seen anythey make trouble there that got pinkards attention all right how do you mean he rapped out they donthow you saythey dont keep the secret you make the men do it the lady guards they should do the same thing rodriguez said pinkard drummed his fingers on the desk thats not so good he got out of his chair stuck his hat on his head and grabbed his submachine gun ill have a look for myself he said that whenever he found a problem rodriguez admired him for it he didnt let things fester if something was wrong he went after it right away he had no trouble making up his mind by that time the next day three female officers and half a dozen noncoms in skirts were gone pinkard assembled the rest of the female freedom party guards and spoke to them for most of an hour while men patrolled the womens half of the camp rodriguez never found out exactly what the camp commandant said but it seemed to do the trick the female guards stopped being so blatant about what camp determination was for little by little the women on that side relaxedas much as they could relax while not so slowly starving to death bathsheba and antoinette still survived the cleanouts missed them again and again in a way rodriguez was glad they were people to him now and they hadnt done anything to deserve death except be born black he liked the older woman and the younger one would have been beautiful if she werent so thin but they reminded him of exactly what he was doing here and he didnt like that thanks to the hardhearted female guards they had a pretty good idea of what would happen to them one o these days they gonna put an end to us aint that right bathsheba asked with no particular fear and no particular hatred aint happened yet dont got to happen rodriguez tried to dodge around the truth she wagged a finger at him i aint nothin but a nigger cleanin lady but i aint no blind nigger cleanin lady you wave somethin in front o my face reckon i see it i dont wave nothin he did his best to misunderstand she wouldnt let him dont reckon its any different on the mens side is it i dont know what you mean you got women over here men over there of course is different bathsheba sighed i spell it out for you she laughed i aint hardly got my letters but here i is spellin fo you they killin folks over yonder the same way they killin folks here he didnt answer he couldnt answer saying yes would admit far too much saying no wouldnt just be a liethat wouldnt bother him a bitbut an obvious lie obvious lies were no damn good not when you were talking about life and death when you were talking about life and death keeping quiet was no damn good either bathsheba sighed again well i do thank the good lord fo preservin my sweet xerxes along with me an antoinette she said we is in a hard road but we is in it together shame threatened to choke rodriguez along with that shame though came an odd pride bathsheba and antoinette still thought xerxes was alive that gave them pleasure and hope and they thought so because of him ask you somethin else bathsheba said rodriguez didnt sigh though he felt like it go ahead he said and wondered what sort of trouble her next question would land him in antoinette give herself to you it keep her alive any longer the question itself didnt surprise him the brutal bluntness of it did again he did his best to evade i got a wife at home down in sonora i dont need nobody here uhhuh her agreement was more devastating than calling him a liar would have been and he didnt tomcat around the womens side the way a lot of male guards did every now and then yes but only every now and then is true i do he said he usually felt bad after he took a woman here but not while he did itoh no not then all right bathsheba sounded as if that wasnt worth quarreling about she got to the point antoinette give herself to some other guard then it keep her alive any longer he couldnt very well get around that however much he wanted to he gave the best answer he could saying maybe aint no way to be sure aint no way to be sure about nothin is there somehow bathsheba still didnt sound bitter reckon some o them ofays they think its funny to lie down with a girl one day an reduce her population the nex she was righter than she knew or maybe she knew the way guards minds worked much too well i never done nothin like that rodriguez said that was true but it didnt do him much good and it didnt make him sound very good even to himself didnt say you did bathsheba answered wouldntve asked if i reckoned you was one o them i is pretty much used up dont want to go mind but if i gots to i gots to but antoinette she jus startin out you do somethin fo her you make an ol nigger cleanin lady happy i do what i can rodriguez had no idea how much that would be she dont got to do nothin like that for me bathsheba started to cry you is a good man she said even if rodriguez wasnt so sure of that himself right now you is a decent man i reckon you is a godfearin man she cocked her head to one side and eyed him the streaks of tears on her cheeks shining in the sun so what you doin here doin what you doin he had an answer hed always hated mallates ever since they did their level best to kill him after he put on the confederate uniform like any freedom party man he thought negroes meant nothing but danger and misfortune for the confederate states the country would be better off without them but how did he explain that to a colored woman in rags her hair going all gray whod just offered her only daughter to him not for her own sake but for the younger womans how did he explain that to a wife and daughter who loved an old man on the other side of the camp an old man now dead an old man whose death rodriguez didnt have the heart to tell them about he couldnt explain it even trying was a losing fight he just sighed and said i got my job dont seem like reason enough had bathsheba got mad and screamed at him he could have lost his temper and stormed off but she didnt and that meant he couldnt he had to listen to her instead he had three stripes on his sleeve and a submachine gun in his hands she had nothing and chances were neither she nor her pretty daughter had long to live so why did he feel he was the one at a disadvantage why did he feel she could call the shots why did he wish he were still down on the farm outside of baroyeca he didnt know why he didnt like wondering not even a little bit jake featherston was not a happy man being unhappy was nothing new for him he ran on discontent his own and others the way a motorcar ran on gasoline he recalled only two times in his life when he was happy and neither lasted long when he took the oath of office as president of the csa and when his armies drove all before them pushing north from the ohio to lake erie and cutting the united states in half being president was still pretty good but it was also a lot more work than he ever thought it would be hard work corroded happiness and al smith damn him was supposed to lie down with his belly in the air after the confederates went and licked him when he didnt he dragged jake and the confederacy into a long war the last thing anybody on this side of the border wanted now the csa would have to take a yankee punch too jake muttered under his breath like any barroom brawler he wanted to get in the first punch and clean up afterwards especially when the other guy was bigger he tried it and he didnt knock out the usa he didnt have enough to hit again standing on the defensive went against every ounce of instinct in him instinct or not sometimes you had no choice his secretary looked into his office the attorney general is here to see you sir thank you kindly lulu bring him in jake said ferd koenig seemed bigger and bulkier than ever hello jake he saidhe was one of the handful of men these days who could call the president by his first name hello ferd jake answered have a seat pour yourself some coffee if you want to a pot sat on a hot plate in the corner jake smacked a desk drawer or ive got a fifth in here if youd rather have that coffeell do koenig fixed himself a cup then sat down after a sip he said want to thank you for letting that freedom party guard unit go into action in west texas theyve done a pretty good job better than i expected to tell you the truth featherston said you want to pick up recruiting for your combat wing i wont tell you no thanks mr president with your kind permission i will do that koenig said we need a fire brigade when things get hot thats a fact other fact is some of the generals are getting jumpy i can feel it jake said a counterweight to the army could come in goddamn handy one of these days you never can tell lord isnt that the truth koenig set the coffee cup on the desk pour me a shot in there after all would you help yourself jake got out the bottle and slid it across the desk shame to do that to good sippin whiskey but suit yourself i want the jolt but i run on coffee these days koenig added a hefty slug of bourbon then tasted he nodded yeah thatll do the trick he eyed jake you really mean that about the guards units hell yes jake poured himself a shot too only without the coffee he raised the glass mud in your eye after a respectful drinkhe couldnt just knock it back not after he called it sipping whiskeyhe went on if party guards arent loyal nobody will be you raise those units and by god ill see theyre equipped with the best weve got army wont like it the attorney general predicted fuck the army featherston said thats the whole point so what else have we got going on did you forget ferd koenig asked day after tomorrow we clean out richmond isnt it about time the confederate states had a niggerfree capital oh i remember all right you dont need to worry about that jake said all the cops and stalwarts and guards are geared up for it he chuckled with the niggers gone we wont need so many of those people around here we can put some of em in the armyand in your party guards outfitsand some in the factories and well be better off both ways if we didnt have all those mexicans coming in wed never be able to make enough to stay in the war koenig said yeah well thats the carrot we give francisco jose jake answered he gives us soldiers to fight the niggers in the countryside we keep the frontier open for his workers thats his safety valve like they get jobs here instead of going hungry down in mexico and stirring up trouble against him he gives us a hard time we close the borderand start shipping the rebels old boltaction tredegars we dont need any more his old man made it through a civil warwe can see how he likes another one his laugh held all the cynicism in the world sounds like youve got that under control all right koenigs role was domestic he didnt presume to mess around with foreign affairs he had his place he knew it he was good at it and he kept to it all of which made him uniquely valuable to jake featherston he added the sooner we clean out all the niggers the sooner we can throw everything weve got at the usa thats the idea all right jake agreed koenig didnt know anything about the uranium bomb featherston didnt tell him anything either that secret couldnt be too tightly held he did say starting day after tomorrow richmondll be a better place you go in right at sunup like usual thats what ive got in mind well have all day to move em out then yankee bombers arent likely to complicate things by daylight either koenig answered and jake nodded as far as he was concerned the difference between day and night was largely arbitrary hed always been a night owl and spending so much time underground only encouraged him to catnap around the clock he was asleep at sunrise the day the cleanout started but he got a wakeup call literally for the telephone by his cot jangled that telephone didnt ring unless something big was going on he grabbed it in the middle of the second ring featherston he said hoarsely and then what the fuck have the damnyankees done to us now not the damnyankees mr president ferd koenigs voice was on the other end of the line its the goddamn niggers weve got he paused maybe looking for a way to sugarcoat what came next but he almost always did speak his mind and this morning proved no exception weve got an uprising on our hands jake sat bolt upright whats going on fill me in fast damn smokes mustve known we were coming for em the attorney general answered weve already had i dunno six or eight people bombs go off theyve got rifles and grenades and featherston fizzes and a couple of machine guns anyway they mined the streets into the colored quarter the sneaky bastards and they blew two armored cars to hell and gone its a fight sir nothing else but son of a bitch son of a motherfucking bitch jake featherston said all right if they want a fight they can damn well have one let me get hold of the war department if we have to well blow up the whole nigger part of townbasically southeast richmondand all the coons inside it thatll do by god he sounded as if he looked forward to it the reason for that was simple he did all right mr president i wanted to let you know koenig said well now i know get off the line and ill get you what you need to finish the job jake waited till the attorney general hung up then called nathan bedford forrest iii he wasnt surprised to find the chief of the general staff at his desk forrest the niggers are raising a ruckus what can we pull from north of here to squash those stinking backstabbing shitheels flat well sir there is a problem with that forrest said slowly if we pull too much or make it too obvious what were doing the damnyankees are liable to try and break through up there theyre liable to make it toowere already stretched pretty damn thin north of the city they wont do it jake sounded very sure he wondered why then he found an answer theyre building up out west not right here you know that as well as i do he even thought he was telling the truth and he added besides we cant let the niggers get away with this kind of crap or well have trouble from here to fucking guaymas i want men i want armor i want artillery and i want asskickers by the time they all get done wont be a nigger left on his feet in there he waited if nathan bedford forrest iii did any more bitching the cs general staff would have a new chief in nothing flat forrest must have sensed as much too for he said all right mr president theyll get here as fast as they can faster than that featherston said but it was only reflex complaint forrest had satisfied him he slammed down the telephone quickly dressed and did something he didnt do every day he went up above ground shockoe hill gave him a good vantage point when he looked southeast he swore at the black smoke rising over the colored part of richmond he heard the rattle of smallarms fire and the occasional explosion too christ he said the police and stalwarts and party guards always came loaded for bear just in case well they found a bear and then some this time nathan bedford forrest iii proved good as his word about half an hour later the first mule dive bombers screamed down out of the sky above the colored quarter whatever the blacks had in the way of small arms they didnt have any antiaircraft guns the flat harsh crump of bursting bombs echoed across richmond but the confederate asskickers werent the only airplanes in the sky us fighters flying at not much above rooftop level darted over southeastern richmond to strafe the people cleaning out the negroes then they zoomed away to the north again jake featherston did some more swearing at that swearing sulfurous enough to make his guards and the crews of the antiaircraft guns on the cratered gray house grounds stare at him in startled admiration he didnt know whether the damnyankees had urged richmonds negroes to rise he didnt know and he hardly cared he did know they had good spies inside the city to hear about it and take advantage of it so fast he called for his driver and pointed toward the trouble take me down there quick as you can uh yes mr president the driver saluted but then he went on sir what good will you be able to do there you dont want to give the coons a shot at you dont tell me what i want to do jake snapped just get moving goddammit the driver did people were in the habit of doing what jake featherston said a good thing too he thought a damn good thing twenty minutes later he was at what was for all practical purposes the fighting front he found ferd koenig looking ridiculous with a helmet on his jowly head a moment later when a bullet cracked past featherston wished for a helmet of his ownnot that any helmet ever made would stop a direct hit its a war mr president koenig said unhappily i see that featherston wasnt unhappy he was furious if the negroes thought they could get away with this they needed to think again send in everybody weve got he told koenig this has to be stamped out right now shouldnt we wait till the soldiers get here the attorney general asked licking his lips been kind of hot for the manpower we have send them in featherston repeated when we have the soldiers later well use em but if we can end it in a hurry well do that weve already got the asskickers in action what more do you want egg in your beer so the attack went in and the negro fighters waiting in prepared positions shredded it wounded whites staggered back out of the fighting so did overage cops who looked as if they were on the point of having heart attacks they killed some negroes and brought out some others but they didnt break the line jake featherston swore yet again now hed have to do it the hard way from the bridge sam carsten looked at the josephus daniels with a kind of fond dismay theyd done strange things to his ship her paint was the wrong shade of gray sheet metal changed the outline of the bridge and the gun turrets her sailors wore whites of the wrong cut his own uniform was dark gray not blue and so were the rest of the officers by the name painted on both sides of her bow the josephus daniels was the css hot springs a confederate destroyer escort operating in the north atlantic the main danger coming south from boston was that she would run into a us patrol aircraft or submersible and get sunk by her own side the confederate naval ensign a square version of the cs battle flag completed the disguise if they capture us theyll shoot us for spies lieutenant pat cooley didnt sound worried he was almost childishly excited at playing dressup the possibility of getting shot hardly seemed real to him it didnt seem real to sam either but for a different reason not a whole lot of pows off navy ships he said if something goes wrong theyll just damn well sink us that wasnt romantic it had no cloakanddagger flavor to it he didnt care it was real by now barring bad luck they were too far south for us airplanes to harry them subs were always a risk but sam didnt know what to do about it except monitor the hydrophones as closely as he could the crew was doing that he had the best set of cs navy recognition signals his us navy superiors could give him he also had an ace in the hole a deserter from the csa named antonio jones normally sam would have been leery about a confederate traitor anybody like that was too likely to be playing a double game but heand again his superiorshad a good reason for thinking jones reliable the man was black as the ace of spades he came from cuba the only state in the csa where negroes had surnames he pronounced his honeace he spoke english with an accent half confederate drawl half syrupy cubano spanish he hated the homeland hed left behind and he burned to go back there and so here he was with a disguised destroyer escort for transportamong other things not the first time ive been in the gunrunning business carsten remarked no the exec said as he was supposed to nope i took rifles into ireland in the last goround just to help keep england busy sam said the irish paid us off in whiskey dont expect thatll happen in cuba no suh antonio jones said he wore a mess stewards uniform high cheekbones and a strong nose argued for a little indian blood in him but maybe you get some rum oh i wont sam said thatll be for the fellows who do the real work long as they dont get drunk and disorderly ill look the other way pat cooley raised an eyebrow but lowered it again in a hurry a lot of skippers would do the same thing not just a man who was a mustang the exec contented himself with saying lets hope they have the chance to drink it not all these little tricks are easy sam said we just have to do what we can and hope for the best same as always they were off the coast of south carolina when a seaplane of unfamiliar design buzzed out to look them over the mock confederate sailors ran to their guns with luck that wouldnt alarm the fliers in the seaplane which also sported the confederate battle flag on wings fuselage and tail after a couple of passes the seaplane waggled its wings at the pseudohot springs and flew away lets just hope it didnt fly low enough to read our name pat cooley said i dont think it did sam hoped he wasnt whistling in the dark the people the seaplane wirelessed probably wouldnt be surprised to find a cs destroyer escort in these waters they probably would be surprised to find the hot springs around here they also probably wouldnt be very happy the josephus daniels wasnt fast enough to run away from everything theyd throw at her she wasnt armed well enough to fight it off either all she could do was go down swinging yall are bueno antonio jones asked well ill tell youif were not well know pretty damn quick sam went from the bridge to the wireless shack any confederate traffic for us or about us he asked the men with earphones nothing for us sir one of the yeomen answered if theres anything about us its not in clear if its in code chances are were shafted sam said all rightthanks he returned to his station at least somewhat reassured another seaplane examined them when they neared the southern tip of florida they must have passed that inspection too if they hadnt cruisers and landbased dive bombers would have called on them as far as sam knewas far as anybody in the us navy knewthe confederates had no airplane carriers it made sense that they wouldnt they didnt need that kind of navy landbased air and coastdefense ships could keep the united states from mounting major operations against them and submarines let them strike at the usa from far away you know what our best chance is sam said as the josephus daniels neared the northeastern coast of cuba sure his exec answered our best chance is that the confederates wont figure were crazy enough to try anything like this in the first place just what i was thinkingmaybe we ought to get married sam said sorry sir no offense but youre not my type cooley answered they both laughed antonio jones looked from one of them to the other this aint funny amigos he said what that featherston bastard is doing to colored people in my estado its a shame and a disgrace we got to go to the mountains and fight back sorry mr jones sam didnt think hed ever called a negro mister before but orders were to treat him like a big shot we know your people are in trouble were not laughing about that but my crew is in trouble too and it will be till we get back into us waters and even after that he added but only to himself we can laugh about that wed go nuts if we didnt chances are ah now i understand jones sketched a salute all right senor capitan we do this too against our worries the sun sank into the sea with tropical abruptness no long lazy twilights in these latitudes darkness came on in a hurry pat cooley had the conn as the josephus daniels approached the cuban coast sam didnt want to risk the ship in any way he didnt have to what they were doing was already risky enough by the nature of things one patrol boat where its not supposed to be could ruin our whole day cooley remarked all the guns are manned and yranging should let us see him before he sees us sam said with luck well sink him before he gets word off about us cooley nodded sam wondered how much luck theyd already used up when those cs seaplanes believed they were what they pretended to be did they have enough left hed find out before long yranging gear also let them spot the cuban coast although it was blacked out the darkness wasnt so thorough as it would have been farther north us bombers werent likely to visit here eyeing what had to be two fairsized towns sam said thats guardalavaca to starboard and that has to be banes to starboard we are where were supposed to be nice navigating mr cooley thank you very much sir the exec said sailors were hauling crates of rifles and submachine guns and machine guns and cartridges up on deck soon theyd be lowered into the josephus daniels boats and brought ashoreif the destroyer escort got the recognition signal she was supposed to that thought had hardly crossed carstens mind before three automobiles on a beach aimed their headlights across the water in the warships general direction antonio jones breathed a sigh of relief sam breathed another one anxiety tempered hiswere they sailing into a trap he had to find out thank you sir the black cuban answered god willinghe crossed himselfthe partido de libertad here will have some new worries they went out on deck together sailors in ersatz confederate uniforms swung crate after crate down into the waiting boats jones continued it is not as much white man against black man here as it is on the mainland of the csa there are many of mixed blood on this island and even some whites help us as much as they can good thats good mr jones sam did his best to pronounce it the way the negro did he was uneasily aware that his own country wasnt doing everything it could to help the negroes in the confederate states well the united states were doing something the proof of that was right here sailors scrambled down nets to board the boats and take the guns and ammo ashore antonio jones went to the port rail to go down himself i hope you stay safe capitan carsten he said i hope you do too sam said maybe after the wars done well get together and talk about it over a beer i hope so yes jones sketched a salute and swung himself over the rail he descended as nimbly as any sailor motors chugging the boats pulled away from the josephus daniels and went in toward the beach nothing to do but wait sam thought he would rather be doing hed smuggled arms into ireland himself he knew the ploy worked right away if firing broke out on the beach nowwell in that case im screwed too the boats came back after what felt like years his watch insisted it was more like fortyfive minutes sailors hoisted the boats up one after another smooth as rum sir said one of the men back from the beach the simile made sam suspicious or more than suspicious remembering the good irish whiskey hed downed in the last war he said not a word goddamnedest thing you ever saw too a grizzled cpo added they had this kid running things on the beach if he was a day over sixteen im a nigger but he knew what was what fidel did he gave orders in that halfspanish halfenglish they talk here and people jumped like you wouldnt believe he was a white kid too not a smoke like mr antonio jones jones said whites and blacks were in it together down here sam said do we have all the boats aboard if we do we better get out of here they did the josephus daniels made for the open ocean aboard her sailors put on their own uniforms for the first time since setting out from boston they started dismantling the sheetmetal camouflage that turned her into a confederate ship when morning came they would give her a proper paint job too they couldnt bring her back into us waters looking the way she did not unless they wanted her sent to the bottom in short order we got away with it sam said to pat cooley did you think we wouldnt sir cooley asked well im damn glad we did sam said and let it go at that clarence potter fitted a new clip to his tredegar automatic rifle he worked the bolt to chamber the first round that done he was ready to empty the twentyfiveround clip into anything that looked even a little bit like trouble the negro uprising in richmond was having unexpected effects one of them was reminding even officers who normally spent their time deep in the bowels of the war department that war meant fighting and fighting meant killing nathan bedford forrest iiis greatgrandfather first said that and the cavalry general from the war of secession knew what he was talking about small bands of blacks had managed to get out through the barbedwire perimeter that was supposed to seal the colored quarter off from the outside world bombedout buildings gave them hiding places uncountable during the day when night fell they came out and shot whoever they could find rumor said a negrod come close to killing jake featherston potter didnt know if he believed rumor he didnt know how he felt about it even if it was true either he didnt love the president of the csa but he knew the country needed him his own foxhole was just inside the colored district come on he shouted to the confederate soldiers entering the perimeter theyre shooting back from over there and from over there too the virginia confederate seminary ordained black preachers it was as close to an institution of higher learning as negroes could have in the csa for now its large solid buildings made a splendid strongpoint for negroes armed with oldfashioned boltaction tredegars sporting rifles shotguns pistols and whatever else they could get their hands on they even had a few mortars perhaps captured perhaps homemade perhaps sneaked in by the damnyankees but what they had was no match for the artillery barrels and air power the confederacy used against them to say nothing of the ground troops clearing them out one block one building at a time more confederates some in gray some in butternut led a long column of black captives out of the colored district any time a negro hesitated a soldier or freedom party guard shot himor her if asskickers bombed apartment blocks into rubble who could say how many people died in the explosions or in the fires that followed and who cared except the negroes themselves anybody blown to bits now didnt need shipping to a camp later population reduction came in all different flavors antiaircraft guns started going off clarence potter swore and dove into a foxhole the yankees sent fighters into richmond whenever they could helping the black uprising was good for them just as helping the mormons helped the csa but the us border was much closer to richmond than the confederates were to salt lake city too bad potter thought the us fighters came in low the way they always did they blasted whatever they could then roared off a few bullets slammed into the sandbags that helped strengthen potters foxhole dirt leaked out of them and onto him leaking dirt he didnt mind leaking blood was a different story potter straightened up again when he was reasonably sure the enemy airplanes were gone a latecomer shot past then but didnt open up on him he let out a sigh of relief that could have beenunpleasant potter someone yelled potter im here clarence potter shouted back by jake featherstons orders no one named anyone elses rank inside the perimeter shouting out for a general only made the man a tempting target for snipers quite a few officers and even noncoms didnt wear their rank badges for the same reason potter did but more from a sense of fussy precision than out of vanity he kept calling till the runner found his foxhole here you are sir the man said and handed him a sealed envelope thanks potter said things did happen outside this colored district though proving as much wasnt easy not when the capital was on fire he broke the seal took out the papers inside it read through them and nodded to himself so thats ready to get going is it i dont know what you mean sir the runner said do i need to take an answer back to anybody no thats all right this just lets me know somethings going to happen you can leave potter answered the young confederate soldier didnt seem sorry to disappear no doubt he would have been happier running messages through the war departments miles of underground corridors potter couldnt blame him rifle and machinegun bullets hardly ever flew down those corridors here now well hed got this message where it needed to go potter lit a match and burned it confederate bombers flying out of extreme northwestern sonora were going to try to hit the us uranium works in western washington it was a gamble in all kinds of ways other cs bombers taking off at the same time would head toward los angeles las vegas and denver with luck the damnyankees fancy electronicsbetter than anything the csa hadwould make them concentrate on those other bombers not on the ones that really counted with a little more luck the bombers would do some real damage when they got over the target they had to fly a long way to get there something on the order of miles the confederacy didnt have longrange heavy bombers that could carry a big bomb load that far and then turn around and fly home if the war broke out in say instead of the confederacy probably would have such airplanes but the country needed to use what it could get its hands on now even starting out with a light bomb load those bombers wouldnt be coming home again they would land at a strip on vancouver island a strip of whose existence the united states werepotter fervently hopedignorant assuming everything went the way it was supposed to pilots and aircrews would eventually get smuggled back to the confederacy canadian rebels would wreck the aircraft so the usa couldnt learn much from them so the canucks claimed anyhow if they found people to fly those birds against the damnyankees potter suspected they would he didnt mind he wished them luck assuming everything went the way it was supposed toclarence potter laughed not that it was funny things had a habit of going wrong any soldier and especially any soldier in the intelligence business could testify to that he laughed again assuming everything went the way it was supposed to richmonds negroes would all be in camps by now assuming everything went the way it was supposed to potter himself would be back under the war department figuring out sneaky ways to make life miserable for the damnyankees and to keep them from making it miserable for his own country that knowledge didnt give him any great faith things would go the way they were supposed to but the confederate states had to try the united states started the race towards uranium sooner and they were running faster they had more trained people to attack the problem and they had more industrial capacity to spare from straightout shortterm war production thank you professor fitzbelmont potter muttered there in his foxhole who would have thought an unworldly physicist would see something a spymaster missed physics was fitzbelmonts business but all the same even if everything did go the way it was supposed to how long would this raid stall the united states days weeks months potter laughed at himself he couldnt know ahead of time neither could anybody else the longer the better potter said and that was the lords truth one raid on that facility might get through a followup seemed unlikely to more negroes came back past his foxhole they were skinny and dirty despair etched their faces theyd done everything they could to hold off the confederate authorities theyd done everything they could and it wasnt enough plenty of their friends and loved ones lay dead in the rubble from which they were pulled and now they were going off to the camps in spite of everything potter felt like waving goodbye to them he didntthat was asking for a bullet but the temptation lingered too bad fools of course if the damnyankees won this war as theyd won the last one they would jeer the confederates the same way and they would have won the right potter tried to imagine what the confederate states would be like with us soldiers occupying them he grimaced it wouldnt be pretty the yankees got soft after the great war they paid for it too they werent as dumb as most confederates thought they were they werent dumb enough to make the same mistake twice in a row if they came down on the csa this time around theyd come down with both feet of itself potters gaze swung to the west toward washington university how were professor fitzbelmont and his crew of scientists doing how much time did they need how far ahead of them were their us opposite numbers how long would the cs bombers set the damnyankees back there he was back where he started from he had lots of good questions and no good answers rattling and clanking a couple of confederate barrels ground forward against the rebellious negroes they were obsolescent machines left over from the early days of the war only twoinch guns poorly sloped armor having to use themand their highly trained crewsfor internalsecurity work was galling just the same a machine gun in the ruins of a grocery opened up on the barrels that wasnt a cs weapon it came from the usa its slower rate of fire made it immediately recognizable potter cursed under his breath yes the damnyankees helped the negro revolt in the csa the same as the confederates helped the mormons but the mormon uprising was fizzling out while negroes went right on causing trouble bullets ricocheted off the forward barrels turret and glacis plate some of them striking sparks from the armor even experienced soldiers tried to knock out barrels with machine guns and it couldnt be done a confederate infantryman fired an antibarrel rocket into the battered store the machine gun suddenly fell silent antibarrel rockets were made for piercing armor plate confederate soldiers had quickly discovered they also made excellent housebreakers the barrels clattered on when somebody with a rifle fired at them the lead barrel sprayed the house from which he was shooting with machinegun fire but that rifleman was only a distraction a skinny negro kidhe couldnt have been more than fourteenleaped up onto the second barrel yanked open the hatch over the cupola and threw in a featherston fizz a cs foot soldier with a submachine gun cut him down a moment latera moment too late flames and black greasy smoke burst from all the turret hatches the gunner got out but he was on fire he took only a few steps before crumpling to the ground and writhed like a moth that flew into a gas flame then the barrel brewed up as its ammunition cooked off fire burst from it potter knew the commander and loader were stuck in there he didnt think the driver or bow gunner got out either five good men gone five men who wouldnt fight the usa again five men the csa couldnt afford to losebut they were lost clarence potter swore one more time to his way of thinking this proved the confederacy had to get rid of its negroes what did they do but cause trouble and grief what the confederacy might be if it treated negroes like men and women rather than beastsnever even crossed his mind vii flora blackford was listening to a navy captain testifying about support for black rebels in the confederate state of cuba when a page approached her and whispered excuse me congresswoman but you have an urgent telephone call outside who is it she whispered back this wasnt the most exciting testimony the joint committee on the conduct of the war had ever heard but it was important assistant secretary roosevelt the page answered oh flora got to her feet please excuse me she told her colleagues ill be back as soon as i can the page led her to one of the telephones outside the hearing room hes on this line thank you flora picked up the handset and said this is congresswoman blackford hello flora franklin roosevelt said can you come by here right this minute she asked well you might want to roosevelt answered and what did that mean something like if you dont youll be sorry flora couldnt think of anything else it was likely to mean on my way she said and hung up please apologize to the rest of the committee for me she told the page im afraid i need to confer with the assistant secretary of war the young man nodded and hurried away flora wondered what kind of connections he had to be wearing a sharp blue suit instead of a greengray uniform she also wondered how long he would go on wearing his suit congressional pages did get conscripted at least one had got killed and as she hurried to the exit she wondered what the other members of the joint committee on the conduct of the war would think people knew she often talked with franklin roosevelt she hoped to heaven they didnt know why if they didnt know why what would they think that she and roosevelt were having an affair he was married but that mattered little in high government circles reporters knew better than to write such stories people called it a gentlemans agreement though flora had never seen anything very gentlemanly about it she walked over to the war department sentries there scrupulously compared the photo on her id card to her face they searched her handbag a woman took her into a closed room and patted her down and they called roosevelts office to make sure she was expected only when they were fully satisfied did a soldier escort her to that office far underground call when you need to come back up maam the soldier said a polite way of warning dont go wandering around by yourself i will flora promised roosevelts chief secretary or administrative assistant or whatever he was led her in to the assistant secretary of war then the man left closing the door behind him did he knew about the work on uranium bombs flora wouldnt have cared to guess one way or the other how are you franklin she asked oh a little tired but not too bad he answered he looked worn and weary as if he was running on too much coffee too many cigarettes in that jaunty holder of his and not enough sleep few people with important jobs were doing anything else he nodded perhaps trying to make himself believe it no im not too bad myself but the news could be better what is the news flora asked the confederates bombed our hanford facility in the wee small hours this morning gevalt she sank into a chair her knees didnt want to hold her up how bad is it do i want to know well its not good roosevelt said they know were working on this they knew where were working on it they know its important and they must be working on it too or they wouldnt try so hard to shut us down every word of that was true but he hadnt told her what she most wanted to know how much damage did they do oh that his resonant laugh filled the office now that the suns up out there we can see its less than we feared at first they dont have aircraft that can carry heavy loads a long way and its hard to bomb accurately at night anyway they hit some of the works but they didnt damage the plant where were separating u and u or the pilethats what theyre calling the gadget that makes more energy than goes into it that would have been bad flora said repairing those things would take a long time she didnt even mention money repair isnt the only worry if the bombers hit those wed have to worry about radioactive contamination like you wouldnt believe roosevelt said flora must have looked blank for he went on that kind of thing can cause cancer it can poison you if its strong enough it can come right out and kill you and its very hard to clean up but it didnt happen flora said it didnt happen hardly any contamination in fact roosevelt said goodi guess flora hadnt even thought aboutwhat did roosevelt call itradioactive contamination she hadnt known such a thing was possible or that anybody needed to worry about it she was just starting to realize how much she didnt know about this whole uranium business its very good believe me roosevelt said they could have made things worse for us than they did were not badly delayed anyhow that is good flora said what kind of program do the confederate states have how far along are they how do we go about finding out i dont know i dont know and well have to find a way respectively the assistant secretary of war sighed thats all i can tell you right now as i say theyre working on it the same as we are were in a race and wed better win eight words as far as flora could see they said everything that needed saying if we knew where theyre working we could visit them the same way they just visited us she said if we knew that we would have done it a long time ago roosevelt said weve got to look harder thats all its a long way from confederate territory to washington state flora said thats one of the reasons you put the uranium works out there i suppose how did they manage to fly bombers all the way up there and what happened to them afterwards they got cute franklin roosevelt said unhappily i dont know what else to tell you they flew a whole swarm of airplanes out of northwestern sonora some of them headed for los angeles some attacked las vegas and boulder dam in nevada and somesome we just forgot about he looked angry and embarrassed at the same time airplanes flying over the middle of the countrytoo many people assumed they were ours and didnt worry about them that wont happen again either they didnt go back to the csa did they flora asked he shook his strongchinned head no we might have done something about that i hope to heaven we would have done something about it anyhow but they flew on to vancouver island and landed at strips there the crews were gone by the time we got people there and they set fire to the airplanesor maybe the canadians who helped them get away did i dont know about that i do know it was a very smart operation and were lucky it didnt hurt us a lot worse than it did what can we do to make sure it doesnt happen again flora asked you do know the right questions to ask roosevelt said flattery truth both at once he went on from now on well have fighters overhead all the time thats effective immediately well beef up the antiaircraft guns as soon as we can and well put a yranging station close by so we can spot the enemy a long way off and well hit confederate airports in sonora and chihuahua and even texas to make it harder for them to fly up north what do we do about auto bombs what do we do about people bombs flora asked well the area is well fenced and the fences are a long way out from the buildingsfor one thing we need room if experiments get out of hand roosevelt answered we have a garrison there he wrote himself a note wed better reinforce it and wed better add some armored vehicles too you do know the right questions maybe he really meant it this time did we lose any important people flora asked no absolutely not no we dont have as many firstrate physicists as germany does but weve got plenty of good people to take us where were going roosevelt said and the bombers didnt hit any of them last night so thats all right if we find the confederates project striking them will hurt them more or i hope so anyway they only have a third as many educated people as we do they cant afford to lose anybody one more part of the price they pay for leaving their negroes as nothing but field hands flora said i agree but they arent even field hands now theyre roosevelt paused victims flora supplied a word yes thats what they are roosevelt shook his head strange to use a word like that in this day and age strange to use it like that anyhow if people drown in a flood theyre victims if a man runs a stop light and kills a grandmother shes a victim but those arent accidents in the csa the freedom party is doing it on purpose nobody up here wanted to believe that for the longest time flora said i still dont want to believe it franklin roosevelt said but i have no choice its true all right you deserve a lot of credit for making people see that i dont want it i wish i didnt have it flora said and speaking of such things what are we doing to help the negroes in richmond what we can which isnt much the assistant secretary of war answered our fighters strafe the confederates we bomb their positions as we can some of the weapons the negroes are using they got from us smuggling arms isnt easy but we do what we can the confederates did a pretty good job of helping the mormons in utah flora said more space and fewer people out there roosevelt replied getting things into richmonds never been easy the negroes are making the most of what we got themand of what they got on their own i will say that for them they really can fight cant they it does seem that way then why doesnt the us army let our negroes put on the uniform and go after the confederates flora asked god knows they have the incentive to do it i cant change that policy myself you know roosevelt said flora nodded impatiently yes of course but you can recommend a course of action to the president he could change it by executive orderi dont think he needs the consent of congress to enlist negro troops id say youre right about that roosevelt replied my one worry is i dont know how our white soldiers would like negroes fighting alongside of them whod have a better reason to fight hard than colored troops flora said if i were a black man in uniform i wouldnt want to surrender to the confederates would you when you put it that way no roosevelt admitted ill speak to president la follette about this you might do the same the final decision will be up to him though yes flora said for the past year charlie la follette wasnt just someone who could help make the upper midwest vote socialist he was the man who decided things and he seemed to be doing it well enough ill talk to him and well see what happens after that brakes squealing the train pulled into the station riviereduloup the conductor called all out for riviereduloup he spoke french as most people did in the republic of quebec dr leonard odoull hardly noticed to him french seemed at least as natural as english home he thought and got to his feet after two years away riviereduloup looked very good indeed after almost two years of war the republic of quebecofficially neutral in the war that convulsed the rest of north americalooked very good indeed too people waiting on the platform waved as he and two other men and a woman got off the train nicole dashed up to him he squeezed the air out of his wife then did the same with his son you should get married more often lucien he said it lets me take leave lucien odoull sent him a severe look youre as bad as uncle georges he said i only intend to get married once thank you very much as bad as me thank you very much lucien georges galtier the younger of nicoles two brothers was the family wit the family cynic the family punster and practical joker most of the galtiers were swarthy and slight georges was dark but almost as tall as leonard odoull and half again as wide through the shoulders his older brother charles stopped picking on him in a hurry when he began to get his full growth charles was no coward but also no fool no galtiers were fools charles came up to odoull now he looked achingly like his father lucien galtier after whom odoulls son was named was several years dead good to see you again charles said gravely good to see you safe he sounded like his father too though he didnt have much of the old mans whimsy georges had got all of that and a little more besides they both made successful farmers though crops didnt care if you were funny or not hand in hand with lucien stood his fiancee paulette archambault was a dentists daughter the match if not made in heaven was certainly one that had a lot of study behind it paulette had black hair and blue eyes and a nice figure odoull had no trouble understanding what his son saw in her welcome to the family he said thank you very much paulette said theresa lot of it isnt there as if to prove her point nicoles three sisters susanne denise and jeanne greeted odoull too each with a husband at her side jeanne the youngest was pregnant again odoull tried to remember if this would be her fifth or sixth he couldnt but all the galtier children had big broods except for nicole lucien odoull might be an only child but he was an only with a raft of first cousins you look tired jeanne told leonard odoull she was a farm wife with a flock of children and she was telling him he looked tired if that wasnt madness damned if he knew what would be odoull managed atiredshrug ive been busier than i wish i were he said and let it go there coming back to a country of peace a country at peace felt surreal hed got used to the tensions of emergency surgery to the cries of wounded men to the smells of ether and alcohol and pus and blood and shit to washing gore from his hands more often than lady macbeth ever did the only familiar odor on the platform was tobacco smoke perfume for all hed smelled it lately perfume might be a martian invention you look like a man who needs a drink his wife said amen he exclaimed everybody laughed except nicole who understood he wasnt kidding theyd known each other for more than a quarter of a century now if one of them didnt understand the other nobody ever would lets go back to the house nicole said with the six galtier children and their spouses and progeny leaving the platform lost a big part of the crowd on it a house with a lawn in front of it no broken windows no bullet holes no chunks bitten out by artillery or bombs no craters in the front yard no gunshots close by no soldiers stumbling by with numb stunned faces and thousandyard stares no this wasnt mars it seemed more alien than that instead of decay odoull smelled cooking of a sort hed almost forgotten he knew nicole would do herself proud when it came to food butwill we have enough to drink a lot of his nieces and nephews were getting old enough to hoist a glass and georges always seemed to have a hollow leg but nicole said dont worry about it he did worry till she went on for one thing i bought twice as much as i thought wed need and for another the farmer across the road from charles makes the best applejack in temiscouata county he makes a lot of it too when leonard odoull heard that he stopped flabbling a lot of people with apple orchards turned out homemade calvados quality varied widely from one farm to another often from one batch to another none of it went through the tiresome formalities involving taxes the republic of quebec loved distillers no more than the dominion of canada did before it and had no better luck bringing them to heel odoull took packs of raleighs and dukes out of his suitcase and distributed them to his wife his son and his inlaws they would have repaired his popularity had he lost it quebec got us tobacco and not enough of that no one had tasted mild flavorful cigarettes like these since the early days of the war how did you get them through customs georges asked his face was wreathed in smiles and in smoke im in us uniform odoull tapped the gold oak leaf on one shoulder strap i speak pretty good french too and i let the inspectors have a couple of packs apiece so they didnt bother me a bit such things are wasted on those swine but what is a man to do georges said with a philosophical shrug if the man was leonard odoull he was to eat too much and to get drunk he wasnt loud and boisterous but he felt the applejack buzzing in him hed feel it in the morning too but he didnt worry about that he ate he drank he talkedand he didnt tell war stories his quebecois extended family didnt know how lucky they were not to know much about what he did and he didnt intend to enlighten them a lot of relatives stayed at the house they slept in the front room in the dining room in the kitchen odoull didnt mind even now not everybody had a motorcar for those who didnt going back out to a farm and then coming into town again for the wedding the next day would be slow and inconvenient all the same he whispered to nicole you didnt ask one of your sisters to share the bedroom did you why would you want to know that his wife asked archly ha he said youll find out with so many people here nicole said its upstairs remember if were not careful the bed will squeak and theyll laugh at us well just have to be careful then wont we odoull said nicole was laughing at him but she didnt say no she didnt say no later that night either though she did lock the door first and she did insist on turning off the light after nearly two years away odoull felt almost as if he were having his wedding night all over again just ahead of his sons he didnt have the stamina lucien would doubtless display but he had the sincerity ive missed you more than i know how to tell you he said afterwards why did you go then nicole asked it needs doing he answered im a doctor im good at putting people back together a good many men are alive because i happened to be there so they can go back to the war and get killed somewhere else instead nicole said tartly he shrugged that made the bed squeak where their sidebyside lovemaking hadnt or not very much it made nicole squeak too in alarm laughing a little odoull said i cant do anything about that god puts them where he wants them i just patch them up when he looks the other way for a second after the things hed seen he wondered how he still believed at all granny mcdougald didnt not so far as he could tell but his own faith survivedas long as he didnt lean on it too hard and he was strongwilled enough to make his own choices as he usually did he wore a rubber tonight nicole wasnt likely to catch she was close to fifty but why take chances and if that made the pope unhappyodoull didnt lose much sleep about it he didnt lose much sleep about anything he couldnt begin to guess how far behind he was nicole had to shake him awake the next morning when he did come back to consciousness the smells of coffee and of frying bacon helped reconcile him to the world he found fried eggs and fried potatoes to go with the bacon susanne and denise had been busy in the kitchen thank you my dears he said after he finished breakfast youre just about as wonderful as your sister they laughed susanne made as if to throw a spatula at him he made as if to duck everybody laughed then after flying shell fragments and machinegun bullets a spatula didnt seem very dangerous he thought about wearing uniform to the wedding he might have if it were in the usa in riviereduloup he didnt want to remind people he was a foreigner he didnt want to remind himself either his tailcoat smelled of mothballs but he put it on anyway it didnt match luciens hired suit but that was all right the groom was supposed to be noticed while his father was perhaps the most easily disposable person in the wedding party he wasnt even footing the billalphonse archambault was doctor and dentist greeted each other at the eglise stpatrice with a handshake and identical words hello quack they laughed and clapped each other on the back bishop guillaume celebrated the mass he wasnt a patch on the former bishop pascal whod returned to secular life but his lady friend hadnt had twins either which was why the former bishop pascal had returned to secular life lucien lifted paulettes veil and kissed her the odoulls and the archambaults stood in a receiving line and shook enough hands to make politicians jealous then everyone repaired to the archambaults houseonly a few blocks from the odoullsand ate and drank with as much abandon as people had the day before archambault had either talked with charles or knew somebody else who made damn good applejack riviereduloup didnt have a hotel odoull and nicole went down to old luciens farmrun by charles these daysto give lucien and paulette the privacy they needed for their first night in the morning the newlyweds would catch a train to honeymoon at niagara fallson the american side not the canadian the canadian side was under martial law nicole squeezed odoulls hand when they rolled past the hospital built on what was once galtier land if the occupiers hadnt wanted to punish your father by putting the hospital there we probably wouldnt have met odoull said see how many things we can blame on them charles said from behind the wheel his voice as dry as if he were georges since father did eventually get paid i suppose we can forgive them now nicole said you dont have any other reasons odoull asked and she poked him in the ribs the farmhouse hadnt changed much with charles living there even most of the furniture was the same as it had been so many memories nicole murmured odoull nodded he had a lot of memories of this place too though not so many as she did but he also had other memories more recent ones darker ones all too soon he would have to get back on a train for himself not for a honeymoon but to return to nightmare what was i doing what was i thinking he wondered even though he saved lives even though he wanted to save lives he also wanted to stay here he knew he couldnt and got drunk again so he didnt have to remember spring in georgia what could be finer mild air occasional showers everything green and growing the countryside full of birdsong hummingbirds flitting like badtempered jewels from flower to flower everything was lovely cassius noticed none of it he cared about none of it all he wanted to do was stay alive one more minute one more hour one more day had he gone to church with his family in augusta that sunday morning he wouldnt be wandering the georgia countryside now when his father and mother and sister didnt come back he went looking for themand almost ran right into the cops and freedom party stalwarts whod rounded them up the ofays were still laughing and joking about their haul and didnt notice him in the shadows every once in a while a dark skin came in handy of course if he were born with a white skin he wouldnt have ended up shut in behind barbed wire in the terry like a zoo animal he would have been on the other side of the wireprobably with a submachine gun in his hand and a freedom party pin on his lapel he didnt dwell on that he did realize he had to get out of the terry and right away if he didnt the whites would nab him in a cleanout before long off hed go to a camp people didnt come out of those places he waited till after midnight that night he had two weapons when he headed for the wirea pair of tin snips and the biggest stoutest knife from his mothers kitchen if anyone spotted him he aimed to fight if he could kill somebody with a gun then hed have one he didnt think about dying himself he was too young to take the idea seriously all the heroics he imagined ahead of time evaporated the tin snips cut through the wire well enough come morning people would have no trouble figuring out where hed got away but he didnt care hed be long gone by then and he was heading west he couldnt very well stay inside augusta it wouldnt be thirty seconds till he heard lets see your papers boy nothing in his passbook said he had any business being out and about again theyd ship him off to a campor maybe theyd just kill him on the spot out in the countrythered be more negroes there maybe hed fit in better and then he could start paying the freedom party goons back for everything they were doing hed had connections with the resistance in the cityhad them and lost them as people kept dying or getting seized now he had to rely on his wits and on the kindness of strangers black strangers of course hed long since given up on expecting anything from whites his father always said he got on well with jerry dover he even said dover had kept their whole family safe more than once maybe sobut dover was in the army now and the rest of cassius family was in a camp when the sun came up cassius was walking along a road heading west he didnt know where he was going all he knew was that hed made it out of augusta alive and that he was getting hungry and getting thirsty all the money that had been in the apartment was in his pocket how long could he make hed counted it to the last pennycounted it twice in fact hoping it would be more the second time around and absurdly disappointed when it wasnt last well hed find out maybe hed find out on the other hand maybe hed get killed before he came close to going through his meager funds every time he saw a motorcar he ran for the pine woods through which the road ran most of the time nobody stopped to go after him none of the vehicles that went by was an armored car so nobody sprayed the woods with machinegun fire that was good luck as good luck for negroes in the csa ran these days cassius didnt see it so aside from being hungry and thirsty he had sore feet he couldnt remember when hed done so much walking he didnt think he ever had he wondered if he ought to throw his shoes away for a while he didnt he didnt want to look like a shiftless country nigger he might have argued with his father but his attitudes faithfully respected the way he was raised he did a little thinking why didnt he want to look like a shiftless country nigger wasnt that his best bet for survival away went the shoes and his socks too dont go barefoot you get chiggers an hookworm too his old mans voice still rang in his ears or rather between them ignoring it wasnt easy but cassius managed the blisters on his heels sighed with relief before long though his soles started to complain and his luck ran out with the pine woods for miles ahead the road ran through fields cotton peanuts tobacco even rice he couldnt stay where he was living on what he could grub out of the groundmushrooms and maybe berriesand on the squirrels and rabbits he killed with rocks wasnt living it was just starving a little more slowly for better or for worse hed grown up in the city no doubt there were tricks to living out here only one trouble he didnt know them he took a deep breath and set out down the road through the fields a few years earlier they would have been full of colored sharecroppers tractors and harvesters and combines drove negroes off the land in swarms though like so many towns in the csa augusta had filled with farm workers who couldnt find work having them in the cities made it easier for the freedom party to scoop them up too here came a motorcar it was fairly new and in good repairnot noisy not belching smoke that made it a good bet to belong to a white man cassius straightened up squared his shoulders and kept walking along as if he had every right to be there every negro learned that trick if you pretended you belonged somewhere the ofays would believe you really did and it worked damned if it didnt the driver here wasnt a white man but a white woman her blond hair blowing in the breeze that came in through the open windows her head didnt even turn toward cassius as far as she was concerned he was part of the scenery like a cow or a dog or a turkey vulture sitting on a telegraph pole in a way that was good she didnt notice him and he couldnt afford to be noticed in another wayhe thought he deserved to be more important than a cow or a dog or a turkey vulture whites in the csa didnt see things like that they never had odds were they never would we have to make em see cassius thought fiercely then a white did notice him and it made his heart leap into his throat he was walking past a farmhouse when somebody shouted hey you yeah you boy the farmer wore bib overalls and a big straw hat he carried a shotgun at the moment pointed down at the ground what you want uh suh cassius tried not to show how scared he was you chop wood got me a pile of wood needs chopping the farmer said pay you a dollar for it when you get done part of cassius wanted to leap at that the restthe rest was naturally leery of trusting any white man half a dollar now half when i get through he said reckon id stiff you the farmer said cassius just spread his hands as if to say you never could tell the farmer shrugged all right but if you take off halfway through ill send the sheriff after you hell with me if i dont thats fair cassius allowed reckon i could get me a ham sandwich an maybe a dr hopper at noontime long with my other four bits if he was going to bargain hed go all out the farmer took the request in stride dont see why not good book says something about not binding up the mouths of the kine that tread the grain reckon that goes for people too how could he quote the bible and go along with what was happening to negroes in the csa maybe he didnt go along or not all the way anyhow he didnt ask to see cassius passbook and he didnt ask any inconvenient questions about what a young black man in city clothes was doing here as soon as cassius saw the mountain of wood he was supposed to chop he understood at once why the man didnt ask questions if he chopped all that hed earn his dollar three or four times over he was tempted to light out with the farmers two quarters in his pocket one thing held him back fear county sheriffs were supposed to use bloodhounds to track people just the way their grandfathers did back in slavery days if this one caught himhe didnt want to think about that with a sigh he set to work before long sweat ran down his face even though the weather wasnt too warm he got blisters on his palms bigger than the ones on his heels the farmer came to check on him took a look at those and gave him strips of cloth to wrap around his hands they helped at least an hour before noon the man brought him an enormous sandwich a big slice of sweetpotato pie and a cool dr hopper the bottle was dripping maybe it had been in the well much obliged suh cassius said youre doing an honest job the farmer said looks like you could use a meal maybe some cassius wolfed down the food he savored the dr hopper and smiled when bubbles went up his nose can i pour a bucket o water over my head feel mighty good if i do go right ahead the farmer answered cassius walked over to the well and did he finished somewhere between three and four in the afternoon the farmer didnt make any fuss about giving him the second installment of his pay and even brought him another sandwich without being asked thank you kindly cassius said with his mouth full want to stick around for a spell the white man asked him i could use a hand and you pull your weight sayfour dollars a week and board the money was chicken feed though a place to sleep and threeor at least twomeals a day made up for some of that but cassius shook his head i better keep movin on he said you wont find many better deals the farmer warned not from ofays cassius thought with negroes though he had a chance for something this fellow couldnt hope to give him vengeance that still burned in him obliged he said again but i got places to go and i know where youll end up in trouble the farmer said you come sneakin round here after dark raisin cain ill give you a bellyful of doubleaught buckshot wouldnt be the first time that meant guerrillas were active in these parts for cassius good news still he said i wouldnt do nothin like that with you suh you treated me fair you treated me bettern fair an i know it how long will you remember though the white man shrugged reckon were quits i dont have anything against youyou did a job of work there aint seen anybody go at it like that for a long time i was hungry cassius said with a shrug makes a difference the farmer agreed you know what theyre doin in the city suh cassius asked you know they got all the niggers shut up inside barbed wire you know theyre takin em to camps an killin em they took my ma and my pa and my sister yesterday no i didnt know any of that they dont talk about it much the farmer said only after cassius was a couple of miles down the road still another sandwich tied up in a rag did he realize the man had to be lying who were they what did they say he wondered why the man bothered to waste time lying to a black why not just tell the truth and gloat one answer occurred to him after another half a mile or so hed been closer to the axe than the farmer was and hed shown he knew how to use it armstrong grimes was fit to be tied and he didnt care who knew it what was his reward what was his regiments reward what was his divisions reward for making the mormons realize they couldnt throw enough bodies on the fire to put it out why to go to canada to go up against a bigger rebellion hed called the shot too well how many people in utah he demanded of yossel reisen i dont know his fellow sergeant answered as the train rattled along through the upper midwestor maybe it was in canada one stretch of plain looked just as dreary as another yossel went on half a million maybe yeah and not all of em were mormons either armstrong said all righthow many people in canada millions reisen said got to be millions fuckina it does thats what i figure too armstrong said so what do we have to do kill every goddamn one of them hey dont get sore at me yossel told him i didnt give the orders ive got to take em same as you do ill tell you whats sore my ass is sore armstrong grumbled the car he was in had hard benches packed too close together to squeeze in as many soldiers as possible the smell and a dense cloud of cigarette smoke thickened the air the army cared nothing for comfort it valued efficiency much more armstrong shifted from one weary cheek to the other he nudged his buddy you oughta write your congresswoman armstrong the first time you said that it was funny yossel reisen said the fifth time you said it i could put up with it by now though by now it gives me a fucking pain in the ass you know all right already got a butt armstrong asked sure yossel passed him a pack he lit up it helped pass the time when armstrong returned the pack reisen stuck one in his mouth armstrong leaned close to give him a light after yossels first drag he said weve got to lick the damn confederates if we dont well be stuck with our own shitty tobacco forever there you go armstrong blew out a cloud of smoke one more reason to hate jake featherston i thought i already knew em all weve got to kick his scrawny butt all right i wish we could do it too instead of fucking around with the goddamn stinking worthless canucks yossel chuckled i dont quite follow you tell us how you really feel before armstrong could answer he discovered they were already in canada somebody shot out a window in his railroad car the bullet missed everybody but glass sprayed soldiers everybody jumped and yelled and swore machine gunners on the roofs of two or three cars opened up on the sniper armstrong had no idea if they hit him but he did hope they made the bastard keep his head down then he said my guysyou all right he still had his platoon no eager young second looey had come out to take his place i got somethin in my eye sarge somebody right behind him said is it glass lemme see awkwardly armstrong turned around dont blink boone for christs sake he yanked at the privates eyelid damned if he didnt see a chunk of glass not much bigger than a grain of salt dont flinch either dammit ill try boone said not flinching when somebodys hand came at your eye was probably harder than holding steady in combat the soldier managedpretty well hang on armstrong peered down at his thumb sure as hell hed got the glass out he flicked it away blink hows your eye better sarge boone said in glad surprise thanks a million he blinked again yeah its all right now bully armstrong didnt know why he said that he couldnt remember the last time hed used it he couldnt remember if hed ever used it even his old man hardly ever said it but getting something out of somebodys eye made you feel fatherly and fathers talked in oldfashioned ways yossel reisen gave him a quizzical look bully well what about it armstrong snapped he was embarrassed hed come out with it too nothing yossel said but it wasnt nothing because he added you sounded like george custer thats all thanks a lot yossel armstrong had often wondered why his father gave him custers middle name and not his first one george grimes would have been a perfectly ordinary handle armstrongwasnt he shrugged yossel had a funnier name yet although maybe not if you were a jew a few minutes later the train screeched and squealed to a stop they werent anywhere that armstrong could seejust out in the middle of the damn prairie before long though officers started yelling out out what the fuck boone said armstrong only shrugged he didnt know what was going on either he was standing out on the prairie with his men waiting for somebody to tell him what to do next either nobody was in a hurry to do that or nobody knew he looked around in utah hed got used to always having mountains on the horizon no mountains here this was the flattest country hed ever seen it made ohio look like the himalayas the train tracks stretched out toward infinity as far as he could tell the two rails met there next town ahead is rosenfeld yelled somebody with a loud authoritative voice canucks ran the frenchies out of there and they hold the train station were going to take it back from them rosenfeld sits at a railway junction so we need the place if were going to be able to use both lines you got that goddamn frenchies armstrong muttered the soldiers from the republic of quebec showed no enthusiasm for fighting their former countrymen hed heard mexican troops in the csa didnt jump up and down at the idea of shooting atand getting shot bythe spooks down there both sets of soldiers from small countries probably figured they didnt really want to do big countries dirty work for them well the hell with em he thought i dont want to get my ass shot off either yossel reisen on the other hand summed things up in half a dozen words this is where we came in armstrong grunted and nodded theyd got off the train and fought their way forward in utah too he hoped the canadians wouldnt be as fanatical as the mormons he had trouble imagining how they could be but a soldiers life was full of nasty surprises the men in greengray shook themselves out into skirmish lines and moved forward a woman with hair once red but now mostly gray stood outside her farmhouse staring at them as they tramped past she saw americans come this way in too yossel murmured yeah and her husband probably made bombs or something armstrong said yossel trudged on for another couple of paces then nodded one good thing as far as armstrong was concerned this flat flat ground offered far fewer ambush points than utahs rougher terrain the first gunfire came from a farmhouse and its outbuildings the american soldiers went after the strongpoints with practiced ease machine guns made the canadians stay down mortar teams dropped bombs on the buildings and set some afire only then did foot soldiers approach a few canucks opened up on them more mortar and machinegun fire silenced the position then something new was added to the mix a beatup old pickup truck bounced across the fields it turned broadside to the american soldiers get down armstrong yelled to his men whatever the bastard driving that truck was doing it didnt look friendly and it wasnt two canucks in the pickups staked bed served a machine gun on a tall mount the gun chattered bullets sprayed toward the americans wounded soldiers shouted and screamed a few men in greengray had the presence of mind to shoot back but only a few leaving a trail of dust in the distance the truck bucketed away jesus armstrong said and then well i will be damned how come yossel reisen asked because heres a way to make our lives miserable the fucking mormons never thought of armstrong answered he pointed toward the pickup which was long out of range its not as good as a barrel but they can sure as shit chew us up from long range if theyve got more than one or two of those stinking things and they will bet your ass they will he spoke with a veterans ingrained pessimism yossel didnt tell him he was wrong the other sergeant did say a couplethree rounds through the engine block and those trucks wont go anywhere fast sureif we can do it armstrong said what about this guy though we never laid a glove on the mother he surprised us yossel said sure as shit surprised me armstrong agreed damn near punctured me besides hed lasted two years with nothing worse than cuts and bruises and scrapes he wanted to go on lasting too hed seen too many horrible things happen to other people he knew much too well that they could also happen to him now we know theyve got em yossel said well spread our machine guns out more or whatever the hell no softskinned trucks are going to make monkeys out of us ook armstrong said and scratched under his armpits yossel gave him the finger but he didnt care as far as he was concerned he was dead right that damn machine gun must have wounded eight or ten men the americans were flabbling as if it was going out of style but they werent doing anything except flabbling one lousy pickup truck knocked them back on their heels they needed most of an hour to start moving forward again half a mile closer to rosenfeld another defended farmhouse held them up as soon as they went to the ground two pickup trucks showed up they stayed at extreme range and blazed away most of their bullets were bound to go wild a few thougha few would wound or kill somebody with an antibarrel cannon made either a lucky shot or a great one and set a pickup on fire the other truck zoomed up alongside picked up the men who got out and roared off despite all the us bullets and shells that flew toward it it got away how many little trucks do you suppose the canucks have yossel asked armstrong gave that the only possible answer too goddamn many his buddy nodded they fought their way into rosenfeld a couple of hours later the canadian fighters didnt try to hold the little prairie town with the fanatical determination the mormons showed over every inch of ground in utah but canada had a hell of a lot more inches than utah did the defenders headed north toward winnipeg they would make another stand somewhere else only at the train station and a diner called pomeroys did they put up much of a fight the canucks wrecked the tracks in the station blew up the building and escaped pomeroys was a different story the rebels who holed up there didnt run and didnt give up the only person who got out of the burning battered building was a little boy about six years old hed lost the last joint of his left little finger otherwise he didnt seem badly hurt whats your name kid armstrong asked as he bandaged the boys hand im alec the boy looked at him you must be a goddamn yank yeah well i love you too armstrong pulled a squashed chocolate bar out of his pocket here want it thank you alec said gravely but youre still a goddamn yank you better believe it you little bastard armstrong told him not without pride vienna georgia was as far as east as spartacus guerrilla band had gone since jonathan moss and nick cantarella joined them spartacus insisted on pronouncing the name of the place as vieenna so did everybody else who talked about it from everything moss heard it probably didnt hold two thousand people but its name was proudly distinct from that of the capital of austriahungary mexican soldiers and overage white men patrolled the roads the negroes moved crosscountry past the ghosts of what had been their lives till the freedom party turned on them the countryside was achingly empty so many people either gone to towns to look for work or just gone period nick cantarella was chortling over an article in a threedayold copy of the albany gazette somebody had brought into camp listen to this he said nudging moss with his elbow brave canadian patriots with machine guns mounted on the back of pickup trucks have inflicted heavy casualties on the brutal us occupiers in a series of lightninglike hitandrun raids isnt that terrific moss gave the us infantry captain a quizzical glance well i guess it depends on whose side youre on oh cantarella laughed some more yeah sure but its a terrific idea we could do that right here we should do it and i was just laughing on account of jake featherstons propaganda asswipe told me about it all right now i get it color me dumb moss said yeah we could build a machinegun mount if we had ourselves a truck bet your ass we could cantarella said couplethree of these smokes are better mechanics than half the guys youd find in a motor pool theyre used to working with scrap metal and junk cause they couldnt get anything else lets talk to spartacus moss said they put their case to the guerrilla leader aint hard gettin us a truck or as many as we need he said all we gots to do is steal em he took the prospect for granted wish we had us mo machine guns we could fit em out like they was tanks damn near that was the oldfashioned british word for barrels cantarella shook his head well no not quite the thing about barrels is theyre armored somebody shoots up one of these trucks its gonna be shot up all right cant get too gay with em or youll be sorry quick you hear what im sayin i hear you spartacus answered makes sense still and allreckon we can git some o the ofays round these parts to shit their pants he grinned oh i think we might i think we just might cantarella answered we ought to make the mount so we can take it off a truck in a hurry sometimes a truck will get shot up sometimes well have to leave it behind cause we cant hide it shame to have to build a whole new mount again if something like that happens you know that makes sense too spartacus allowed his grin got wider wes gonna put trouble on wheels hell yes cantarella said three pickups walked with jesus in vienna that very night the guerrilla bands blacksmiths got to work on one the next morning spartacus stashed the other two in an abandoned negro village a few miles outside of town jonathan moss found places like that heartbreaking how many of them were there from one end of the csa to the other and what happened to the people who used to live in them nothing goodthat was only too plain the colored blacksmiths got the idea about fitting a machine gun on a truck as soon as cantarella started explaining one of thema man named caligulasaid dont need to give us no sermon on the mount suh he sent the white man a sly smile cantarella winced moss groaned the negroes broke up moss looked at them with new eyes from then on anyone who made puns that bad wasdamn near had to bea real live human being and deserved to be slapped down just like anybody else and the mount the blacksmiths came up with was beautifully simple they fastened a short length of upright iron pipe to the truck bed if they lost the truck they would lose it too into it they stuck a longer pipe whose outer diameter matched the inner diameter of the bottom part of the mount and on top of that they fixed the machine gun jonathan moss admired the result if you were going to make these as a regular thing you couldnt do any better he said where did the pipe come from reckon some plumber wonder where the pipe go suh caligula answered with another sidelong grin all the negroes were eager to take their new toy out on the road so eager that they almost came to blows they all knew how to serve the machine gun only a handful of them though could drive that was funny in a frightening way spartacus sidled up to moss and asked how you like to be our driver how would i like that moss wondered he was less useful to the guerrillas than nick cantarella simply because he knew less about the infantrymans trade but he damn well could drive a truck sure he said after no more than a seconds hesitation put somebody who knows where hes going in the cab with me though i didnt grow up around here so i dont know all the little back roads thatll get me out of trouble i go with you my ownself spartacus said reckon i knows this country tolerable good he let out a nasty chuckle reckon we gonna give the ofays a little bit of a surprise too yeah jus a lil bit what will the confederates do to me if they recapture me fighting alongside the black guerrillas moss decided he didnt want to know not in any detail he also decided he couldnt afford to be taken not any more let me have a pistol he said and mimed shooting himself in the head oh yes we takes care o dat spartacus promised and he did the he handed moss the next morning was an officers sidearm it would do the job all right strategy was simplicity itself about an hour after sunup they set off up the road from vienna heading north toward the even smaller town of pinehurst about ten miles away anything they passed they shot up the first auto they came up to was driven by a fat grayhaired white man he started to give moss a friendly smile as the pickup truck passed his beatup gray birmingham the smile changed to a look of horror when he saw spartacus on the seat beside moss a moment later a burst of machinegun fire finished him and set his motorcar on fire spartacus and the blacks in the back all whooped do jesus the guerrilla leader yelled this here gonna be fun that white man wouldnt think so but then if he was one of the yahoos who went around yelling freedom he was helping the confederate states government visit wholesale slaughter on their blacks if he happened to get in the way of a little retail slaughter coming the other waywell too damn bad a tractor sat in a cotton field not far from the side of the road stop the truck spartacus told moss he followed the black mans order spartacus pointed out the window put some holes in that fucker he yelled the gun crew obeyed the tractor sent a plume of black greasy smoke up into the sky they wrecked two more tractors and a combine jonathan moss nodded to himself those were the tools that let white farmers get along without black sharecroppers they were handy yes but they were also expensive how would those whites like watching them go up in flames the gunners sprayed an oncoming automobile with bullets it went off the road flipped over and burned like a torch this is fun spartacus shouted moss nodded destruction for the sake of destruction brought a nasty thrill with it almost as if he were a staid married man visiting a whorehouse there was a checkpoint outside of pinehurst a sleepy one manned by three or four great war veterans too old or too infirm to do anything more strenuous they were just going through the motions they didnt expect any trouble as the pickup truck drew near spartacus ducked down so they couldnt see him next to moss when the machine gunners in the back of the pickup opened fire the guards toppled like tenpins git spartacus told moss go left then left again soon as you can the road up to pinehurst was paved the one onto which spartacus put moss was nothing but a dirt track red dust rose in choking clouds for it hadnt rained lately the dust will let them track us moss said so what spartacus answered we be long gone by the time they catch up to usan if we aint they be sorry he probably wasnt wrong about that pursuerseven riflemencoming up against a machine gun would get a lethal surprise he sent moss and the pickup bouncing along back roads and tracks nobody who hadnt known these parts for years would have been able to follow moss teeth clicked together more than once they werent necessarily good tracks one of them had a hog wallow right in the middle spartacus pointed straight ahead moss gunned the engine and leaned on the horn the machine gunners solved the problem a different way as hogs scrambled out of the muck the gunners shot them the truck sprayed stinking mud as it went through stop spartacus yelled when it got to the other side moss hit the brakes the machinegun crew hopped out and threw three carcasses into the back of the pickup we dont just shoot up the ofays spartacus said happily we eats good today too a white man with a shotgun charged out of a farmhouse a couple of hundred yards away he didnt want to yield his porkers without a fight the machine gunners sprayed a burst in his general direction he ran away even faster than hed come out we dont take shit from nobody spartacus roared as moss put the pickup in gear again riding around with a machine gun in the back of your truck worked wonders for your confidence those side roads brought the pickup almost back to where its rampages had begun the machine gun and the top part of the mount came off neat as you please one of the gunners carried the weapon the other shouldered the long pipe more guerrillas emerged from the undergrowth to take charge of the dead pigs roast pork and a tenmile stretch of road shot to hell and gone made for a celebration that evening so did a couple of jugs of raw corn whiskey the stuff tasted like paint thinner and burned its way down like a lighted kerosene lamp after a few swallows moss started forgetting things a few more he knew and hed have trouble remembering his name but he needed to remember something youve got to tell people he said to spartacus the homemade hooch adding urgency to his voice tell which people the guerrilla leader asked tell em what he was drinking harder than moss got to tell the other colored fighters moss was proud of himself he did remember got to tell them what these pickup trucks can do dont you worry none about dat spartacus said be all over georgia day after tomorrow be all the way to louisiana this time nex week yes suh you best believe it will we done hit the ofays hard folks is gonna hear about it you best believe folks is gonna hear about it moss turned to nick cantarella youre a hero my ass cantarella said i didnt even get to drive the truck but he hadnt drunk himself fighting mad for he went on what i really like about this is that their own damn propaganda upped and bit em i never woulda thought of mounting a machine gun on a pickup and raising hell but since those stupid pricks went and told me how heres to propaganda moss said they both drank colonel terry defrancis was one of the youngest officers of his rank major general abner dowling had ever seen remembering how long hed taken to get to bird colonel himself dowling eyed the boy wonder with suspicion my orders from the war department are to subordinate myself to you and to smash cs air power in west texas defrancis said i think my wing has brought enough fighters and bombers out here to do the job too i wouldnt begin to argue with you there colonel dowling said in one fell swoop the air power at his command had tripled but why does philadelphia care now when it didnt before sir i can answer that in three little words defrancis told him if youre going to say i love you colonel ill throw you out on your ear dowling warned straightfaced terry defrancis stared at him then laughed like a loon youre not what i expected sir not even slightly he said no what i was going to say is i dont know have featherstons boys been pulling off air raids that hurt if they have nobody told me about it dowling answered they havent had enough airplanes out here to hurt us very badly we havent had enough to do much to them either sounds like things are going to change though thats what im here for colonel defrancis agreed thats what my boys are here for were going to make them sorry if we can good dowling said it was good in all kinds of ways if the war department had aircraft to spare for an outoftheway outfit like his eleventh army it was bound to have even more farther east where the real decision would lie andtell me something colonel when they sent you out here did they say anything about camp determination no sir the younger man answered is that ours or theirs sounds like something the freedom party would name theres a reason for thatit is something the freedom party named here take a look at these dowlings desk had a locked drawer he unlocked it and took out the aerial reconnaissance photos of the camp near snyderand of the mass graves not far away defrancis studied them with meticulous care he was frowning as he looked up at dowling interpreting stuff like this isnt always easy especially when youre seeing it for the first time what exactly am i looking at here dowling told him exactly what he was looking at there defrancis jaw dropped youre making that upuh sir colonel i wish to christ i were dowling answered and the disgust and horror in his voice had to carry conviction its the truth though if anything its an understatement they really are killing off their negroes and they really are doing it by carload lots literally by carload lotsthats a railroad spur between the two halves of the camp yes sir i saw that it was colonel defrancis stared down at the pictures again when he looked up this time he wasnt just frowning he was slightly green or more than slightly you know i thought all those stories were bullshit propaganda stuff we pumped out to keep the civilians all hot and bothered about the war effort back in the last war the british said the germans boiled babies bodies to make soap that kind of thing i felt the same way till i got out here dowling said grimly who wouldnt if youre halfway decent yourself you figure the guy on the other side is too well the guy on the other side here is jake featherston and jake featherston really is just as big a son of a bitch as everybody always thought he was defrancis eyed the photographs once more dowling understood that they had an evil fascination to them in their own way they were just as much filthy pictures as the ones you could buy in any town where soldiers or sailors got leave what can we do about this sir defrancis asked we cant just let it go on i mean i havent got any great use for niggers but yeah but dowling reached into another desk drawer he pulled out a halfpint of whiskey and slid it across the desk to the younger man here wash the taste out of your mouth thank you sir defrancis took a healthy swig then set the flat bottle down what can we do weve got to do something i think so too though youd be amazed at how many people on our side of the border dont give a rats ass dowling said ive had the time to think about it now way it looks to me is we cant just bomb hell out of the camp if we do that we go into the niggerkilling business ourselves like you said i dont have much use for them but i dont want to do that i agree defrancis said like i told you sir my first priority is blasting enemy airstrips and aircraft but now i see what i do next dowling scratched his head the war department suddenly seemed to have a wild hair about cs airstrips here in the west had the latest raids on los angeles and las vegas and denver rattled people back east so much if they had why dowling shrugged that wasnt his worryand as often as not the ways of the gods back in philadelphia were unfathomable to mere mortals in the field i havent operated out here before colonel defrancis said whats the fuel situation like we dont have a problem there dowling said the refineries in southern california are working with local crude so theyre at full capacity we get what we need a lot of the airplane plants are out there too so you should be able to get your hands on spare parts assuming they dont decide to send all of themand all the avgasto ohio and virginia defrancis said yes assuming dowling agreed we cant do much about that so there isnt much point to worrying about it is there no sir the young officer eyed him i think were going to get on pretty well sir he might have been announcing a miracle well heres hoping dowling said i put up with general custer for a lot of years my thought is if i managed that most people ought to be able to stand me for a while eryes sir colonel defrancis gave him an odd look now to defrancis as to most people george armstrong custer was a hero up on a marble column he wasnt a whiskeydrinking cigarsmoking skirtchasing whenever his wife wasnt too close eviltempered mulestubborn old man reminding people that a hero had feet of clay and sometimes a head of iron seldom won you friends no matter what defrancis thought about general custer he knew what to do with airplanes he built his strips close to the front relying on the eleventh army not to lose ground and leave them vulnerable to artillery fire dowling thought he could oblige the flier there but he was gloomily certain the confederates would find out where the new fields were as soon as the bulldozers and steamrollers started leveling ground no matter whether you called this part of the world west texas or part of a revived us state of houston the people here remained passionately proconfederate and the land was so wide and troops scattered so thinly those people had no trouble slipping across the front to tell the enemy what they knew or rather what they thought they knew terry defrancis proved devious to a downright byzantine degree earthmoving equipment laid out and flattened several dummy fields along with the ones his airplanes would actually use confederate bombers called on more of the dummies than the real airstrips wasting their highexplosive sweetness on the desert ground and then defrancis medium and heavy bombers roared off to respond dowling drove back to one of the stripsirreverently named fry featherston fieldto watch them go they and their escort fighters kicked up ungodly clouds of dust coughing dowling said weve got our own smoke screen yes sir defrancis shouted over the engines thunder we could use one too im not used to operating in broad daylight its a different war out here new rules no colonel dowling shook his head only one rule the same one you find anywhere weve got to beat those bastards defrancis pondered that but not for long well do it sir well beat em like a drum he kept fighters in the air when the bombers came back for fuel and ordnance a few bombersand a few fightersdidnt come back the confederates had fighters of their own and antiaircraft around their airfields you couldnt fight a war without taking losses colonel defrancis looked grim the men who went down werent just fliers to him they were friends almost family wireless technicians monitored signals from the us airplanes and also from the confederates they marked maps and brought them to defrancis and dowling looks like were doing pretty good sir one of them said were plastering the fields we know about all right defrancis said how many fields have they got that we dont know about dowling asked thats always the question defrancis said well find out how hard they hit back and from where then well go blast hell out of those places too sooner or later they wont be able to stand the gaff any more he sounded confident dowling looked inside himselfand found he was confident too enemy bombers returned but at night the confederates had paid too high a price to go on with day bombing that was a sign they were hurting or dowling hoped it was night bombing spared their airplanes but wasnt very accurate the confederates managed to sneak auto bombs onto a couple of fields they blew up one bomber in its revetment and cratered another runway the runway was easy enough to repair the bomber was a writeoff terry defrancis cashiered the officers in charge of security at those strips when dowling heard about the auto bombs he telephoned and asked what the wing commander had done about them when he found out he grunted in sour satisfaction if you didnt give em the boot i would have he said figured as much sir defrancis said but i can shoot my own dog by god and i shot both those sons of bitches they had no business falling asleep at the switch this isnt nebraska for gods sake enemy action shouldnt catch them playing with themselves in two words colonel youre right dowling hung up feeling better about the world than he had in quite a while defrancis was an officer after his own heart on the ground the eleventh army wasnt making much progress dowling used what he had as aggressively as he could hed already made the confederates send that elite unit to stall his advance the party guards did it too he was disappointed about that but not crushed whatever the freedom party guards did here they werent doing in ohio or kentucky or virginia places that really mattered he wondered if the confederates would send more bombers west to contest the skies with terry defrancis airplanes they didnt their counterattacks dwindled before long they were reduced to harassment raids from biplanes that sounded like flying sewing machinesboll weevils the confederates called them they came straight out of the great war their pilots heaved five and tenpound bombs from the cockpit by hand that sounded laughable till the first time one of those little bombs blew up an officers club the boll weevils flew at what would have been treetop height if there were any trees close by yranging had a devil of a time spotting them and nothing else could not till they got right on top of whatever they intended to hit they would never win the war for the csa even so they kept dowling and defrancis back on their heels us air power had won part of the fight here in west texas but not all of it abner dowling fumed in lubbock nothing ever went quite the way you wished it would viii george enos had never crossed the country on a train before that he could now said the war had come a long way in the past few months the townsend sat in drydock in san diego getting a refit and repairs theyd given him enough liberty to go to boston stay a few days and then hop another train heading back to the west coast the one he was on now would have gone faster if it could have made anything better than a crawl at night but blackouts were strictly enforced the cars had black curtains along with conductors they had hardfaced blackout monitors who carrieds and made sure nobody showed a light at night those monitors had good reason to look tough the farther east the train traveled the more often george saw wrecks shoved off to one side of the railroad the government no doubt figured they were part of the cost of making war the government had a point george doubted the people in those ravaged trains would have appreciated it he came through ohio during the day so he could see what the war had done he stared in astonishment it looked more like the mountains of the moon than any human landscape how many years would this part of the country take to recover from the devastation would it ever how could it he didnt go through pittsburgh from everything hed heard that was even worse that he could get through at all was plenty this time last year things were even worse he thought he shook his head it seemed impossible even boston had taken bomb damage hed heard that too seeing it as the train slowed and then stopped was something else again those bastards hit my home town the fury that stirred up amazed him he wasnt overjoyed about coming into town three and a half hours behind schedule either he wasnt surprised but he wasnt overjoyed he hoped connie and his sons werent waiting for him on the platform the boys would be bouncing off the walls if theyd had to sit around all that time when the train stopped he jumped up grabbed his duffel and slung it over his shoulder he almost clobbered another sailor sorry buddy he said then a sergeant almost clobbered him he laughed what went around came around but not usually so soon there was a traffic jam at the door to the car everybody wanted to get out first eventually the door opened and people squeezed out most of the passengers were soldiers and sailors coming home on leave screaming weeping women rushed toward them george that was redheaded connieshe was there after all she almost knocked him off his feet when she threw her arms around him hi babe he said then he kissed her and that took a lot of careful attention he felt as if he stayed submerged longer than any submersible in the us navy at last he came up for air his heart pounding he noticed his wife was there by herself where are the kids he asked my mothers got em connie answered i figured the train would be late and i was right whats so funny you talk like boston george said so do i but im about the only guy on my ship who does im not used to hearing it any more well you better get used to it pretty darn quick on account of its how people talk around here connie said what do you think of that he hadnt let go of her your mas got the boys he said his wife nodded at her place connie nodded again george squeezed in that case i know exactly what i think he squeezed her again tighter oh you do do you and whats that connie pretended not to know lets go back to the apartment youll find out he said sailors she laughed sure lets go you wont be fit to live with till we do her mocktough tone softened and ive missed you missed you too babe george said and it was true he did his best to forget his occasional visits to whores he told himself they didnt really count he didnt do anything like that when he was at home and his visits to pro stations must have worked hed passed every shortarm inspection he wouldnt be bringing connie any unexpected presents that was a relief when they got to the subway station the ticketseller wouldnt take his nickel free to men in uniform sir she said before the war everybody who worked in the subway system had been male one more thing the pressure of fighting had changed i hate these cars theyre so crowded connie said as the train rattled along george nodded purely for politeness sake it didnt seem that bad to him hed got used to being packed tight with other people on fishing boats the navy pushed men together closer still no subway car could faze him he dropped the duffel inside the front door to the apartment and looked around in amazement the living room was so big and the kitchen and the bedrooms lay beyond and a bathroom just for the family with a door that closed i swear to god hon the skipper on the townsend doesnt live half this good george said i should hope not connie said and pulled her dress off over her head that wasnt what george meant but it wasnt bad either he would have dragged her down on the floor and done the deed right there why not with a carpet down it was softer than the decks hed been walking since going to sea but giggling she twisted away and hurried back into the bedroom he followed standing at attention even while he walked a bed was better than even a carpeted floor afterwards sated for the moment george was willing to admit it wow he said lighting a cigarette and then running a hand along connies sweet curves whyd i go and join the navy i asked you that when you went and did it connie said see what youve been missing its good to be home all right he said but the army wouldve got me if i didnt put on a sailor suit if i couldve gone on doing my job that wouldve been different but conscription wouldve nailed me id rather be a sailor than a soldier any day of the week and twice on sundays he wondered why putting to sea wasnt safer than staying on dry land hed seen as much in the endless clashes with the japanese over the sandwich islands but hed been going out to sea since he was in high school hed never gone through the middle of the usa till this train trip from the west coast he was doing what he was used to connie poked him in the ribs he jerked what was that for he asked what do you do when you come into port when youre halfway around the world from me his wife said do you go looking for floozies the way sailors do when they get into boston not me he lied solemnly if he hadnt expected that question he couldnt have handled it so well im a married guy i am i like being a married guy to show how much he liked it he leaned over and started caressing her in earnest he wasnt ready for a second round as fast as he would have been a few years earlier but hed gone without for a long time he didnt have much trouble smiling in the afterglow connie said i like the way you argue me too george said and they both laughed she wouldnt have liked it so muchwhich was putting things mildly with her redheads temperif hed told her the truth he never felt like straying if she was anywhere close by if they were thousands of miles apart though if he wasnt going to see her for monthsas long as he didnt come down with the clap and pass it along what she didnt know wouldnt hurt her and then he poked her the same way shed poked him she squeaked what about you he asked you looking at the handsome delivery guys and truck drivers while im gone thats a laugh she answered these days the delivery guys and truck drivers have white mustaches or hooks or wooden legseither that or their voices arent done changing yet besides if i was stupid enough to do something like that youd find out about it somebody would blab somebody always does but youre off in those places where nobody ever heard of you so who knows what you could get away with if you wanted to she was right she was righter than she knewand righter than he ever intended to let her find out and she was right that word about straying wives did get back to husbands a couple of men on the townsend had got that kind of bad news from people in their home towns either from relatives or from friends who couldnt stand keeping their big mouths shut connie teased him about going off the reservation but she didnt really push him which could only mean she didnt really think he was doing it that left him relieved and embarrassed at the same time she said now that youve acted like a sailor who just got home do you want to see your children sure george lets see if they remember me patrick and margaret mcgillicuddy had a house not far from the enos apartment connies father was a fisherman too and out to sea right now he was well past fifty they werent going to conscript him no matter what connies mother was a lot like her even if shed put on a little weight and her hair wasnt so bright as it used to be margaret mcgillicuddy didnt take guff from anyone even her grandsons to georges way of thinking that made her a better grandma not a worse one he missed his own mothera sudden stab of longing he could never do anything about now if only shed never taken up with that worthless drunken bum of a writer hed shot himself too not that that did george any good when george walked into the mcgillicuddys place leo and stan were playing with tin soldiers some painted greengray others butternut stan who was younger had the confederates he was losing and not happy about it being a little brother meant getting the dirty end of the stick george was the older of two children and he had a sister he hoped mary jane was doing well hed find outsoon for now the boys looked up from their game yelled daddy and knocked everything over they charged him he picked them both up that was harder than it had been before he joined the navytheyd grown a hell of a lot since hey guys he said and kissed each of them in turn are you glad to see me yeah they screamed one into one ear one into the other the roar from the townsends main battery might have been louder but not a lot leo added we dont ever want you to go away neither do i connie said softly i dont want to either george said sometimes youve got to do what youve got to do though not what you want to do thats so mrs mcgillicuddy said she turned to connie and went on do you think i want your father to put to sea and stay away for weeks but thats how he keeps us fed and thats what hes got to do connie couldnt even say being in the navy was dangerous and being a fisherman wasnt storms out in the atlantic claimed too many boats for that to be true i know she did say but i still dont like it well i dont like it either george said he put down his sons theyre heavy i think you must be feeding em rocks that made leo and stan giggle connie rolled her eyes george aimed to enjoy his leave as much as he could and when it was upwhen it was up he would go back and that was all there was to it with the front stabilized not far southeast of lubbock jefferson pinkard stopped worrying about the damnyankees he had more urgent things to worry about insteadmaking sure negroes went through camp determination in a hurry chief among them he didnt have numbers to let him know how the other camps in the csa were doing but if his wasnt the biggest he would have been mightily surprised one thing seemed clear they were reducing population faster than blacks could possibly breed every day they did that was a victory and then the united states started making his life difficult us bombers and fighters came overhead with little opposition from confederate hound dogs the antiaircraft guns around the camp boomed and bellowed but didnt shoot down many enemy airplanes jeff telephoned the local cs field commander to ask for more help if i could give it to you i would brigadier general whitlow ling said i dont have the aircraft myself though whered they go jeff asked he didnt quite add did they fly up your ass he wanted the army man to give him the facts and pissing ling off wouldnt help damnyankees pounded the crap out of em thats where ling said glumly they got a whole new air wing sent in and it gives em a big edge dammit why cant we get more then pinkard demanded im trying ling sounded harassed so far no luck everything we make theyre keeping east of the mississippi but the yankees can afford to send airplanes out here jeff said thats about the size of it and we cant right now thats about the size of it too shit jeff said and hung up if the usa could do some things the csa couldnt match the confederacy was in trouble you didnt need to belong to the general staff to figure that out only a matter of time before the damnyankees used their air superiority todo whatever they damn well pleased and before long what they pleased became pretty obvious they started bombing the railroad lines that led into snyder you needed a lot of bombs to tear up train tracks because the chances of a direct hit werent good the usa had plenty of bombs and us fighters strafed repair crews whenever they could us airplanes started pounding snyder too that terrified jefferson pinkard not for the camps sake but for his own if anything happened to his pregnant wife and his stepsons he had no idea what hed do go nuts was all he could think of the house where edith and frank and willie were stayingthe house where pinkard stayed when he didnt sleep at camp determinationwasnt that close to the tracks but when the damnyankees hit snyder they didnt seem to care they did their best to knock the whole town flat maybe they figured that would interfere with the way camp determination ran and maybe they were right too pinkard got a call from ferdinand koenig whats this i hear about niggers piling up on sidings halfway across texas the attorney general barked doesnt sound like your camp is doing its job the injustice of that made pinkard want to reach down the telephone line and punch koenig in the nose mr attorney general sir you repair the railroads for me he growled clamping down on rage with both hands you get the fighters out here to shoot down the yankee airplanes that are chewing up the line you do that stuff and then if i fall down on the job you can tell me im slacking off till you do it though you just back the hell off maybe you want to watch your mouth ferd koenig said how often did people talk back to him not veryjeff was sure of that the attorney general went on i can have your job like that he snapped his fingers if youre gonna blame me for shit thats not my fault youre damn well welcome to it jeff said if i screw up thats fine rake me over the coals on account of it but if you want me to take the heat because some asshole on the general staff wont send airplanes way the hell out here im damned if ill sit still for it go and find some other whipping boy then see how long he lasts me ill get the fuck outa here and go someplace safer a long long silence followed at last koenig said maybe i was hasty maybe you weresir jeff said ive got my family maybe you ought to can me then i can send them back to louisiana and i wont have to worry about getting em blown to smithereens ill get back to you the attorney general hung up he didnt call back pinkard hadnt really thought he would nobody wanted to admit hed got his ears pinned back but no more cs fighters appeared in the skies above west texas maybe the csa truly couldnt spare them no matter how much this front needed them if the confederacy couldnt one more thing jeff didnt want to think about he was in snyder for the worst air raid hed ever gone through his driver had just delivered him to his house and sped away when the sirens began to howl bombs started falling a few seconds later snyder boasted no fancy electronic detection gearor if it did pinkard didnt know about it somebody had to eyeball those airplanes before the sirens could cut loose he almost knocked down the front door flinging it open get in the cellar he roared edith was already herding her boys into it come on jeffyou too she said im coming he tried not to show how scared he was a storm cellar gave almost perfect protection against a tornado as long as you got there in time against bombsthere was no guarantee nothing this side of reinforced concrete gave you a good chance against a direct hit a wooden trapdoor wasnt the same but going into a cellar was a lot better than staying out in the open fragments couldnt get you blast probably wouldnt not unless the bomb came down right on top of the house make it stop papa jeff frank wailed as explosions shook the earth i cant i wish i could pinkard said his stepson stared up at him in the dim yellow light of a kerosene lantern but you can do anything papa jeff that was touching if only it were true only god can do everything pinkard said and the way things were going for the csa even god looked to be falling down on the job god and hyperman willie said the younger boy sounded utterly confident there was another comic with a similar name in the usa but that one was banned down here its hero frequently clobbered confederate spies and saboteurs but it was so vivid and exciting banning it wasnt good enough people smuggled it over the border till the powers that be in richmond had to come up with an equivalent even now from what jeff heard the yankee comic circulated underground in the csa but hyperman whod wrecked new york city at least three times and philadelphia twice made a good enough substitute edith might have explained that god was real and hyperman only makebelieve she might have but bombs started falling closer just then the thunder and boom the earth rocking under your feet made you forget about funnybooks this was real and all you could do was hope you came out the other side one hit so close that the lantern shuddered off the tabletop and started to fall jeff caught it before it hit the groundmiraculously by the handle he put it back where it belonged wow frank said and then see i told you you could do anything catching a lantern was one thing andjeff knew even if frank didnthe was lucky to do even that making the damnyankees stop dropping their bombs was a whole different kettle of fish jeff had no idea how to say that so it made sense to a little boy and so he didnt try all he could do all anybody in snyder could do was sit tight and hope a bomb didnt come down right on his head pinkard also hoped the yankees werent bombing the camp they hadnt yet what did that say that they valued niggers lives more highly than those of decent white folks jeff couldnt think of anything elseand if that was true then what choice did the confederacy have but to fight those people to the last cartridge and the last man after the longest forty minutes in the history of the world the bombs stopped falling do you reckon we can go up now edith asked i guess so pinkard answered though he wasnt sure either his wife seemed to think hed been through things like this before and knew what to do about them he wished it were true but sitting in a cellar getting bombed was new for him too back in the great war airplanes couldnt deliver punishment like this when they opened the door and went up the house was still standing and still had all the roof but window glass crunched and clinked under their feet if theyd stayed up there it would have sliced them into sausage meat edith softly started to cry the boys thought it was funtill they cut themselves on some razoredged fragments then they cried too jeff went outside jesus he muttered the house across the street had taken a direct hit it had fallen in on itself and was burning fiercely people stood around staring helplessly whoever was in there didnt have a chance of getting out one of the houses next door to the wrecked one had half collapsed too a little farther down a bomb had gone off in the middle of the street water welled up onto the asphalt from a shattered main that would make fighting fires harder if not impossible telephone and power lines were down he hadnt noticed that the electricity was out when he came up from the cellar but hed had other things on his mind and he smelled gas jesus he said again hed been about to light a cigarette but he thought better of that then he changed his mind and lit up anyhow if that blaze across the street didnt set off the gas his raleigh wouldnt plumes and clouds of smoke rose all over snyder it was just a little texas town lucky to have one fire engine the siren wailed like a lost soul as the firemen did whatever they could wherever they could edith came out too and looked around in disbelief this was a nice place she said it really was look what those goddamn sons of bitches went and did to it pinkards jaw dropped she never talked like that but she was right no matter how she put it nodding jeff said do you want to take the boys back to alexandria then yalld be safer there no she said which surprised him again i want to stay right here with you and i want us to lick the devil out of the usa looking around at the wreckage jeff knew the yankees had just licked the hell out of snyder andtheyre liable to come back you know i dont think theyll just hit us once and go away if they wanted to foul up camp determination wrecking the way in would help im not afraid edith said god will watch over all of us i know hes on our side everybody in every war since the world began was convinced god was on his side half the people in every war since the world began ended up being wrong jeff didnt know how to say that either he did know edith wouldnt listen if he tried and so he let it go major jerry dover didnt know what the hell had happened to colonel travis ww oliphant dead captured deserted he couldnt say and he didnt much care with oliphant out of the picture keeping central kentucky supplied landed on his shoulders he could do it without false modesty he knew he could do it better than his thickheaded superior did oliphant of course was a regular he went to vmi or one of the other confederate finishing schools for officers no doubt he was a good enough subaltern during the great war but it wasnt the great war any more and oliphant had had trouble figuring that out trucks dover shouted into the telephone we need more trucks up here dammit he might have been back at the huntsmans lodge screaming at a butcher whod shorted him on prime rib were sending up as many as weve got said the officer on the other end of the line an officer much more safely ensconced down in tennessee damnyankees are giving us a lot of trouble you know that did it dover blew up the same way he would have at a cheating butcher give me your name damn you give me your superiors name too on account of im going to tell him just what kind of a clueless git hes got working for him you want to know what trouble is come up where you can hear the guns dont sit in a cushy office miles and miles away from anywhere and tell me how rough youve got it now give me your name instead of doing that the other officer hung up on him jerry dover said several things that made the other logistics officers in the tent outside of covington kentucky look up in amazement then he called back someone else down in tennessee picked up the telephone who was the last son of a bitch on the line dover demanded brigadier general tyler just stepped out the other man replied who are you and who do you think you are somebody whos looking for tylers superior said dover who didnt back away from anybody he had a shorttimers courage he was a man with no military career to wreck they wouldnt shoot himthe damnyankees were much more likely to do that they wouldnt jail him for long the worst they were likely to do was cashier him in which case hed go home and be better off than he was now im going to get what i need up here in kentucky or ill know the reason why im major general barton kinder the officer said now one more timewho the dickens are you im major jerry dover and i want brigadier general tyler to pull his trucks out of his asshole and get em on the road up here dover said a considerable silence followed then kinder said a major does not speak that way to a general officer so sue me dover said all i know is the damnyankees are building up like you wouldnt believe on the other side of the ohio were lagging on account of we cant get what we need where we need it and one of the reasons we cant is that you guys wont turn loose of your trucks if we get swamped you reckon anybody in richmonds going to give a rats ass that youve got all your fucking trucks the silence lasted even longer this time i could have your head major general kinder said at last can you give me one good reason why i shouldnt i can give you two sir dover said you give me the boot youll get somebody up here who doesnt know what the hell hes doing and thatll screw up the war effort theres one and two is ten minutes after that new sucker gets here hes gonna be on the horn screaming his head off to you wondering how come youre not shipping him the shit he needs you cant possibly be a regular major general kinder said after yet another pause not me jerry dover agreed cheerfully i come out of the restaurant business but im mighty goddamn good at what i do which counts for moresir the restaurant business eh no wonder youre such a foulmouthed son of a bitch kinder said proving hed had at least one other restaurant manager serve under him all right major well see what we can do thank you very much sir dovers respect for military courtesy rose in direct proportion to how much his superiors were inclined to do what he wanted you almost pushed it too far major barton kinder said i wouldnt try that again if i were you he hung up before dover could answer which might have been lucky for all concerned one of the other logistics officers who couldnt possibly have heard what major general kinder said told dover boy you like to walk close to the edge dont you the damnyankees can blow me up the damnyankees will blow me up if we give em half a chancemaybe even if we dont dover answered if a brass hat on my own side wants to throw me in the stockade or take the uniform off my back what the hell do i care the worst thing my own people can do to me is leave me right where im at i wish i could look at it that way the other man had a vmi class ring on the third finger of his right hand so he was a career officer that meant he was missing freedom dover said he was no party stalwart but the slogan rang true here isnt that what this damn wars all about if we arent free to do what we want and tell everybody else to piss up a rope whats the point before the vmi graduate could answer the world blew up alarms started howling and screeching bombs started dropping shells started bursting men started screaming gas gas fuck jerry dover said with much more passion than hed used to say freedom he had to rummage in his desk for a gas mask as he fumbled it on he knew what this was he knew what it had to be the yankees had been building up for a long time they werent building any more they were coming invasion no word could rouse greater dread in the csa for the first two summers of the war the confederates had had everything their own way the united states had a lot of debts to pay now it looked as if they were laying their money on the table out somebody shouted out and into the trenches that struck jerry dover as some of the best advice hed ever heard he flew out through the tent flapnot that he was the first man gone or even the second the trenches werent far away but one of the men who got out ahead of him stopped a shell and exploded into red mist dover tasted blood on his lips as he ran by he spat and spat feeling like a cannibal he jumped into the trench feetfirst as if going into a swimming hole when he was a kid then he looked around for something to dig with being merely a logistics officer he had no entrenching tool on his belt a board was better than nothing he started scraping his own dugout from the side of the trench shell fragments screeched past above his head a wounded man shrieked not everybody made it to the trench on time some confederate guns started firing back the noise of shells going out was different from the one they made coming in bombs whistled down out of the sky they were what really scared dover if one of them burst in this stretch of trench that was it he was safe enough from artillery here but not from bombs somebody punctuated a momentary lull by screaming this is it make it stop someone else added a moment later his voice high and desperate and shrill jerry dover wished it would stop too but it didnt it went on and on till it reminded him of one of the unending bombardments from the great war he was convinced whoeverd let out that first cry was dead rightor with better luck still alive and right this had to be it if the damnyankees werent coming over the ohio right here this was the biggest bluff in the history of the world more confederate guns boomed but the noise they made seemed almost lost in the thunder of the yankee barrage officers and sergeants shouted for men to move now here now there dover wouldnt have left his hole for all the money in the world or for all the love in it moving about up there was asking to be obliterated overhead us airplanes droned south dover swore as he listened to them the yankees werent just going after frontline cs troops they were trying to tear up roads and railroads too the better the job they did the more trouble the confederacy would have bringing up men and materiel to beat them back and the better the job they did the more trouble jerry dover would be in not only from the us soldiers but also from his own superiors they wouldnt believe any disaster that befell the csa was their fault god forbid easier to blame the major who used to manage a restaurant a fourengine bomber fell out of the sky its right wing a sheet of flame it smashed down less than a quarter of a mile from where dover huddled its whole bomb load went off at once the ground shook under him blast slammed him into the side of the trench he tasted blood again it was his own this time corpsman medic the shouts rose again and again from all directions god help these poor bastards dover thought riflemen and machine gunnersmostlyturned their weapons away from the soldiers who wore red crosses shells and bombs didnt give a damn after four and a half hours that seemed like four and a half years dover kept checking his watch every three months and being amazed only fifteen minutes had gone by the gunfire let up he waited for shouts of here they come he was surprised he hadnt already heard those shouts the damnyankees could have carved out a formidable bridgehead under cover of that barrage then just when he started to wonder if it was a bluff after all more shells came in these close by the river smoke again the shout came from everywhere at once us light airplanes buzzed along the southern bank of the ohio spraying more smoke behind them they got away with it too they made perfect targets but the confederates near covington were simply too battered and rattled to shoot back slowly slowly the smoke screen cleared jerry dover started to look up but the rattle of machinegun fire made him duck back into the trench again those small airplanes came back and sprayed more smoke the sound of machine guns and rifles roared from it reinforcements someone bawled we got to get us reinforcements before they break out and go hog wild fuck me that shout of despair came from close by dover theyve got barrels over the river dover looked up sure as hell through the smoke that now thinned again he spied several squat monstrous shapes the growl of their engines added more noise to the racketing gunfire a confederate shell burst in front of a barreland it ceased to be it didnt brew up it didnt catch fire itvanished its a goddamn balloon dover exclaimed there were no real barrels close byonly more balloons the noise of engines and gunfire came from phonograph records and loudspeakers whoeverd planted them had disappeared the biggest bluff in the history of the world jerry dover thought again and it had worked it froze the confederates by covington nowwhere was the real blow landing irving morrell was wary of repeating himself irving morrell was wary of repeating himself the armor commander shook his head wondering if he was going out of his tree he wanted to drive jake featherston out of his instead crossing a river the size of the ohio wasnt easy when george custer did it in the great war he paid a heavy priceand he went on paying a heavy price while his troops ground their way southward a few hundred yards at a time back in morrell got men over the cumberland east of nashville much more quickly much more neatly but he had to figure the confederates now knew all about what he did then and how he did it they were bastards but they werent dopes if he tried the same thing twice they would hand him his head and he would deserve it and so in football terms he was doing his best to fake them out of their jocks he laid on ferocious barrages in front of covington and louisville and one on an open stretch of river between the two kentucky towns he used all the sneaky ingenuity the army could come up withand some straight out of hollywood too inflatable rubber barrels and soundeffects records kept the confederates guessing a crucial extra little while so did shells that gurgled as they flew through the air but didnt hold any gas a sensible man would figure no one wasted gas shells on a bluff and a sensible man would be right morrell saved the real ones for the genuine assault the state of the art of crossing rivers in the face of enemy fire had improved since you didnt have to throw pontoon bridges across or send men over in wallowing barges armored landing craft delivered soldiers barrels and artillery in a hurry only a direct hit from a or a bigger cannon yet could make them say uncle once the soldiers carved out a lodgement then bridges could span the river no the tricky part wasnt the crossing itself the tricky part was moving men and materiel into southern indiana without letting the bastards in butternut know what was going on lots of trucks made lots of trips carrying nothing to fool featherstons fuckers into thinking the real blow would fall farther east lots of others carried men who promptly reboarded them under cover of darkness more inflatable barrels and wooden artillery pieces left the impression of buildups where there were none so did acres of tents just out of range of cs artillery now morrell had to hope all his deceptions were deceptive enough his security tight enough that the confederates had spies on the northern bank of the ohio went without saying that us intelligence hadnt rooted out all of them was also a given how much they reported how much they were believedthose were the questions only battle would answer so far everything looked good the us concentration lay between two tiny indiana riverside towns with odd names magnet and derby magnet hadnt attracted any particular confederate attention that made morrell want to tip his derby to the men under him whod made the crossing work he wanted to but he didnthe wasnt wearing a derby he was wearing a helmet with two stars painted on the front on a parade helmet the stars would have been gold so they stood out morrell didnt want them to stand out one sniper had already hit him he wasnt anxious to make himself a target for another one his rank emblems were dull brown and invisible from more than a few feet away his own headquarters were in derby the more southerly of the two towns people there talked with a twang that reminded him of the wrong side of the border intelligence assured him they were no more disloyal than anybody else he hoped intelligence knew what it was talking about but his hackles rose whenever he listened to any of the locals through field glasses he watched artillery and dive bombers pound northern kentucky the confederates were trying to hit back but they seemed a little punchdrunk a little slow the corners of morrells mouth turned down two years earlier he and abner dowling were a beat late when they tried to meet the cs thrust into ohio about time the other side found out what that felt like a soldier from the wireless shack came up to him and saluted weve reached objective a sir he reported morrell looked at his watch two in the afternoon a few minutes past almost an hour ahead of schedule he said theyd driven the confederates out of rifle and machinegun range of the ohio pushed them back more than a mile jake featherstons men wouldnt have an easy time driving the invaders into the river now and morrell had another reason to beam with objective a taken i can cross myself yes sir the noncom said morrell had strict orders from philadelphia to stay north of the ohio till the confederates were cleared from the riverside he obeyed orders like that only when he felt like it here reluctantly he saw they made good sense general parsons he shouted now his secondincommand came running yes sir brigadier general harlan parsons was short and square and tough he didnt have much imagination but he didnt have much give either as of now youre in command morrell said keep em crossing the river keep em moving forward when i get south of the ohio ill take over again my barrels got enough wireless circuits to do the broadcasting for new york city he exaggerated but not by much parsons saluted again ill handle it sir he said and morrell had no doubt he would ill see you when we get to objective b right morrell said they would have to drive the confederates out of artillery range of the ohiosay ten or twelve miles backto meet their second objective if everything went according to plan that would take another two days but who could say what the plan had to do with reality you went out there and you saw what happened morrell hurried toward his fancy barrel with the eagerness of a lover going to his beloved the rest of the crew stood around the machine waiting as soon as the four enlisted men saw him they scrambled into the machine the engine roared to life even as he was slipping down through the hatch atop the cupola and into the turret take us onto the landing craft he called to the driver as soon as his mouth reached the intercom mike yes sir the barrel rumbled forward first on the soft riverside earth and then on the steel ramp that led up into the ungainly slabsided rivercrossing contraption sailorsthey wore navy blue not army greengrayraised the ramp it clanged into place hard enough to make the barrel shake for a moment a series of clangs meant the ramp was stowed and now had become the boats stern or rear end or whatever the hell you called it the boats engine started up the vibration made morrells back teeth ache well a dentist could wait the landing craft was as graceful as a fat man waddling along with an anvil but a fat man lugging an anvil would sink like a stone if he went into the water the landing craft didnt god and the engineers who designed it no doubt knew why it didnt irving morrell had no idea he took the notion on faith somehow believing in the landing craft was easier than his sundayschool lessons had been crossing the ohio took about fifteen minutes a few confederate shells splashed into the river not far away fragments clanged off the landing crafts sides nothing got through up front the barrel driver said thank you jesus he still believed in what hed learned in sunday school then with a jolt that clicked morrells teeth together the barrel wallowed up onto dry land again the ramp thudded down morrell hadnt felt the boat turn in the water but it faced away from the ohio the barrel went into reverse and left its steel nest morrell felt like cheering when the tracks bit into soft ground here he was on confederate soil at last after spending most of the two years trying to defend his own country forward he told the driver toward the fighting then he played with the dials on the big bulky wireless set that cramped the turret nest this is robin he said wondering whod picked such idiotic code names nest this is robin do you read read you five by five robin the answer resounded in his earphones he was back in touch back in command after fifteen or twenty minutes of gloryand responsibilityharlan parsons could go back to being number two what is the situation morrell asked any changes negative sir the wireless man replied everythings on schedule or maybe a little ahead of schedule sounds good to me morrell said before the nest could answer a noise like a giant frying bacon filled his earphones swearing he yanked them off his head the confederates were starting to jam signals that was a sign they were getting their wits about them and seriously starting to fight back morrell swore some more he would have liked the enemy to stay stunned a while longer you didnt always get everything you wanted as long as the usa had enough the barrel jounced past the burning ruin of a cs machine four soldiers in bloodsoaked butternut coverallsthe barrel crewsprawled close by in death maybe the fifth man got away or maybe he never got out and was nothing but charred meat inside the barrel morrell rode toward the front standing up in the turret head and shoulders out of the cupola he wanted to see what was going on enemy fire was light machine guns and other small arms farther forward chattered every confederate foot soldier carried either an automatic rifle or a submachine gun the bastards in butternut had plenty of firepower did they have enough big guns enough barrels enough airplanes enough men morrell and the united states were betting they didnt a salvo of those newfangled rockets screamed in from the south morrell just had time to duck down into the turret and slam the cupola hatch shut before the rockets burst blast rocked the barrel it could flip even one of these heavy machines right over it could but it didnt this time fragments clanged off armor son of a bitch frenchy bergeron said those fuckers are no fun at all right the first time morrell told the gunner yes the confederates were fighting back no reason to expect they wouldnt no matter how much morrell would have liked it if they rolled over onto their backs like whipped dogs another salvo of rockets came down this one a little farther away god help the poor infantry bergeron remarked morrell nodded for plastering a wide area with firepower those rockets were worldbeaters bergeron went on how many of them have they got anyway good question morrell said best answer ive got is not enough to stop us he hoped he was telling the truth somewhere in alabama or texas or georgia the csa had factories working overtime to turn out the rockets and their launchers though the latter were simplicity itself just iron tubing and sheet metal but the more rockets the confederates made the less of something else they turned out bullets automatic rifles barrel tracks canned corn somethingthat was for sure keep the pressure on them and they couldnt make enough of everything they needed and keep an army in the field at the same time not when they were fighting a country more than twice their size things had worked that way in the great war anyhow the united states ought to have a bigger edge this time because the confederates were persecuting their negroes instead of using them but industrialized agriculture and factory efficiency were both a lot further along than they were a generation earlier farms and factories kept fewer men away from the field than they had the bow machine gun on morrells barrel fired a quick burst scratch one the gunner said a confederate who did make it to the battlefield wouldnt go home again morrell nodded to himself nowhow many more would it take before jake featherston said uncle cincinnatus driver sat in a tent north of cincinnati hoping the other shoe would drop here us forces were already over the river farther west driving from indiana into western kentucky meanwhile cincinnatus shoved money into the pot see you an raise you a dollar he said he was holding three jacks so he thought his chances were pretty good one of the other truck drivers still in the hand dropped out the last driver raised a dollar himself cincinnatus eyed him hed drawn two if hed filled a straight or a flush hed done it by accident odds against that were pretty steep cincinnatus bumped it up another dollar now the other mana whiteeyed him he tossed in one more dollar of his own call he said three jacks cincinnatus showed them the other driver sworehe had three eights cincinnatus scooped up the pot the other driver still muttering darkly grabbed the cards and shuffled them for the next hand hed just started to deal when artillery a lot of artillery roared not far away all the men in the card game cocked their heads to one side listening ours one of them said the rest nodded cincinnatus included dont sound like theyre dicking around said the fellow whod held three eights he was a wiry little guy named izzy saperstein he had a beard so thick he shaved twice a day and the most hair in his nose and ears cincinnatus had ever seen put on a bigger barrage earlier another driver said made the bastards in butternut keep their heads down and made sure they wouldnt move soldiers west chances are this is more of the same maybe saperstein scratched his ear with that tuft sprouting from it he likely itched all the time cincinnatus wondered if he couldnt cut the hair or pluck it or something it was just this side of disgusting they played for another couple of hours while the guns boomed and bellowed none of them got excited about that theyd all heard plenty of gunfire before as long as nothing was coming down on their heads they didnt flabble cincinnatus won a little lost a little won a little more he was up about fifteen bucks when a us captain stuck his head into the tent go to your trucks now men he said head for the depot and load up weve crossed the ohio and our boysll need everything we can bring em crossed the ohio here izzy saperstein sounded amazed cincinnatus was surprised too he hadnt really believed the usa would try to force a crossing here he didnt know many people who had either if folks on this side were caught by surprise maybe the confederates would be too we fighting in covington sir he asked i was born there i know my way around good i can lead and show folks the way thanks driver but no the captain answered were going to skirt the town pen up the enemy garrison inside and clean it out at our leisure now get moving only one possible answer to that cincinnatus gave it yes sir along with the other men he headed for his truck as fast as he could go a selfstarter was so handy a touch of a button and the motor came to life he remembered cranking trucks in the great war that was even more fun in the rainand if your hand slipped the crank would spin backwards and maybe break your arm he didnt have to worry about that now noall he needed to worry about was getting shot or incinerated or blown skyhigh happy day he thought soldiers with dollies filled the back of the truck with crates of god knew what ammunition he guessed by the way the truck settled on its springs go get em pop one of the young white men yelled to him cincinnatus grinned and waved he was plenty old enough to be that kids father and pop didnt burn his ears the way uncle would have the soldier would have said the same thing to a white man cincinnatus age in the csa uncle was what whites called a negro too old to get stuck with boy the truck convoy rumbled south toward the river with so much weight in the rear cincinnatus deuceandahalf rode a lot smoother than it did empty he drove past gun pits where gun bunnies stripped to the waist worked like men possessed to throw more shells at the confederates some of the us soldiers were already lobsterred from too much sun cincinnatus glanced at his own brown arm there werent many things white men had to worry about that he didnt but sunburn was one of them every so often incoming shells burst think what you would about the men who followed jake featherston but they had no quit in them wherever they could hit back they did this way this way a sergeant with wigwag flags directed the trucks toward slabsided boats plainly made to cross rivers no matter what the unpleasant people on the other bank had to say about it cincinnatus rolled into one all the way forward a sailor told him we hold two trucks by god cincinnatus rolled up till his front bumper kissed the landing crafts rear wall the sailor rewarded him with a circle from his thumb and forefinger cincinnatus waved and nodded as he had with the young soldier who loaded the truck he knew how the man in blue meant the gesture whether the sailor did or not though cincinnatus also happened to know that to germans many of whom had crossed from cincinnati to covington in the easygoing days before the great war a very similar hand sign meant you were an asshole another truck followed his into the ungainly boat it didnt quite have to bump his machine to let the boats crew raise the ramp and dog it shut do i leave my motor on cincinnatus called to the closest sailor bet your butt buddy the man answered youre gonna wanna hit the ground running right cincinnatus didnt say no he wished he were someplace where the confederates couldnt shoot at him or shell him or drop bombs on his head why didnt you stay in des moines then he asked himself a littleno muchtoo late to worry about that now and he knew why he didnt stay there he owed the csa too much but understanding that and liking it when he headed into danger were two different things on land the landing craft ran well enough to get down into the river on the ohio it ran well enough to cross on the other side it got up onto the bank it didnt do any of those things very well that it could do all of them even if badly made it a valuable machine the wall against which cincinnatus truck nestled also proved to be a ramp it thudded down he put the truck in gear and rolled off the other truck in the landing craft followed him a corporal pointed at him and then at some other trucks follow them the man yelled cincinnatus nodded to show he understood he wasnt sure those other trucks came from his unit that wasnt his worry not right now somebodyd told him what to do he just had to do it he began to wonder if theyd caught the confederates flatfooted there wasnt a lot of incoming enemy fire he didnt miss it and he hoped that what there was kept missing him whenever he could he glanced east toward covington he could seeexactly nothing he hoped the police and freedom party stalwarts and guards hadnt shipped all the negroes in town off to camps farther south he hoped lucullus wood and the other black reds were finding ways to give the confederates a hard time even from behind barbed wire all he could do was hope he couldnt know the convoy stopped by a battery of s soldiers swarmed aboard his truck and unloaded it with locustlike intensity he waited to see if they would start swearing the way they might if say he carried crates full of machinegun belts when they didnt he decided the corporal had sent him to the right place after all where do i go now he asked when the truck was empty back across the river to load up again no by god a us soldier pointed south and west we just took a confederate supply depot i mean to tell you the guy who was running it mustve been a fucking genius everything from pencils to pecans to power tools ammunition out the ass too that dont do us much good cincinnatus said they dont use the same calibers as we do yeah but we got a lotta guys carrying their automatic rifles damn things are great long as you can keep em in bullets the soldier said we got enough of their ammo at this here dump to keep a lot of our guys going for a long time cincinnatus liked the way that sounded when he got to the depot he decided the soldier whod sent him there was right the quartermaster whod set it up was a genius if he was still alive he was bound to be gnashing his teeth that everything hed labored to gather now lay in us hands the confederates hadnt even got the chance to blow up the ammunition this time cincinnatus could see what went into the back of his truck rations canned the crates said no doubt us authorities would use them to feed soldiers in greengray and no doubt the soldiers in greengray would grumble when they got them us canned goods were better than their cs equivalents but confederate rations were ever so much better than no rations at all confederate prisoners marched glumly up the road toward the ohio the us troops in greengray who herded them along got them off the highway and onto the shoulder to keep them from slowing down the southbound trucks some of the men in butternut stared at cincinnatus dark face in the cab of his truck he sent them a cheery wave and went on driving so they didnt think negroes were good for anything did they well he hoped he gave them a surprise the us soldiers who unloaded the truck didnt seem so happy weve got our own canned goods dammit one of them said we dont want this confederate shit his pals nodded dont blame me friends cincinnatus said i just brung what they told me to bring why didnt they tell you to bring us a shitload of confederate cigarettes the soldier said that woulda been worth somethin fuck it said another young man in greengray were heading down into tobacco country well get our own smokes before long yeah two or three us soldiers liked the sound of that so did cincinnatus for different reasons they werent more than ten or twelve miles south of covington but they thought they could go a lot farther hed seen that arrogance in confederate soldiers before but rarely in their us counterparts if they thought going into a fight that they could lick the enemy that made them more likely to be right general morrell he knows what the hell hes doing the first soldier said again he got nothing but agreement from his buddies again cincinnatus wondered if he was hearing straight us soldiers usually thought of their generals as bungling idiotsand usually had good solid reasons for thinking of them that way up ahead confederate guns boomed a few shells came down not too far away the soldiers laughed if thats the best those bastards can do they wont even slow us down one of them said they pulled this shit on us two years ago another one added hell i was in ohio then they caught me but i slipped off before they took me very far we didnt know how to stop em and you know what i bet they dont know how to stop us either no sooner had he spoken than several rocket salvos screamed down out of the sky they didnt land on the trucks but half a mile or so to the east where the artillery hadnt they sobered the us soldiers well maybe it wont be quite so easy the first one said but i bet we can do it lieutenant michael pound thought he was getting the hang of commanding four other barrels instead of doing the gunning for one he hoped he was anyhow none of the other barrel commanders in the platoon was complaining theyd plunged deep into kentucky and all five machines were still intact he studied the map the next town ahead on the north bank of the green river was called calhoun the hamlet on the south side of the river rumsey was even smaller they probably didnt have a thousand people put together john calhoun pound remembered was a southern politician before the war of secessionand therefore a son of a bitch by definition a town named after him deserved whatever happened to it pound didnt know who rumsey was nobody good probably calhoun and rumsey together wouldnt have mattered if not for the bridge between them the james bethel gresham memorial bridge the map called it and noted that it was named for a kentuckian who was one of the first confederate soldiers to die in the great war he had it coming pound thought unkindly he eyed the bridge from the edge of the woods that encroached on calhoun from the north binoculars made it seem to leap almost to within arms length some confederate soldiers milled around in calhoun but not many and they didnt seem very well organized as usual pound didnt need long to make up his mind he got on the allplatoon circuit of his wireless men we are going to take that bridge away from the enemy how sir that was sergeant frank blakey the next most senior barrel commander wont they just blow it when they see us coming sureif they recognize us pound answered but if they dont he explained what he had in mind when he finished sergeant blakey whistled youve got the balls of a burglar sir if we try it though we just have to hope you dont get em draped over a doorknob if you think it wont work sing out pound said i spent years telling officers they were a bunch of damn foolsand they mostly were too my ears wont fall off if you tell me the same thing despite reassurances none of the noncoms under him spoke up right away at last blakey said i think weve got a chance sir like you say they sure as hell wont be expecting it he laughed i wouldntyou better believe that lets go then when an idea struck pound it struck hard this one was no exception he threw open the cupola lid and climbed out of the barrel come on he called to his gunner and loader times awasting they descended from the machine too they both looked faintly dubious or more than faintly but they went along crewmen also got out of the other four barrels like michael pound and his men they started cutting down bushes and leafy branches and tying them to the decking and turrets of their machines breaking up their silhouettes and hiding a lot of the greengray paint that covered them an infantry lieutenant came up to pound what the hell are you guys doing he asked playing queen of the may i hope not pound pointed to the span between calhoun and rumsey i aim to take that bridge ill probably need your help to do it he told the other officerwho was at least twenty years younger than he washis plan you got your nerve dont you the infantry lieutenant echoed sergeant blakey but he nodded yeah we can do that keep quiet till you make it onto the bridge or you get in trouble then open up with everything we got he had a toughguy bigcity accentpound guessed he was from chicago he added you know thats liable to be kinda too late dont you chance you take pounds broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug if we go down well go down swinging hope you dont well back your play the other lieutenant stuck out his hand luck he didnt say youll need it but it was written all over his face pound shook hands with him anyway thanks if this does work come on down once were where we need to be and help us take charge of things right the infantry lieutenant said fat chance his face declared when the barrels were camouflaged to pounds satisfaction he led the parade down into calhoun the other four machines stayed buttoned up he couldnt stand that he wanted to see everything that was going onand he thought he might need to talk his way past some of the men in butternut along state highway they rumbled past seventh sixth fifth fourth calhoun didnt seem to have any street with a number bigger than seventh they got down to mayberry four blocks past the county seat and only a block away from the river before anybody thought to challenge them a confederate sergeant stepped out into the narrow road and called what do yall reckon youre doin securing the bridge of course as usual michael pound acted as if he had not a doubt in the world frowning the sergeant hefted his automatic rifle the barrels bow machine gun could cut him in half before he started shootingpound hoped you talk funny the noncom said where you from new orleans pound answered the crescent citys halfsouthern halfbrooklyn speech pattern was different from anything else in the csa his own accent was much closer to canadian than anything else hed grown up not far from the border it didnt sound much like that of a native louisianan but if this confederate wasnt expecting anybody from the usa and he wasnt he stepped aside saying wish to god somebody woulda told us we were getting barrels sent in life is full of surprises pound thought but he didnt say anything out loudthe less he opened his mouth where confederates could hear the better the barrel turned right on first and rumbled west toward the bridge to rumsey the bridge was about a quarter of a mile away pounds machine had covered a little more than half the distance when somebody shouted holy jesus theyre yankees shit pound said without originality but with great sincerity a burst of submachinegun fire clanged off the side of the barrel he dove down into the turret gun it for the bridge he yelled to the driver to the bow gunner he added shoot anybody who gets in our way or tries to blow the bridge yes sir both men answered the barrels engine went from rumble to roar the ponderous machine couldnt leap but it could scoot pretty fast it couldand it did what if they can blow the damn thing from the rumsey side sir the gunner asked theres a technical term for that sergeant pound answered in that case were screwed he startled a laugh out of mel scullard a moment later he added once were on the bridge i want you to make sure nothing alive has the chance to come up from rumsey and blow it can you do that for me yes sir scullard said which was the right answer he gave the loader a oneword order canister canister private joe mouradian echoed the shell went into the breech barrels carried only three or four rounds of canister in their racks because they needed it so seldom when they did need it though they were liable to need it bad it turned the main armament into an enormous shotgun anybody who came within a hundred yards or so was asking to get blown to bits the driver turned left onto the bridge so sharply pound thanked the god in whom he only sporadically believed for not letting the barrel throw a track one of the machines behind him fired a round from its main armament he couldnt see what it was shooting athe had his eyes on the forwardfacing periscopes that showed the far end of the bridge and the village of rumsey beyond stop just at the end of the bridge he told the driver at the end of the bridgeyes sir no sooner had the driver stopped than soldiers in butternut started running toward the barrel the bow machine gun chattered the confederate soldiers went down some dead or wounded others diving for cover civilians appeared in the streets too but they were running for cover after the first impromptu charge from rumsey failed the confederates paused to put together a proper attack whoever led it was plenty smart he had plenty of people with automatic rifles and submachine guns going forward in front of the men with featherston fizzes and the confederates newfangled antibarrel rockets if the troops making the racket with the small arms could distract the barrel crew but the confederate commander reckoned without canister pound waited till the closest enemy soldiers were very close indeed before he shouted fire even he was awed by the carnage a inch canister shell could cause men and pieces of men lay and writhed broken in front of the barrel several dropped featherston fizzes added flames to the horror shall i give em another round sir scullard asked by all means pound answered the second round of canister when added to the steady rattle of death from the bow machine gun convinced the handful of confederates still on their feet to get away if they could give me one more round the gunner told the loader hold up on that pound overrode him use he instead and start knocking down the houses closest to us i dont want one of those bastards with a rocket to be able to get off an easy shot at us ill do it sir scullard said and he did with the peculiar gusto a man has when destroying property that belongs to the other side a secondary explosion from inside one of those houses in rumsey made pound think hed barely beaten the confederates to the punch if that wasnt a rocket blowing up what was it sergeant blakeys barrel came up alongside pounds the other three in the platoon held the north end of the bridge against the confederates in calhoun their cannon and machine guns thundered and barked pound hoped the us foot soldiers in the woods north of calhoun were pressing down into the town squeezed between them and the barrels on the bridge what could featherstons men do but get out the confederates inside rumsey had an antibarrel cannon an inchandahalfer from the days when the war first started it had two virtuesit was easy to haul around and it fired rapidly against one of the new us barrels though it was hardly more than a doorknocker its shells had no hope of penetrating that thick wellsloped armor there it is sir scullard said in the bushes by that big house youre right pound said do the honors then yes sir the gunner said and then to the loader he two shells sufficed to upend the gun and send a couple of the men who served it flying pound nodded to himself in somber satisfaction if the other side wanted to play the game but didnt have good cardswell too bad for them he looked through the periscopes facing back toward calhoun alarm tingled through him soldiers were on the bridge could he traverse the turret fast enough to fire at them before they reached the barrel but then he relaxedthey wore greengray not butternut we have calhoun he said happily and we have the bridgeintact by god we can keep rolling right on through kentucky lets see featherston stop us lets see anybody stop us ix in the reinforcedconcrete shelter under the ruins of the gray house jake featherston fumed he had the feeling of being a bug pinned down on a collectors board wiggle as he would the pin held him helplessly in place hed had that feeling in the last war when us artillery and barrels inexorably pushed the army of northern virginia back from pennsylvania through maryland and into the state for which it was named hed sworn he would never feel that way again hed sworn the confederate states would never let anybody on earth do that to them again for two years near enough his barrels and dive bombers made good on the boast now now the damnyankees had barrels and dive bombers too their machines were just as good as the csas from the dismayed reports from the field their latest barrels were better than anything the confederates had and the united states had swarms of barrels and cannon and airplanes and men while the confederates hadwhat was left from the adventures of the past two years lulu stuck her head into the office mr president general forrest is here to see you thanks featherston said please send him in he could order negroes sent to camps by the tens of thousands by the hundreds of thousands without batting an eye but he was always polite to his secretary nathan bedford forrest iii came in and gave him a perfunctory salute mr president he said and then plainly with an effort freedom freedom jake echoed the party slogan never felt stale to him he waved the head of the general staff to a chair seeing how haggard forrest looked he took out the bottle of whiskey that lived in his desk drawer need a snort dont mind if i do sir forrest poured himself a healthy shot mud in your eye he knocked it back jake featherston also drank forrest eyed him that was good but i dont reckon i can drink enough to make me forget how much trouble were in youre the fellow whos supposed to get us out of trouble like that jake said with whatsir forrest asked talk about making bricks without strawi feel like im trying to make bricks without mud out there how can i stop the damnyankees when theyre throwing everything but the kitchen sink at me and i dont even have the goddamn sink it cant be that bad featherston said no sir its worse nathan bedford forrest iii said welost a lot of men and we lost a lot of materiel in pittsburgh and falling back afterwards the yankees must have lost a lot too featherston eyed the whiskey bottle he still drank but he couldnt remember the last time he really drank getting plowed forgetting all this crap was an enormous temptation but the crap wouldnt go away and it would get worse while he wasnt looking at it and so regretfully he looked but he didnt grab the bottle again they did sir no doubt about it the chief of the general staff said earnestly hes getting ready to call me a damn fool featherston thought hell be polite about it but hell do it just the same and sure as hell forrest went on but theyve got more men and more factories than we do they can build up faster than we can and they can go on building up to a levelwe have trouble matching a level we cant matchthats what he almost said theyve got more men we cant do much about that jake said but weve got better men by god and weve got better weapons the automatic rifles and now the rockets all thats true sir and its why things arent worse forrest said but our artillerys no better than theirs and theyve got more our airplanes arent better and theyve got more thats really starting to hurt and when it comes to barrelssir when it comes to barrels theyve got a step up on us thats starting to hurt bad too goddammit why cant we keep up jake featherston snarled we were ahead when the war started we dont have enough engineers sir we dont have enough factory hands forrest said damn near every healthy white man in the country from eighteen to fiftys in uniform women are taking up some of the slack in the factoriesmore every day in fact forrest was angry hed taken too long to see how important that was he didnt like giving women such jobs in the long run it would twist the csa out of the shape he wanted the country to have but if you got smashed in the short run the long run didnt matter so women went to work in war plants and hed worry about what it all meant laterif there was a later we still need more bodies in there sir forrest took a deep breath if there was any way we could get more use out of our niggers no featherston said in a low deadly voice the niggers are party business theyre my business dont you go sticking your nose in where it doesnt belong we are gonna come out of this war niggerfree niggerfree you hear me mr president how much do we have to pay to make that happen forrest asked we needed most of a division to clean richmond outa division we couldnt use against the damnyankees if that happens too many more times itll put us in a world of trouble im sorry i have to tell you such things sir but somebody needs to he had nerve not many people who came before jake featherston told him anything but what they thought he wanted to hear clarence potter did but potter had almost official gadfly status even ferd koenig hesitated forrest might be hesitant but he was saying what he thought the worst is over jake said most towns are cleaned out that still left the black belt from rural south carolina through louisiana largely unaffected but he wasnt about to split hairs with nathan bedford forrest iii besides he had mexican soldiers dealing with the coons there he didnt need to pull so many of his own men away from more urgentnot more important but more urgentthings i hope youre right sir the chief of the general staff said i hope so but i havent convinced that man jake thought he changed the subject from his own shortcomings to those of the army weve got to stop the yankees theyre carving their way through kentucky like we did through ohio thats what im trying to tell you mr president forrest said were using every man and every piece of machinery we can get our hands on we cant get our hands on enough men or machines if you stop retreating if you start hitting back sir thats not fair to the men fighting and dying in kentucky you can hang me out to dry if you wantill be your scapegoat but theyre doing everything flesh and blood can do theyre making stands every chance they get and theyre counterattacking every chance they get too wed be in worse shape if they werent and you can take that to the bank his passion startled featherston the president of the csa would have thrown him to the wolves without a qualmif hed had someone in mind to replace him but the only officer who came to mind for the job was george patton and patton was too valuable in the field to bring him back to richmond so instead of canning nathan bedford forrest iii featherston said lets take a look at the map of course sir did forrest sound relieved if he didnt he damn well should have but the map mattered jake featherston slashed a line across it with his forefingeralmost exactly the line irving morrell had slashed across a map of the csa in philadelphia some months earlier whatever featherstons flaws he had a gift for seeing the big picture this is what the sons of bitches aim to do to us nathan bedford forrest iii blinked he worried about trees he hadnt looked at the forest as a whole for a while you dont think small sir he said after a moments pause for thought neither do the damnyankees jake answered without the least hesitation the truth burned hot and clear in his mind lies burned just as hot and clear which helped make him as effective as he was but this was no lie he wasnt trying to fool either himself or the chief of the general staff the damnyankees hurt us bad the last goround but that was all they didthey hurt us with barrels that really haul ass with airplanes that really bomb theyll fucking kill us this time and thats how theyll do itchattanooga atlanta the ocean forrest eyed the map as if a rattlesnake had crawled out from behind it he licked his lips they cant do that he blurted they can unless we stop em jake answered how do you aim to losing atlantad be bad enough all the oil from louisiana and texas comes east through there atlanta goes down the toilet everything north and east of it stops running we are screwed blued and tattooed they cant possibly do all that this year forrest said jake would have liked the assessment much better without the qualifierand if it didnt so closely match his own he asked how much more can we pull out of virginia to send west if we pull more out the united states will just waltz into richmond you know forrest said im not sure we can stop them if they push hard now if we have to we can keep fighting without this town right jake knew losing the capital of the csa would hurt it would be a psychological blow that would start people plotting against himif they werent already plotting against him which they probably were and richmond wasnt just the capital it was one of the most important industrial towns in the csa right up there with birmingham and atlanta and dallas butif it comes down to choosing between richmond and atlanta we have to hold on to atlanta because so many other things depend on it if the damnyankees take this place away from us they cant go much farther is that right or do you see it different he meant the question forrest was welcome to make him change his mindif he could but the chief of the general staff kept eyeing the map and the slash jake had cut across it im afraid it is right forrest sounded unhappy about it which convinced jake he was telling the truth and if he was and if jake had things straight the answer seemed plain we have to stop the usa as far this side of atlanta as we can stop the damnyankees then drive em back they did it to us lets see how they like getting hoist with their own waddayacallit petard forrest said automatically i hope we can do it sir the one big difference between us and the united states is that they have more margin for error than we do they fell all over themselves in the ohio campaign but we did everything we could do to get as far as we did if things dont go just right for us yes yes jake featherston had heard that too many times one reason hed heard it so often was that it was true he didnt want to think about that and no one in the csa could tell him he had to he said well just have to make things go worse for the damnyankees thats all stir up the canucks wherever we can try and talk quebec into pulling its soldiers out of the rest of canada so the united states have to send more men in see if we can fire up the mormons one more time will it be enough forrest asked of course it will jake said its got to be he also didnt want to think about what would happen if it wasnt and no one in the csa could tell him he had to do that either for a long time camp determination had bustled load after load of negroes came into the place load after load of corpses went out it was in a way a factory with death as its chief product and it ran very efficiently troop leader hipolito rodriguez longed for the old days so did all the other guards up to jeff pinkard himself the only people who liked the way things were now were the negroes still inside the camp and their opinions didnt count fewer and fewer negroes were left thanks to the damnyankees air raids trains had a hard time getting to snyder texas and the camp just beyond it the bathhouses that werent bathhouses and the asphyxiating trucks went right on working emptying barracks one by one blacks went to their deaths without too much fuss the story now was that they were being moved for their own protection they knew how many bombs fell on snyder they didnt know bombs wouldnt fall on them and so they walked into the bathhouses and climbed onto the trucksand they never worried about anything else after that all of a sudden camp determination had more guards than it needed rodriguez and the other men from the confederate veterans brigades didnt worry about going anywhere else they were useless at the front the tough females who did most of the guarding on the womens side didnt need to fear trading their gray uniforms for butternut either but the young men the freedom party guards shows what kind of people the damnyankees are one of them said at supper after another day when no trains came in theyd sooner help niggers and blow decent white folks to hell and gone rodriguez gnawed on a barbecued pork rib as far as he was concerned texans only thought they knew how to barbecue down in sonora now they did things right he found himself nodding to the young guard though he was neither black nor white himself another youngster said how long till there arent any niggers left here at all they arent shipping so many spooks out this way i hear said the guard whod spoken first more and more are going to camps farther east where the us bombers cant hit the train tracks so hard thats not good the second guard said camp determination was made to be the biggest and the best country cant do a proper job of reducing population if this here camp isnt doing its bit they didnt think about no yankees when they made it rodriguez put in youre right troop leader the first young guard said without three stripes on his sleeve rodriguez would have been just another damn greaser to him with them the sonoran was a superior party discipline ran deep weve got to do something the second guard added weve got to push the united states back into new mexico go aheadvolunteer rodriguez thought guards outfits were fighting alongside cs army troops northwest of the camp even if he were hale he wouldnt have volunteered himself hed seen too much infantry combat in west texas in the last war he didnt want or need any more maybe if we sneak in the spooks at night another guard said got to have lights to move em from the railhead into the camp troop leader tom porter said the veteran was an outstanding noncom rodriguez tried to model himself after him porter went on can you imagine what would happen if we lit this place up like a christmas tree damnyankeesd be on it like ants on potato salad at a picnic theyll blow up the niggers if they do that one of the young guards said they could hit this place any time they please they dont do it on account of they love coons so goddamn much porter frowned maybe youre right maybe but if they figure out they can take out a whole bunch of guards all at once they might reckon its worthwhile i mean its not like we wont reduce the niggers population anyway the young guard grunted so did rodriguez that sounded as if it made good military sense why dont they just bomb the camp anyhow then though the youngster said theyd just be blowing up the smokes a little bit before we take care of them well youre right porter said bleakly which wasnt what the young guard expected to hear thats why weve got shelters in this place now if they want to blast the living shit out of us they canno two ways about it what about the antiaircraft guns around the camp two or three guards asked the question in almost identical words what about em porter said antiaircraft guns dont mean you cant bomb a place if you want to bad enough they just mean it costs more if youre willing to pay you can do it you bet your ass you can you reckon they dont have antiaircraft guns all over richmond and philadelphia you reckon those places dont get bombed ha nobody said anything for a while after that hipolito rodriguez found himself looking at the ceiling as if to see bombers overhead he would have been embarrassed if he were the only one doing it but he wasntnowhere close he almost panicked when droning airplane engines woke him later that night he was ready to run for the shelter not that his middleaged almostelectrocuted body could run very fast but the enemy airplanes went on to the east whatever they were after it wasnt camp determination or snyder two days later jefferson pinkard sent another contingent of female guards packing the men who had to go over to the womens side to take their shift didnt know exactly why the guards left all their guesses were lewd though it wasnt as if pinkard minded brutality as long as it stopped short of the point where prisoners rebelled rodriguez wondered if he would find bathsheba and antoinette alive to his surprise he did theyd lasted longer than most camp inmates both of them were dreadfully thin now the older woman coughed all the time but they greeted him with smiles its the nice sergeant bathsheba said how is that xerxes how is our man dead rotting in a trench a bulldozer scraped in the ground piled in with god knows how many other bodies he couldnt tell them that he didnt have the heart hed led so many men to their deathwhat was telling the truth about one of them next to that nothing logically but logical didnt seem to have much to do with it and so he lied he is good he is about like you he says hello he says he loves you both he says he misses your son he remembered bathsheba had one and that the boy or young man didnt come to the camp i misses cassius too the older woman said and antoinette nodded bathsheba went on i hope hes all right wherever he was if he wasnt in a camp he was better off than the rest of the family rodriguez didnt say thatwhy belabor the obvious he did say you got messages forfor your man he couldnt pronounce xerxes to save his own life and nothing would save xerxes now they poured out their hearts to him that only made him feel worse about lying to them but they would hate him all the more for deceiving them if they found out the truth now and so he listened to words of love for a dead man and promised to bring back answers from beyond the grave none of the other guards knew what he was doing had they known they would have laughed at him or said he was doing it to get antoinette to lie down with him if he wanted her he thought he could have her but what was the point she and her mother couldnt last much longer not the way things were and when she was dead hed be sad she was gone hed be sad when she was gone even if she didnt sleep with him he liked her he didnt miss the black women he did lay they were justbodies now they were dead bodies and so what if they was to drop bombs all over this place bathsheba said you reckon a couple o skinny colored ladies could run off without nobody noticing you dont ask me that rodriguez exclaimed i got to keep people inside here not tell nobody how to get away you keepin people in here bathsheba shook her head dont reckon so aint nobody in the whole wide world could keep people in a place like this what youre doin is youre keepin niggers here niggers aint people not to the folks who go round yellin freedom all the damn time mama antoinette said bathsheba laughed its the truth aint it course it is you afraid i git in trouble on account of tellin the truth girl how kin i git in trouble thats any worsen what im in already you answer me that she turned to rodriguez you answer me that too mistuh sergeant suh rodriguez had no answers and he knew it he was a twentyyear freedom party man hed shouted freedom and libertad plenty of times more times than he could count he had no use for blacks if anything mallate was even more insulting even more demeaning than nigger he still believed negroes caused most of the confederacys troubles and without blacks whites would come down on mexicans instead but this skinny old woman did something no one else had ever been able to do she made him ashamed of the uniform he wore of the stripes on his sleeve of the party badge on his chest bathsheba did indeed tell the truth and hipolito rodriguez wasnt too far gone to know it where you goin she called after him he didnt answer he just went away anywhere away from the terrible truth as fast as his legs would take him now look what you went and done mama antoinette said reproachfully as if despite everything that had happened to them this could still be her mothers fault me i didnt do nothin bathsheba answered and then more quietly but not too quietly for rodriguez to hear he done it to hisself and there was another piercingly painful truth rodriguez had done it to himself he looked beneath the face of population reduction and saw murder he looked at niggers at mallates and saw people he looked at what hed been doing and saw madre de dios he whispered and crossed himself ai madre de dios but could even the virgin forgive him for such a mountain of sins he had trouble believing it nohe couldnt believe it that made a difference that made all the difference in the world he crossed himself again the gesture seemed extraordinarily pointless extraordinarily futile he was damned he felt the certainty of his damnation like that mountain of sin falling on him hed known for a long time that edith pinkards first husband was a camp guard who killed himself hed heard of other men who did the same thing up till now hed thought they were crazy all at once he didnt how could you live with yourself when you understood what you were doing what you were helping your country do he looked down at his hands how much blood was on them a river a lake an ocean he looked at the submachine gun in those bloodstained hands it was made for one thing killing people it was perfectly designed for the job too he clicked off the safety flicked the change lever to full automatic fire then like a man in a trance he put the muzzle of the conveniently short weapon in his mouth it smelled and tasted of metal and gun oil look out a woman cried he gonna and he did he pulled the trigger hard and that was most definitely that chester martin had never gone south of the ohio river hed spend the great war in virginia on the roanoke front in the west and then after recovering from his first wound in the northern part of the state pushing down toward richmond hed been not far from fredericksburg when the fighting ended in and not far from the same town when he got wounded twentyfive years later he liked kentucky better he especially liked how far the us army had driven into kentucky and how fast it was moving theyd passed madisonville and were heading south toward earlington madisonville was a tobacco town the crop was nowhere near ripe which didnt stop several us soldiers from plucking their own drying or half cooking the leaves and trying to smoke them afterwards they proved one thing in a hurry making cigarettes wasnt as easy as it looked earlington by contrast made its living from coal us army engineers dynamited the entrances to one mine after another is that smart sir martin asked his platoon commander shouldnt we be using those mines ourselves he knew how much coal the steel industry needed and it wasnt the only one lieutenant wheat only shrugged i guess the first thing is to deny this coal to the enemy he answered we can worry about everything else later its not like we dont mine plenty of our own i suppose so sir if chester didnt sound convinced it was because he wasnt but he didnt decide such things even if the news would have come as a surprise to the men in the platoon somewhere not far away a rifle went off he and lieutenant wheat both reached for their weaponsthat wasnt a springfield it also wasnt one of the confederates automatic rifles or an older boltaction tredegar martin didnt know exactly what it wassome kind of squirrel gun he supposed he would have bet whoever squeezed the trigger wasnt aiming at a squirrel the same thought must have gone through delbert wheats mind for he said they dont love us around here do they not hardly chester said the or whatever it was barked again i bet were going to have to take more hostages soldiers in butternut were trying to hold a line on the southern fringes of earlington and they would have to fall back from there in the next day or two but confederate civilians had rediscovered the thrills of guerrilla warfare kids and old men and even women turned into bushwhackers whenever they saw the chance the laws of war said people who werent in uniform but took up arms anyway were fair game those laws didnt say taking hostages was all right but every army on enemy territory did it sometimes it helped sometimes it just made more civilians want to pick up squirrel guns we kill enough of these fuckers sooner or later the rest will get the idea wheat said or if they dont well kill all of them he didnt sound worriedmore as if he looked forward to it after a third shot rang out martin got to his feet somebody ought to do something about that damn sniper he said he hadnt gone more than a step or two before a us machine gun stuttered out a short burst and then another one a triumphant shout went up got the son of a bitch talk about service lieutenant wheat said chester grinned and nodded and hunkered down again he pulled out a pack of raleighsproperly grown properly cured tobaccoand lit up after a deep drag he nodded again yeah this was what smokes were supposed to taste like a soldier trotted back to him and the lieutenant theres a confederate captain with a flag of truce wants to talk to us about civilians he said bring him back here wheat said we can talk blindfold him first chester added no point letting him see what weve got that may be part of what hes after the platoon commander nodded the soldier saluted wheat and hurried away would you like to sit in on this the lieutenant asked politely if you dont mind sir chester answered as politely the platoon leader didnt want to let the confederates hornswoggle him chester was his ace in the hole and appreciated being invited without having to invite himself when the cs captain took off his blindfold he proved to be about thirty with the ribbon for the purple hearta decoration that went back to george washington and that both sides usedon his chest he said his name was wilbur pease he didnt seem surprised to find a first sergeant sitting in with a second lieutenant which showed he knew how the world worked wheat did the talking well captain whats on your mind ive had reports of atrocities against civilian citizens lieutenant and ive come to investigate and to protest pease answered considering what the confederate states are doing to their negroes arent you in a poor position to talk about atrocities wheat asked wilbur pease didnt even blink civilian citizens i said negroes are only residents not citizens they dont have the rights of citizens we can do whatever we want to them martin translated captain pease went on im talking about white people people who matter his racism was so complete so perfect he didnt know he had it we have a problem withwhats the fancy french for it sergeant francstireurs sir chester pronounced it franksteeroors he knew no more french than chinese it satisfied both lieutenant wheat and captain pease the us officer went on if we catch people out of uniform shooting at us were going to kill them its as simple as that captain we nailed one a few minutes ago if we have to take hostages to make them think twice well do that too and well shoot the hostages if it comes to that im sorry but these jerks with guns need to understand that were serious the laws of war pease began you did the same damn thing on our soil chester martin said dont get all high and mighty about it and dont encourage the uh francstireurs either wheat added that way everybody will be better off captain pease scowled his troops wouldnt be better off the more us soldiers flabbled about civilians with rifles the more distracted from fighting the regular confederate army they were i deny that we encourage civilians to take up arms against invaders he said of course you do captain wheat said and the stork brings babies and sticks em under cabbage leaves chester added all right pease said angrily i can see you dont take this seriously oh we do wheat said we take it so seriously well do whatever we have to to stamp it out and if that means you run short on civilians we wont lose any sleep about it whatever people in these parts try to do to us well do worse to them i promise you that captain it worked in utah it should work here if you want that kind of fight im sure you can have it wilbur pease said youd better put my hoodwink back onid like to return to my side of the line ill do it sir chester said to lieutenant wheat as he blindfolded pease he went on we dont have anything in particular against the confederate army you play fair when you fight us civilians playing soldierthats a different story yes it is youll see pease held out his hand someone take me back please a soldier led him through the us positions chesters face was troubled as he watched the confederate officer go a different storyhe wondered if his own words would come back to haunt him auto bombs people bombsthe kentuckians hadnt started making life as miserable for the us army as they could how much trouble do you think civilians can make by the troubled note in lieutenant wheats voice he was worrying about the same thing it cant be worse than utah thats all i know for sure martin paused for a moment of course utah was pretty bad a brief burst of gunfire came from the confederates formally marking the end of the truce a us machine gun fired back and after that it was time for everyone to keep his head down again the confederates launched a salvo of their rockets most of them came down on earlington civilians hadnt evacuated the town and bore the brunt of the hellish weapons bursts so much for taking care of their own martin said into delbert wheats ear they both crouched in the same shell hole if something came down on them the platoon would need new leaders they dont give a damn they never have the young officer answered all they care about is scoring points off us chester nodded it looked like that to him too chaos reigned in the town wounded us soldiers screamed for medics so did wounded civilians the corpsmen dealt with soldiers first that was likely to hurt their popularity with the locals they didnt seem to care chester didnt either us warplanes streaked low overhead they were fighters but each one carried a bomb slung under its belly they were bound to be slower and less maneuverable till they dropped those bombs explosions on the confederate side of the line said they werent wasting any time barrels rumbled down toward the front too one platoon particularly caught chesters eye all five machines were the newest us model sleek and deadly as so many tigers all five were unbuttoned too their commanders and drivers looking out to see where they were when they got closer to the firing the drivers would close their hatches some barrel commanders liked to stand up in the cupola as long as they could they took chances doing that but their machines fared better one of those commanders drew chesters notice as he rolled down highland park and into the northern outskirts of earlington he spotted chester too and no surprise for they were about the same age middleaged survivors in a world of young men over the din of his engine he called you went through it before and you came back for another round his accent said he came from somewhere close to the canadian border yeah im a glutton for punishmentjust like you chester shouted back they grinned and waved at each other stay safe chester added you too the barrel commander laughed so did martin if they wanted to stay safe what were they doing here lieutenant wheat gave chester a quizzical look you know that guy no sir chester answered but us old farts weve got to stick together his platoon went into the line not long after the barrels clattered past with help from the armored behemoths they shoved the confederates all the way out of earlington more rockets came in from the south featherstons soldiers had lots of nasty weapons whether they had enough men to use them was a different question for all their firepower confederate troops seemed thin on the ground that barrel commander fought his machine aggressively his gunner hit a confederate barrel at what had to be over a mile and set it afire two other confederate barrels decided theyd be better off somewhere else they trundled away in a hurry chester approvedthe less he had to worry about enemy armor the happier he was before too long he trudged past the burning enemy machine the push south rolled on cincinnatus driver made sure the on the seat of his truck was loaded and sat where he could grab it in a hurryhe never let it slide out of reach the road between paris and winchester wasnt safe for us convoys the drive south had pushed the confederate army out of this part of kentucky but cs stragglers and bushwhackers who didnt wear uniforms still took potshots at us vehicles from the trees that grew too damn close to the side of the road a bloated body hung from a telegraph pole the placard tied around the mans neck said franctireur that was officer talk for bushwhacker no doubt us authorities hanged him there to warn his buddies his wasnt the first corpse cincinnatus had seen they didnt seem to do much to intimidate the confederates he sighed things hadnt been that much different in the great war you did what they told you to do and you hoped you came out the other side in one piece you volunteered for this cincinnatus reminded himself were you born stupid or did you have to study he concluded he was born stupid hed never been much for studying but hed had too recent a closeup look at the confederacy any black man who did naturally wanted to kill the country with an axe since he didnt have an axe truckload after truckload of supplies would have to do in the great war the usa was content to make the csa say uncle this time the united states seemed to want to kill the confederate states with an axe cincinnatus understood why too the united states almost had the axe fall on them the lead truck in the convoy didnt run into an axe it ran over a land mine and started to burn the lead truck never carried munitions just because it was most likely to go boom the driver probably didnt have a chance a different truck chosen by lot led every convoy that could have been me cincinnatus thought gulping no matter what happened to the lead truck the convoy had to get through the second truck drove off the road onto the soft shoulder on the rightand ran over another mine and blew up do jesus cincinnatus yelped he hit the brakes there was going to be a holdup herehe could see that if the third truck went off the road to the left would it go skyhigh too the driver didnt want to find out cincinnatus wouldnt have either the confederates who planned this one had outthought their us opposite numbers just how badly theyd outthought them became obvious a moment later when the us trucks in the convoy were all stopped and all bunched up behind the two that were in flames a machine gun and assorted automatic rifles and submachine guns opened up on them from the woods to the left as soon as cincinnatus heard the gunfire and saw muzzle flashes winking over there he bailed out he paused only to grab the as he slid across the seat he was damned if hed get out of the truck on the drivers side and make himself a perfect target for the cs holdouts or guerrillas or whoever the hell they were his bad leg and bad shoulder both howled protests at what he was making them do he paid them no attention getting hit by an auto had been bad very bad getting chewed up by machinegun fire was one of the few things he could think of likely to be worse he didnt want to find out the hard way no more than a second or two after he threw himself to the ground and crawled behind a tire a burst of bullets chewed up the cab of the truck glass from the windshield and the driversside window blew out and then fell like rain had the engine caught fire he would have had to abandon the truck and make for the woods to the right he would also have had to pray confederates didnt infest them too for the moment though the truck wasnt burning a couple of wounded drivers cried out in pain other men like cincinnatus crouched and sprawled in whatever cover they could find one of them called be ready those fuckers are liable to rush us can they be that smart and that dumb at the same time cincinnatus wondered if he were in the woods he would have kept shooting at the trucks till they all caught fire or started exploding the confederates had put themselves in a position where they could do that why wouldnt they then confederate soldiers probably would have reasoned the same way he did the men in the woods turned out not to be soldiers they were amateurs bushwhackers guerrillas they cared about the trucks yes but they wanted to kill people too once theyd peppered the trucks with bullets set some on fire and flattened a lot of tires they loped forward to deal with the drivers they must have thought theyd killed and wounded more men than they had that was the only thing cincinnatus could think of with just a pistol he had to let them come near before he opened up he eyed the bushwhackers they wore dirty dungarees and dirtier flannel shirts they were poorly shaved when they got a little closer they would probably stink they never got that close one of the drivers had a springfield not a he fired from behind a tire worked the bolt and fired again two guerrillas fell the others started spraying lead as if it were going out of style the drivers fired back they didnt want the bushwhackers to concentrate on the man with the best weapon cincinnatus used the twohanded grip to steady the but it still bucked like an unbroken stallion when he pulled the trigger the man he aimed at ducked the way almost everyone did when a bullet came too close several bullets came too close to cincinnatus he was already down on his belly he tried to flatten out like a squirrel after a deuceandahalf ran over it another guerrilla fell the drivers cheers were punctuated by a shriek as one of them got hit in the films about fighting indians on the great plains the cavalry always charged over the hill in the last reel it wasnt the cavalry this time it was an armored car and two command cars that carriedcaliber machine guns as soon as the us soldiers in them got a look at what was going on they hosed the irregulars down with gunfire the men who fought for the confederacy broke and flew toward the woods not many of them got there even then the bushwhackers didnt give up the machine gun hidden among the trees started shooting at the oncoming vehicles the armored car didnt need to worry about that but the thinskinned command cars did the armored car had a small cannon not just machine guns of its own after it sent half a dozen rounds crashing into the woods the enemy machine gun shut up in the middle of a burst somebody in one of the command cars or the armored car must have used the wireless because four or five fighterbombers roared in and dropped their presents on the stand of trees cincinnatus hoped they blew the bushwhackers to hell and gone no matter what he hoped he knew some of them would get away maybe they would think twice about messing with the us army from now on more likely he feared they wouldnt he didnt want to get out from behind his tire even after the armored car took up a position between the woods and the shattered convoy nobody could call him a cowardly coon either not when the white drivers also stayed right where they were a soldier got out of one of the command cars for a closer look at a dead irregular a bullet from the woods made him throw himself flat the armored car and the command car lashed the trees with machinegun rounds another defiant bullet clanged off the armored cars turret nobody went anywhere till more trucks brought soldiers forward some to clear the woods and others engineers to get rid of the rest of the mines the bushwhackers had planted after that still more trucks had to come up to salvage what the kentuckians hadnt destroyedand to pick up the drivers im getting too old for this shit one of them said wearily as he climbed into the back of a deuceandahalf i was too old for this shit a long time ago cincinnatus said remind me how come i signed up to do it again on account of youre a damn fool the other driver said before cincinnatus could even start to get mad the white man added just like me that took care of that the front lay just north of winchester cincinnatus wished it were farther south still he knew that was unfair the us army had done in a couple of weeks what took months of slogging in the last war and this wasnt even the main us thrust that was farther west and was moving faster he got a new truck that afternoon and a new assignment the kid lieutenant in the motor pool gave him a dubious look you sure youre up for this gramps he said its gonna help whip jake featherston aint it cincinnatus said thats the idea yeah the lieutenant answered then im up for it cincinnatus declared after another pause the lieutenanthe was younger than cincinnatus son achilles which made him seem very young indeednodded well when you put it that way i do cincinnatus said fair enough i can see why the lieutenant said good luck cincinnatus drove within artillery range of the front nothing came down too close for which he thanked god what the hell took youse guys so long said the quartermaster sergeant who took charge of the supplies the truck convoy delivered we been waitin for youse he was a hairy little italian guy from new york city his accent and cincinnatus were a long way from each other he was also a long way from any place where bullets flew his uniform was clean it was even pressed sorry to disoblige you sergeant cincinnatus said but before i got down here bushwhackers hit the convoy i was in we had trucks blown up an men killed so maybe you better do your grousin somewheres else you gotta lotta noive talkin tme that way the sergeant growled who do you think you are im an uppity nigger tryin to kick jake featherstons raggedy ass cincinnatus answered we on the same side or not the noncoms eyes almost bugged out of his head you cant talk to me like that you cant you hear tell me your name im gonna put you on report im cincinnatus driver do whatever you damn well please cincinnatus said calmly whatever you do it aint gonna be worsen what happened this morning you want to put him on report put us all on report a white driver said he just told you what everybody was thinking im hal williamson write it down bruce donovan another driver said everybody in the convoy gave the quartermaster sergeant his name somebody in the back of the crowd added you sad sorry chickenshit asshole that does it that fuckin does it the sergeant shouted youse guys have had it he stormed off and returned a few minutes later with a captain in tow listen to these wiseguys sir cincinnatus and the other truckers were happy to let the captain listen we almost got killed today cincinnatus said i dont see him with no purple heart or silver star or nothin again the rest of the drivers chimed in on his side after listening to them the captain turned to his sergeant and said take an even strain cannizzaro its not like they were holding you up on purpose but sir sergeant cannizzaro began take an even strain i said the captain told him more sharply this time the stuff is here now lets get it out to the troops who need it he walked away leaving the quartermaster sergeant staring after him an officer with sense cincinnatus thought hed run into some before but it didnt happen every day jerry dover had a promotion he wanted a second star on either side of his collar about as much as he wanted a third leg but he was now officially a lieutenantcolonel he was doing everything colonel travis ww oliphant did before he went missing and more besides so the powers that be seemed to have decided he deserved at least some of the vanished colonel oliphants rank lieutenantcolonel wasnt enough to get the boneheads down in tennessee to pay attention to him he would have needed to be at least a lieutenant generalnot a rank the confederate states dished out every day listen dammit dover snarled over a bad telephone connection if you dont get more ammo and gasoline up here pretty damn quick you wont need to worry about me pissing and moaning any more thats for sure you dont know how bad things are down here said the colonel on the other end of the line the yankees are bombing the shit out of the dams president featherston built weve got floods like you wouldnt believe half the time we dont have power on account of they made so much of it roads are out railroads are out if you dont send us what we need to fight with were out dover interrupted youll be arguing with some damnyankee quartermaster not me some damnyankee quartermaster was enjoying the depot hed put together outside of covington nobody but nobody had dreamt the usa could move so fast were trying the colonel said you sure are jerry dover told him but it went over his head dover would have bet on that he went on this is a war in case you didnt noticesir if we dont do it were going to fucking lose he didnt care what he said when he talked to a supplier that was just as true when he talked to cs army quartermasters as it had been when he talked to rascally butchers in augusta i am certain you are doing everything you can colonel said the officer down in tennessee why dont you give me and my men credit for doing the same because from up here it looks like youve got your head up your ass but dover didnt say that though it was a damned nearrun thing what he did say was get as much forward as you can theyve promised me theyll hold on to bowling green no matter what theyd also promised they would hold on to covington no matter what hed believed them which only proved anybody could be a fool now and then he was more ready to evacuate and wreck this depot than he had been when the line lay farther north some yankee writer once said trust everybodybut cut the cards that struck jerry dover as good advice even the colonel down in tennessee who had to worry about nothing worse than bombers and floodsmere details in dovers harried existencecould see they might have promised more than they could deliver keep your options open he said and hung up options right dover said tightly at the moment he didnt know whether to shit or go blind and that about summed up his options the western us column was already down about even with bowling green the eastern one was still northeast of his current center in a way that was good news it meant that for the time being he could resupply both crumbling confederate fronts but it also meant both fronts were liable to converge on him here or even behind him if that happened if that happens i have to move like a son of a bitch to save anything dover thought glumly take what i can blow up what i cant he already knew what was what what would go and what would go up in smoke if this turned into the front he was liable to have to turn into a combat soldier to get free of it he muttered to himself like every other white man his age in the csa hed done a spell in the trenches in the last war he wasnt eager to repeat it but if the damnyankees got in his way he would try his best to run them over the telephone jangled if it was that officious idiot in tennessee telling him something wouldnt show up because somebodyd lost the paperworkdover here he growled a note of warning in his voice this here is major kirby bramlette over by elkton the caller said dover had to look at a map to find elkton southeast of hopkinsville which had fallen to the usa only the day before it was also definitely south of bowling green which wasnt good news bramlette sounded right on the edge of being frantic as he went on you got any more o them antibarrel rockets the ones infantrymen can shoot off looks like every yankee barrel in the world is heading right at me youll have some in a couple of hours if us fighters dont shoot up my trucks on the way dover answered soonerd be better bramlette said two hours from now im liable to be dead he didnt say anything about pulling back the confederates did that only when they couldnt help it fast as we can get there dover hung up and ran outside yelling for drivers when hed assembled half a dozen he said load up on antibarrel rockets and get em to elkton on the double where the fuck is elkton one of them asked follow me ill get you there by his accent the man who spoke was from around these parts youd have to be to know where elkton was take your trucks to gate number nine dover said go in through there and make the first left you can hed laid out the depot himself he knew where everything was if major bramlette needed coldweather socks or prophylactics he would have known where they were off the top of his head too confederate soldiers loaded the rockets and their stovepipe launchers onto the trucks in the last war negroes would have done it not here not now the soldiers didnt even grumble about nigger work they just fetched and carried without a second thought if blacks were working now most of the soldiers working the depot could have been at the front with automatic rifles in their hands that seemed obvious to jerry dover the trouble he would land in if he said so out loud seemed even more obvious so he kept his mouth shut inside of half an hour the trucks were on the way dover went back to his office and telephoned major bramlette barring air strikes they should get there in an hour or so its what about forty miles from here to where youre at he said something like that anyways bramlette answered thank you kindly colonel youve done what you could now we just have to see if we can hold on that long as if to punctuate the comment explosions came over the telephone line all of a sudden he didnt have a connection he swore hoping the trouble was in the line and not because of a direct hit on bramlettes headquarters he didnt find out till the trucks got back a little before sunset we delivered the rockets sir said the head driver a master sergeant named stonewall sloane dover had seen his papersthat was his real name why his parents couldnt have picked a different confederate hero to name him afterjerry dover shrugged how many babies born between and now were called featherston too manyhe was sure of that all rightyou delivered them dover said sloane nodded he neither looked nor sounded happy dover asked the question he had to ask what went wrong damnyankees had already shoved our guys out of elkton by the time we got there sir stonewall sloane paused to light a cigar dover had a cigarette goingbut then he usually did the sergeant went on i hope the rockets can help us blow some of the yankees to hell and gone if they cant he sent up gloomy smoke signals shit dover said whereabouts exactly did you make your delivery was it south of elkton or east of it east sir sloane answered a world of bad news in two words shit dover said again theyre heading this way then dont know if they want to take bowling green or get in behind it and cut it off sergeant sloane said theyve been doing a lot of that crap lately we did it in ohio so i reckon the united states learned their lessons from us did they have to learn them so goddamn well dover stubbed out his cigarette and lit another one stonewall sloane managed a thin smile after a deep savage drag dover asked you think well have to get out of town the more time we have the more stuff well be able to save sir i honest to god dont know sloane replied if you told me a month ago the yankees could come this far this fast i wouldve told you you were out of your goddamn tree uhmeaning no disrespect dont worry about it dover said dryly stonewall sloane sent him an appraising glance the cigar twitched youre all right arent you well i try yeah sloane scratched his head where was i oh yeah theyve already done more than i reckoned they could so who knows what the fuck theyre liable to do next do you want to take chances before dover could answer airraid sirens wailed were going to take chances whether we want to or not he said and grabbed his helmet and ran for the closest trench sergeant sloane was right behind him antiaircraft guns around the depot thundered dover was glad he had steel between his skull and the chunks of shrapnel that would start falling out of the sky any second now you were just as dead if your own side killed you as you were any other way fighterbombers streaked by low overhead the us eagle in front of crossed swords plainly visible one trailed fire and smoke it slammed into the ground and blew up thatll learn em sloane yelled but other explosions came from the depot not far away some were single others multiple bombs touching off more explosions on the ground what jerry dover had to say scuttled several commandments hed arranged ordnance in small lots with thick earthen dikes between them that minimized the damage but didnt couldnt stop it the surviving us airplanes came back for another pass at the depot and the trucks this time with their cannons and machine guns dover said something even worse he yanked his out of its holster and fired several shots at the us warplanes that did no good of course hed known it wouldnt goddamn useless thing he growled in disgust antiaircraft guns arent doing a hell of a lot better stonewall sloane said fuck them too dover said the veteran noncom blinked then laughed dover wasnt laughing he was furious we ought to have something that really will shoot airplanes down dammit all these things do is make noise the guns at the moment were making a godawful racket rockets maybe sergeant sloane didnt sound as if he took that seriously even if he was the one proposing it but dover said why the hell not theyve got em for barrels why not airplanes theyre a lot easier to wreck harder to hit though sloane said thats for the guys with the high foreheads and the thick glasses dover said i bet weve got people working on it i bet the damnyankees do too if they figure it out first thats bad news he scrambled out of the trench and trotted toward the depot to do what he could to control the damageand to see how much damage there was to control right now he couldnt find much good news for the csa cassius skirted milledgeville georgia the way he skirted every town he approached milledgeville was a fairsized place with maybe people in it it was laid out with the idea that it would become the state capitaland it did till brawling bumptious atlanta displaced it after the war of secession a sign on the outskirts bragged that milledgeville was where georgia legislators voted to leave the union cassius didnt think that was anything to be proud of what would life be like in the united states it probably wouldnt be good he didnt suppose life for negroes was good anywhere but it couldnt be like this he was skinny and dirty he smelled badthe only chances he got to wash were in streams he walked past he was hungry most of the time and at that he didnt have it so bad he wasnt in a camp he didnt know what his family was going through not exactly nobody knew exactly except the people who got carted away the only thing people on the outside knew was that the ones who got carted away didnt come back most negroes in the cities had been rounded up and taken away it was harder out in the countryside they were more scattered harder to get into one place with barbed wire all around it guerrillas scared some whites out in the country to death others though werent so bad quite a few let you do odd jobs in exchange for food and a place to sleep and maybe a dollar or two some of the farms had women running them all the menfolk gone to war cassius learned it was harder to get a handout or even a hearing at those places than at the ones with white men on them women on their own commonly carried shotguns or rifles and didnt want to listen to a hardluck story get lost before i call the sheriff they would sayeither that or get lost before i shoot but they didnt call the sheriff in spite of an augusta passbook cassius hadnt had any trouble going where he pleased if he stole that might have been a different story except for triflesa few eggs here some matches therehe didnt his parents had raised him the right way he wouldnt have put it like that not after the way he knocked heads with his father but that was what it amounted to he stayed in the pine woods after getting run off a farm west of milledgeville with summer coming soon nights were mild mosquitoes tormented him but they would have done that anywhere except behind screens he didnt worry about animals bears and cougars were hunted into rarity people on the other hand hed already seen mexican soldiers on the march he made sure they didnt see him ducking into a stand of trees once and hiding behind a haystack another time those yellowish khaki uniforms made him angrywhat were they doing in his country he wouldnt have got nearly so upset about butternut or gray that was his gut reaction anyhow when he thought about it he laughed at himself as if the confederate states were his country or any negros country the idea was ridiculous and native whites would have been rougher on him or anyone else his color than these foreigners were he chopped wood for a farmer later that day the blisters hed got the first time he did it were starting to turn to calluses the farmer gave him ham and grits and a big mug of homebrew making your own beer was against the law in georgia but plenty of people both white and black turned criminal on that score you work good the farmer said spitting a stream of tobacco juice thank you suh cassius answered as others had before him the white man asked want to stick around he gave cassius a shrewd look sooner or later youre gonna run into trouble wandering around the countrysideor else troubles gonna run into you cassius only shrugged whatever happened to him out here couldnt be worse than what had happened to his father and mother and sister in augusta sorry suh but i got to be movin on he said whatever you want the farmer shrugged too but cassius didnt like the glint in his eye he left a little earlier than he would have otherwise and headed south where he had been going west as soon as he got out of sight of the farmhouse he took the first westward track he found luck was with him because he came up to another farm just as the sun was going down he scouted the place from the edge of the woods and didnt see or hear any dogs when it got really dark he sneaked into the haystack which gave him a much better bed than bare ground would have he hadnt fallen asleep yet when gunfire split the night several bursts from submachine guns with single shots from a pistol in between them he wondered what that was all about no actually he didnt wonderhe feared he knew had that farmer called the local sheriff or militia commander or whoever was in charge of the people with guns and said theres an uppity nigger southbound from my place reckon you ought to take care of him deputies or mexicans must have picked on the first negro they saw heading south on that road that black wasnt cassius but they didnt know or careespecially after he started shooting back at them cassius felt bad about snaring the other colored man in his troubles and hoped the fellow got away if they were after me they wouldve snagged me he thought shivering as he burrowed deeper into the sweetsmelling hay if i didnt notice that damn ofay looking all sly he woke up before sunrise and got out of there before the farmer could come outside and discover him once he was back in the woods he took off his clothes and made sure he brushed all the hay off of them he didnt want to look like somebody who had to sleep in a haystack even if that was what he wasespecially if that was what he was he heard gunfire again that afternoon not just a little the way he had the night before but lots both sides had plenty of firepower and werent shy about using it now i know what war sounds like cassius thought which only proved hed never come anywhere near a real battlefield but this would do he walked toward it thinkingfoolishly thinkinghe would watch what was going on from a safe distance as he might have watched a football game back in augusta even the first bullet that came close enough for him to hear the crack as it zipped past wasnt enough to deter him he got behind a pine tree and imagined he was safe negro guerrillas held what had been a sharecropper village mexican soldiers were trying to push them out of it or kill them if they stayed inside hardly even noticing that he was doing it cassius leaned forward this was more exciting than any football game hed ever watched it stayed an exciting game till a mexican took a bullet to the temple the other side of his head exploded into red mush his rifle fell from his hands as he crumpled to the ground even with that surely mortal wound he didnt die right away he jerked and flopped and twitched like a chicken that had just met the chopper cassius gulped he almost wished someone would shoot the mexican again to make him hold still no this wasnt a game no matter what it looked like people were really dying out there when another bullet snapped past cassius he didnt just flinch he felt as if somebodyd jabbed an icy dagger into each kidney this is what fear feels like he thought and fear had an odor too he could smell it coming off of himself he could probably smell it drifting over from the mexican soldiers and their negro foes and smelling it only made him more afraid at some level far below conscious thought he heard footfalls coming through the woods toward him they made him afraid too they were all too likely to come from francisco joses men and if the greasers spotted him what would they do theyd shoot him that was what he was a young negro man of course they would think him an enemy and he was even if he didnt carry a tredegar his heart was with the embattled blacks in the little hamlet not only his heart either before he knew what he was doing he ran for those shacks as fast as he could go bullets chewed up the ground under his feet they cracked and whirred past his head he didnt know if the mexicans or the negroes were shooting at him both probably if the two sides werent so busy blazing away at each other they might have paid him even more attention than they did not that it was attention he was likely to live through he dove behind a crate hoping everybody would forget about him who the hellre you one of the negroes shouted at him names cassius he answered not that that told them much theres soldiers in them trees i run out of oh yeah said the voice from behind him we can shift them fuckers i reckon they did too they had a couple of machine guns and they didnt seem short of ammunition for them shrieks from the woods said theyd scored at least a couple of hits nobody used the trees to outflank the hamlet which the mexicans had probably wanted to do cassius lay very still behind the crate the mexicans seemed to forget he was there which suited him fine he didnt want to remind them after another half hour or so the firing on both sides tapered off theys goin someone behind him shouted reckon you can come out now whatever the hell your name was someone else added wearily cassius got to his feet a couple of negro men with rifles in their hands showed themselves one of them gestured to him looks like you jus joined us the man said he was short and wiry with a knife scar pulling the left side of his mouth up into a permanent sneer coulda had some trouble if them mexicans got where they was goin looked that way to me cassius said you know anything about guns the scarfaced man asked no suh but i reckon i can learn cassius replied the older negro nodded thats a good answer now i got another question fo you you take orders folks call me gracchus he jabbed a thumb at his own chest i runs this outfit you dont like that you hit the road no hard feelins but we dont want nobody whos out for hisself and not for all of us the outfit gotta come first ill take orders cassius said if you gave dumb ones i reckon youd be dead by now not runnin things here expect youre right gracchus said well my first order is tell me about yourself whats your name again where you from im cassius i got out of augusta when the ofays nabbed my folks how come they didnt catch you too gracchus sounded coldly suspicious cassius wondered why then he realized the rebel leader might fear he was bait and would betray the whole band when he saw the chance they went to church he answered truthfully me i stayed home gracchus nodded again god didnt help em much did he you reckon theres a god cassius said i got a hard time believin any more either god likes ofays or there aint none i got to choose between a god that loves jake featherston an one that aint there i know which way i go for the first time since he shouted out his warning gracchus eyed him with something approaching approval maybe yous all right after all he said give me a rifle teach me what to do with it cassius said reckon i show you how all right i am x irving morrell rolled into bowling green with a smile on his face the burntout confederate barrels he rolled past were what made him happy the confederates had fought hard outsidetheyd fought hard and theyd got smashed the one thing they managed to do was empty out most of their big supply dump and wreck what they couldnt take away the us army wouldnt be able to salvage much given what the csa had in kentucky logistics was one of the enemys strengths some capable officer or another probably needed killing almost without thinking about it morrell brought his left hand up to his right shoulder it still twinged every now and again now both sides used snipers and bombs and any other way they could find to try to murder their foes better leaders it hardly seemed like war neither usa nor csa seemed to care any weapon that came to hand either side would use when this war ended one country or the other would lie flat on its back the winner would have a booted foot on the losers neck and would try to keep it there as long as he could somebodyd painted freedom on a wall somebody elseor maybe the same confederate patriothad added several blue xs quick and easy shorthand for the cs battle flag the stars and stripes might fly over bowling green but the people still longed for the stars and bars only a long lifetime ago this townthis whole statebelonged to the usa they spent a generation back in the usa after the great war the negroes in kentucky had liked that fine most of the whites had hated it they thought of themselves as confederates and didnt want to be us citizens the ones who did fled north when the csa won the plebiscite in early all of a sudden morrell stopped muttering and swore with savage fluency whats wrong sir frenchy bergeron asked nothing morrell said that was so patently untrue he had to amend it nothing i can do anything about anyway how many whitesand maybe even blackswho fled kentucky after the plebiscite were really confederate spies that hadnt occurred to him till now he hoped it hadnt because he was innocent and naive he intended to send a message to the war department anyway on the off chance that everybody else was just as naive thinking about the next big push sir the gunner asked im always thinking about that morrell said and sergeant bergeron chuckled he was a good gunner even a very good gunner he wasnt quite in michael pounds league but who was now that pound was an officer at last he was finding new ways to annoy the confederates seizing the crossing over the green river between calhoun and rumsey probably put the western prong of morrells offensive a couple of days ahead of where it would have been absent that a couple of artillery shells burst off to the south the confederates were fighting hardif anything harder than irving morrell had expected no matter how hard they were fighting they were still losing ground they were losing it almost fast enough to suit morrells driving perfectionismalmost but not quite when he conceived his plan he wanted the csa wrecked in a single campaigning season unless the bastards in butternut flatout collapsed he didnt think he could bring that off he would have to slice the confederacy in half in two installments john abell was right about that ask you something sir frenchy bergeron said sure morrell answered whats on your mind when do we go for nashville bergeron asked morrell started to laugh the gunner coughed reproachfully whats so damn funny sir isnt thats whats coming next you bet it is morrell said and thats whats so damn funny the war department probably hasnt figured out where i go from here but you damn well have i want to get moving as fast as i can too before the confederates think im ready he never denied the military talent facing him after what happened in ohio after what came much too close to happening in pennsylvania he would have been a fool to do that which didnt always stop some of the more feverishly optimistic us officers what he wanted to do was make sure the confederates talent didnt matter much if they lacked the men and barrels and airplanes to stop his thrusts what was talent worth nashvillenashville could be a real bitch bergeron said uh sir why do i always get gunners who think they belong on the general staff morrell wondered wryly it wasnt that frenchy was wrong the problem in fact was that he was right along with george custer morrell had planned and executed the attack that crossed the cumberland and took nashville in that wasnt quite the blow that won the great war but it did knock the confederates back on their heels and they never got over it afterwards meanwhile sergeant bergeron was waiting for an answer i expect well come up with something morrell said oh yes sir frenchy said dont want to try crossing the river where you did the last time though what do you want to bet featherstons little chumsll be laying for us there jesus morrell exploded you really do belong on the general staff not me sir i dont want to go back to philly the people back there they just talk about whats supposed to happen me i want to make that shit happen myself theyre smartern i am but i have more fun i feel the same way morrell said which was only partly true no way in hell did he think the high foreheads back in philadelphia were smarter than he was a lot of the time he thought they thought they were smarter than they really were of course frenchy might have been sandbagging too you know what youre gonna do bergeron persisted anything happens to you i may be the guy who has to talk through the fancy wireless set for a little while he was about as far removed from the chain of command as a soldier could be that didnt necessarily mean he was wrong if say morrell got hit standing up in the cupola which could happen easily enough somebody who knew what things were like at the front might have to do some talking to keep an attack moving smoothly till brigadier general parsons could take over it would be highly unofficial chances were it wouldnt show up in the afteraction reports it could be important though youre going to be an officer before this war is done morrell said how many times had he tried to promote michael pound how many times had pound said no now pound was a lieutenant himself and proving he deserved his rank morrell hadnt expected anything different as for frenchy bergeron he said i hope so sir ill promote you right now if you want morrell said only thing i dont like about the deal is that ill have to break in a new gunner thank you sir bergeron said you want to wait till we get past nashville then i figure therell be a lot of fighting up to there and youll need me deal morrell said at once and i think youre right getting over the cumberland wont be fun but if we made it across the ohio we can do that too the us spearhead broke out of bowling green heading south three days later air strikes took out a battery of confederate rockets before they could salvo hearing that cheered morrell no end those damn things could hamstring an advance before it really got going as usual morrells place was at the front he wanted to see what happened not hear about it later from somebody else officers who served on the general staff didnt understand that to them war was arrows on a map to morrell it was shells going off and machine guns hammering and barrels brewing up and sending pillars of noxious black smoke into the sky and prisoners staggering out of the fight with shell shock on their faces and with their hands in the air it was exhaust fumes and cordite and the sharp stink of fear to the men of the general staff it was chess they didnt understand both sides were moving at onceand trying to steal pieces and knock over the board morrells barrels raced byraced througha column of refugees us fighterbombers had hit from above in the confederates gleefully strafed ohioans who didnt care to live under the stars and bars refugees clogged roads refugees whod just been hammered from the air clogged them even better so the confederates taught and now they were learning the same lesson for themselves kentuckiansor maybe they were tennesseans by nowwho didnt want to live under the stars and stripes fled south as people from ohio had fled north and east two years earlier when they got hit by machine guns and cannon fire and bombs from above it was as horrible as it had been in the usa dead and wounded children and womenand a few men mostly oldlay in the roadway children with dead parents clutched corpses and screamed grief to the uncaring sky peoples most precious possessions were scattered everywhere automobiles burned a woman standing by the body of a little girl stared at morrell with terrible eyes as his barrel rattled past the shoulder was wide herethe oncoming barrels didnt need to plow straight through what was left of the refugee column the woman picked up a rock and threw it at morrell it clanged off the barrels side what the hell frenchy bergeron said its all right morrell ducked down into the turret just a dissatisfied customer if that was me out there and all i had was a rock i expect id throw it too he straightened up and looked out again the confederates didnt try to hold back the advancing us troops till they got to a hamlet called westmoreland morrell looked for it on his kentucky maps didnt find it and checked the sheets for northern tennessee that was how he was sure hed crossed the state line a sign said westmorelandstrawberry capital of the world here as may passed into june the crop was no doubt coming to full sweet ripenessor it would have been anyhow the treads of morrells barrel and all the others speeding south with it churned the strawberries into jam was that motion there behind a farmhouse by hawkins the street leading into westmoreland from the northwest morrell brought up his binoculars front he sang out in back of that yellow clapboard house identified bergeron said and then clapboard that house go to a whorehouse morrell snorted and wheezed he had to try twice before he could ask whats the range just over a mile sir can you hit it bet your ass ill kill the fucker and he wont dare open up on us till we get closer do it then morrell ordered the barrel to a halt the gunner traversed the turret till the long inch cannon bore on the cs barrel the roar almost took morrells head off he used the field glasses again hit he yelled way to go frenchy son of a bitch is burning damn straight bergeron said they got any others hanging around theyll know they better clear out other us barrels started finding targets and setting them afire at a range the confederates couldnt hope to match sullenly the surviving cs machines did pull back they had to hope for wooded terrain where they had a better chance to strike from ambush us foot soldiers and barrels pushed into westmoreland the streets proved to be mined that slowed them up but not for long us bombers left two major dams in northern tennessee untouchedthe one by carthage and the one farther east near celina they didnt do it out of the goodness of their hearts they didnt want the floods downstream to disrupt their own advance the confederates desperate to slow us ground forces however they could blew both dams as they fell back over the cumberland michael pound was not pleased the floodwaters washed over the banks of the river and flowed across what had been fertile farmland they turned it into something that more closely resembled oatmeal the new us barrels had wide tracks that meant each part of the track carried less weight than was true in older machines it also meant they could keep going where older barrels would bog down it didnt mean they had an easy time here and there confederate antibarrel guns and holdouts with rocket launchers lingered north of the cumberland i hate those damn stovepipes sergeant mel scullard said using the name the men in greengray had hung on the launchers doesnt seem fair one miserable infantry son of a bitch able to take out a whole barrel all by his lonesome especially when its your barreland your neck pound observed dryly you bet the gunner said they always could with a featherston fizz pound said thats different scullard insisted you could see those assholes coming and you had a chance to kill em before they got to you these guys they stay hidden they fire the lousy thing and then they run like hell i know pound said weve got to get something just like that so our guys can give the confederates whatfor had he been as mouthy to his superiors when he was a noncom he smiled reminiscently he was sure he had that evening he got summoned to an officers conclave this was the sort of thing hed always had to find out about from his own superiors till he finally couldnt evade promotion it proved less impressive than hed imagined it would a dozen or so officers ranging up from his lowly second lieutenanthood to a light colonel gathered in a barn that smelled maddeningly delicious the former owners had used it for curing tobacco the lieutenant colonel lit a us cigarette whose nasty smoke seemed all the viler by comparison with the aroma of choice burley intelligence says the confederates have some freedom party guards units in the neighborhood he announced you want to watch out for those guys whats so special about em sir a captain asked if you shoot em they go down right if you shoot em enough times they stay down right michael pound smiled meeting someone who thought the way you did was always nice after another drag on his cigarette the senior officer who was younger than pound looked at it in distaste i think they made this thing out of camel shit he said how he knew what camel shit tasted like when he smoked it was probably a question for another day no matter how little he liked the niagara he kept on smoking it whats so special he echoed theyre supposed to be featherstons elite force theyve got the best men and theyve got the best equipment just about all of them carry those goddamn automatic rifles theyve got plenty of stovepipeshe used the new handle tooand their armor is the best the confederates have not good enough pound and two other us officers said the same thing at the same time the lieutenant colonel shook his head even up out in the open weve got the edge if they shoot from ambush when were out in the open he didnt go on or need to pound nodded reluctantly but he nodded a hit from a threeinch gun could kill his barrel it wasnt a sure thing but it could how do we know em when we see em somebody asked they wear camouflage uniforms not ordinary butternut the light colonel said theyve caused a lot of trouble in texas this is the first report of em east of the mississippi just our luck pound said a couple of the other men in the barn sent him curious looks he was the junior officer present he was also the oldest man there the combination was odd and awkwardawkward for other people anyhow michael pound didnt much care if they busted him back down to sergeant he wouldnt say boo hed found he could do more as an officer than as a noncom that was nice and the confederates had reason to regret it on the green river but he wouldnt mind looking through a gunsight again either that incher was a gunners delight high muzzle velocity a flat trajectory better sights than earlier barrels had too you need to be aware theyre around the lieutenant colonel said and be aware our engineers are in the neighborhood too theyll do their best to make ways for you to go forward where the floodings worse than usual now pound beamed that was good news army engineers were on the ball fighting wasnt their job but they did it when they had to and they worked under fire without a peep solid men sure as hell he stuck up his hand the lieutenant colonel nodded sir will they have bridging equipment to get us over the cumberland pound asked the sooner we can grab a bridgehead on the other side the more the confederatesll have to flabble about you dont think small do you the light colonel said no sir pound took the question literally and answered with a straight face he nonplused the colonel the younger man rubbed his chin if we get that far lieutenant i figure well find some way to get over too does that satisfy you oh yes sir pound said but as long as those bastards are down i want to keep kicking them i want to kick their teeth in again he sounded perfectly earnest again he made the lieutenant colonel pause at last the man made the best of it saying your spirit does you credit you can serve as an example for all of us any more questions he waited nobody said anything he clapped his hands together once softly all right then lets go get em whats the word sir sergeant scullard asked when pound came back from the meeting pound hid a grin how many times had he asked officers the same question when he was a sergeant himself more than he could count that was for sure we drive for the cumberlandand cross it if we can he answered which overstated the case a bit the engineers will give us a hand we may have freedom party guards units in front of us theyre supposed to be tough and theyve got anumberone equipment but well make em say uncle sounds good to me the gunner was a man after his own heart the attack went in the next morning infantrymen in trucks and halftracked armored personnel carriers kept up with the barrels though the trucks had trouble with the mud and mostly stayed on the roads engineers rode in combat cars and in bulldozers with steel plating welded around the drivers position some of the dozers sported machine guns too those were informal nonregulation additions but the engineers were in a position to do that if anybody was resistance was light at first pound had just begun to doubt whether that lieutenant colonel knew what he was talking about when all hell broke loose an enemy barrel nicely hidden behind an overturned truck blew up two personnel carriers in quick succession the crew no fools started to fall back to another position front pound sang out identified scullard answered what he identified he could hit he couldand he did the cs barrel started to burn pound thought some of the men inside got awayit was long range for a machine gun that was a shame those soldiers plainly knew what they were doing as soon as they got a new machine theyd cause the usa more trouble but not now when an antibarrel rocket took out a greengray barrel foot soldiers descended from their conveyances and started hunting the confederates nearby the enemy troops were plainly outnumbered but nobody seemed to have told them anything about retreating holding their ground till they were overrun they died in place and took a lot of us soldiers with them those the freedom party guards sir scullard asked i think so pound said either theyve all got a lot of mud on their butternut or theyre wearing camouflage and they fight hardno two ways about that we smashed em for now looks like the gunner said yup pound agreed and that means we ought to gun for the river fast as we can before the confederates bring more troops back to this side he stood up in the cupola and looked around to see if he could spot any engineers his wireless set couldnt communicate directly with theirs which he considered an oversight not far from criminal but he spotted an armored bulldozer only a couple of hundred yards away he had his driver go closer so he could shout back and forth with the man inside the dozer driver waved and nodded then it was on toward the cumberland for his platoon and the foot soldiers with them and blast anything that got in the way the confederates really didnt have much left on this side of the river michael pound cheerfully went about reducing what they did have he wondered how they planned on fighting the war next year and the year after if they were wrecking some of their most productive land and the united states were wrecking some more after a bit he decided the confederates didnt care about next year and the year after if they couldnt stop the united states now they were much too likely to lose the war this year he nodded yeah that might be so the more he thought about it the better he liked it the better he liked it the harder he pushed his platoon other greengray barrels stormed toward the cumberland with them and dozers and other engineering vehicles did their damnedest to keep up even before he got to the river he realized his chances of seizing a bridge intact the way he had between calhoun and rumsey were slim and none the confederates had blown the bridges over the cumberland themselves and were using it for a barrier and if they hadnt the flood they turned loose by blowing the dam upstream would have swept away any surviving spans he had hoped the engineers would be able to bridge the river in a hurry but the cumberland was too wide for anything engineering vehicles could carry on their backs it would have to be pontoons which took longer to rig and let the enemy concentrate his fire but lieutenant pound wasnt the only officer with a driving urge for speed general morrell had it too and had the authority to do something with it the pontoon bridges started reaching across the river as soon as it got too dark for the confederates on the southern bank to see what us forces were up to morrell or someone else with a good head on his shoulders ordered an artillery barrage laid on several miles to the west the confederates naturally replied in kind and fired star shells to light up the cumberland there to discover what the men in greengray were doing the soldiers and engineers there werent doing anything much but shelling lulled featherstons men fired back at a quarter to four a captain of engineers asked pound you ready to go like hell lieutenant yes sir pound answered around a yawn hed been up all night the captain nodded good thats the right answer wont be long haul ass when you get the word i can do that sir pound said and ten minutes later he and his platoon did they werent quite the first us barrels over the cumberland but not many were in front of them infantry in halftracks crossed right behind them by the time the sun came up theyd carved out a solid bridgehead on the south bank gas somebody shouted as usshells rained down on the confederate positions south of the cumberland jorge rodriguez already had his mask onhed heard the gurgle gas rounds made flying through the air he huddled in a hastily dug foxhole and prayed nothing would come down on his head too much had landed on him in the past few weeks not literally but metaphorically virginia had been fairly quiet getting transferred to the tennessee front was like getting a bucket of ice water in the face but getting word that his father had died in texas was like getting thrown into ice water with no way out the telegram gave no details which only made things worse jorge had written to his mother down in sonora but he was still waiting for an answer he had little time to brood on it that was the one good thing about getting thrown into combat fierce enough to give him a brush with death almost every day hed asked his company commander for compassionate leave captain nelson cash had looked at the telegram and shaken his head im mighty sorry george he said that being what most englishspeakers called jorge im mighty sorry but maybe you noticed there was a war on yes sir jorge hadnt really expected anything different but he had to try he thought about going awol thought about it and then thought again he was a long way from texas an even longer way from sonora someone at a train station was bound to check his papers they were making examples of deserters these days of course what the army and the freedom party were doing to deserters wasnt a patch on what us bombs and bullets might do to him he was in his late twenties older than a lot of the conscripts who filled out his company old enough to know god didnt have a carved stone somewhere that said he would live forever even getting to the front hadnt been easy hed had to go all the way down to atlanta and then north again traveling mostly by night the yankees had torn up and bombed the railroad lines going west from virginia into kentucky and also the ones going west from asheville north carolina to knoxville tennessee they wanted to keep the confederates from hitting them in the flank while they pushed south by all the signs they knew how to get what they wanted too all that meant the cs reinforcements from virginia reached the front a couple of days later than they would have with everything going smoothly it meant the front was farther south than it would have been had they got there in good time and it meant that the mission theyd been given when they left virginiathrowing the us bridgehead south of the cumberland back over the riverwas nothing but a pipe dream by the time they got there jorge knew about all that only because of occasional grumbles from his superiors hed never been in tennessee before he wasnt sure where the cumberland was let alone any of the towns south of it the only thing he knew was that his outfit had to fight like hell whenever it got where it was going in a way such a state of almost blissful ignorance wasnt bad for an ordinary soldier he got off the train somewhere not far south of murfreesboro and climbed into a truck for the journey up to the front jorge was sorry to change vehicles hed won more than two hundred dollars in the poker game that started back in virginia he was a goodtempered easygoing fellow a measure of how popular he was with his buddies was that nobody called him a goddamn greaser no matter how much he won murfreesboro had taken a pounding a lot of the places where jorge was stationed in virginia had taken a pounding too but theyd been at or near the front since some of them had taken a pounding in the great war too and even in the war of secession murfreesborohell had opened up on murfreesboro in the past few days the ruins still had sharp edges smoke still curled up from them the women and kids and old men who grubbed through them still looked stunned astonished that such things could happen to them the smell of death was very sweet very strong jorges stomach turned over he gulped trying to keep his rations down the move east from murfreesboro also came by night the butternut trucks had most of their headlights covered over with masking tape the slits that remained shed more light than cigarette coals but not a whole lot more the truck convoy had to go slow even so jorge rattled past one machine that had driven off the side of the road and into a shell hole that driver hes gonna catch hell he said his english had an accent different from those of the white men in the truck with him every so often he used a word that wasnt english anywhere except sonora and chihuahua but the other soldiers understood him his father spoke mostly spanish when he went off to fight in his mother was still more at home in it than in english but he and his brothers like most of the younger generation embraced the tongue the rest of the csa used maybe he will someone else said but the guys he was drivin i bet they give him a medal for makin em late wish our driverd go off the road another soldier said he didnt sound like a man making a joke on the contraryhe seemed painfully serious his name was gabriel medwick he was about six feet three at least pounds blond jutjawed and handsome he could have posed for a freedom party recruiting poster as a matter of fact and he sounded like a man just this side of shitting himself with fear jorge was afraid too anybody whod seen combat and wasnt afraid had some screws loose somewhere he hadnt seen a whole lot and what he had seen wasnt too intense the company was probably heading into something worse but knowing that the allconfederate boy sitting in the truck with him was more afraid than he wasor less able to hide his fear which amounted to the same thinghelped steady him aw fuck medwick muttered when the truck stopped it was getting near dawn gray light had started leaking in through the rearfacing opening in the canvas canopy over the cargo area thats what we arecargo rodriguez thought they use us up like rations or bullets or barrels he wished that hadnt occurred to him come on get out we got to head on up to the front sergeant hugo blackledge would never show up on a recruiting poster he had hairy ears and more hair sticking out of his nose and a black five oclock shadow that came out at noon his eyebrows grew together above that beaky nose his chin was barely there at all he was little and skinny and mean if he was afraid he never showed it he ran his squad with no pretense of fairness or justice but he never sent anyone anywhere he wouldnt go himself and he could whip all of them gabriel medwick included he wouldnt fight fair to do it which only made the men more willing to follow his lead theyd seen enough to know that fighting fair was for civilians and other fools where the hell are we anyways someone asked as they scrambled out of the truck where were supposed to be blackledge answered thats all you assholes need to know he didnt expect to be loved that wasnt his job captain cash on the other hand was friendly to his men he could afford to be he had bastards like blackledge under him to handle the dirty work that town up ahead is sparta he told the soldiers piling out of several trucks its still ours weve got to make sure it stays ours any questions a bird piped in a tree all the birds up here in the north sounded strange to jorge even the jays were peculiar they acted quite a bit like the blackthroated magpiejays he knew back home but they were only about half the size they should have been that meant they could only screech half as loud what are the yankees throwing at us somebody asked after a pause everything but the outhouse sergeant blackledge answered before the captain could say anything if they figure out a way to dump that shit on us theyll use it too after that no one seemed to want to know anything else come on captain cash said into the uncomfortable silence lets go forward when jorge and his companions went into the line in virginia theyd replaced other soldiers who left the front for rest and refit and recuperation here nobody was coming back as the replacements went forward that couldnt mean all the confederates up there were dead or the damnyankees would storm through the breach but it probably did mean the high command couldnt afford to take anybody out of the line and that wasnt good news or anything close to it confederate s banged away at the enemy jorge was glad to hear them they meant things hadnt all gone to the devil anyhow the sun came up it looked like a nice day then us guns started answering the s jorge knew enough to throw himself flat he pulled his entrenching tool off his belt and started a foxhole hed long since learned how to dig without raising up more than a few inches off the ground pretty soon he was in a hole with the dirt heaped up in front of him to help block fragments foxhole or not though he was still liable to get killed the yankees had more guns than his side did and they werent shy about using them that was when the gas started coming in he hadnt seen this kind of bombardment in virginia by the time he got there the war had settled down to skirmishes with neither side trying very hard to break through it wasnt like that here he needed no more than a few minutes to see as much the damnyankees had already broken throughif they hadnt driven all the way through kentucky they wouldnt have been over the cumberland and deep inside tennessee the confederates were doing what they could to counterattack and throw the enemy back so far everything they could do wasnt nearly enough even before the shelling stopped fighterbombers made it worse because they flew so low they could put their bombs almost exactly where they wanted they hit the cs artillery positions hard and then came back to strafe whatever else looked interesting and then from up ahead jorge heard a shout no foot soldier ever wanted to hear barrels the big snorting monsters advanced in wedges jorge needed a little while to realize they werent all the same the damnyankees put the largest and toughest ones in the lead they blasted the way clear for the older barrels that came behind where are our barrels he wondered wherever they were they werent close enough to do anything about these machines one of the us machines hit a mine and threw a track its machine guns and cannon went on firing even so jorge picked off a barrel commander standing up in the cupola with a quick burst from his automatic rifle that barrel kept on coming though and sprayed machinegun bullets all around back sergeant blackledge screamed we gotta get back or were all dead whats captain cash say jorge asked how can you say anything when you got your fucking head blown off the noncom said jorge had no answer for that the confederates in and around sparta tennessee had no answer for the oncoming yankees jorge didnt want to get out of his foxhole but he didnt want to get killed where he crouched either he ran for a shattered house and made it then he ran again he was lucky a lot of people werent brigadier general clarence potter had got used to long faces everybody in the war department looked as if his favorite aunt had just walked in front of a bus by the news leaking out of kentucky and tennessee the whole confederacy might have walked in front of a bus what goes around comes around he thought unhappily up in ohio the csa had taught the united states a lot of lessons about how to use armor and mechanized infantry and aircraft together who would have figured the damnyankees made such good students now they were giving lessons of their own and they had more in the way of blackboards and chalk and books than the confederates ever did jake featherston had counted on a quick victorious war when he didnt get one when he got another grapple insteada good big man didnt always lick a good little one but that was sure as hell the way to bet if potter wore a vinegar phiz then and if just about everybody he saw looked the same waywell so what people had earned the right to look gloomy he took frowns as much for granted as he took the smell of smoke and corruption in the air and the sight of plywood or cardboard over almost every window he hardly even noticed that the corners of everybodys mouth turned down he hardly noticed that is till a young lieutenantwho wore the same hangdog expression as everybody elseescorted professor henderson v fitzbelmont into his office no matter how tweedy fitzbelmont was he looked as happy as if hed just got engaged to an eighteenyearold bathing beauty seeing his smile was like getting a surprise flashbulb in the kisser clarence potter couldnt remember the last time hed met such unalloyed joy whats up he asked whatever youre drinking i want a slug too professor fitzbelmont had learned the ropes about security he didnt let out a peep till the lieutenant saluted left and closed the door behind himself only after the latch clicked did he say general we are selfsustaining thats nice potter answered deadpan so youre making enough money that you dont need a handout from the government are you no no no fitzbelmont didnt quite say you damned fool but the thought plainly hovered in his mind then he sent potter a suspicious stare over the tops of his spectacles i believe youre having me on who me potter sounded as innocent as a guilty man could i dont know what youre talking about but he quickly grew serious im not sure i do know what youre talking about so suppose you spell it out for me we have a lattice of uraniumenriched uranium with more u than youd find in natureand graphite that is producing more neutrons in each generation than it needs to generate in order to produce the next generation i seei think does that mean itll go boom if you pull out all the stops or whatever you need to do wellno fitzbelmont admitted but it is an indispensable first step have the united states already done it potter asked you would know for a fact better than i general professor fitzbelmont said potter wished that were true he knew the damnyankees had that establishment out in washington state but that was all he knew he hadnt been able to sneak any spies into the projector if he had they hadnt managed to get any reports out which amounted to the same thing us security there was tight and all the tighter after the confederates bombing raid a few months before fitzbelmont meanwhile went on while i dont know for sure id say its highly likely that matched potters opinion better than he wished it did the united states wouldnt be committing the kind of resources they were if they didnt think they had a winner were they spending more than the confederacy was they hid the budget as best they could so did his own government but he thought they were so theyre still ahead of us he said again i cant prove it again if i were a gambling man id bet that way fitzbelmont said were all gambling men right now professor potter said were gambling that you and your people can get this done before the damnyankees doand before they rip our guts out just in the ordinary way of making war rip our henderson fitzbelmont frowned do i take it that the true state of affairs in kentucky and tennessee is less salubrious than the press and the wireless make it out to be lesssalubrious thats one way to put it abstractly potter admired the professors choice of words the damnyankees were tearing the confederacy a new asshole out west and nobody seemed able to slow them down much let alone stop them we are in trouble over there theyre aiming at chattanooga right now they havent got there but thats where theyre heading oh my professor fitzbelmont said thatsa long way from the ohio river tell me about it clarence potter said hed almost got sent west a couple of times himself not as an intelligence officer but as a combat soldier the war department was throwing every experienced officer into the fight only jake featherstons loud insistence that he needed a spymaster had kept potter in richmond this long even featherstons insistence might not keep him here forever unfortunate fitzbelmont murmured umyou are aware that my teams experiments require large amounts of electricity yes potter said and so the supply has been erratic lately erratic enough to force delays fitzbelmont said i have no idea who can do anything about that but id appreciate it if someone would if you are the person to ask i hope youll pass the word to the proper authorities clarence potter didnt know whether to laugh or to cry he ended up laughing because he didnt want henderson fitzbelmont to see him cry have you been paying attention to the war news professor any attention at all i know its not good fitzbelmont said we were just talking about that but what does it have to do with the electricity supply he was good at what he did there wasnt a better nuclear physicist in the csa potter knew that hed had every one of the small band of physicists investigated but outside his specialized field henderson v fitzbelmont lived up to almost every cliche about narrowly specialized professors as gently as he could potter said you know weve lost a lot of dams on the cumberland and the tennessee the yankees blew some and we blew others to try to slow them down and it didnt work well enough dammit he added but only to himself well yes certainly but much more slowly than it should have a light went on in fitzbelmonts eyes youre telling me those dams produced some of the electricity i use not just what you use professor and you arent the only one feeling the pinch potter said some of our factories have had to cut production and we just cant afford that if we dont have adequate power heaven only knows how we can go forward fitzbelmont said this isnt something we can do with steam engines and kerosene lamps i understand that but you need to understand youre not the only one with a problem potter said how much did that matter would the confederacy let factories work more slowly to make sure the uraniumbomb project stayed on track without the weapons the factories made how were the confederate states supposed to hold back the latest us thrust the other side of that coin was could the confederates hold back the latest us thrust even with all those factories going flatout if the answer to that was noif the answer to that is no what the devil were we doing getting into this war in the first place potter wondered jake featherston had counted on his quick knockout the difference between what you counted on and what you got explained why so many people had unhappy marriages but if the confederate states had to count on the uranium bomb for any hope of victory and if there was no guarantee they would ever get it built and if there was a more than decent chance the united states would beat them to the punchif all that was true the confederacy was in a hell of a lot of trouble do you want to see the president professor potter asked im sure hed be glad to have this news straight from the horses mouth well straight from some part of the horse anyhow henderson fitzbelmont shook his head thank you but thats all right you can deliver it i dont mind i dont mind at all president featherston uh intimidates me president featherston intimidates a lot of people potter said that was true featherston intimidated him and he was a lot harder to spook than any tweedy professor ever born in fairness though he felt he had to go on i dont think he would try to be intimidating after news like this i think hed be much more likely to pull out a bottle and get drunk with you by the look fitzbelmont gave him that was intimidating too how many years had it been since he went out and got drunk had he ever done anything like that with most people potter would have taken the idea for granted he didnt with the professor do i need to know anything else he asked youve got a selfsustaining reaction and you need all the electricity you can steal is that it that is the ah nucleus yes professor fitzbelmont smiled at his own joke so did clarence potter in a dutiful way as quickly as he could he eased the professor out of his office then he called the president of the csathis couldnt wait featherston here that harsh furious voice was familiar to everyone in the csa and doubly so to potter whod heard it in person long before most confederate citizens started hearing it on the wireless the line between his own office and the presidents bunker was supposed to be secure he picked his words with care all the same i just had a visit from the fellow at the university did you now jake featherston said with sudden sharp interest and what did he have to say hes jumped through one hoop potter answered ill send you the details as soon as i can but we really are moving forward hot damn featherston said the fucking yankees are moving forward too i swear to god potter sometimes i wonder if this country deserves to win the war if we let those niggerloving mongrels kick the crap out of us we arent the kind of people i reckoned we were i dont know anything about that sir potter said in lieu of something like i see its not your fault were losing the war its gods fault potter didnt think that was true but even if it were it didnt help because what could a mere mortal do about god i do know our friend thinks he can get this done does he think he can get it done in time hearing that question made potter feel better it showed the president still had a feel for the essential i dont know i dont think anyone knows it depends on how far along the united states are with their own project screw the united states the president said question is can we keep our heads above water any which way till the professors come through that showed a feel for the essential too all things considered clarence potter wished it didnt dr leonard odoull had been with a retreating army now he served with an advancing one from things hed heard most peoples morale was sky high these days his wasnt at an aid station you saw just as much misery going forward as you did going back the only difference was he didnt suppose the confederates were so likely to overrun the tent while he was operating it doesnt seem like enough he said looking up from a resection of a kids rippedup lower intestine granville mcdougald looked at him over his surgical mask yeah well you take what you can get doc the veteran noncom said only thing worse than fighting a war and winning is fighting a war and losing is that really worse odoull put in another suture and another and another sometimes he felt more like a sewing machine than anything else this poor bastards going to be left with a semicolon instead of a colon any which way a semi mcdougald sent him a reproachful stare thats awful doc period did he really say awful or was it offal he was right either way but once you started making puns you also started hearing them whether they were there or not and wasnt that one short step from hearing the little voices that werent there is it better to get shot in a war your side wins than in one where you lose odoull persisted better not to get shot at all mcdougald said a great and obvious truth to which too many people who went down in history as statesmen were blind but he went on if you have to get shot better to do it so not so many people on your side will get shot after you do you really want to see featherstons fuckers opening up with machine guns whenever they feel like target practice all over the usa well no odoull admitted he dusted the wounded soldiers entrails with sulfa powder maybe the kid would escape the wound infection that surely would have killed him in any earlier war maybe odoull started closing if the soldier did live he would have an amazing scar still and all though granny i wonder if i should have come back from quebec so you were thinking about french leave were you mcdougald said and odoull winced undeterred mcdougald went on cant say as i blame you i was tempted odoull admitted i dont think quebec would have let the usa extradite me but i put the uniform on and i cant very well take it off again till things are done nicole had a different opinion but he didnt mention that hey doc that shout from outside the aid tent warned another casualty was coming in this time though eddie added can you work on a civilian the tent wasnt far south of sparta tennessee not all the confederate civilians had fled fast enough odoull had already patched up several chances were they wouldnt be grateful but he figured cs surgeons had done the same up in ohio for equally ungrateful us citizens so he answered sure eddie bring him in ill do what i can for the miserable bastard he paused and turned to mcdougald or do you want me to pass gas while you do the honors sure why not thanks doc mcdougald answered but when eddie and the other corpsmen brought in the casualty it turned out not to be a him but a her she was about thirty groaning the way anyone else with a bloodsoaked bandage on the belly would have aw shit odoull said softly most of the time he didnt get reminded that whole countries were at war not just armies when he did it was like a slap in the face you take the case doc granny mcdougald said all i know about female plumbing stops about nine inches deep god what a braggart you are odoull said eddie snorted the wounded woman fortunately was too far gone to pay any attention to the byplay get her up on the table odoull told the corpsmen ill do what i can for her she feebly tried to fight when mcdougald put the ether cone over her mouth and nose how many soldiers had done the same thing more than odoull could count he and eddie held her hands till she went limp get a plasma line into her odoull said shes lost a lot of blood already doing it mcdougald said and he was ill put a cuff on her too so we can see what weve got with unhurried speed he also did that pressure is over a little low but not too bad pulse is a little thready maybe but i think shes got a chance lets see whats in there odoull opened her upactually he extended the wound she already had shrapnel sure as hell he said and then im going to have to do a hysterectomy your case all right mcdougald said i wouldnt even know where to start i havent done all that many myself odoull said he reached for a scalpel and then after he felt the womb for forceps heres what did it all right he held up a jagged piece of metal about the size of a halfdollar must have been nearly spent or it wouldve torn her up worse than this happy day im sure shes real glad of that mcdougald said yeah i know odoull agreed shes got a tear in her bladder too but i can fix it guts dont seem bad with any luck at all shell make it thatd be good mcdougald said shes harmless now she cant have any kids to shoot at us soldiers when we try this again in christ odoulls hand almost jerked theres a cheery thought itll happen unless we really knock em flat and sit on em mcdougald said you hope we will but what are the odds beats me odoull said but wed have to be crazy to give them a third chance to cream our corn for us yeah and your point is odoull winced again but went on suturing what are we supposed to do we cant occupy the whole csa theyll shoot at us from behind trees and throw featherston fizzes at us forever if we try but how do we hold em down without occupying them kill em all mcdougald said resettle the place from the usa congratulations odoull told him you get an a in jake featherston lessons thems fightin words mcdougald said put up your dukes later odoull said let me finish sewing this gal up first this is a funny business isnt it mcdougald said shes not badlooking and there are you messing with her private parts but shes not a broad or anything shes just a patient yeah that crossed my mind too odoull paused for a moment to make sure a suture was good and tight once upon a time between the wars i went to a medical conference in montreal and i got to talking with this hotshot gynecologist i asked him if he ever got tired of looking at pussy all day he kind of rolled his eyes and said oh jesus do i ever the medic laughed well all right i guess i believe that of course a lot of what hes looking at belongs to little old ladies the young healthy pretty gals mostly dont bother coming to him i wasnt finished yet odoull put in another stitch then went on a couple of years later this guys wife divorced him not easy to do in quebecits a catholic country she had to prove infidelity and she didwith three different patients of his so not all the young pretty ones stayed away that made granville mcdougald laugh some more see i know what happened you asked the wrong question maybe he got tired of looking but do you ever get tired of touching good point odoull looked down at the wounded woman i do believe shell pull through havent had to try that particular surgery for quite a while you looked like you knew what you were doing whether you really did or not mcdougald said thanks a lot granny you really know how to make a guy feel good about himself as odoull started closing the outer wound and the incision that had widened it a new thought struck him where are we going to put her cant just dump her with the wounded pows you know no that wouldnt work mcdougald agreed wheres the closest civilian hospital beats me somewhere north of usthats all i can tell you oh there are bound to be some farther south too but passing her through the lines wont be easy and if we keep moving forward were liable to blow wherever shes staying to hell and gone be a shame to waste your hard work mcdougald said tell you what we ought to dowe ought to just send her back to the division hospital and let them figure out what to do with her theyve got more room for her and more people to deal with her than we do anyway odoull had dealt with the military bureaucracy long enough to know a perfect solution when he heard one well do that all right he said fixing her up was my worry let the guys in back of the line figure out where shes supposed to go she went off to the rear in an ambulance with the wounded soldier on whom odoull had operated not long before theyll probably be pissed off mcdougald remarked too damn bad odoull answered they both stood outside the tent watching the ambulance head off toward sparta whats the worst they can do write me a reprimand right like i give a shit there you go doc mcdougald said thats one nice thing about coming in for the durationyou dont care what the brass hats who run things think of you must be nice he sighed wistfully youre in about the same place arent you odoull pulled out a captured pack of raleighs they probably wont bump you up to lieutenant and youd really have to screw up big for them to take your stripes away youre free he lit a cigarette and smiled as he inhaled let me have one of those would youthanks mcdougald leaned close for a light then took a deep drag of his own youre right and youre wrong doc yeah i can tell em where to head in i guess but i dont really want to most of the time cause this is my outfit ill be here till they dont want me any more youre freer than that i suppose one of odoulls hands touched the oak leaf on his other shoulder he didnt feel very free if it werent for the honor of the thing id rather walk thats what the fellow said when they tarred and feathered him and rode him out of town on a rail isnt it you know who told that joke the first time mcdougald asked and odoull had to shake his head abraham lincoln thats who did he odoull decided he wouldnt tell it again eighty years ago the things lincoln didand the things he didnt domade sure the usa and the csa would go at each other till the end of time few presidents were better remembered washington and jefferson perhaps their memories somewhat tarnished in the usa because they were virginians and undoubtedly teddy roosevelt but only james g blaine came close to lincoln as a failure and blaine wouldnt have had the chance to botch the second mexican war if lincoln hadnt botched the war of secession yes that was one joke leonard odoull would forget jefferson pinkard eyed the letter in front of him with several different kinds of pained incomprehension he understood that it was from magdalena rodriguez down in sonora but he didnt understand much that was in it because although she tried to write english what they thought of as english in sonora wasnt the same as it was in the rest of the csa still he knew what she had to be asking why the devil did her husband go and shoot himself i wish to christ i knew pinkard muttered every once in a while a guard couldnt stand what he was doing and he ate his gun or got rid of himself some other way pinkard knew thatnobody knew it better if it werent true he wouldnt be married to chick blades widow but that hip rodriguez should blow off the top of his headgoddammit he fucking hated niggers still muttering jeff wondered if he ought to call in another guard from sonora or chihuahua to get an exact translation after a few seconds he shook his head whatever was in the letter would be all through the guard barracks in nothing flat if he did he shook his head again he didnt want that to happen hipolito rodriguez was a good man he didnt deserve to get his name dragged through the mud any more than it had to be and that wasnt jeffs only reason he was a friend dammit jeff said and that scared him a couple of different ways anything that happened to hip might happen to him too ever since rodriguez shot himself the weight of the ceremonial on jeffs hip seemed larger and more ominous than it ever had before and when he picked up a submachine gun to walk through camp determination he often shivered what was hip thinking when he turned his the wrong way and jeff hadnt realized how much having a real friend here mattered till he suddenly didnt any more he could talk about stuff with hip without fearing that ferd koenig or jake featherston would find out what he said he could use his war buddy as a back channel to the guardsand they could use rodriguez as a back channel to him too it worked well for everybody except now it didnt and under all that lay the hole one friends death left in the life of another who survived hip and jeff went through desperate and deadly times together no one else remembered themno one else jeff knew which was all that mattered when he and hip talked they both understood the mud and the blood and the stinks and the fear and the occasional flashes of crazy fun that lit up the horror and the wild drunken furloughs theyd got to take too seldom now all that stuff was locked inside jefferson pinkards head he could explain it to other people but that was the point he never needed to explain it to hip hip knew the telephone rang pinkard jerked in his swivel chair son of a bitch he burst out his hand shook as he reached for the telephone im jumpy as a goddamn cat he thought cant let anybody see that or im in big trouble pinkard here his voice came out as a satisfactory growl whats up sir weve got a new shipment coming in the guard officer at the other end of the line sounded both pleased and more than a little astonished should be here in an hour or two good god pinkard said why the hell didnt somebody tell us sooner only thing i can think of sir is that they didnt want the damnyankees listening in the officer replied jeff gruntedthat did make some sense could be he said and maybe theyll let up on this place for a while anyway theyve had their damn propaganda offensive its not like they really give a rats ass about niggers i mean who does for christs sake not me sir the youngster on the other end of the line replied with great conviction didnt reckon you would pinkard said let everybody know whats what we want to give these coons a nice juicy camp determination helloand then a nice juicy goodbye too if he had to he aimed to raise hell to make sure the guards were ready because of the way us airplanes had pummeled the railroads coming west to snyder and the camp things had been painfully slow lately it would have been easy for the men in gray uniforms to slack off but they didnt which made pinkard proud he could tell when the call reached the barracks guards exploded out almost as if they were in a comedy film but it wouldnt be funny when that train got here pinkard was at the railroad spur watching when it pulled into the camp he didnt say anything he would if he had to but the men in charge of the welcoming committeehe chuckled when he thought of it that waydeserved the chance to handle things themselves till they showed they couldnt engine puffing brakes squealing the train stopped right where it was supposed to the engineer was on the ball then that was good because he didnt fall under jeffs command doors opened the familiar rank stench that rolled out of the jampacked cars was even richer and riper than usual the weather was warming up out guards screamed gesturing with their submachine guns move you lousy stinking coons move men to the left officers added men to the left women and brats to the right one of them kicked a dazed black man who fell with a groan get up the officer roared get up you dumb fucking prick you too goddamn stupid to know which is your left and which is your right the negro probably was how many days had he been stuck in that jampacked car with nowhere to turn around nowhere to sit down nowhere to ease himself nothing to eat nothing to drink how many bodies would the guards and the negro trusties find when they went through the train there were always a good many because summer was here there would probably be more than there had been on runs earlier in the year a submachine gun stuttered out a quick burst jefferson pinkard nodded to himself every trainload a few negroes thought they could beat the odds by playing possum every trainload they found out they were wrong no you stupid fuck you cant carry your suitcase into the camp every time some negroes managed to bring things along what was confiscated was supposed to go straight into the war effort some of it did the guards took what they wanted first though that was one of the perquisites that went with this job many of them barely able to stay on their feet the black men shambled through the gate and into the southern half of the camp the women and little children went into the northern half every time men and women waved to one another and promised they would be together again soon yeah you will all rightin hell jeff thought he sighed sure as hell the senior female guard officer would come around and complain that her girls didnt get a chance to help with the unloading shed done that at least half a dozen times she wanted them to get what she thought was their fair share of the loot too damn bad pinkard muttered in case something out here went wrong he didnt want a bunch of flabbling women trying to fix it even or maybe especially if they carried submachine guns too they were all right with barbed wire to back them up they even had advantages over men fewer of them had affairs with negro women but when they did they really fell in love with their colored partners that happened much less often with the men by now the female guards knew how to get the colored women and children into the asphyxiating trucks and the bathhouse on that side of the camp without panicking them the ones who couldnt manage that were gone jeff had had to be firm about that the guards in skirts had powerful backers in richmond but nobody was more powerful than ferd koenig and jake featherston and hed got his way camp determination got another shipment of negroes the next day and two more the day after that it seemed like old times again barracks started filling up as prisoners came in faster than the camp could process them that was how jeff thought of it and that was how it went down on every report it seemed so much moresanitary than talking about killing there was some trouble with the prisoners from the last trainload on the second day as they lined up to get deloused and bathed a man shouted you aint gwine give us no baths you gwine kill us all he wasnt wrong either in general or in particular two guards emptied their submachine guns at him by the time they got done he had more holes than a colander they hit other prisoners tooonly fool luck kept them from hitting other guards nobody could stay smooth and polite after that the only way the guards got the negroes into the bathhouse was by threatening to kill them all on the spot if they didnt get moving an ugly business jeff said when he got to the bottom of it i hope that damn troublemaking nigger cooks in hell forever all his fault yes sir agreed the guard officer in charge of those prisoners we did everything we could we got the job donethats what counts most pinkard said maybe thingsll slow down again so all the spooks who saw this get processed then they wont have the chance to say anything to anybody else thats what really matters yes sir the guard said well have endless trouble if we dont keep it smooth i mean endless jeff went on most of the guards ive got here they didnt serve at a place like camp dependable they dont know what its like when you have to reduce populations by hand he meant marching negroes out into the swamp and shooting them saying what he said was easier on the spirit they dont know what its like to have the niggers knowing their populations gonna get reduced neither its like sitting on a bomb with the fuse primed thats what you hear me uh yes sir the guard officer said once more he was getting more than he bargained for more than he wanted but he couldnt do a thing about it and jefferson pinkard still wasnt through if any little thing goes wrong then the fuse catches and the bomb goes up and then it blows your fuckin ass off you aim to let that happen we gonna let that happen no sir now the guard got to say something else it was the right answer too all right then jeff growled get the hell out of here and well see if we can pick up the processing more niggers we do handle before we get the next trainload in easier thingsll be from then on out instead of agreeing this timeor even disagreeingthe guard got the hell out of there as jeff had said pinkard nodded to himself telling other people what to do was an awful lot better than getting told where he was now the only people who could tell him what to do were the attorney general of the csa and the president no wonder i dont like getting calls from richmond he thought then he laughed because somebody else could tell him what to do his wife he laughed again that was true of any ordinary family man and what else was he got a new young one on the way he said wonderingly he hadnt expected that but he liked it pretty well even if edith did have morning sickness all day long he looked out over the camp and nodded im doing this for him by god xi major angelo toricelli stuck his head into abner dowlings office i have the reply from the war department decoded sir oh good dowling said and then after getting a look at his adjutants face no i take it back it isnt going to be what i wanted to hear is it im afraid not sir toricelli walked in and set a sheet of paper on dowlings desk thanks the commander of the us eleventh army peered down through his reading glasses when he looked over the tops of them toricelli was in perfect focus but the typewritten text in front of him blurred into illegibility he would just as soon have had it stay unreadable philadelphia told him he not only couldnt have any more barrelshe couldnt have any new artillery either he got the impression he was lucky to be able to keep what he had and that it had taken special intercession from the pope or possibly from the secretary of war to keep him supplied with ammunition so much for that he muttered sir toricelli said philadelphia got all hot and bothered about camp determinationfor about a month dowling said now theyve got bigger fish to fry morrells drive into tennessee is going well im not complaining mind youdont get me wrong we need to give featherston a couple of good ones right in the teeth lord knows hes given us too many but that means theyre forgetting everybody west of morrell again colonel defrancis his adjutant began dowling shook his head his aircraft have been hitting other targets lately too i dont blame himwe do need to knock out the enemys factories but nobody seems to be paying attention to the poor damned niggers im afraid youre right major toricelli said signs are that the confederates are shipping more blacks to the camp and taking more bodies away from it weve got aerial recon photos showing theyve dug a new trench in that field where they get rid of the bodies bastards dowling said the word didnt seem nearly strong enough he doubted whether the language had words strong enough to say everything he thought about the confederates who ran camp determination the ones who fed negroes into it and the ones who by backing the freedom party proclaimed that it ought to exist major toricelli shrugged what can we do sir by his tone of voice he didnt think the eleventh army could do anything under normal circumstances dowling would have agreed with him but circumstances here in west texas werent normal he couldnt win the war here no matter what he did he couldnt lose it no matter what he did either when he got plucked from virginia and sent to the wilds of clovis new mexico they told him hed be doing his job as long as he didnt let the confederates take santa fe and albuquerque well the confederates damn well wouldnt they had to be flabbling about what was going on in kentucky and tennessee even more than the united states were their defensive force wouldnt get many new men he was still surprised it had got that unit of freedom party guards i want you to draft some new orders major dowling said toricelli raised a questioning eyebrow dowling explained i want you to order this army to concentrate in and around lubbock and to prepare for an advance as soon as possible and get hold of terry defrancis and tell him to get his fanny over here as fast as he can because well need all the air support we can get yes sir toricelli hesitated hed already given the only proper answer a subordinate should even so he went on what if the confederates try getting around our flanks while were concentrating well what if they do dowling returned major torricellis eyebrow didnt just rise this time it jumped dowling didnt care they havent got enough men or enough barrels around here to surround us and cut us off this isnt pittsburgh and it damn well wont be i aim to make enough of a commotion in these parts so that philadelphia will have to notice me what happens if something goes wrong his adjutant asked i go up before the joint committee on the conduct of the war and they chop off my head dowling said that shut major toricelli up dowling was too old and too stubborn to worry much about what failure would do to his career toricelli doubtless worried about his which was tied to his generals best way to keep everyone except the confederates happy is to make sure things dont go wrong draft those orders major and get defrancis here on the double yes sir toricelli saluted with mechanical precision and left dowling chuckled under his breath hed given general custer plenty of those halfhearted salutes somehow or other the old boy made it work in the end he thought i will too see if i dont terry defrancis arrived within the hour whats up sir he asked your adjutant made it sound like youve got something interesting cooking but he wouldnt go into any detail on the telephone good for him dowling said when confederate sympathizers werent cutting the telephone lines they were tapping them security in occupied west texas was an unending nightmare dowling explained what he had in mind i like it colonel defrancis said with a grin when he finished the more we do the better we do the more attention philadelphia has to pay us may i make one suggestion though go ahead dowling told him i think the axis of attack ought to be northeast not southeast for one thing theyll be looking for a drive on the camp for another its not much farther from here to childresshe used a map to show what he meantthan it is to snyder if we take childress we cut amarillo off from the east by road and by rail dowling had to think about that cutting amarillo off was a bigger military objective than threatening camp determination but the camp was a bigger political plum not without regret he shook his head no colonel well continue on our present line for now if we get the reinforcements were after then we can worry about amarillo prepare your mission plans accordingly yes sir defrancis said like major toricelli he sounded dubious dowling didnt care one way or another he was going to ram this through if george armstrong custers ghost was looking over his shoulder the old bastard must have smiled shifting soldiers from yon to hither occupied the next four days dowling left only tiny screening forces on his flanks calculating that he wasnt likely to deceive the confederates any which wayand also calculating that they didnt have the manpower or the driving will to hurt his army while it was on the move he proved right on the fifth morning us guns in and around lubbock thundered bombers overhead dropped tons of death on the enemy fighters streaked low over the confederate lines to shoot up trucks and command cars and troop columns and anything else they caught out in the open two hours after the bombardment started dowling ordered his infantry and the little armor he had forward he went forward himself in a command car bristling with almost as many wireless aerials as a porcupine had spines major toricelli who was in the car with him was also bristling dowling didnt care about that either he wanted to see what happened at the front not just hear about it from people who were really there the first thing he saw was a long file of prisoners in plain butternut and camouflage brown tramping back toward lubbock herded along by grinning us soldiers in greengray several of the us soldiers carried captured cs automatic riflesthe perfect tools to use if prisoners got out of line the glum confederates seemed likely to behave themselves yall dont fight fair a confederate yelled at the command car dowling waved back as if acknowledging a compliment naturally the terrain right on the confederate side of the line had taken the heaviest pounding from us bombs and shells dowling saw scenes right out of the great war cratered trench lines rusty barbed wire with stretches smashed down flat by barrels so foot soldiers could get through wrecked field guns lying on their sides the only thing missing was the allpervasive stink of death a landscape got after it changed hands three or four times with neither able to bury all the corpses then the rats smiled and grew fat and frolicked as they fed on noisome flesh not all the confederates had surrendered or died a nest of them were holed up in a farmhouse and barn though cut off and surrounded by us soldiers they wouldnt quit an officer in greengray approached the barn with a white flag to see if he could talk them into coming out they fired a burst over his head they werent trying to hit him but they were letting him know they didnt intend to give up he drew back in a hurry is that a bunch of freedom party guards dowling shouted to a sergeant serving a mortar those camouflage cocksuckers the noncom paused to drop a bomb down the tube after a surprisingly small bang it arced through the air to come down between the house and the barn yes sir thats them they fight hard if we get rid of them then the confederates will be in more trouble dowling said as if the holedup elite troops had heard him they aimed one of their machine guns his way he hadnt been under gunfire for a while not since he and daniel macarthur were trying to hold this part of texas in the usa before al smiths plebiscite get down sir major toricelli yelled when bullets kicked up puffs of dust not far from the command car get down hell dowling swung the pintlemounted machine gun toward the barn and let it rip he had acaliber weapon to play with not the riflecaliber gun that was shooting at him his fired bullets almost as big as his thumb the barn had to be more than a mile awaynot much more than a dot on the horizon even so he had confidence he was doing the enemy some harm and the jackhammer roar of the gun was as much fun as a rollercoaster ride the stink of cordite and the clatter of brass as empty cartridges flew from the breech and fell to the floor of the command car only added to the kick he went through a belt as happily as a twelveyearold plinking at tin cans with a if he could have made the confederates surrender all by himself that would have been great no such luck a couple of truckdrawn s pulled up and flattened both buildings in which the freedom party guards were holed up the shells set the barn and the farmhouse on fire even so when us infantrymen cautiously advanced the surviving confederates opened up on them with automatic weapons all in all the freedom party guards fought a firstrate delaying action they did what they set out to do they tied up enough us soldiers to let their buddies withdraw in better order than they could have otherwise but abner dowling with the bit between his teeth was determined not to let that matter much he had more men than the confederates and more artillery and more barrels and many more airplanes as long as i dont do anything stupid he told himself i can drive them a long way could he drive them all the way back to camp determination he aimed to find out flora blackford had needed a while to get used to picking up the philadelphia inquirer and reading good news day after day it seemed strange unnatural almost unamerican but instead of stories of disaster in ohio and retreat in pennsylvania the paper was full of the us drive through kentucky and tennessee and of other progress elsewhere by everything she could tell us bombers were hitting richmond harder than the confederates were hitting philadelphia these days new us airstrips farther south meant birmingham and atlanta were starting to catch it too even the news west of the mississippi seemed good though it often got shoved back to page four or page six out in texas abner dowling was quoted as saying with more men i could move even faster flora wanted general dowlings army to move faster if us soldiers could walk into camp determination or could even take closeups of the vast boneyard where jake featherstons men disposed of dead negroes the world would have to sit up and take noticewouldnt it she wished she hadnt had that last little afterthought when the tsar turned the cossacks loose on the jews in another pogrom did the world sit up and take notice when the turks enjoyed their ancient sport of slaughtering armenians did the world try to stop them when the germans treated the blacks in the congo even worse than the belgians had did anybody get up on his hind legs and complain no and no and no so why would the world flabble undulyor at allabout what the confederates were doing to their own people to hell with the world then flora said there in the moreorless privacy of her office i care whether it does or not her secretary stuck her head into the office did you call me congresswoman no bertha its all right flora said the other woman retreated flora shook her head it wasnt all right or even close to all right and if the world didnt care wasnt that a sign something was wrong with the poor old globe she looked at the newspaper again why should dowling complain that he didnt have enough men he was doing something vitally important shouldnt he get all the soldiers he wanted and more besides her first impulse was to summon the joint committee on the conduct of the war and hold the general staffs toes to the fire in she would have done it she still might do it but shed learned other tricks since then she called the assistant secretary of war instead hello flora franklin roosevelt boomed when she got through to him let me guessyoure going to want me to send about six divisions to west texas and to have them all there yesterday wellyes flora didnt like being so predictable and now youre going to tell me why you claim you cant do it simplest reason in the world we need em more farther east roosevelt said if they go to kentucky and tennessee they gut the confederacy gut it i say if i send them out to abner dowling they step on its toes that will hurt no doubt about it but it wont kill and we want the csa dead sending troops to texas will stop jake featherston from murdering negroes flora said sending troops to texas will stop jake featherston from murdering negroesat camp determination roosevelt said it wont do a damn thingexcuse me but it wontto stop him from murdering them in louisiana or mississippi or east texas the only thing that will keep him from murdering them there is knocking the confederate states flat taking land away from the enemy taking away his factories and his railroads and his highwaysthat will stop him he made more sense than she wished he did is there any way we can compromise flora asked i can see why you dont want to send a lot of men and a lot of equipment to texas i dont like it but i can see it can you send some though the confederates are bound to be having a hard time out there too even a small reinforcement could tip the balance our way youre very persuasive you ought to be in congress roosevelt laughed merrily tell you what ill do let me talk to the gentlemen with the stars on their shoulder straps what they say we can afford well send if they say we cant afford anything they can come before the joint committee and explain why not flora reminded him she had the stick as well as the carrot he only laughed again youre very persuasive he said i suspect you may squeeze a few soldiers out of them after all flora suspected she might squeeze out some soldiers too generals were often happier facing amputation without anesthesia than they were about coming before the joint committee on the conduct of the war amputation only cost you your leg not your career and the pain didnt last nearly so long anything else franklin roosevelt asked hows the other business doing flora wouldnt go into detail or name names over the telephone lines into and out of congress and into and out of the war department were supposed to be extra secure some things were too important to entrust to a line that was supposed to be secure though she still couldnt be sure who besides roosevelt was listening he was equally careful saying only everything seems to be coming along well enough right now thats good theyve made all the repairs they need i havent heard anything different all right anything new from the foreign factories flora hoped he would understand she was asking how the confederacy and germany and england and franceand russia and japan too come to thatwere faring in their quest for a uranium bomb i havent heard anything new lately he replied of course just because i havent heard it that doesnt mean it hasnt happened i know she said unhappily that was true even of the confederates project and they were right across the border and spoke the same language how much could the usa find out about what the germans say were doing they were allies but they were being tightlipped about anything that had to do with uranium the russians and the japanese were probably behind in the raceflora hoped they were anywaybut she didnt see how her country could learn anything about what they were doing unless they got amazingly careless with their codes if i hear anything youll know about it roosevelt promised and then oh that reminds me did he sound a little too casual flora thought he did reminds you of what she asked trying not to show it id like to send a team to your office and to your apartment to sweep them for microphones he said dont want to take chances you know no i suppose not flora sighed all rightgo ahead of course the confederatesor any other spiescould plant mikes again right after the inspection team finished a whore might be healthy when a government doctor looked her over then catch something nasty from her next customer and spread it till she was inspected again in both cases though you had to try thanks flora the leader of the team is a master sergeant named bernstein if hes not there go somewhere else and call the guards will do flora said bye she hung up the team showed up at her office the next morning she exchanged yiddish gibes with sergeant bernstein if he was by any chance a confederate spy he was a brilliant one bertha squawked when he and his men ran their detectors over her desk sorry lady gotta be done he said anything bob he asked the tall blond soldier who was checking there looks like zip carl the private answered he towered over his boss who was little and dark and probably hadnt combed his hair in three or four days they also didnt find anything in floras office either youre clean or the confederates are smarter than they look sergeant bernstein declared which is it likely to be flora asked never can tell he said seriously most of their shuh stuffis just a little behind ours but theyre mighty good with it and some of what they use is ours he made a sour face you can walk into a wireless shop and buy it right on the street and the bastards do is that the price we pay for being a free country flora asked dont ask me im just a shlemiel with stripes bernstein answered but if we stop being free because those mamzrim can steal too easy that aint so good neither he turned to the other soldiers come on bob dick we got other places to check flora found one more question as the men in greengray packed up to go secretary roosevelt said youd come to my apartment too when will that be sergeant bernstein checked some papers in a clipboard day after tomorrow probably in the morning you be there if i wont my son will flora said ill tell him youre coming and that he should let you in oughta work bernstein looked from one of his men to the other you guys arent ready yet watsamaddawidya to get that all out in one word he had to hail from new york city well let me say this dick began bernstein cut him off no dont say it just come on to flora he added get him started and he wont shut up dicks blackly stubbled face burned with resentment but the sergeant got him out of there before he could loose any of it when flora got home she was all set to tell joshua about the soldiers who would stop by in a couple of days but that never happened her son showed her an envelope look what came today he sounded excited about it that particular envelope as flora knew too well hadnt changed much since the days of the great war the old english typography on the cheap paper was almost the same too us army department of selection for service joshua might be excited flora knew nothing but horror we can beat it she said automatically we can quash it no joshua said this is my country ill fight for it the same as anybody else would its not a game joshua flora knew she sounded desperate she felt desperate uncle david walks on one leg cousin yossel never knew his father if anything happened to you i dont think i could stand it nothing will happen mother at eighteen joshua was confident in his own immortality an uncle a cousins father so what joshua had never known the first yossel reisen either he went on after the war theyll ask me what did you do shall i say i hid behind your skirts yes please god yes flora wanted to scream it only the certain knowledge that it wouldnt help kept her quiet she started to cry instead that didnt help either but she couldnt help herself somewhere out ahead in the atlantic the british and french fleets prowled sam carsten kept glancing toward the josephus daniels yranging screens nothing showed up except the returns from the us ships all around the destroyer escort no enemy airplanes had smelled out where the us fleet lay this could be the big one pat cooley said youre rightit could sam agreed i went through the battle of the three navies and i never thought thered be a bigger fight than that but maybe i was wrong this would be a different kind of fight the exec said oh just a little carsten said southwest of oahu us warships had slugged it out with their british and japanese counterparts with big guns this time aroundchances are well never see the fleet that sends airplanes at us and they wont see our ships either weve got some battlewagons along just in case cooley said but i think youre right i know theyre here the dakotas one of em sam shivered i dont ever want to go on another wild rideyou can just bet your ass i dont a shell hit had jammed the battleships steering and she sped on a mad arc through the us fleet ending up much too close to the enemy she took a lot of hits but she kept shooting back too to this day both sides claimed victory in that fight near the sandwich islands as far as sam could tell theyd both lost lieutenant jg thad walters stiffened in front of the yranging set sir ive got a bogey to the northeast the youngster said his voice quivering with excitement give me range and bearing sam snapped as soon as he had them he swung the destroyer escorts blinker light toward the closest cruiser to pass the word the whole fleet of course sailed under wireless silence before he started flashing the cruiser began sending him a signal as he read it he laughed so did pat cooley well sir at least their yranging operator isnt asleep at the switch swell sam said the exec smiled so did sam wryly he couldnt win and he knew it if he said something like swell he marked himself as an oldtimer trying to sound up to the minute but if he said something like bully he marked himself as an oldtimer not bothering to stay up to date which had to be even worse us fighters from the combat air patrol streaked toward the foreign airplane if they let it keep coming it would find the fleet and pass the word on to the enemy ships somewhere off to the east if they shot it down before it found the us ships that would also tell the limeys and frogs something but not so much and if they made it try to run before they shot it down they might be able to use its flight path to get an idea of where the enemy lay sam watched the fighters till they vanished from sight then went over to the yranging screens and watched them there he could tell just when the enemy aircraft spotted them it broke off its advance and turned away as fast as it could go whats that bearing he asked walters sir the course is a little south of east the yranging officer answered so somewhere along that line from where it started thats where the ship that sent it out is likely to be carsten said well we dont know that for a fact sirthat airplane could be bluffing trying to throw us off walters said but i think its a pretty good bet me too sam said and then mr cooley is the cruiser reporting that scout aircrafts course no sir then signal it over there if you please chances are theyre checking it themselves but i dont want to take even the smallest chance with something this important aye aye sir cooley was faster with morse than sam was himself sir weve got a hydrophone contact that was chief bevacqua the cpo was the best man on the ship at making sense of what came back from the pings the underwater equivalent of yranging sent out bearing range about half a mile its shallow sir and the contact feels like a goddamn submersible jesus christ ice shot up sams back a sub that close could sink the josephus daniels easy as you please change course to well give it the smallest target we can man the ashcan flinger pat signal the cruiser that weve got the worst kind of company aye aye sir cooley said again but before he could finish the signal the submarine announced its own presence it cared little for anything as small as the destroyer escort the light cruiser made a much more tempting target two torpedoes slammed into her as soon as she was hit the submersible dove by then though the josephus daniels hovered over the sub depth charges splashed into the atlantic down below the submersible would be doing everything it could to get away but its underwater electric motors were painfully slow the skipper down therebritish french confederatewould have heard the ashcans going into the water could he get away could he get deep enough to avoid and evade even up on the surface each burst from the spread felt like a kick in the teeth then sam heard a noise like a slammed metal doorthe pressure hull caving in from the explosions we got him he said soberly he got us too cooley saidthe cruiser was listing badly do they want us to take men off or does their skipper think shell stay afloat sam asked rage filled him rage at himself destroyers and destroyer escorts sailed with the fleet to keep submarines away he hadnt done his job any enemy country would gladly trade a sub for a cruiser for now they think shell stay up cooley answered more flashing morse came from the cruiser we get an attaboy for sinking that submersible they heard it cave in over there too hot damn sam said bitterly he spoke to the hydrophone operator keep your ears open bevacqua will do sir the petty officer replied i feel like hell on account of that fucker suckered me he mustve snuck in under a warm layer or something even so yeah even so sam said well do your damnedest he didnt look forward to the afteraction report he had to hope he lived to write one more airplanes came off the carriers flight decks and more and still more they formed up into attacking squadrons above the us fleet then zoomed off to the east i think weve found the enemy fleet cooley said thats what we came for sam paused of course they came to find us if they dont already know where were at seeing where our airplanes are coming from will kind of give them a hint i know the limeys have yranging from what ive heard theirs may even be better than ours cooley said im not so sure about the french well once they see the limeys launching airplanes they wont do a whole lot of waiting around after that carsten said and the exec nodded sailors wrestled more depth charges up on deck to replace the ones the josephus daniels used to sink the enemy submersible half an hour went by then thad walters said weve got aircraft coming in from the east sir theyre not likely to be friendlies how far out are they sam asked maybe fifteen or twenty minutes all right thanks it wasnt and sam had no reason to be grateful but he said the polite words anyway then he got on the pa system were going to have company in a little while chances are theyll go after the airplane carriers and battleships ahead of us but you never can tell any which way our job is to get as many rounds in the air as we can some of them will do some good i promise weve put a lot of work in on our gunnery this is where it pays off were a lot better than we were when you took over this ship sir cooley said thanks pat this time sam did mean it but he went on better doesnt count are we good enough well well find out pretty damn quick some of the ships farther east at the very forefront of the us fleet started firing black puffs of smoke fouled the blue sky peering between the puffs with a pair of field glasses sam spotted wings and fuselages glinting in the sun his belly tightened his balls wanted to crawl up from his scrotum hed been on a ship attacked from the air as early as hed been on the remembrance when the japanese sank her good men were going to die here in the middle of the atlantic so would good ships with luck more of them would die a couple of hundred miles to the east out over the curve of the world neither sides ships would see the others today with a thunderous roar the josephus daniels guns cut loosecaliber machine guns twin mm antiaircraft guns and the inch popguns that were her main armament those could reach higher and farther than the lighter weapons but couldnt fire nearly so fast evasive action mr cooley sam said all ahead flank speed aye aye sir the exec relayed the command to the engine room he started zigzagging as the ships speed built up it wouldnt build up enough sam wished for the extra six or seven knots a real destroyer could give him but then how much difference would they make against an airplane a burning fighter slammed into the atlantic before sam could see which side it belonged to a great black cloud of smoke rose from a stricken ship he swore hed known it would happen but that didnt make it any easier to take weve got to keep some carriers sam said more to himself than to anyone else otherwise we wont be able to land our airplanes when they come home a fighter with a bluewhitered british roundel dove on the destroyer escort guns blazing bullets whined through the air and clanged off metal here and there men sprawled in spreading pools of blood sailors got the wounded down to the sick bay the ship had no doctor only a couple of pharmacists mates they would have to do what they could when things calmed down they could transfer the men hurt worst to a bigger ship with a real surgeon or even to a hospital ship uncounted tracers pursued the enemy airplane but it got away exultant shouts rang out a few minutes later when a torpedo airplane splashed into the sea sailors at the forward mm guns jumped and swaggered and pounded their hairy chests like so many gorillas too much was going on too fast in too many places for sam to have more than a vague idea of how this end of the fight was goingand he had no way to know what was happening off to the east if everything here and there went perfectly the battleships could storm off and pound the enemy ships to piecesbut he didnt think things were going perfectly now several greasy black smoke plumes rose into the clean saltscented air i hope were hurting them worse than theyre hurting us pat cooley said exactly echoing his own thought after most of an hour no more enemy aircraft remained overhead theyd either gone down or flown off toward the east they might clash with returning us airplanes coming west as sam steered the josephus daniels toward a listing escort carrier he realized he might have fought in two great naval battles now where nobody had the faintest idea whod won agreat naval victory in the atlantic blared the wireless set behind the bar in the sleazy seaside san diego saloon british and french claims of triumph are the spasmodic bleating of frightened sheep baaa george enos said looking up from his beer what do you think chief just have to wait and see fremont dalby answered what happens next will tell the story they said we were licking the confederates in ohio too when the bastards were really kicking our ass or does it look different to you nah that sounds about right george said if we go on and blast the crap out of the convoys coming up from south america then we honest to god did whip the limeys dalby continued for all the world as if he had an admirals broad gold stripe on each sleeve if they go on and link up with the confederates and give us a hard time in our own waters they walloped us instead i got you george said and if neither one happens its a push fritz gustafson put in there you go dalby nodded emphatically the empty glass in front of him and the ones that had preceded it no doubt had something to do with that emphasis he put money on the bar and the man in a boiled shirt and bow tie behind it gave him a full glass and took away the empty one after a sip the gun chief went on i mean i think we really are no shit smacking the confederates around cause we wouldnt be down in fucking tennessee if we werent past that thoughwell who knows how much to believe who cares as usual gustafson got a lot of mileage out of a few words thats it george drained his beer and nodded to the bartender the man worked the tap but didnt hand over the beer till he got paid george sipped then sucked foam off his upper lip weve got to keep doing our job no matter what the big picture looks like well figure out what it all means later on down at the far end of the bar two marines started slugging at each other sometimes as george knew too well a brawl like that made the whole joint explode this time other young men in forestgreen uniforms grabbed the brawlers and sat on them lots of leathernecks in town lately dalby remarked they train here george said dalby shook his head i mean even besides that he said somethings up i bet could be george said maybe theyre going to go down and take baja california away from the mexicans possible dalby said thoughtfully we tried that in the last war and it didnt work maybe wed have more luck this time around we could blockade the confederates at guaymas george warmed to the ideait was his after all if we did they couldnt even get their subs out that would make it like they didnt have any ports on the pacific ive heard notions i liked less fremont dalby allowed me too gustafson said which was a solid accolade if they send the marines south i bet we go along too george said we could do shore bombardment and keep the submersibles away from the landing craft dalby laughed at him you tell em admiral he said reversing the thought george had had a moment before but that held more admiration than derision for he turned to fritz gustafson and said hes not as dumb as he looks is he not always anyhow gustafson saidmore praise of sorts the next morning george hardly remembered his prediction you could get hung over on beer if you worked at it and hed been diligent the day before black coffee and aspirins took the edge off his pounding headache but left his stomach feeling as if shipfitters were using blowtorches in there his buddies seemed in no better shape that was some consolation but only some two days later the townsend put to sea with several other destroyers the escort carriers that had raided baja california before and a gaggle of slow ugly landing craft surveying them as they waddled along fremont dalby said its a good thing the empire of mexico has a horseshit navy a real fleet could sink those sorry wallowers faster than you can say jack robinson george would have argued except he thought dalby was right im glad im not on one of those scows he said amen brother ben dalby exclaimed youd be puking your guts out every inch of the way i know youve got a good stomachive seen it but you could put a statue into one of those damn things and itd barf brass by the time we got down to cabo san lucas they didnt get down to cabo san lucas the marines went ashore about halfway down the baja peninsula that had dalby and the handful of other oldtimers on the destroyer muttering to themselves the army had landed in almost the same spot during the great war and had had to pull out not much later george couldnt see that it mattered one way or the other once you got south of tijuana baja california didnt have enough of anything except rocks and scorpionsbut it sure had plenty of those the mexican coastal garrison held its fire till the landing craft got close then opened up with several batteries of threeinch guns that were a generation out of date on the big battlefields farther east but that still worked just fine keeping quiet let those guns escape the fury of the dive bombers that flew off the escort carriers to soften up the landing zone before the marines went in as soon as they started firing all the real warships with the flotilla blasted away with their main armament from ranges at which the smaller landbased guns couldnt reply one by one the mexican cannon fell silent they werent playing possum this time either george wouldnt have wanted to be on the receiving end of that shellacking but theyd done more damage than anyone on the us side would have expected a couple of landing craft were on fire and a couple of more had simply gone down to the shallow bottom of the pacific machine guns greeted the men in those dark green uniforms who splashed ashore the dive bombers returned and pounded the machinegun nests so did guns from the townsend and her comrades fighters strafed the rocks just beyond the beach peering shoreward with binoculars fremont dalby said were whaling the crap out of them only bad thing is you cant hardly see them at alltheir khaki matches the landscape real good the leatherheads stick out like sore thumbs poor bastards somebody was asleep at the switch not giving them the right kind of uniforms george said the confederates are starting to wear camouflage for christs sake least we could do is have our guys not look like christmas trees in the desert probably figured we were only fighting mexicans so what difference did it make dalby said thats how they think back in philadelphia but anybody with a rock in front of him and a gun in his hands is trouble what are we doing making things easier for him acting dumb fritz gustafson said which was all too likely to be true they had the time to gab because the townsend didnt come close enough to shore for them to open up with their mm guns that would have let the mexicans shoot back no enemy airplanes appeared overhead if they had the fighters from the escort carriers would have dealt with them before the antiaircraft guns couldgeorge hoped so anyhow he watched the marines hack out a toehold on the barren mexican coast boy if the confederates werent over on the far side of the gulf of california id say the mexicans were fucking welcome to this baja place he remarked you notice the confederate states didnt buy it when they picked up sonora and chihuahua fremont dalby said you notice we didnt take it away after we won the great war goddamn mexicans are welcome to it george looked at his wristwatch other crews coming on pretty soon theyre welcome to it too i want some shuteye he yawned to show how much he wanted it this watchandwatch crap is for the birds what you dont like four hours on four hours off around the clock dalby said in mock surprise you want more than a couplethree hours of sleep at a time shit enos what kind of american are you a tired one george answered a hungry one too if i eat i dont get enough sleep if i dont eat i still dont get enough sleep but i come closer and i get hungry like a son of a bitch i cant win dalby scraped his index finger over his thumbnail theres the worlds smallest goddamn violin playing sad songs for you that shows how sorry i am youre not talking about anything im not doing i know chief george said quickly one advantage of gustafsons usual silence was that he couldnt get in trouble by opening his big mouth too wide and falling in when the other crew took over at the twin mm george raced down to the galley and snagged a ham sandwich and a mug of coffee he inhaled them then climbed into his hammock it was hot and stuffy belowdecks but he didnt care the destroyers fiveinch guns roared every so often but he didnt care about that either he thought he could have slept on top of one of them he was punchy and groggy when he got shaken awake and needed a minute or two to remember where he was and why and what he was supposed to be doing oh god he groaned is it that time already bet your ass charlie his tormentor said cheerfully and went on to rout other victims from sleep the sun had set on the shore tracers zipped back and forth the us marines used yellow or red tracer rounds maybe the mexicans had been buying theirs from the empire of japan because they were ice blue it made for a bright and cheerful sceneor a scene that would have been bright and cheerful if george hadnt known that those tracers along with all the ordinary bullets he couldnt see were fired with intent to kill looks like were holding more ground than we were when i sacked out he said yeah i think so fremont dalby agreed now that were holding it though what are we going to do with it beats me george said but ill tell you one thingid sooner be fighting francisco joses boys than hirohitos any old day well if you think ill argue with that youre crazier than one mans got any business being the gun chief replied the japs are tough and their gear is as good as ours these guystheyre using stuff left over from the last war and you have to figure most of em dont want to be here would you george said its got to be hell on earth hot sun rocks rattlesnakesgotta think so anyway most of those guys probably just want to go back to their farms and make like none of this ever happened sounds good to me dalby said if we go home and the confederates go home whos left to fight see piece of cake theyll be calling with the nobel peace prize any goddamn day now want to split it sure why not george said on the barren desolate coast of baja california something blew up with a rending crash hope that was on the mexican side of the line george said fremont dalby nodded aprivate came up to chester martin with a halfgrim halfsick expression on his face seeing that martin knew what he was going to say before he said it but say it he did sarge they found don bushwhackers caught him it aint pretty shit chester said this is worse than kentucky all right kentucky had gone back and forth between the csa and the usa most people there hated yankees but a fairsized minority didnt even some of the ones who hated yankees understood they didnt come equipped with horns and tails here in central tennessee none of the locals seemed to have got the news they reacted to soldiers in greengray as if to demons from hell some of them ran while the rest tried to fight back civilians werent supposed to fight back if anybodyd told that to the confederates it didnt sink in what are we going to do sarge the private asked i know what i want to do chester answered i want to take hostages and if the bastard who did that to don doesnt turn himself in i want to shoot the son of a bitch yeah the private said savagely i cant do it on my own chester said my assd be in a sling if i tried it but i bet captain rhodes can hubert rhodes was newly in command of the company which had had two cos wounded on backtoback days before he arrived unless he was unlucky martin didnt think hed be easy to kill he was tough and skinny with a thin dark mustache and gray eyes that seemed to see everywhere at once he didnt mind having a noncom head up a platoon which gave him another good mark in chesters book when chester found him he was fieldstripping and cleaning a captured confederate automatic rifle he carried it himself in lieu of the usual officers he put himself where the enemy could shoot at him and he wanted to be able to answer with as much firepower as he could he looked up before chester got very close you couldnt get close to him without his knowing it what can i do for you sergeant he asked by the way he talked he came from somewhere in the midwest damn confederate bushwhackers just murdered one of my men sir martin replied murdered him and did nasty things to the body after he was dead i hope after anyway rhodes mouth was never wide and giving it tightened more than usual now what do you want to do about it he asked what do you want me to do about it take hostages sir chester said we may not make em stop this shit but we can make it expensive for em without looking at the weapon he was working on rhodes reassembled it his hands didnt need his eyes help to know what they were doing he got up and lit a cigarette also confederate plunder sounds good lets do it he said you think tens enough or do you want twenty twenty martin said this isnt the first man we lost like that if featherstons soldiers shoot us its one thing we shoot them too but these cocksuckersthey think nobody can touch em because theyre in civilian clothes well do it captain rhodes said your men up for firingsquad duty if it comes to that chances are it will you know yes sir chester said without the slightest hesitation if its a confederate theyll shoot it old men boys too young to shave maybe even women rhodes persisted wont be a lot of men of military age in this woodbury place the ones who did live there the wars already sucked em into uniform any confederate hostages we take theyll shoot chester martin said confidently they know damn well the confederatesd shoot them if they got the chance then lets round up some soldiers and lets round up some hostages rhodes said rounding up soldiers was the easiest thing in the world by then the whole company had heard about what happened to their comrade had captain rhodes given the order they wouldnt just have taken hostages in woodbury tennessee they would have wiped the place off the face of the earth woodbury might have held five hundred people before the war startedfewer now of course the stores in the center of town were old and weathered the courthouseit was a county seatso shiny and new it had probably gone up in jake featherstons administration slopes north of the courthouse square were given over to crops those to the south held houses soldiers formed a perimeter around the houses then they went through them and seized twenty men all under eighteen or over fifty except for one whod lost his right arm probably in the last war they also killed one old man who fired a shotgun at the us soldiers heading up his walk he must not have taken careful aim he winged one man in greengray but most of the blast went over the soldiers heads once the hostages were taken captain rhodes assembled the rest of the townsfolk in the square they stared at him with sullen hatred only slightly tempered by the snouts of the machine guns staring at them from sandbagged revetments we had a soldier murdered by bushwhackers rhodes told the locals that kind of cowardice runs dead against the laws of war and we dont aim to put up with it weve taken hostages if the killer doesnt come forward inside of twentyfour hours we will execute them i did it a man with a white mustache stepped forward you can shoot me if youve got to shoot somebody what did you do to the body after it was dead chester asked the man blinked i smoked a cigarette over it by god then i went home youre a liar youre brave but youre a liar chester said get back where you belong crestfallen the man went back into the crowd anybody else captain rhodes asked no one said a word he looked at his watch all right the clock is ticking one of the hostages started to blubber you got no business doing this to me he said no business you hear i never done nothin to nobody too goddamn bad said a man in chesters platoon you wasted a hell of a chance then didnt you this wont bring your soldier back another hostage said thats true chester said but maybe itll make somebody else with a squirrel gun and not a hell of a lot of sense think twice and even if it doesnt it pays you people back an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth captain rhodes agreed except were taking a whole mouthful of teeth confederate artillery came in that evening maybe someone managed to slip out of woodbury and let the enemy soldiers know what was going on but the shells mostly fell shortthe front kept moving south chester wasnt sorry not to be right up on the firing line for a while he slept in his foxhole with his springfield beside him if anybody tried to give him trouble he aimed to give it first but he slept till sunup and woke with nothing worse than a stiff back he didnt remember being so tight and sore the last time around of course that was more than half a lifetime ago now hed been a young man then he scratched his belly which was larger these days no he wasnt a young man any more anybody come forward he asked opening a ration can get serious sarge answered one of the soldiers who was already eating those fuckers are brave enough to shoot somebody who isnt looking but they wont put their own necks on the line when it counts that one geezer who tried to volunteer had balls chester said sure but the point is he didnt really do anything the soldier replied the fellow who did sneak around hes still sneaking he must be pretty sneaky too martin said if the people with kin who got taken hostage knew who he was you have to figure somebodyd rat on him to save a husband or a son or a brother the soldier only shrugged hasnt happenedthats all i can tell you well theyve gotwhat another couple of hours chester said the soldier nodded chester shrugged well see what happens then thats all what happened then was what hed expected us soldiers paraded the hostages out to the town square some soldiers had set a post in the ground in front of the courthouse captain rhodes ordered the townsfolk of woodbury out to watch the executions this is what you get when civilians try to fight in a war he said youd better remember it he gestured to chester martin will you do the honors yes sir don was in my platoon chester waited till the soldiers had tied the first hostage to the pole then he gestured to the men in the firing squad ready they brought up their springfields aim the riflemen drew a bead on the white paper pinned over the hostages heart fire a dozen rifles barked as one the hostage slumped against his bonds blood poured from his wounds he writhed but not for long in the crowd a couple of women screamed another one fainted so did a man us soldiers cut the dead hostage down and marched another one a young one over to take his place the youths shout of freedom cut off abruptly when the men from the firing squad pulled their triggers more screams rang from the crowd a girl about his age tried to charge the soldiers not too roughly they kept her from hurting them or herself then shoved her back to her relatives the locals held on to her to make sure she didnt try again most of the hostages died as well as men could four or five wept and begged it did them no good chester called readyaimfire over and over again finally the men in greengray cut down the last bloody body bury your dead captain rhodes told the townsfolk and remember chances are whoever made us do this is still right here with the rest of you some of you may even have a pretty good notion who he is but he kept quiet and you kept quiet and this is what you get you leave us alone we wont harm you if you break the laws of war youll pay you have paid the courthouse square stank of cordite and blood and shit it stank of fear too chester had smelled that smell too many times to have any doubts about what it was for once he didnt smell his own fear he made sure he patted each man from the firing squad on the back you did good he told them that wasnt easy doing what you guys did im proud of you those fuckers had it coming said one of the men in greengray several other soldiers nodded but another man said youre right sargeit wasnt easy they were justpeople they didnt hurt anybody i did this once but i dont think i ever want to do it again all right lewis you wont then martin promised go off and smoke a cigarette if youve got any booze take a knock ill look the other way you earned it i dont sarge lewis said mournfully dont worry about it frankie another soldier said i got a pretty good idea where you can get your hands on some chester turned his back so they wouldnt see him smile they were kids doing a mans job what about me he wondered im no kid any more he was trying to do a mans job too and it wasnt any easier for him than it was for them arifle on his shoulder jonathan moss trudged along through the muggy hell that was summertime in georgia he turned to nick cantarella and remarked up at feet where im supposed to be fighting its cold enough for me to need fur and leather even up above this its still that cold yeah well thats how the ball crumbles the infantry officer answered thats the way the cookie bounces spartacus looked from one escaped us pow to the other you damnyankee ofays you fuckin crazy you know dat the guerrilla leader said thanks moss said which wasnt likely to convince spartacus he was wrong cantarella chuckled a couple of the blacks who were close enough to listen to the byplay tapped index fingers against their temples or spun them by their ears to show whom they agreed with the guerrillas held the countryside it did them less good than moss wished it would with so many big farms growing one big cropcotton or peanuts or tobaccoand with so many negroes taken off the countryside after agriculture was forcibly mechanized the rebels had a devil of a time feeding themselves some of their raids on towns came from no better reason than the need to steal enough food to keep from starving towns were going hungry too trains had cars that mounted machine guns and cannon trucks traveled in convoys with machineguntoting command cars guerrilla bands shot at them and planted explosives under roads and along railroad tracks anyway spartacus machineguncarrying pickup had done some nasty work driving alongside roads and shooting up trucks that stuck to them what are we going to do next moss asked spartacus back in the usa he wouldnt have imagined ever taking orders from a black man but spartacus unquestionably led this band a word from him to his followers and both moss and cantarella would die the next instant but all he said was don know fo sho wish to jesus i did best thing i kin think of is to keep on movin east foraging do seem better over dat way he had a tredegar slung over one shoulderand a ham slung over the other not so many mexicans over that way neither nick cantarella said moss could follow cantarella when he spoke he could follow spartacus when he spoke too trying to follow one of them on the heels of the other sometimes made him feel he was shifting mental gears too fast for comfort not yet spartacus said dey hear wes operatin in them parts though dey git over there pretty damn quick maybe moss said but maybe not too they arent what youd call eager to mix it up with us not their fight cantarella said i was them i wouldnt want anything to do with a bunch of crazyass smokes ofays hereabouts make them greasers fight spartacus said make em pretend to fight anyways how good they aim how hard they push when they comes after usmebbe a different story has been so far moss said francisco joses soldiers showed no more enthusiasm about being in georgia than moss would have shown in the yucatan and if peasants in the yucatan tried to kill him when he came after them he wouldnt go after them very hard big worry is theyre liable to find an officer with a wild hair up his ass cantarella said they get a guy who makes his troops more afraid of him than they are of us they can give us trouble before moss or spartacus could answer the guerrillas point man waved everybody stopped they were coming out of pine woods into more open more cultivated country or maybe they werent coming out whats up spartacus asked in a penetrating whisper somethin dont look right up ahead answered the point man a small scrawny very black fellow named apuleius dont look right how spartacus asked what you mean apuleius shrugged dunno too quietlike maybe reckon somebodys layin for us out there spartacus asked the point man shrugged again spartacus frowned cant go back or stay here fo good he said nobody argued with him that was selfevidently true his frown got deeper we gonna have to smoke em out then ill go out see what they do an army officer would have sent a private or several privates into the open to do the same job spartacus led by force of personality not force of military law he had to show the men who followed him that he was worth following that meant exposing himself to danger instead of them out of the woods he sauntered he left his tredegar and the ham behind he might have been a happygolucky negro without a care in the world he might have beenif jake featherston and the freedom party hadnt made negroes without a care in the world extinct along with the rest of the band moss and cantarella watched from the woods moss knew more than a little relief that spartacus hadnt told the two white men to scout what was up ahead if mexican soldiers lurked in the fields their color might have done the trick but their accents would have betrayed them to confederates as soon as they opened their mouths for a moment moss thought apuleius was flabbling about nothing spartacus strolled along and nobody bothered him then a shout rang out seemingly from nowhere like a chipmunk popping out of its hole a grayhaired confederate in a gray uniform stood up in what looked like a plain old field of peanuts he pointed a rifle at spartacus three other white men appeared and went over to the negro one of them held out his hand spartacus produced papers they were more or less genuine the negro whose picture was on them even looked something like the guerrilla leader spartacus pointed east down the road toward perry the closest town the whites put their heads together after a minute or two they waved for him to pass on he sketched a salute and walked off in the direction toward which hed pointed back in the woods the men he led scratched their heads what you reckon we should oughta do now one of them asked nick cantarella he wasnt spartacus secondincommand in any formal sense but the negroes recognized that he had a professionals sense of tactics now we know where theyre at cantarella said and the black man nodded the us officer went on we could set up the machine gun over there sayhe pointedand attack from a different angle while theyre trying to take it out could work the negro agreed yeah cantarella nodded but itd make a lot of noise and probably draw everybody and his goddamn dog over this way that aint good news other thing that occurs to me is we could just sit on our asses here till dark and try and get past this position then spartacusll be waiting up the road for us somewhereyou can count on that after talking it over in low voices the guerrillas decided to wait it out moss thought that was a good idea we cant send for reinforcements if things go sour he said theres a sayingthere are old pilots and there are bold pilots but there are no old bold pilots makes sense apuleius said as point man he recognized the need for caution more than most of the others if he got bold when he shouldnt hed end up killing himself and probably a lot of his comrades too they waited under the trees midges and the nasty little biting flies the negroes called noseeems buzzed around eventually the sun sank as darkness deepened cantarella peered east with a pair of field glasses some mexican officer didnt need any more fuck me he said softly now whats wrong jonathan moss asked theyve got somebody cute in charge of them cantarella answered they arent leaving theyre moving to new positions closer to the road so they can make sure nobody sneaks by what i wouldnt give for a mortar right now fight our way through moss didnt like the idea and he was sure his dislike showed in his voice i dont want to cantarella said even if we win itll cost us and itll draw more of these militia assholes and mexican soldiers down on us just like shit draws flies you say the ofays is by the road apuleius asked nick cantarella nodded is all of em there the negro persisted i dont know for sure cause i dont know how many of em were out there to begin with cantarella said but a good many of em moved how come on account of mebbe i kin git us around em in the dark apuleius replied wouldnt want to try in the daytime they see us sure but at night without no moongot a fair chance anyways lets do it cantarella wasnt a man to whom hesitation came naturally well go in full combat array ready to fight if we have to but well sneak if we can then he seemed to remember he wasnt a us army captain any more and couldnt just give orders he had much less authority here than spartacus did is that all right with youse guys he asked the guerrillas nobody said no they got to their feet and shook themselves out into a line from which they could go into action if they needed to everyone checked to make sure he had a round chambered and his safety off then as quietly as they could they left the corner of the pine woods and sneaked left following apuleius one man at a time the point man found or knew about a track through the fields a lot of the negroes were barefoot they moved as silently as ghosts their dark skins also made them harder to spot moss shod and with what didnt feel like enough dirt on his face and arms felt conspicuous every time one of his feet came down he waited for a shout from near the road which didnt seem far away at all worse he waited for a volley from the white mens rifles thunder and the lightning of muzzle flashes splitting the night those oldtimers in gray couldnt be so blind and deafcould they maybe they could moss spotted a couple of glowing coals in the militiamens positions they were smoking and they werent being careful about it jesus if i was a fuckin sniper cantarella whispered moss didnt want to say a word for fear his voice would carry but he nodded the same thing had occurred to him the whites over there should know better careless smoking in the trenches got plenty of soldiers killed in the great war no challenge rang out nobody fired none of the guerrillas tripped over his own feet or dropped his weapon or did any of the other simple deadly things that were all too easy to do apuleius led the line back toward the road if the militiamen had had a deep positionbut there werent enough of them for that just when moss thought he was safe when he could breathe more than tiny sips of air a human shape loomed out of the darkness ahead he almost fired from the hip then he realized it was spartacus i was hopin yall didnt run off an leave me the negro said dryly not us that other gal she nothin but a pretty face apuleius answered laughing softly the guerrillas tramped on through the night xii sergeant armstrong grimes looked at winnipeg from the prairie due south of the city as usual smoke shrouded the view bombers the confederates would have hacked out of the sky with ease were more than good enough to lower the boom on enemies who didnt have fighters or antiaircraft guns that was as true in canada as it had been in utah how much good the endless bombing would doits gonna be craters like on the moon armstrong said pausing to light a cigarette not far from him yossel reisen was doing the same thing he said something even worse its gonna be craters like salt lake city fuck armstrong muttered not because yossel was wrong but because he was right every pile of bricks in salt lake hid a rifleman or a machine gun if it worked the same way hereif it worked the same way here the regiment would take a hell of a lot of casualties a harsh chatter rang out in the distance armstrong and yossel looked at each other in dismay its one of those goddamn machinegun cunts yossel said and armstrong nodded they hadnt been in canada long but soldiers language didnt need long to hit bottom machinegun pickup went through machinegun whore on the way down an antibarrel cannon boomed the canucks on the pickup truck went right on shooting back pickups were a lot faster than barrels on flat ground they were a lot more mobile too and they made much smaller targets the antibarrel cannon fired againand missed again put your spectacles on the next time dears armstrong said in a disgusted falsetto yossel snickered the antibarrel cannon boomed one more time a couple of seconds later there was a different boom and a fireball to go with it they listened to you yossel exclaimed yeah well that makes once armstrong said an officer blew a whistle soldiers trotted forward armstrong and yossel veered apart from each other they both dodged like brokenfield runners and bent as low as they could they didnt want to make themselves easy to shoot every time armstrong saw a motorcar he shied away from it the canadians used auto bombs as the mormons had theyd added a new wrinkle too wirelesscontrolled auto bombs they loaded a motorcar with explosives put it where they pleased and blew it up from a mile awayfrom farther than that for all armstrong knewat the touch of a button when they saw enough us soldiers near it to make the detonation worthwhile sooner or later explosives menmost of them borrowed from bomber squadronswould go over the motorcars one by one to defang the machines that did carry explosives that was dangerous thankless work the canadians had boobytrapped some of their auto bombs to go off when somebody tried to pull their teeth one thing armstrong said when he and yossel happened to dodge together again the fire from up ahead wasnt badhed known plenty worse the canucks didnt have many defenders in the outermost suburbs of winnipeg anyhow whats that yossel asked if an auto bomb blows up while youre trying to defuse it youll never know what hit you armstrong said a bullet kicked up dirt between the two men they both flinched yeah you got something there yossel said each of them had seenand listened tomen die knowing exactly what had hit them and in torment till death released them armstrong had never killed a man to put him out of his misery but he knew people who had he knew he would if he ever found himself in a spot like that he hoped somebody would do it for him if he ever found himself in a spot like that which was not the sort of thing he wanted to be thinking when he got shot one second he was loping along happy as a clam how happy were clams anyway the next his left leg went out from under him and he fell on his face in the dirt he stared in stupid wonder at the hole in his trouser leg and at the spreading red stain around it oh for christs sake he said more in annoyance than anything else i stay lucky for two years and then this shit happens he thought then the pain reached his brain and he howled like a wolf and clutched at himself he knew what had hit him all right and wished to god he didnt he scrabbled for the pouch that held his wound dressing the sulfa powder he was supposed to dust on the wound before he used the bandage and the morphine syrette that might build a wall between him and the fire in his leg sergeants down somebody yelled corpsman two or three soldiers shouted the same thing armstrong detached the bayonet from the muzzle of his springfield and used it to cut away his trouser leg so he could give himself first aid he felt sick and woozy he also bit his lip against the pain the wound hadnt hurt for the first few seconds after he got it but it sure as hell did now my old man got hit just about like this he thought as he sprinkled sulfa powder into the hole in his calf hed never had a whole lot in common with his father this wasnt the way he wanted to start merle grimes still used a cane to take some of the weight off his bad leg armstrong hoped that wouldnt happen to him he slapped on the bandage then he yanked the top off the syrette stuck himself and pushed down on the plunger he felt more squeamish about that than he had about the bandage or even the wound he was hurting himself on purpose he knew he would feel better soon but knowing didnt make a whole lot of difference once hed done what he could for himself he looked around for cover he didnt see anything close by he pulled his entrenching tool off his belt and started digging it wouldnt be much of a hole no doubt but anything was better than nothing he piled the dirt from the scrape in front of him enough of it might stop a bullet or at least slow one down hed just got up a halfway decent dirt rampart when medics crouched beside him here you go sergeant one of them said can you slide onto the stretcher sure armstrong was amazed at how chipper he sounded he didnt care about anything the morphine had taken hold while he was digging he didnt slide so much as roll onto the stretcher another medic looked at his wound the man with the red cross armbands and smock and helmet markings poked at it too which hurt in spite of the shot he did a pretty good job patching himself up he reported i dont think the bones are broken looks like a hometowner to me he gave armstrong an injection too before the wounded man could tell him not to bother where you from sergeant asked one of the corpsmen at armstrongs head uh washington dc i mean armstrong answered vaguely that second shot was kicking like a mule he felt as if he were floating away from himself the medic didnt seem to see anything out of the ordinary in the way he talked the man laughed if thats your home town youre safer staying away damn confederates have worked it over pretty good i hear folks are all right as far as i know armstrong said then the corpsmen picked up the stretcher and carried it away armstrong had felt as if he were floating before now he floated and bounced red cross flags flying around the aid station and red crosses painted on the tents themselves told the canucks not to shoot this wayor gave them targets depending one of the medics let out a yell doc hey doc we got a casualty thats what i am all right with two shots of morphine in him the idea didnt bother armstrong a bit bring him in somebody yelled from the other side of the canvas in armstrong went he smelled ether and other chemicals he couldnt nameand blood enough blood for a butchers shop where are you hit soldier a bespectacled man asked from behind a surgical mask leg armstrong answered the corpsmen slid him off the stretcher and onto the operating table the doctor peeled off the bandage hed put on and studied the wound youre lucky he said after perhaps half a minute my ass even doped to the gills armstrong knew bullshit when he heard it if i was lucky the fucker wouldve missed me hes got you there doc one of the medics said laughing oh shut up rocky the surgeon replied without rancor he turned back to armstrong im going to give you a shot of novocaine to numb you up then ill clean that out it should heal fine you may not be as lucky as you like but youll do all right he wasnt especially gentle and he didnt wait for the novocaine to take full effect before he started working with a probe and forceps and a scalpel armstrong yipped a couple of times then he did more than yip christ on a crutch doc take it easy he said sorry about that the surgeon didnt sound very sorry he didnt take it easy but went on no offense but i want to get you taken care of in a hurry so i can deal with a bad wound if one comes in thanks a lot armstrong said easy for you to talk like thatit aint your goddamn leg well no the medico said but its not an amputation either or a sucking chest or a belly wound or a bullet in the head youll be back on duty in six weeks or so in the meantime you get to take it easy while you heal could be worse as he spoke he did some more snipping armstrong yelped again after what seemed like forever and was probably about ten minutes the surgeon gave him a shot whats that armstrong asked suspiciously tetanuslockjaw the man answered he eyed armstrong over his mask locking your jaws might be an improvement all things considered funny doc hardeharhar im laughing my ass off you know what i mean get him out of here the surgeon told the corpsmen some other poor bastardll come along pretty damn quick they carried armstrong over to a tent next to the aid station and put him on a cot ambulancell be along in a while one of them said happy day he answered they were shaking their heads when they left the tent he couldnt have cared less the tent held a dozen cots counting his five of them were occupied none of the other wounded men was in any shape to talk one of them had bloody bandages around his head one had lost an arm two had torso wounds three including the man whod been shot in the head were deeply unconscious the other one moaned from time to time but didnt come out with any real words looking at them listening to them armstrong reluctantly decided the smartass surgeon had a point if he had to get wounded he could have done a lot worse than catching a hometowner despite the morphine and novocaine his leg barked again he muttered under his breath then he brighteneda little anyhow his old man had always thought he wasnt quite good enough that he never did enough if his father tried saying that now armstrong promised himself hed knock his goddamn block off lulu looked into jake featherstons office general forrest is here to see you mr president she said send him in then jake growled his secretary nodded and ducked out to bring back the chief of the confederate general staff nathan bedford forrest iii looked pale and pasty the look of a man who spent most of his time underground and didnt see the sun very often featherston looked the same way but he hardly noticed ithe saw himself all the time forrest nodded to him mr president he said hello general jake leaned forward across the desk are we ready to hit back at those damnyankee sons of bitches general patton thinks so sir and hes the man on the spot forrest answered hes the man on the spot all right jake featherston said his eyes went to the map on the wall of his office the confederates had been gathering men and materiel east of the appalachians for weeks aiming to strike at the us flank if everything went the way it was supposed to they could cut off the yankees in tennessee and bundle the ones in kentucky back to the ohio that would put the war on even terms again but if things didnt go the way he wanted them towe cant afford to fuck this up yes sir nathan bedford forrest iii said stolidly jake swore under his breath hed never thought it would come to this when he ordered his armies into motion against the usa the yankees were the ones who were supposed to be fighting for their lives not his side he swore again on a different note a moment later hed already survived two assassination tries if the war kept going down the toilet he knew damn well hed have to worry about another one even a vice president as pliable as don partridge might start getting ideas so might clarence potteras if he didnt have them already but he might decide to do something about them the coldblooded son of a bitch nathan bedford forrest iii might get some of his own too is security tight jake asked tight as we know how to make it forest answered it better be it better be tight as a fiftydollar whores twat jake said and the chief of the general staff let out a startled laugh featherston went on if the damnyankees figure out what were up to before we get rolling they can give us all kinds of grief right youd better believe it sir if theyve got a gopher planted somewhere between here and general pattons headquarters thats a problem forrest replied and if he can pass on whatever he knows i mean yeah yeah jake said impatiently what are the odds mr president i just dont know nathan bedford forrest iii spread his hands we still have gophers in the usa and with us forces the yankees are bound to be doing the same thing to us too goddamn hard for one side to root out all the spies from the other we just sound too much alike whether theyve got somebody in the right place whether the son of a bitch can pass on what he picks up if he picks up anythingwell have to find out i hope to god we dont find out the hard way but i cant be sure most men in forrests place would have told jake featherston what they thought he wanted to hear that everything was fine that of course the united states had no chance of finding out what was going on reluctantly featherston respected the younger mans honesty if you promised the moon and couldnt deliver wasnt that worse than not promising in the first place all right well see what happens jake tried telling himself what he wanted to hear maybe the yankees wont believe wed try coming through the mountains even if some stinking spy tells them we will maybe but general forrest sounded dubious remember sir thats general morrell in charge of their spearhead he wont be easy to fool hes the kind whod take armor through the mountains himself so hes too likely to think wed try it too i suppose featherston forced himself to nod no youre bound to be right dammit i sure wish wed punched his ticket for good some lousy busybody of a sergeant threw him on his back and toted him out of the line of fire i hear nathan bedford forrest iii didnt say anything the expression on his face was hard for jake to fathomand then all of a sudden it wasnt sure as hell forrest was thinking takes one to know one and sure as hell he was right jake damn well had been a lousy busybody of a sergeant clarence potter remembered that even if forrest couldnt anything else jake asked no mr president thats whats going on now well go from there then tell patton to give em hell tell him i said so i will sirwhen im sure the damnyankees cant hear me do it forrest got to his feet saluted and left the office once jake was sure the general was on his way back to the war department he stuck his head out and asked whos next lulu the attorney general is waiting to see you mr president well you know you can send him in featherston said ferdinand koenig lumbered into the office a moment later unlike forrest he was older than jake and also much heavier than the president who retained a whipcord leanness good morning koenig rumbled i hope so jake said you couldnt prove it by me though he pointed at the map the us thrust aimed straight at chattanooga it was getting too close too i expect youll do something about that before too long ferd koenig didnt know the details he didnt need or want to know them either i expect i will too jake said no more than he had to the less you told people the less they could blab ferd wasnt the kind of guy who ran his mouth featherston wouldnt have put up with him for a second if he were but even an inadvertent slip might hurt badly here so why take chances the president said whats on your mind today about what youd expect the mess in texas jake featherston grunted it was a mess no two ways about it when we built camp determination way the hell out there at the ass end of nowhere we never reckoned the damnyankees would give us so much trouble about it thats the truth koenig said unhappily only goes to show the bastards really are a bunch of niggerlovers jake said how far from the camp are they he already knew but didnt feel like admitting it about forty miles now theyre throwing everything theyve got out there into the attack the attorney general said theyve got more out there than we do too we need reinforcements mr president we need em bad i cant give you more army men dammit jake pointed again to the map showing the ominous yankee bulge everything we can grab were using against that he sighed talking about texas meant talking about kentucky and tennessee after all he might have known it would things fit together however much you wished you could you couldnt look at any one part of the war in isolation can i have more freedom party guards then koenig asked ive got to do something jake or the damnyankeesll take the camp away from us we cant afford to let that happenyou know we cant it screws up the whole populationreduction program and it hands the usa a propaganda victory like you wouldnt believe he wasnt wrong sometimes though propaganda defeats had to take a back seat when you were nosetonose with real military defeat jake didnt want anything to get in the way of cleansing the confederacy of negroes but he didnt want to lose the war either he felt more harried than hed ever dreamt he could never a man who compromised easily he knew he had to now yeah you can raise some more guards units he said we arent short of weapons and we arent short of uniforms by god but ill tell you something else toowe better set up a new camp some place where the damnyankees sure as hell cant get at it when its ready to roll just move the guard staff and start shipping in niggers what about the ones whore already in camp determination koenig asked well what about em jake said ferd was a sharp guy but sometimes even sharp guys missed seeing the obvious oh the attorney general turned a dull red to hide his embarrassment he made a small production of lighting up a habana after a couple of puffs he went on yeah thatll take care of itself wont it jeff pinkard wont be happy about moving though camp determinations his baby tough titty featherston said where its at his babys getting to be more trouble than its worth if theres no camp in west texas the united states dont have any reason for pushing farther in except for determination whats there lubbock koenig said amarillo big fucking deal jake was massively unimpressed the united states are welcome to both of em they want to set up their phony state of houston again theyre welcome to do that too far as i can see they got more grief from it last time around than anything else youve got a good way of looking at things koenig said well i hope so right now what weve got to do is take care of the shit that wont wait featherston aimed a forefinger at the map one more time after weve dealt with that then we go on with the rest of it he made everything sound simple and obvious and easy hed always had that knack usually making things sound easy was good enough in a fight for your life thoughferd koenig could see that too we need to hit the yankees hard he said bet your sweet ass ferd jake was thinking of henderson v fitzbelmont about whom he devoutly hoped the attorney general knew nothing or next to it we will too you better believe it ive believed you for twentyfive years now koenig said im not about to quit good jake meant it from the bottom of his heart youve believed in me longer than anybody these days that was true of people he still knew clarence potter had met him before ferd did but potter hadnt always followed him he wasnt sure if potter ever really followed him potter was loyal to the country not to the freedom party or to jake featherston himself weve come a long way you and me ferd said weve brought the country a long way too were not niggerfree but were getting there damn straight jake said well get where were going by god even if the damnyankees come up shockoe hill and we have to fire at em over open sights we wont ever quit and as long as we dont quit they cant lick us i sure hope not koenig said dont you worry about a thing you dont see any us soldiers in richmond do you featherston waited till his old warhorse shook his head then went on and you wont either not ever were going to win this son of a bitch not just get a draw so we can start over twenty years from now were going to win sounds good to me the attorney general said it also sounded good to jake featherston he hated relying on a goddamn professor but knew too well he was irving morrell dismounted from his command barrel a few miles north of delphi tennessee his force wasnt within artillery range of chattanooga not yet but us guns werent far from being able to reach the linchpin of the first part of the campaign the united states had come farther and faster than hed dreamt they could when the summers fighting started to his mind that said only one thing the confederates had thrown everything they could into their opening offensives and it hadnt been enough they didnt have enough left to fight a long war which didnt mean he wasnt worried about what they did have the bright young captain whose command car rolled to a stop near morrells barrel wore a uniform with no armofservice colors or badges if a cryptographer got captured he didnt want the enemy knowing what he was he also didnt want to spread around what he knew morrells barrel carried every kind of wireless set under the sun that was what made it what it was but if the united states were deciphering cs codes you had to assume the confederates were doing the same thing to us messages what the enemy didnt overhear he couldnt very well use against you hello captain shaynbloom morrell said what have you got for me today sol shaynbloom was thin and pale with a bent blade of a nose and thick glasses he looked too much like someone who would go into cryptography to seem quite real but he was he handed morrell a manila folder latest decrypts sir he said and some aerial photos to back them up lets see what weve got morrell studied the decoded messages and the pictures well well he said at last they are getting frisky over there arent they yes sir captain shaynbloom said more of a buildup on our flank than in front of us as a matter of fact morrell had a map case on his hip he pulled out a map and unfolded it sohere and here and here eh he pointed thats probably what id do in their shoes too theyll try to cut us off and roll us back to the ohio can they the codebreaker asked i hope not morrell said mildly but that wasnt what the other man wanted to hear smiling a little morrell went on i think were ready for them if we are your section will have an awful lot to do with it shaynbloom smiled thats what were here for sir then his smile disappeared if we do smash them as they try to break through i hope they dont realize how well were able to read their codes no that wouldnt be good morrell agreed but sometimes the cards arent worth anything unless you put them on the table this feels like one of those times to me all right sir i guess youre right captain shaynbloom said id better be morrell thought being right in spots like this is what they pay me for he wasnt in it for the money but the extra salary he earned with stars on his shoulder straps acknowledged the extra responsibility he held and if he was wrong a couple of times they wouldnt take the rank or the pay away from him they would just put him in charge of the beach in kansas or the mountains in nebraska and try to forget theyd ever had anything to do with him another command car pulled up alongside the first whats this morrell said i thought they only gave one to a customer he made it sound like a joke but his hand dropped to the butt of the on his belt even so the confederates had already tried to assassinate him once they might well be up for another go at him but he recognized the officer who got out first lieutenant malcolm williamson bore almost a family resemblance to sol shaynbloom both were skinny and pale and fair and both looked more like graduate students than soldiers williamson also wore an unadorned uniform saluting both shaynbloom and morrell he handed the latter an envelope we just got this sir lets have a look as morrell opened the envelope he asked do you know whats in it can i talk about it in front of you yes sir and in front of the captain williamson answered its not that kind of thingyoull see in a second fair enough nodding morrell unfolded the paper in the envelope and read the message someonemaybe williamsonhad scrawled on it well well he said so general patton will be in charge of the confederate thrust im honoredi suppose i wondered if he would be shaynbloom said hes sort of fallen off the map the past few weeks hes back on it now morrell said its a compliment to me i guess but i could do without it hed heard from someone or other that patton developed his slashing style by studying his own campaigns during the great war maybe that was true maybe it wasnt if it was it made for another compliment morrell didnt really want patton was too good at what he did well lick him sir as a lieutenant williamson wasnt prone to the doubts that could cloud a generals mind who gives a damn how tough he is weve got the horses to ride roughshod over him he didnt even mix his metaphors a common failing for everyone from the president on down do we know their precise start time morrell asked if we do we can disrupt them with spoiling bombardments ahead of time the more we can do to throw their plan and their timing out of whack the better off well be williamson and shaynbloom looked at each other they even wore the same usissue steelframed spectacles though shaynblooms lenses were noticeably stronger as one man they shook their heads havent got it yet sir they chorused shaynbloom adding but it cant be long youre right about that morrell said theyll know they cant hide a concentration very long itll have to be soon if you find out exactly when soon is let me know as fast as you can well counterpunch if we have to but getting in the first lick is even better yes sir their voices didnt sound alike williamsons was an octave deeper they tore off almost identical salutes returned to their command cars and roared off to wherever they worked their codebreaking magic morrell didnt know where that was what he didnt know he couldnt spill if captured as things worked out the confederates announced their own attack they chose early afternoon to open their bombardment hoping to catch us soldiers off guard by the rumble from us batteries they didnt us airplanes roared into the sky morrell couldnt see where they were taking off from the fields lay farther behind the lines but he knew they were up there which was what counted the confederates wouldnt catch them on the ground the way theyd caught so many fighters and bombers in ohio us yranging gear was pointed east ready to warn the pilots to get airborne before enemy air attackers arrived and these days unlike the way things were in everybody took yrangingand the confederatesvery seriously indeed those fighters and bombers with the eagle in front of crossed swords didnt get airborne just to escape cs attacks either they were loaded for bear the confederates had to deploy through several gaps in the mountains before they could debouche the harder they got bombed and strafed while still in column the slower and clumsier their deployment would be the less they can bring to the dance morrell thought remembering how he met agnes not long after the great war she and their daughter mildred were all right hed had a letter not long before the war hadnt really touched fort leavenworth out beyond the mississippi fighting came in harsh spatters one that seemed unending over the oil fields in sequoyah which each side torched whenever the other seemed about to retake them and another in west texas that had heated up lately looked at logically there was no reason on gods green earth to fight over west texas dark mutters said logic had little to do with it that the confederates were up to something really horrible out there something that needed suppressing regardless of logic having fought without much luck to hold the state of houston in the usa before al smiths plebiscite morrell was ready to believe the worst of west texas he was also ready to believe the worst of jake featherston and all his freedom party pals the only question in his mind was how bad the worst was out there he didnt even have time to worry about that except when he got out of the command barrel to stand behind a tree or smoke a cigarette he spent almost all of the next fortyeight hours in the turret as a less mobile commander might have spent them in a map room in a headquarters somewhere far behind the line he was wryly amused to find it worked out about the same either way now much of the frontmost of the places where the confederates were trying to break throughlay behind him a map room proved better than the turret for at least one reason it had the space to put up the maps he was constantly unfolding and refolding them and using cellophane tape to stick them here and there for a little while frenchy bergeron finally lost patience with him what happens if the confederates attack us here sir the gunner asked pointedly how am i supposed to fight those fuckers off if i cant even load my piece if the fate of this army depends on this barrel and some other one cant do the job were in a hell of a lot more trouble than i think we are morrell said mildly well all right sir bergeron said i can see that but my own neck might depend on shooting that gun even if the army doesnt i think were good even so morrell told him with everything the confederates are throwing at our left i dont see how they can have much to use against our front here the gunner grunted like almost everyone else in the two opposing armies bergeron fancied himself a strategist he came closer to being right than a lot of other people some of whom held significantly higher rank than his and he listened to what morrell didnt say as well as to what he did theyre hitting us from the one side sir not from both sides at once thats right morrell nodded they dont have the men for that and even if they did they could never get them into place west of us the mountains help screen their positions in the east and the travels easier to get there too what theyre doing is about as good a counterattack as they can hope to put together but not good enough right frenchy bergeron said confidently morrell yawned hed been in the saddle for a devil of a long time dont quite know yet he said i hope not but i cant be sure yet what happens if they do break through the gunner asked well i can give you the simple answer or the technical one morrell said which would you rather give me the technical one sir sure enough bergeron figured he knew enough to make sense of it he was right too the technical answer is if that happens were screwed morrell replied bergeron started to laugh then broke off when he saw morrell wasnt even smiling youre not kidding are you sir he said not me morrell said not even a little bit so the thing we want to make sure of is we want to make sure they dont break through brigadier general clarence potter thought of himself as a cosmopolitan man hed gone to college at yale up in the usa hed traveled up and down the east coast of the csa and west as far as new orleans he thought he knew his own country well but hed never been to knoxville tennessee before hed never been anywhere like knoxville before the confederacys interior had been a closed book to him the longer he stayed in and around the town the more he wanted to get back to richmond and the war department knoxville made daily us air raids seem good by comparison hed spent most of his time in charleston and richmond those were sophisticated places back before the freedom party seized power theyd had substantial opposition groups chances were they still did though the opposition had to stay underground these days if it wanted to go on existing knoxvilleby all appearances knoxville had never heard of never dreamt of opposing jake featherston people here were shabby and tiredlooking the way they were in richmond the men came in three categories the very very young the ancient and the mutilated an awful lot of women wore widows weeds but people in knoxville greeted one another with freedom potter hadnt heard them say it without sounding as if they meant it jake featherstons portraits and posters were everywhere even with us soldiers in tennessee on the other side of the mountains the locals remained convinced the confederate states would win the war without sharing their confidence potter envied it he wouldnt have come to knoxville himself if the csa werent in trouble if pulling someone out of intelligence and expecting him to command a brigade wasnt a mark of desperation what was it he needed a while to realize that question might not be rhetorical jake featherston could have had reasons of his own in assenting to potters transfer the first that sprang to mind was the one most likely true the president of the csa might not shed a tear if his obstreperous officer stopped a bullet who will rid me of this turbulent priest henry ii shouted and in short order thomas a becket was a dead man featherston was more polite instead of simply ordering his own men to do potter in or even hinting that he wanted him dead he sent the man he mistrusted off to where danger was apt to lie thicker on the ground than it did in richmond remembering some of the us air raids hed been through potter wondered if that was really so but his was not to reason why his was to do or that failing to die he didnt want to die and he wasnt sure he could do which left him in an unpleasant limbo he was in limbo another way too nobodyd ordered his brigade forward yet if everything was going according to plan it would have been committed two days earlier he didnt think the officers set over him were keeping the outfit in reserve because it had a green co a lot of brigades did these days no he feared the outfit hadnt got the call because things up at the front were going to hell even though he came out of intelligence he couldnt get a handle on what the war west of the mountains looked like nobody wanted to say anything that in itself was a bad omen when things were going well peopleand the freedom party propaganda millshouted it from the housetops when they werent good news had a thousand fathers bad news was an orphan the orphanage in knoxville got more crowded by the day potter began to wonder if his brigade ever would get sent to the front if it didnt why the devil had they called him out of richmond had optimism run that far ahead of common sense maybe it had he was just about convinced he would go back to the capital without ever seeing real action when he got the order to move forward that amused him about as much as anything ever did and in the usual sardonic way he had trucks he had fuel hed made damn sure he did the outfit was rolling inside of an hour he might have left a few men behind in knoxville men whod got leave and whom the military police hadnt scraped out of the bars and whorehouses he would worry about and if need be punish them later better to get where he needed to go when he needed to get there with not quite so many men than to wait around for the rest and show up late but he showed up late anyhow though he didnt intend to everything went fine till the brigade rolled past harriman about thirtyfive miles west of knoxville up till then highway had been in pretty good shape occasional craters were patched up confederate engineers had repaired bombed bridges or set up makeshift spans to do duty for the ones the damnyankees had blown to smithereens after harriman it was a different story the yankees had hit the road hard enough and often enough to get ahead of the repair crews potter hadnt seen such devastation since the great warexcept in richmond after a bad air raid but those raids disrupted civilian life these delayed soldiers on the way to the front a much more serious businessespecially if you were one of those soldiers going off the roads and into the fields alongside them helped but only so much for one thing the fields were cratered too even trucks with fourwheel drive werent barrels they didnt laugh off big holes in the ground and the lead trucks chewed up the ground and made it worse for the ones that came behind the worse the bottlenecks got the more worried potter grew we have to get rolling he said to whoever would listen to him and scanned the western skies like a farmer fearing rain at harvest time he feared something worse than rain if the damnyankees hit us while were stuck here bite your tongue sir advised the corporal at the wheel of his command car you say that kind of stuff youre liable to make it come true to clarence potter that was superstitious nonsense he didnt say so thoughwhat was the point fifteen minutes later with the brigade still snarled what both he and the corporal dreaded came true the howl of airplane engines rising swiftly to a scream hed done what he could to get ready for air attack hed deployed the antiaircraft guns attached to the brigade and the heavy machine guns he and his men werent caught flatfooted when the us raiders struck them things could have been worse as it worked out they were only bad bad proved grim enough the damnyankees didnt use asskickers or their equivalents they just mounted bomb racks under fighters which turned their explosives loose from not much above treetop height they hit the trucks on the road and those to either side of it fireballs blossomed chunks of blazing metal hurtled through the air so did chunks of blazing flesh like most potters command car carried a pintlemounted machine gun he banged away at the enemy airplanes hed gone through the whole great war without firing a weapon at us forces now he could hit back the shattering noise and the stream of hot brass spitting from the breech filled him with fierce primitive joy whether he hurt the damnyankees any was a different question the unsleeping rational part of his brain knew that even as the animal inside him whooped and squeezed the triggers and played the stream of tracers like a hose a fighter slammed into the ground not far away that fireball dwarfed the ones the trucks sent up splashes of burning gasoline caught running soldiers they dropped and writhed and rolled screaming their torment all but unheard after the fighters unloaded their bombs they came back to strafe the stalled column the confederates had invented the tactic two years earlier potter could have done without the flattery of us imitation he got more chances to use his machine gun and the fighters armed with four machine guns and two cannon each got more chances to turn their weapons on him they badly outgunned him they were making better than miles an hour while he was a sitting duck the wonder wasnt that they kept missing him the wonder was that all their weaponry didnt chew him to red rags bullets cracked past his head when bullets cracked they came too damn close others kicked up puffs of dust from the dirt a few feet to the left of the command car and then a moment later from the dirt a few feet to its right he went on firing hardly even knowing he was doing it he changed belts on the machine gun when the first one ran dry after what had to be the longest ten or fifteen minutes of his life he ran out of targets the us fighters roared off toward the west he looked around to see what theyd doneand discovered that what had been a brigade was no more than a shattered mess not all the trucks were on fire but about one in three was some of the burning trucks carried ammunition which started cooking off flying rounds would cause more casualties and likely set more fires too the stinks of cordite and burning fuel and burning rubber and burning meat filled the air so did the cheerful poppoppop of exploding cartridges and the not so cheerful screams and moans of wounded men officers and noncoms shouted commands trying to bring order out of chaos by sheer force of will order did not want to be born chaos wasnt ready to die potters driver looked around and summed things up in a handful of words jesus what a fucking mess now that you mention it yes potter sounded dazed even to himself he thought hed earned the right hed had reports of what air strikes could do to troops hed read them carefully hed imagined he understood them so much for that went through his mind the difference between reading about an air strike and going through one was about like the difference between reading about love and making love you did good sir his driver said that took balls standing up there and firing on those bastards a lot of guys wouldve run for the trees fast as they could go not far from the command car lay the corpse of a soldier whod been running for the trees when a cannon round caught him in the middle of the back the corpse was in two piecestop half and bottom half they lay several feet apart runnings not guaranteed to keep you safe potter said standing your ground and shooting back at the enemy didnt guarantee it either a bomb had landed right by one of the brigades antiaircraft guns the blast blew the gun itself ass over teakettle not much was left of the men whod served it can we still go forward the driver asked we have to potter said the question and the automatic answer helped get his brain working again he hopped down from the command car and started adding orders of his own to the ones that came from his subordinates fighting fires getting the wounded and the dead off to one side clearing wrecked vehicles from the roadwayit all took time time the brigade should have used to travel they were going to be late getting where they were supposed to go and they wouldnt get there at better than twothirds strength the great war was a war of attrition a war the csa lost attrition had just fallen out of the sky and jumped on his brigade a few minutes of air strikes and it was barely combatworthy it wouldnt be able to do the things planners assumed a fresh brigade of reinforcements could do it couldnt come close how many other confederate units were in the same boat and which boat was it anyway one that just stopped a torpedo it sure looked that way to clarence potter he did the best he could praying all the while that us fighterbombers wouldnt come back he was agnostic leaning toward atheist but he prayed anyhow it cant hurt he thought and enemy aircraft did stay away the brigade or what was left of it got moving again the men could still do their besthowever good that turned out to be lieutenant michael pound was not a happy man hed been happy driving the confederates from pittsburgh back into ohio and then down into kentucky and tennessee forcing the csa to dance to the usas tune made him happy now instead of pushing on toward chattanooga he and his armored platoon had to leave the front line and shift to the east if they didnt the confederates were liable to drive in the us flank if that happened very bad things would follow pound could see as much he took it as a personal affront well make them payyou see if we dont he growled when his platoon stopped to rest andat his ordersto maintain their barrels if they think they can sidetrack us theyre right arent they sergeant frank blakey asked the barrel commander had a large wrench in his hands he was tightening the links in his barrels left track pound approved of a commander who could do his own maintenance he also approved of a noncom who talked back to officers hed done plenty of that when he had stripes on his sleeve instead of these silly gold bars on even sillier shoulder straps a lot of men who became officers late in their careers did their best to ape the style and ambitions of those whod gained the privilege sooner not michael pound he still thought like a top sergeant and didnt labor under the delusion that those little gold bars turned him into a little tin god so he just laughed and nodded yeah they areright this minute anyhow but when we get through with them theyre going to be worse off than if they never tried this attack in the first place how do you figure sir that was mel scullard his own gunner his crew had learned even faster than the others that he didnt get pissed off when people spoke their minds weve got air superiority weve got more barrels than they do and better ones now weve got more artillery than they do too in spite of their damn rockets pound answered if they come out and slug toetotoe with us they just make themselves better targets theyre harder to get rid of when they hang back and make us come at them it worked like that in the great war and it still does sergeant scullard grunted well that makes sense he gave pound a crooked grin how did you come up with it accidents will happen pound said dryly and everyone laughed pound went on what we have to do is we have to clobber the confederates for coming out in the open to bang with us and then we have to get back down to the real front and push on to chattanooga everything always sounded easy when he started talking about it it sometimes didnt turn out like that for real but he was convinced that was never his fault well put a lot of driving miles on our barrels sergeant blakey pointed out sure pound nodded barrels were complex machines that performed right at their limits all the time this wars models were less prone to breakdowns than the lumbering monsters of a generation earlier but they still failed much more often than he wished they would he said the better we take care of them while were on the road the less trouble theyll give us all the men he led nodded at that a barrel crew that took care of its machine spent a lot more time in combat than one that let things slide barrels were the logical successors to horsed cavalry back in the old days pound had heard a mounted trooper took care of his horse before he worried about himself the same rule held good with armored units though pound would sooner have used a curry comb on his barrel than a screwdriver he was old enough to remember the way horses responded when you groomed them barrels never would do anything like that but in an age of mechanized warfare horsed cavalry couldnt hope to survive soldiers in barrels stayed alive and hurt the enemy that was what the game was all about are we ready to get rolling pound asked nobody said no the soldiers got back into their steel shells and rumbled northeast before long they passed a barrel whose men were busy replacing a track we hit a mine one of the soldiers in coveralls said in response to pounds shouted question lucky this is all that happened to us youd better believe it pound said well hurry alongwell need everybody we can get our hands on before long the other barrelman waved in agreement and returned to his backbreaking work the northeast road ran from dalton toward pikeville at the head of the sequatchie valley where the confederates were trying to break out pikeville was a county seata sign still standing near the edge of town so declared all the same the place couldnt have held much more than people before the fighting started michael pound doubted it had half that many now the locals like most people with half an ounce of sense didnt want to stick around while bullets chewed up their houses and bombs and shells came down on their heads theyd lit out for the tall timber wherever the tall timber wasprobably in the mountains to the east us artillery was set up south and west of pikeville throwing shells at the confederates as they tried to push forward the gun bunnies most of them naked to the waist nodded to pound as he and his barrels rattled past us fighterbombers roared past overhead pound smiled to hear bombs going off not too far away the harder the enemy got hit before he made it to pikeville the less trouble hed be when he finally did bomb craters said confederate aircraft were hitting back as best they could a burntout hound dog had crashed in a field just outside of town the front half of the fighter was a crumpled wreck the confederate battle flag on the upthrust tail was as much of a grave marker as the pilot was likely to get houses on the east side of pikeville faced the mountains from which the enemy would come pounds barrel pushed its way into one of those housesliterally knocking down the western wall and poking the gun out through a window on the east side the other machines in his platoon deployed close by behind fences and piles of wreckage they werent the only barrels taking up positions there if the confederates wanted pikeville and what lay beyond they would have to pay pound peered out through the now glassless window waiting he would have been happier if the enemy never made it as far as pikeville if the artillery and fighterbombers could stop featherstons columns in their tracks so much the better it would let him turn around and head back toward important fightingfighting that led to advances into the heart of the confederacy but no such luck less than an hour after pound got to pikeville us infantrymen whod been screening the way ahead fell back into the little town up to us now id say pound remarked without the foot soldiers and the artillery and the airplanes the confederates would have been in pikeville ahead of him and probably spilling out to the west he didnt think about that only about what needed doing next front he called as a confederate barrel rolling through the cornfields made itself plain identified the gunner sang out range just over a mile sir can you hit the son of a bitch pound asked hell yes scullard sounded confident as could be the way a good gunner should then fire when ready pound almost nagged scullard about leading his targetat that range the shell had a flight time of a second and a half and the enemy barrel could move enough to make remembering it matter but in the end he kept his mouth shut the gunner knew what he was doing hed remember to lead the barrelor if he didnt pound would come down on him after he screwed up the gun swung slightly then it roared michael pound thought his head would come off he was head and shoulders out of the turret but still in an enclosed space and the noise was cataclysmic was it a hit or smoke spurted from the enemy barrel got him pound yelled good shot you led him just right he laughed at himself he was going to get the lesson in come hell or high water wasnt he other barrels opened up on the advancing confederates several more enemy barrels brewed up the longer us barrelmen used the inch gun on the new models the better they liked it it fired a flat fast round that could kill anything it could reach and the improved gunsight made hits more likely pound wished he were shooting it himself little by little hed decided he might be able to do more good as an officer than he had as a noncom coordinating five barrel crews wasnt the piece of cake hed thought it was till he tried it himself he kept shouting into the wireless finding out what was going on with all the others and making sure they did what he wanted them to do and he had to fight his own barrel too it was enough to give the onearmed paperhanger a galloping case of the hives and the confederates wanted pikeville they needed pikeville and they were doing their damnedest to take it back from the us soldiers inside it their barrels didnt swarm forward to be massacred in the open the way pound hoped they would instead smoke rounds from cs artillery back in the mountains came down between the advancing confederate forces and the defenders in the little town before long the streamers came together in a ragged fogbank that hid most of what lay behind it out of the fogbank cametrouble confederate foot soldiers armed with antibarrel rockets and launching tubes ran through the smoke flopped down behind the closest cover and started working their way forward us machinegun fire picked off some of them and more of the riflemen who protected them but they kept coming in the little rushes experienced troops used before long rockets trailing tails of fire flew toward pikeville more than one us barrel that had stayed too long in its original firing position got hit michael pounds platoon came away unscathed hed ordered the machines back to secondary firing positions in the lull the smoke screen gave them a rocket slammed into the house where his barrel had been hiding the house started to burn pound smiled to himself the confederates would think theyd killed the barrel they might make some embarrassing mistakes if they thought their mischiefmakers had done more than they really had and sure enough a few minutes later a couple of platoons of cs barrels charged through the thinning smoke ready to break into pikeville or die trying michael pound earnestly preferred the second alternative he was standing in the cupola of a machine that could make his preferences felt the leading barrels were the latest confederate model excellent in their own right but half a step behind his they were out in the open he had cover it hardly seemed fair but then he didnt want a fair fight he wanted a fight hed win front he shouted identified sergeant scullard continued with the ritual three shots from pounds barrel killed two confederate machines and they were the leading two one turned into a fireball a couple of men got out of the other barrel machinegun bullets reached for them but they might have made cover part of pound hoped they did hed bailed out of a stricken barrel himself he knew what it was like they were enemies but they were also men doing the same job he was the confederates kept coming another us barrel set the last of theirs on fire less than a hundred yards outside of pikeville several more greengray barrels were also burning by then some from enemy cannon fire others from those damnable antibarrel rockets but the confederates didnt get into the town they didnt get around it either us reinforcements poured in to make sure they couldnt pound was only half glad to see them he wished theyd stayed farther south and stormed toward chattanooga lieutenantcolonel jerry dover had the ribbon for the purple heart he didnt much want it nobody on either side much wanted a purple heart but dover didnt think hed earned his a chunk of shrapnel had torn a bloody line across his forearm as far as he was concerned it wasnt worth fussing about but the rule was that you got a medal if you bled and so he had one not a lot of officers in the quartermaster corps owned a decoration that said theyd been in combat in a way it was handy it made line officersand even line noncomstake him seriously but the wound was so trivial the decoration embarrassed him it did when he had time to think about it anyway more often than not he barely had time to breathe let alone eat he smoked like a chimney as long as he kept breathing he could do that it didnt keep him from doing the usual seventeen other things at the same time he knew before almost anyone else that the confederate thrust from the east wasnt going as well as the planners back in richmond wished it were as soon as the front just north of chattanooga got its supply priority restored he realized the confederates either had an extravagant success and would soon swarm up from the south or had failed and would soon need to hold on for dear life here the shipments of barbed wire and land mines said they wouldnt be advancing he sent out the supplies as frontline units shouted for them in the meantime he quietly swore under his breath a generation earlier hed seen what a losing war looked like now he stared another one in the face he hadnt thought jake featherston would land the confederacy in a mess like this who had surely featherston himself hadnt and a whole fat lot of good that does anybody dover thought confederate gunboats came up the tennessee river as far as chattanooga and fired big shells at us forces to the north then they turned around again and scooted south as fast as they could go for us airplanes struck at them whenever they got the chance landbased guns couldnt be as big or move as fast as the ones the gunboats carried but the boats had trouble moving fast enough to stay safe dover could cheer for them without worrying that their performance reflected on him the cs navy was responsible for keeping them in fuel hardtack and munitions some navy commander had to flabble about that dover just hoped their shells blew plenty of damnyankees to hell and gone his own worries were the usual sort getting munitions and other supplies up from the rear and then making sure they reached the front keeping his dumps as close to the fighting as he could went a long way toward solving the second problem the first was harder especially since he had to deal with new sets of gatekeepers the dumps in southern and western tennessee that had nourished the confederate armies were now withering themselves most of dovers shipments came up from atlanta and the quartermasters there had carved out a tidy little empire for themselves one they didnt care to disturb just because there was a war on your demands are excessive a colonel safely behind the lines told jerry dover you cant possibly be expending so many antiaircraft shells no huh dover said what do you think im doing with em pounding em up my ass had that colonel in atlanta been handy dover might have done some pounding with him even though he didnt say it that message must have got across in frigid tones his superior said you are insubordinate yes sir dover said proudly people keep telling me that but the ones who do are always farther from the fighting than i am the guys who really have to go out and shoot things at the yankees they like me fine and you know what sir if i have to choose between them and you ill take them any old time have a care how you speak to me the colonel in atlanta sounded like a man on the verge of apoplexy youd better have a care by god i can have you courtmartialed like thatlike that i tell you he snapped his fingers big fucking dealsir dover had heard such threats before if you do theyll kick my ass out of the army ill go to prison where its safe or ill go home to augusta where its safe and i hope they ship you up here to take my place itd goddamn well serve you right and if i dont get those shells my next telegram goes to richmond not to you you cant do that the colonel gabbled it violates the chain of command no doubt that would have impressed an officer whod had proper training it didnt bother jerry dover one bit you think jake featherston will give a damn about the chain of command when he hears somebody isnt doing his job and wont do it i think hell have you for breakfastwithout salt he was bluffing he didnt think any telegram of his would reach the president of the csa no doubt the colonel down in atlanta didnt either but there was always that chance and if featherston did descend in wrath on an obstructive colonel that man would end up nothing but a smear on the bottom of his shoe dover got his antiaircraft shells that meant the front got its antiaircraft shells if he had enemies down in atlanta he didnt give a damn he camouflaged his supply dump as elaborately as he could netting and mottled tarps covered crates and boxes and stacks branches and uprooted saplings made the place next to invisible from the air that wasnt just jerry dovers opinion he sent up a confederate artillery spotter in a light airplane to look the place over from above the man said he had a devil of a time finding it dover felt proud proud however had nothing to do with anything dover was also paranoid half a mile from the concealed dump he ordered a dummy depot built right out in the open he made some token efforts at camouflaging it the kinds of things a busy not very bright not very diligent officer would do so his superiors couldnt come down on him for not doing anything but nothing that would really keep enemy bombers from spotting the site his men grumbled at the extra work that ticked him off look he said the name of the game is being able to hang on to our shit till we have to move it up to the front if the damnyankees drop bombs on the wrong place weve got a better chance of doing that or do you want the bastards to plaster us here nobody said yes to that he would have got rid of any man who did a lot of officers would have given a man like that a rifle and sent him up to the forwardmost positions to see how he liked things there as dover had shown at the huntsmans lodge though he was more vindictive toward superiors than toward subordinates he would have palmed reluctant enlisted men off on some other supply officer sending them up to the front to get shot didnt cross his mind us reconnaissance aircraft buzzed above chattanooga almost every hour of the day antiaircraft fire didnt discourage them there werent enough confederate fighters to drive them away west of the appalachians the united states had air superiority the confederates could harry and harass but they couldnt stop the yankees from doing most of what they wanted to do bombs rained down on the dummy depot smashing it to hell and gone you see dover said to anybody who would listen you see we fooled the sons of bitches he got busy repairing the dump just as if it were the real one he was proud of his realism hed even had a few barrels of waste oil at the dummy site so they could send up convincing plumes of greasy smoke enemy bombers hit the fake depot again two days later even harder jerry dover was so pleased with himself he could hardly even breathe he felt like dancing because hed done such a good job of fooling the damnyankees how many tons of bombs had they thrown away smashing up worthless tents and empty crates enough to make some of their supply officers very unhappy if they found out about the wastehe was sure of that again he had his crew run around as if trying to set things to rights after two wasted us raids theyd found some enthusiasm for trying to trick us fliers antiaircraft guns sprouted like toadstools around the dummy depot only a handful of the guns were real the rest were quaker cannons logs trimmed and painted to look like the real thing on mounts made from whatever junk the soldiers could scrounge close up they were jokes from a couple of miles in the air or from a fighterbomber streaking by as fast as it could go they seemed damned convincing when he heard the thrum of us bomber engines overhead yet again jerry dover smiled a smug complacent grin the good humor behind that smile went up in smokeliterallywhen the yankees blasted the kapok out of his genuine dump all the antiaircraft guns around the real installation were in good working order they knocked down a few bombers but not nearly enough the usa clearly won the exchange how he shouted even as firemen poured streams of water on the smoking wreckage how the fuck did they know where we were at i bet some goddamn nigger tipped em off that we were running a bluff a sergeant answered dover started to say that was ridiculous but he stopped with the words unspoken it wasnt ridiculous not one bit every black manand womanin the csa had to hate the present government as much as the government hated blacks not many negroes were left in these parts even one would have been plenty if he reached the damnyankees i bet youre right was what came out of his mouth fucking black bastards the noncom said freedom party shouldve done a better job of cleaning em out what did we elect those assholes for anyway politics didnt rear its head so often in this war as it had in the last a lot of people in the csa were afraid to talk politics these days they worriedand with reasonthat they could end up in camps if they said the wrong thing to the wrong person anything that criticized the government or the freedom party was too likely to be the wrong thing although jerry dover hadnt expected anybody to come down on the party for not doing enough to get rid of blacks you want to kind of watch your mouth pete dover told the sergeant some of these party people they dont take things the right way yeah well i didnt figure you for a stalwart or anything like that pete answered you dont sound like youre ready to come when you go freedom no huh dover said dryly nope the sergeant shook his head he stuck a chaw of red man in his mouth his jaw worked he might have been a cow chewing its cud but a cow wouldnt have spat a stream of brown the way he did he winked at dover besides sir if you turn me in youll get stuck with some dumb shithead who doesnt know his ass from the end zone you like people with a little something upstairs me i like broads with a little something upstairs he held his hands in front of his chest dover laughed go on get out of here he said youve got other things to do besides driving your co crazy with a sketched salute pete ambled off jerry dover stared after him no wonder people didnt talk politics any more whenever you did you felt you were suddenly part of a plot say anything bad about the powers that beeven listen to someone else saying bad things about the powers without denouncing him on the instantand you were complicit in indiscretion you had a hold on the other guy and he had a hold on you shit dover muttered it shouldnt be this way he felt that very strongly not being able to speak your mind had to hurt the war effort having people go after people who did speak their minds had to hurt the war effort too all the labor wasted in chasing down grumblers could have been turned against the damnyankees instead the effort used in chasing down negroes dover wasnt like pete he didnt think the freedom party wasnt doing enough but the question of whether the party should be doing anything at all along those lines never crossed his mind he might despise the numskulls set over him but he was still a man of his country and his time and his color xiii dr leonard odoull finished the amputation there we go he said all things considered the poor bastards lucky just losing a foot i should say so granville mcdougald nodded sometimes you lose a leg when you step on a mine sometimes it just plain kills you or if you step on one of those new bouncing bastards the confederates are using it pops up in the air and blows your nuts off some fun yeah odoull hated the bouncing mines with a fierce and terrible passion they were designed to make the ghastliest wounds they could some cs engineer had probably won himself a bonus for coming up with the idea he looked at the patient etherized upon the table he should do pretty well though he just found an ordinary one pretty well it was true the man would live he probably wouldnt get a wound infection once he healed enough to wear a prosthesis hed be able to get around without too much trouble how much agony lay between the moment of stepping on the mine and that reasonably favorable prognosis though how much had he gone through before he was carried back to the aid station no way in hell to measure such things but hed already tasted his share of hell his share and then some lets get him off the table mcdougald said were bound to have more business before long aint life grand mauvais tabernac odoull said and added osti for good measure granny mcdougald laughed the way he always did when odoull swore in quebecois french sometimes though the blasphemy of the french curses felt more powerful than the blunt anglosaxon obscenities odoull had gone back to using more often than not they did get more business too but not the kind they expected mortar bombs started bursting not far away shit mcdougald said and leonard odoull wasnt inclined to argue with him they both grabbed the wounded man and lugged him along as they hurried out of the tent they would have to rebandage him later but that was the least of their worries leaving him there for shrapnel to slice up would have been worse careful with him granny odoull said as they slid him down into the trench near the tent the trench they always hoped they wouldnt have to use im trying mcdougald said another mortar round burst nearby fragments screeched past odoull mcdougald gasped then he said shit again this time in an eerily calm tone of voice you hit odoull had heard that tone too many times to have much doubt afraid so mcdougald answered two wars up at the front and my very first purple heart lucky me then he said shit again most sincerely now son of a bitch is starting to hurt get down in here odoull told him ill do what i can for you and ill get you on the table as soon as they stop landing things on us right the medic said tightly well nice to know im in good hands like any other soldier he carried a morphine syrette in the aid kit on his belt as soon as he flopped down into the trench he stuck himself his left trouser leg was dark and soggy with blood most soldiers would have used a belt knife or a bayonet to cut away the heavy fabric and get a look at the wound odoull had a scalpel it didnt do a better job than any other sharp blade would have but it felt natural in his hand he found a long nasty tear in mcdougalds thigh not too bad granny he said we can patch it upthats for damn sure youre the doctor mcdougald said through clenched teeth when is that morphine going to kick in how long does it take anyway hed injected himself only a minute or so before when he was caring for someone else he could gauge exactly how long the painkiller needed he wasnt objective about his own wound his own torment who could be wont be long odoull promised as soothingly as he could i dont have my needles and suture material with me im going to pinch off a couple of bleeders in there and safetypin you together till i can get you under the gas for a proper job youre the doc mcdougald said again he braced himself as odoull got to work on anyone else he would have watched what his friend was doing why not for a wound like this he could have done just as well himself when he was the wounded party though he looked anywhere and everywhere except at his injury in a macabre way it was funny he even laughed when odoull remarked on it but he swore savagely when odoull pinned the wounds lips together then he laughed again shakily crazy how much that little crap hurts isnt it yeah crazy odoull started bandaging the gash youre going to have yourself a hell of a scar you know oh boy just what i always wanted but then mcdougald let out a sigh ah theres the dope christ that feels good almost worth getting hit for you know somebody said it was like kissing god now i know what he meant dont like it too much odoull had known a few doctors who did like morphine too well army medics werent immune from using the stuff for their own pleasure either the powers that be landed on them like a rockslide when they got caught but a lot of them were sly and careful people who used drugs werent always the crazed addicts in melodramas a lot of them used just enough to stay happy and lived more or less normal lives aside from their habit more shell fragments whistled and screeched overhead even staying in the trench didnt necessarily do odoull and mcdougald and the anesthetized soldier with a missing foot any good if a mortar bomb came down on top of them that was it end of storyor the start of a new and horrible one far back of the linewell north of delphius artillery started thundering the mortar fire stopped as suddenly as it had begun did that mean the cs mortar crews were casualties odoull hoped so he didnt like people shooting at him not even a little bit eddie the corpsman stared down into the trench jesus doc what the hell happened here he asked what do you think happened i was elected queen of the may and im about to go into my dance granville mcdougald said before odoull could get a word out morphine might have dulled his pain but not his sarcasm granny got his leg sliced when we were moving the wounded guy on account of the mortar fire odoull said can you help me get him up and out so i can work on him let me round up a couple more guys itll go better if i do eddie disappeared before odoull could say yes or no nobodys paying any attention to me today odoull thought aggrievedly he hoped the confederates wouldnt get their mortars upright and shooting while eddie was looking for help they didnt maybe the us artillery really had knocked out the enemy crews three more corpsmen jumped into the trench with odoull they got the man with an amputated foot up onto a stretcher and then grunting lifted him out of the trench whats going on he said vaguelyhe was starting to come out from under the anesthesia he wouldnt feel pain for a while though odoull had shot him full of morphine while he was still out once the corpsmen got him off the stretcher it was granville mcdougalds turn take it easy granny eddie said as they lifted him well how else am i going to take it mcdougald answered he rolled off the stretcher once they got it up to the level of the top of the trench morphine or not that made him say several pungent things they got out of the trench themselves put him back on the stretcher and carried him into the aid tent sharp jagged steel fragments had done a good job of ventilating the tent a big one was stuck in one of the operating tables front legs it was only about a foot from the cylinder of ether and oxygen up there if it had punched into thatodoull was just as glad it hadnt maybe the tent would have gone up in flames or maybe it would have just gone uphalfway to the moon well granny im going to put you under so i can do a proper job on this odoull said reaching for the mask connected to the cylinder sure doc do what you gotta do mcdougald had anesthetized god only knew how many men himself but when the mask came down over his nose and mouth he tried to fight it the way a lot of wounded soldiers did it was reflex nothing more odoull knew as much eddie and another corpsman held mcdougalds hands till he went to sleep odoull cleaned the wound closed off some more bleeders and then sutured things firmly and neatly he nodded to himself hell be all right wont he doc eddie asked hes a good guy you bet he is odoull answered and yes he ought to do fine but hell need at least a couple of months before hes back on the job well be getting a new numberone medic then above the mask hed put on eddie blinked thats gonna be weird boy no kidding odoull had come to take granny mcdougalds unflustered competence very much for granted now hed have to break in somebody else somebody whod probably be half his age and who wasnt likely to know anywhere near as much as mcdougald did odoull muttered under his breath he and mcdougald had got on fine living in each others pockets for most of two years it wasnt a marriage but it was intimate enough in its own way could he do the same with a new guy hed damn well have to they took mcdougald away still unconscious odoull washed his hands and his instruments he shook his head all the time he was doing it hed imagined himself getting hurt plenty of times mcdougald he shook his head again no not a chancehed thought the veteran noncom seemed enduring as the rockies which only went to showyou never could tell odoull was still fine not a scratch on him and mcdougald was lucky he hadnt lost a leg odoull thought about that then shook his head the medic was unlucky to have been wounded at all but it could have been worse with all odoull had seen himself he knew how much worse it could have been us fighterbombers roared by overhead flying south to pound the confederate positions outside of chattanooga odoull didnt look forward to that fight he couldnt imagine how taking the enemy bastion would be easy or cheap more work for me he thought but he could do without more work his ideal day was one where he sat outside the aid tent reading a book and smoking cigarettes he hadnt had an ideal day since putting the uniform back on he didnt expect to have one till the war finally ended but every man even a military doctor deserved his dreams one way not to have to patch up wounded soldiers was to get hit himself he looked down at his hands he didnt have granville mcdougalds blood on them any more he thought about the replacement medic or a surgeon farther behind the front trying to patch him up hed seen too many wounds he didnt want one of his own what he wanted might not have anything to do with the price of beer only fool luck granny stopped that fragment and he didnt he wondered howand whetherto tell nicole that mcdougald was injured he talked about granny in every letter he wrote she would notice if he suddenly stopped but she would flabble if he came right out and said his friend and colleague had got hurt if it happened to granville mcdougald she would say it could happen to him too and she would be right odoull knew he couldnt admit that to her he didnt want to admit it to himself the more you thought about things like that the less you slept the more likely you were to get an ulcer the more likely your hand was to shake when it shouldnt but how were you supposed to not think about something if someone said dont think about a blue rabbit of course nothing else would fill your mind you just have to go on odoull murmured you just have to go on on the bridge of the josephus daniels sam carsten said i guess maybe we won that fight with the limeys and the frogs after all pat cooley nodded yes sir i guess maybe we did the exec said we wouldnt be trying to take bermuda back if we didnt would we he didnt sound a hundred percent convincedmore as if he was trying to convince himself and sam too well i hope we wouldnt anyway carsten had been aboard the remembrance when a british attack on us fishing boats lured the carrier northand left bermuda vulnerable to amphibious assault now the united states were trying to return the favor if that was the word us surface ships and airplanes and submersibles kept the british from reinforcing or resupplying the outpost in the western atlantic but the british garrison wasnt ready to throw in the sponge lots of royal marines and soldiers were on the ground the british had plenty of artillerysome of the heavy pieces big enough to damage a battleship or blow a destroyer escort like the josephus daniels clean out of the water and they had fighters and dive bombers at least as good as the americans could throw at them and enough fuel to keep their airplanes flying at least for a while along with carriers and battlewagons and smaller escort vessels like the josephus daniels troopships and landing craft wallowed toward bermuda sam watched them with a reminiscent smile on his face it looked like this in he said when we landed on the sandwich islands you were there for that cooley asked you bet i was still an able seaman in those dayshadnt even made petty officer sam answered i was on the dakota my battle station was at one of her fiveinch guns he chuckled secondary armament right sure bigger guns than weve got on this tin can we can do what we need to do the exec patted the destroyer escorts wheel as if to say the ship shouldnt listen to her skippers insults but he couldnt help adding youve seen a lot of action ive got a lot of miles on me you mean sam said with another laugh airplanes roared off the carriers decks and flew south and east toward the island they hadnt had strike forces like that in the old days the dakota had carried a catapultlaunched biplane scout that seemed to be made of sticks and baling wire when it came backif it came backit landed on the sea and the battleship fished it out with a crane nowadays fleets didnt even see each other airplanes did the heavy lifting he hoped they would do the heavy lifting against bermuda if they plastered the runways on the island so the british fighters and bombers couldnt take offif they did that his own life expectancy would go up hed been lucky in war so far hed had a battleship hit and a carrier sunk under him but hed barely got scratched he hoped that would go onhe liked his carcass the way it was most of the time navy men were lucky compared to their army counterparts they slept in bunks or at least in hammocks not wrapped in a blanket in the mud they ate pretty good chow not the canned rations soldiers had to put up with most of the time they were in transit from here to there except for lurking submersibles nothing put them in danger minute by minute for days or weeks at a stretch butthere was always a but when things went wrong for sailors they went wrong in a big way if a ship went down to the bottom she could take hundreds of meneven a couple of thousand on a carrierdown with her he wished he hadnt had that thought he reached out and rapped his knuckles on the wheel pat cooley sent him a quizzical look whats up sir nothing not really just snapping my fingers to keep the elephants away the exec looked around nothing but the atlantic for miles and miles he said i didnt know the enemy was issuing heavyduty water wings gotta watch out for those water elephants sam said gravely next time you see something sticking out of the atlantic it wont be a periscopeitll be one of their trunks instead no doubt sir cooley answered and the trunkll probably be packed toowith explosives or with bushwah depending bushwahno doubt about it sam said his face still straight an essential wartime ingredient wouldnt surprise me a bit the exec said carsten studied the charts of the waters around bermuda the one thing he was sure of was that he didnt want to get too close without a pilot aboard who knew them like the back of his hand there were too many reefs marked too many names like cow ground flat and brackish pond flats there were also too many wrecks charted some from the eighteenth century some of blockade runners during the war of secession and ungodly numbers from the days of the great war he wondered how many wrecks werent marked he didnt want to add the josephus daniels to that number sir weve got airplanes outbound from bermuda the yranging officer said they dont intend to sit there and take it and were still a hundred miles offshore carsten said well we already knew the limeys have their own yranging gear sure looks that way sir lieutenant walters said seems like theyre trying to keep us from doing too much to the island can they sam and his executive officer asked the same thing at the same time no way to tell yet walters answered he watched the screens for another couple of minutes then grunted thats funny whats up sam asked im picking up incoming aircraft with a bearing of about a little south of west the yranging officer laughed gadget must have the hiccups it does that once in a while sam didnt think it was funny not one little bit he looked at pat cooley the exec was looking back at him similar consternation in his eyes how far is it from cape hatteras to bermuda pat sam asked about six hundred miles sir cooley answered thats what i thought sam said if the confederates wanted to try bombing us they could in other words he didnt wait for a reply this time he just snapped out an order bring the ship to general quarters signal the rest of the fleet what weve spotted and what we think it means other yranging sets would pick up those airplanes too but would the men eyeing the screens know what they were seeing klaxons hooted sailors dashed to their battle stations as if someone had tied torches to their tails if the limeys can put up airplanes at the same time as the confederates things are liable to get interesting lieutenant cooley remarked sounding calmer than he had any business being interesting yeah sam said tightly and i hear that the ocean is wet and jake featherston doesnt always tell the truth and youre liable to get hurt if acaliber slug hits you cooley gave an uncertain chuckle plainly having trouble making up his mind whether the skipper was being sardonic or had just flipped his lid the blinker on the closest cruiser started sending morse cooley and carsten both turned field glasses toward the signal confirm cs aircraft it said one letter at a time prepare to defend air cover limited that was all no matter how much sam waited and longed for more happy day he said and whistled something without much tune he went to the speaking tube that connected the bridge to the engine room be ready to give me flank speed at my order were facing air attack any minute now flank speed at your order aye aye sir nobody down in the black gang sounded ruffled they never did down there they did all they could do and they didnt worry about anything beyond the noise and heat of their province sam envied them their simplicity it was the one thing he missed from his days as a rating now he had to think about the whole ship and the tactical situation at the same time one thing cooley said the confederates probably wont throw asskickers at us they dont have the range to come out this far and make it back to the mainland that means medium bombers hitting from high altitude and they arent nearly so accurate can asskickers divebomb us and then land on bermuda sam asked his exec looked quite humanly surprised for a moment i hadnt thought of that cooley sounded less selfassured than usual he checked some reference books and didnt look happy when he closed them probably sir they may not be able to carry a full bomb load but i think they can get here one more piece of good news sam said the cruiser that had signaled them opened fire with her fiveinch guns a moment later the josephus daniels pair of fourinchers opened up too and then the twin mm guns and then thecaliber machine guns the racket was terrific astonishing deafening sam knew he didnt hear as well as he would have liked artillerymans ear soldiers called it this wouldnt help sure as hell a gullwinged confederate mule stooped on the cruiser sam saw the dive bomber release the bomb it carried under its belly a split second before a big shell connected with it the airplane turned into a fireball fragments rained down into the atlantic but the bomb caught the cruiser just abaft the bridge the big ship staggered in the water a great plume of smoke rose from her pilots a damn fool cooley said sam made a questioning noise the exec explained they should be going after the troopships and the carriers in a fight like this escorts are chump change hed just called his own ship chump change which didnt necessarily mean he was wrong another burning asskicker plunged into the sea the combat air patrol over the fleet was doing something anyhow and the guys at one of the forward mm mounts started whooping and dancing like men going out of their heads theyd shot down an enemy airplane or they sure as hell thought they had more asskickers pulled out of their parabolic dives and fought for altitude they were most vulnerable then since they werent moving very fast as they climbed several of them got hacked out of the sky but other ominous smoke pillars rose from the fleet its a big game sam said i wish i knew what the score was if we get troops ashore on bermuda were winning pat cooley said if we dontif we dont the navy department had a lousy idea no sooner had he said that than another destroyer signaled themthe damaged cruiser was no longer close advance with us to bombard island the other ships signal lamp flashed acknowledge and tell em were on the way sam said to cooley aye aye sir bermuda was actually made up of several lowlying islands linked by bridges and causeways the josephus daniels fire went in against the airstrip in the northeast the gunners worked their pieces with furious haste knowing that the more damage they did the less chance british and cs airplanes would have of getting off the ground and striking back landing boats waddled forward from troopships that stayed out of the artillery range hidden gun emplacements opened up on them here and there a boat was hit and went up in flames or simply sank but most of the landing craft made it to the beach us bombers and fighters pounded all the enemy positions they could find us army men and marines swarmed forward sam hoped for the best till armstrong grimes got wounded hed never been in upstate new york in his life but a lot of us military hospitals were in that part of the country because confederate bombers had to fly a long way to get there the one where he was recuperating lay somewhere between syracuse and rochester since he wasnt sure which town was which he would have had trouble nailing it down any better than that lying around doing nothing with nobody to yell at him for it felt strange almost unnatural not worrying about snipers or machine guns felt even stranger he got plenty of chownot wonderful chow but better than the canned stuff hed been eating most of the time he got all the cigarettes he wanted even if they were us barge scrapings instead of confederate tobacco and the nurses werenurses women some of them were tough old battleaxes whod been taking care of people since the great war others though were young and cute and friendly armstrong hoped some of them would prove more than friendly guys whod been there a while told stories about nurses who helped soldiers recuperate by hopping into bed with them but soldiers always told stories about women armstrong didnt see anything like that no matter how much he wished he would even so he couldnt remember the last time hed been around women who didnt want to blow his brains out it reminded him there was a bigger world out there than the one that involved storming the next apartment building full of mormons or canucks so did reading newspapers and listening to the wireless oh they were full of things like the reconquest of bermuda and the us drive aimed at chattanooga but that wasnt all they didnt go on about the war twentyfour hours a day there were stories about crime and scandal and films and a lady in schenectady whod had quadruplets that one impressed the nurses more than it did armstrong men one of them sniffed when she found out armstrong didnt get it can you imagine trying to take care of four little tiny babies all at once can you imagine trying to take care of four twoyearolds all at once my god she rolled her eyes armstrong couldnt imagine anything like that but since susan was young and cute instead of being a battleaxe he did his best bad he asked my god she repeated my kids are almost two years apart and they still drive me nuts but four of them doing the same things making the same messes getting into the same trouble all at the same time i hope shes got lots of people helping her thats all i can tell you she wore a wedding ring armstrong hadnt even noticed before damn he thought wheres your husband stationed he asked hes in west texas right now susan answered hes been lucky so far she reached out and knocked on the nightstand by his ironframed cot but when i see what can happen to you guys she grimaced im getting better said armstrong not the least selfcentered young man around but then he realized that might need something more with it he did his best most of us are getting better he won a smile from the nurse i know she said but i still worry how can i help it i guess you cant but it doesnt do you any good armstrong said it doesnt do your husband any good either whats his name anyway he didnt give a rats ass what the guys name was but asking might make susan like him better and who could say where that would take him her smile got biggershe did appreciate the question hes jerry she said hes so sweet her face went all mushy if shed looked at armstrong that way he would have been in business since she was thinking about jerry instead he just lay there and smiled himself and nodded he didnt hope the guy would stop an antibarrel round with his face but he didnt exactly love him either he watched susans perky behind as she went to check on the wounded man in the next bed he wasnt the only recovering soldier watching her the guys in this ward were wounded yeah but they were a long way from dead that afternoon susan bustled up to him with a different kind of smile on her face she was pleased for him youve got visitors she announced then turned and said you can come in now in walked his father and mother his mother gave him a big hug and a kiss his father squeezed his hand hard and said im proud of you son what for getting shot armstrong said im not proud of that it was just bad luck no not for getting shot merle grimes left hand stayed on the head of his cane for being brave enough to fight in the front line and for doing it well his old man had done his fighting a generation earlier and he must have forgotten how things worked you didnt go to the front line because you were brave you went there because some slob with stars on his shoulder straps decided your regiment could do a particular jobor maybe because you drew the short straw and if you didnt go forward when the other guys did the army made sure you caught hell if you did go forward you had a chance of coming through anyway youre going to be all right his mother said the nurse told us so yeah mom armstrong said i probably wont even have a limp they were talking about putting him back on duty once he healed up so he figured the chances hed be able to walk straight were pretty fair thats good edna grimes said not that it would be the end of the world she added hastily looking at her husband i understood what you meant merle grimes said im not ashamed of my limp or anythingi earned it honestly but i wouldnt be sorry if i didnt have it thanks for coming both of you you didnt have to do anything like this armstrong said oh yes we did his mother and father said together whos taking care of annie he asked his little sister was getting big these days she didnt need as much care as she would have a few years earlier your aunt clara has her his mother answered she says she hopes you get better soonclara does i mean so does annie of course thats nice armstrong said as politely as he could he didnt like his aunt and it was mutual clara was his moms half sister and only a couple of years older than he was they hadnt been able to stand each other ever since they were little kids he was surprised clara didnt hope hed got his dick shot off his mother always tried to pretend things werent as bad as they really were his father who didnt chuckled she doesnt want to see you dead armstrong he said not unless she does it herself anyway merle by her tone edna grimes would make dad pay for that no matter how true it was oh come on edna i was joking he said at the same time though he tipped armstrong a wink he wasnt joking a bit but he didnt feel like fighting with his wife he looked at the bandages on armstrongs leg how did it happen we were pushing north toward winnipeg the canucks had a strongpoint in a farmhouse armstrong answered i was one of the guys moving up and the damn machine gun got me bad luck thats all like i said before he paused how did you get wounded dad hed never felt able to ask before now they both belonged to the same fraternity hed had himself acaliber initiation it was a trench raid merle grimes answered without the slightest hesitation we used to pull them all the time to grab a few prisoners and see what the guys on the other side were up to the front didnt move then the way it does nowadays we got in we threw some grenades around we caught some confederates and we were on our way back when some son of a bitchexcuse me ednanailed me from behind stinky morris and herm cassin got me back to our side of the line and it was off to an aid station after that it hurt like awell it hurt like anything yeah i found out about that for the first little bit it was just like somebody knocked me down but not for long armstrong shook his head no not for long he didnt want to remember that so he asked how are things back in dc well we arent occupied his mother said it was bad when the confederates took the town last time around and it was really bad when the usa took it back i wasnt much older than you are now when that happened but in between there was a long stretch that was pretty quiet when the front was too far north to let guns reach us bombers werent so much back then they are now his father said the confederates still come over us two or three nights a week were not far from their fields so they can really load up we go to the cellars when the sirens start howling and we hope for the best you cant do much else its almost like being in the line except you dont get to shoot back yourself i guess armstrong had no idea what civilian life in wartime was like hed been a conscript when the shooting started you have enough to eat and everything thats better than it was the last time around his mother said i was in the service the last time around so i cant compare his father said but its not too bad not much meattheres this horrible chopped ham that comes in cans he and armstrongs mother both made faces he went on what we get mostly isnt exciting and a lot of the fruits and vegetables are canned too but nobodys going hungry your rations sound like theyre better than what we ate in the trenches boy i never wanted to see another bean after i got out we always bitch about what we get armstrong said his father laughed king davids soldiers probably did the same thing yeah probably armstrong said but the biggest thing i dont like is that you get bored there arent that many different kinds of rations and some guys wont like some of them so that cuts it down more youre always happy when you can scrounge some chickens or a pig once in utah we ate a goat his mother made a disgusted noise his father just sounded interested as he asked how was it better than i expected armstrong answered kinda tough and kinda gamy but we had this polack in the squadeyechart we called him cause his name looked really weird with all those ss and zs and wswho stewed it and stewed it and it ended up so it was better than rations anyway sounds like he had some practice in the old country his father said him or his folksi think he was born here armstrong said but the coffees lousy and the cigarettes are worse thats the uh dirty end of the stick merle grimes chuckled at the justintime censorship then he said close your eyes armstrong did when his father said he could open them he found himself looking at three packs of raleighs these are for you wow dad thanks armstrong knew he would have to share them with his wardmates he didnt care they were wonderful anyhow whered you get em a friend of mine has a son who captured a confederate truck crammed full of them his father answered wow armstrong said again short of nabbing jake featherston he couldnt think of anything better that guy shouldve won the medal of honor he hadnt thought a visit from his parents could turn out so well a truckload of raleighs that was almost better to think about than susan nothing official ever came of cincinnatus drivers runin with sergeant cannizzaro he hadnt thought it would technically he was a civilian so they couldnt even courtmartial him the most they could do was take away his gun and ship him home that would have pissed him off but it wouldnt have broken his heart he knew he had a better chance of living to a ripe old age in des moines than he did hauling supplies through the csa but there were more kinds of results than official ones the way he handled himself when the confederates hit the supply column and the way he stood up to the jerk of a us quartermaster sergeant won him respect from his fellow drivers youre all right you know hal williamson sounded half surprised when he said it as they dug into ration cans somewhere in central tennessee never had much to do with colored fellows before aint a whole lot of em in manchester new hampshire you kinda believe what folks say but like i said youre all right youre justa guy what did you expect cincinnatus paused to light a raleigh the confederate from whom hed taken the pack wouldnt be smoking again unless he smoked down in hell i aint got horns i aint got a tail he was thinking about hell all right not what i meant williamson cast about for a way to say what he did mean he was about cincinnatus age with steelrimmed bifocals and with three fingers gone from his left hand he gestured with that mutilated hand to make his point i didnt figure you peopled have the balls to do some of the things you done niggersre like any other folks cincinnatus used the word on purpose he could use it though he would have slugged williamson had he heard it from the white mans lips somes smart somes dumb somes brave somes cowards somes goodlookin somes mullions hal williamson blinked at that bit of black slang but he followed it cincinnatus went on maybe i got balls maybe i dont but even if i do that dont say nothin about what niggersre like it only goes to show what im like you see what i mean maybe williamson lit a cigarette of his own its like sayin all jews are cheap or all mexicansll pull a knife on you if you look at em sideways he probably knew even less about mexicans than he did about negroes there might be a negro or two in manchester but cincinnatus would have bet there were no mexicans still he got the point thats what im sayin cincinnatus told him biggest difference between black folks and white folks is youre white and were black next biggest difference is you been on top if we was on top you bet wed treat you just as shitty as you treated us williamson blinked again behind those glasses cincinnatus chuckled silently the idea that negroes could be on top plainly had never occurred to the other driver son of a bitch williamson said after a moment and then well i bet you would itswhat do you call it human nature thats what reckon so cincinnatus said tell you some more human nature i ever get my hands on jake featherstondo jesus yeah the white man said but for me its on account of he jumped my country its personal for you aint it you might say so cincinnatus stubbed out his cigarette and twisted his hands as if he were wringing a chickens neckor a mans yeah you just might say so they got rolling again a few minutes later carrying this that and the other thing down past delphi to where the united states were building up for the attack on chattanooga armored cars accompanied the column so did a couple of halftracks full of soldiers the powers that be probably cared very little about the truck drivers safety what they were hauling that was another story here in tennessee the column needed all the protection it could get the only land the united states really held here was land their men were standing on everything else belonged to the confederates even shotup autos by the side of the road could be deadly dangerous one of them blew up with an enormous roar as an armored car went by the vehicle got two flat tires and a dent but otherwise withstood the blast whoever set off the auto bomb would have done better to wait for a softskinned truck us machine guns sprayed the woods but that was a forlorn hope they also fired at other roadside wrecks which turned out to be a good idea one burntout command car exploded while the closest us vehicle was still a quarter of a mile away cincinnatus whooped when it did one of featherstons fuckers cussin his head off now he said jubilantly the jubilation didnt last it never did infiltrators or holdouts started shooting at the trucks a deuceandahalf lurched off the road with a driver wounded or dead another coughed to a stop when it took a bullet through the engine block a couple had tires flattened and had to change them an armored car stayed behind with them to obstruct the snipers and to shoot at them if they broke cover along with most of the other drivers cincinnatus went on night was falling when they got to the supply dump soldiers holding dim red flashlights guided them to the unloading point more men waited there with wheelbarrows and dollies off in the distance artillery rumbled come on youse guys move it a familiar voice shouted cincinnatus swore under his breath if that wasnt sergeant cannizzaro he was a blond took youse long enough to get here the quartermaster sergeant complained telling him where to go and how to get there was bound to be more trouble than it was worth cincinnatus just sat in the cab of his truck and wished he could have a cigarette signs all over the dump screamed no smoking at the top of their printed lungs here you go jack somebody handed him a sandwich through the open window why thank you kindly cincinnatus said in glad surprise he was even more surprisedand even gladderwhen he bit into it that thick slab of ham had never lived in a us army ration can he didnt know where the soldier came up with it but it was mighty good he wished for a bottle of beer to go with it no sooner had he wished than another soldier came along and gave him a bottle ofdr hopper soda pop wasnt the same but it wasnt bad either it had to be plunder same as the ham the taste reminded him he was back in the csa dr hopper didnt come over the borderat least hed never seen it up in des moines he hoped they dropped a bomb on the factory that made the stuffmaybe after hed got hold of a couple of cases for himself for old times sake swearing soldiers unloaded his truck he thought the cussing in this war was even worse than it had been the last time around people then sometimes seemed faintly embarrassed at what came out of their mouths nowadays men didnt even notice they were turning the air blue they swore as automatically as they breathedand profanity seemed as necessary as air hey sergeant somebody called you got beds for us what you aint goin back right away cannizzaro sounded genuinely amazed a volley of cursespurposeful not automaticwashed over him cincinnatus added his two cents worth to the barrage the idea of crawling along in the dark with useless tapedup headlights waiting for raiders he couldnt see to open up was less than appealing sergeant cannizzaro knew when he was outgunned awright already he said stay here he might have been outgunned in the literal sense cincinnatus had traded in his for a captured confederate submachine gun other drivers carried springfields or even cs automatic riflesalthough us infantrymen in the line grabbed most of those like i said aint got no beds cannizzaro went on youse can spread out bedrolls on the ground or youse can sleep in your trucks aint nobody gonna give you no trouble till morning honest to god cincinnatus slept under his truck more men stayed in their cabs but he couldnt stretch out at full length in there with his battered carcass sleeping all scrunched up mostly meant not sleeping a crumpledup jacket made a good enough pillow cincinnatus battered bones creaked as he turned and twisted to get as comfortable as he could all that wiggling might have kept him awake foroh an extra thirty seconds he came back to himself the next morning when somebody gave him a shake and said you fuckin die under there pop i was restin cincinnatus said with as much dignity as he could manage around a yawn yeah well youll be arrested if you dont get your ass in gear the other soldier said and he went off to torment somebody else breakfast was scrambled eggs and more slices of that terrific ham wherever it came from cannizzaro and his merry men had a lot of it you ever see anybody skinny in the quartermaster corps bruce donovan asked yeah well what the hell most of the time cincinnatus would have been as eager as the other driver to slander sergeant cannizzaro and his ilk since the guys at the supply dump were sharing their bounty this morning he was willing to let them off easy he wasnt jumping up and down at the idea of going back up north to get more supplies oh the army needed themno doubt about it but running the gauntlet again even with armored escorts didnt thrill him that hardly crossed his mind before donovan said to think i volunteered for this shit cincinnatus couldnt have put it better himself since he couldnt he finished his coffee and limped back to his truck the convoy hadnt gone far before it had to stop the confederates must have sent bombers over in the night and a couple of them had scored direct hits on the highway the bombs must have been big ones toothe craters were thirty or forty feet wide and at least half that deep nobody was going anywhere on that road not for a while especially since similar craters pocked the fields to either side army engineers with bulldozers were busy repairing the damage soldiers in greengray went through the bushes to clear out snipers so the engineers could work without harassing fire that made cincinnatus jealous but the engineers werent even moving targets they were sitting ducks more engineers were stretching lengths of steel mattingthe kind used to make emergency airstripsacross the field to serve as a makeshift road while the real one was getting fixed after about half an hour the job was done well enough to suit them they waved the lead truck forward cincinnatus was glad he wasnt driving lead but where the deuceandahalf ahead of him went he followed the matting was a little higher than an ordinary curb would have been his truck didnt like climbing up onto the stuff but it could he bumped along then jounced down then climbed up onto another strip of matting skirting the bomb craters went slowly but it went and those soldiers out there beating the bushes were keeping him safe along with the engineers he tipped his cap to them though they couldnt see him do it everybody stepped on the gas once he got back onto the paved highway cincinnatus was happy to mash the pedal down to the floorboard he knew he might be rushing toward danger not away from it all the same hed felt like a sitting duck himself back there he was glad to get away nobody got hurt on the run north from delphi which made it a good one only three or four shots were fired at the column they sounded like rounds to cincinnatus those wouldnt come from confederate soldiers who had better weapons but from some civilian with a squirrel gun and a grudge us authorities had confiscated all the firearms they could the penalties for holding on to rifles and pistols were bloodthirsty the confederate citizenry didnt seem to care cincinnatus wished he were more surprised halfway to camp determination that was how abner dowling looked at it he wished hed come farther he wished his men could have moved faster but hed been stalled in front of lubbock too damn long the eleventh armysuch as it waswas moving again how much anybody back east caredmight be a different story he hadnt got the reinforcements he hoped for everything the us army could lay its hands on was going into the drive toward chattanooga dowling didnt much like that but he understood it one reason he wasnt going as fast or as far as he wished he could was that the confederates were bringing in reinforcements freedom party guard outfits that fought as if there were no tomorrow they made dowling scratch his head for all kinds of reasons theyve got fewer men in tennessee and kentucky than we do right he asked his adjutant one hot sticky summer morning certainly seems so major angelo toricelli agreed theyre in trouble over there and were not right dowling persisted unless our newspapers and wireless people are lying even harder than featherstons yes sir toricelli said possible i suppose but not likely bet your ass its not dowling said which made the younger officer blink all right then we keep saying we cant afford to send anything out here to the ass end of nowhere but featherstons sending people sending equipment out here like its going out of style i know hes a son of a bitch but up till now i never thought he was a dumb son of a bitch you know what i mean yes sir toricelli said i can only think of one thing well youre one up on me if you can spit it out dowling had always enjoyed feeling smarter than george custer now he watched his own adjutant feeling smarter than he was to the confederates sir this isnt the ass end of nowhere toricelli said well yes but why not dowling asked you cant really mean they think killing off negroes as fast as they can is more important than keeping us out of chattanooga the words hung in the air after he said them the oppressive humidity might have borne them up major toricelli nodded thats it sir that is what i think nothing else makes sense to me then featherston really is off the deep end dowling exclaimed could be sir i dont know anything about that im no headcandler but whether hes nuts or not hes still running the csa and nobodys trying to stop him that i know of when he yells jump frog they all ask how high on the way up good god dowling murmured if youll let your country go down the drain so you can do this insteadim not sure a headcandler can help you i hope nobody can help him toricelli said but hes been at war with negroes about as long as hes been at war with the usa dont they say he had a chance to stop the uprisings in the last war only his superior wouldnt let him take a servant in for questioning something like that anyway i think youre right or close enough dowling said but if he beats us he can do what he wants with the negroes later if he goes on killing them and we lick him theyre gone and he dies happy toricelli said he sure as hell dies dowling said send the war department a report showing the reinforcements weve run up against send them a summary of what weve been talking about too they should know we think he thinks that way dont be shy about giving yourself credit either you were there ahead of me thank you sir major toricelli sounded as if he meant that dowling understood why when he served under custer nothing was ever the great mans fault anything good accrued to the great mans credit here dowling consciously tried not to imitate his old boss he sent an armored probe forwardand got it bloodied yes the confederates finally were reinforced they had new armor of their own and that meant trouble theyd go nipping in after his supply line next he had the feeling hed come about as far as he could or maybe a little farther one thing the enemy didnt have was much air power dowling summoned colonel defrancis i want you to go after those barrels and selfpropelled guns terry he said go after their fuel dumps too lets see how much we can slow em down ill do my goddamnedest sir defrancis said weve got some new inchandahalf guns mounted under dive bombers turns em into barrel busters they dive fire from close range pull up and climb then do it again engine decking hasnt got a prayer of standing up to an armorpiercing round like that sounds good to me dowling told him turn em loose let em hunt lets see what they can do lets see if they can keep those bastards off our necks yes sir terry defrancis sounded enthusiastic he often did especially when dowling was turning him loose on a new and exciting hunt for most officers as for most other people in executive positions what they did was a job some of them were better at it than others but for the able and not so able alike it was work defrancis was different he enjoyed what he did he had a good time doing it maybe he got a hardon watching things blow up dowling didnt knowhe didnt ask but the colonels enjoyment made him a better combat officer he constantly looked for new ways to put the enemy in trouble chances were he grinned when he found them too west texas made good barrel country it was nice and flatyou could see for miles there werent a lot of forests for barrels to hide in either that made for a wideopen fight and also for a fair fight but if barrels had trouble hiding from one another they also had trouble hiding from airplanes the usa controlled the skies hereabouts abner dowling aimed to make the most of it his headquarters wasnt close enough to the airstrip to let him hear defrancis dive bombers and fighterbombers take off why put all your eggs anywhere near the same basket when the prairie was so wide he stayed where he was strengthened his flanks in case the aircraft didnt do as much as he hoped they would and waited to see what happened next custer wouldnt wait he thought custer would charge ahead regardless and no doubt he was right because custer always aimed to get the bit between his teeth and charge ahead regardless about four times out of five he ended up wishing he hadnt the fifth timethe fifth time left him with his reputation as a great general because the fifth time he charged the other side shattered instead of his own dowling knew he wouldnt go down in the history books as a great general the two likeliest candidates this time around were irving morrell and george patton patton got off to a fast start in ohio but morrell was making up groundliterally as well as metaphoricallyin kentucky and tennessee who held higher honors in the books would probably depend on who won the war some men who realized they werent going to be great generals turned into failures instead they drank too much or they became sour martinets or they forgot about discipline for themselves and everybody under them dowling tried not to commit those particular sins if he couldnt be a great general he could be a pretty good one and that was what he aimed at he awaited developments then a great general probably would have forced them a pretty good general could decide he was in no position to force them which seemed plain as a punch in the nose to dowling he consoled himself by deciding it would take a great general to beat him and so far his confederate counterpart had shown no signs of greatness if anything the fellow on the other side seemed to have more trouble making up his mind than dowling did the awaited developmentsdidnt develop no column full of freedom party guards and enemy armor crashed into dowlings flank from the wide open spaces to the north or south dowling briefly wondered whether his opposite number had had his imagination surgically removed when he was only a lad then the aerial reconnaissance photos came in terry defrancis came in with themand with a spring in his step and a cigar in his mouth will you look at these sir he said will you just look at them if you quit waving them around i will dowling said sorry sir defrancis set them on his desk dowling spread them out so he could look at several at once they all seemed to feature vehicles on fire and pillars of smoke mounting up to the sky some of the burning vehicles were trucks but quite a few were barrels you hit them hard dowling said sir we fucking pulverized them pardon my french defrancis said they were driving along without a care in the world right out in the open and we caught em naked with their legs spread we screwed em too we screwed em to the wall with news like that you can speak french to me any old day dowling said thank you sir colonel defrancis grinned around the cigar he grew a little more serious as he went on air power matters here it really matters weve got it and the other guys dont that gives them just as much trouble approaching us as a fleet of battleships has approaching an airplane carrier dont get carried away dowling warned they can do things battleships cant they can camouflage themselves they can spread out so you dont catch so many of them together i suppose they can even use dummies and hit with their real force while you attack those defrancis eyed him sir im glad were on the same side youve got an evil nasty sneaky mind you say the sweetest things colonel dowling batted his eyelashes at the younger man watching a portly sixtyish general simper and flirt was almost enough to make defrancis swallow his stogie as his air commander had before dowling quickly sobered youre doing a terrific job terry i just dont want you to get too confident fair enough sir defrancis said dowling hoped he meant it when you were winning when things were going your way it was easy to think victory was meant to be custer always did hell custer thought victory was meant to be even when hed just taken a shellacking his confidence made his troops pay a fearful butchers bill in the end custer made his vision of victory real dowling wanted defrancis to do that without causing his own side the misery custer had whats the next thing you can do that would hurt the enemy most dowling asked catch another column flatfooted defrancis replied at once dowling tried again whats the next thing you can do that would hurt the enemy most assuming hes not an idiot colonel defrancis took longer to answer this time at last he said well the more we pound his supply lines the more trouble hell have hitting us fine dowling said do it even if the war department wont send us more men they dont seem constipated about shipping us ordnance as long as weve got it we might as well drop it on the confederates heads i like the way you think sir defrancis said i just hope the bastards in butternut dont dowling answered keep hammering them if we can soften em up enough we will drive on camp determination he spoke with no small determination of his own hey sarge one of the soldiers in chester martins platoon called to him whats up frankie martin asked found this out on patrol figured i better bring it in so you could see frankie held out a piece of paper thanksi think chester took it it was cheap pulp not much better than newspaper grade the printing was cheap too letters blurred ink smeary the message though was something else again yankee murderers it began and went downhill from there the gist was that us soldiers whod shot hostages couldnt expect to be treated as prisoners of war we shoot mad dogs it read and anyone who slaughters innocent confederate civilians puts himself forever beyond the pale of civilized warfare what do you think sarge frankie asked me i think theres no such thing as an innocent confederate civilian except maybe in his left ear chester answered you tell anybody else about this little love letter frankie shook his head no sarge not me dont flabble about it if you didbound to be lots more copies out there martin said but dont go yelling it from the housetops either you did good bringing it to me im going to let captain rhodes have a look at it rhodes studied the flyer then looked up at chester thanks for showing this to me sergeant ill kick it up to intelligence let the boys there check it out id say we hit a nerve sir chester said how do you mean looks to me like the confederates are saying they cant protect their own and theyre trying to scare us into being nice little boys and girls rhodes answered or do you think im wrong youve been around the block a few timesyou know whats what i dont know my ass from a hole in the ground half the time chester thought about it you may be right i dont know that you are but you may be fair enough captain rhodes said well see what the intelligence johnnies think hell they wont pay any attention to meim just a dumb line officer so what the fuck can i know youre a damn good company commander sir martin said ive been around that blocki ought to know thanks when you say something like that i know youre not blowing smoke up my ass cause you dont need to rhodes said i know damn well weve got more good companylevel officers than first sergeants he wasnt wrong the worst thing he could do to chester was take away his platoon and if he did if some babyfaced shavetail started commanding it instead who would really be running things any which way chester and hubert rhodes both knew the answer to that one do we have any notion when were going after chattanooga sir chester asked im sure we do if we counts the big brains back in philly rhodes answered if you mean do i have any notion well no cant be too much longercan it martin said i wouldnt think so both sides are building up as fast as they can the company commander said as long as we keep building faster than the confederates everythings fine and i think we are weve got air superiority hereweve got it just about everywhere except between richmond and philadelphia we can smash them when they try to move men and supplies forward and they cant do that to us weve got more men to start with too chester said their small arms make up for some of that but not for all of it now our barrels are better than theirs tootill they run out their next model anyway rhodes said we can lick em sergeant we can and i think we will sounds good to me sir chester said if the confederates thought their us opponents could beat them they did a hell of a job of hiding it chester had seen that in the last war you could beat the bastards in butternut but most of them kept their peckers up right till the end they kept fighting with everything they had maybe they didnt have as much as they would have if us airplanes werent bombing the crap out of their supply lines chester didnt know about that they still seemed to have plenty of artillery ammunition their automatic rifles and submachine guns didnt run short of cartridges either they had enough fuel to send barrels and armored cars forward when they counterattackedand they counterattacked whenever they thought they saw a chance to take back some ground the terrain south of delphi didnt need long to turn into the sort of lunar landscape chester had known and loathed during the great war the stench of death hung over it something even uglier than the view which wasnt easy soldiers sheltered in craters and foxholes trench lines and barbed wire were thinner on the ground than they had been a generation earlier mostly because barrels could breach them nobody liked this kind of fighting going back and forth over the same few miles of ground when do we break out sarge frankie asked one day he was scooping up pork and beans from a can we go somewhere new maybe it wont smell so bad maybe chesters ration can was full of what was alleged to be beef stew the grayish meat inside might have been boiled tire tread chester had never found a piece with goodyear stamped on it but that didnt mean he wouldnt and the confederates thought yankee chow was better than what their own quartermasters dished out that was a scary thought he went on i asked captain rhodes the other day he didnt know either well if he dont chances are nobody does hes a hell of a smart man the captain is frankie said thats a fact chester said they were still eating when a confederate junior officer came forward with a white flag he asked for a twohour truce for both sides to pick up their wounded martin greeted him with a glare yeah suppose you get some of our guys you gonna shoot em once you take em back behind the lines good god no the cs lieutenant said we dont do things like that except maybe to niggers chester said he watched the enemy soldier turn red but the man didnt even waste his breath denying it we dont do that to soldiers in a declared war was all he said sounds like bullshit to me buddy chester said what about that goddamn leaflet youve been spreading all over creation the cs lieutenant blushed again that wasnt soldiers who did that it was freedom party guys from the director of communications office how the hell are we supposed to tell the difference youve even got freedom party guards coming into the line along with regular soldiers what are we supposed to do kill all of you bastards and let god worry about it afterwards i dont have anything to do with ordering that stuff the confederate said if they come up here theyre soldiers they perform like soldiers dont they he waited martin couldnt very well deny that seeing that he couldnt the officer went on honest to god sergeant if we find your people well take em prisoner if we start doing things to em and you people find out youve got our pows to get even with that made a certain brutal sense to chester he nodded all right lieutenant two hours your medics and oursand probably a little bit of trading back and forth got any coffee not much came up into the usa the army got most of what there was and stretched it as far as it would go which made it pretty awful swap you some for a couple cans of deviled ham thats the best damn ration around the lieutenant said before talking to him chester had made sure he had some he would have bet the confederate wanted it the lieutenant gave him a cloth sack full of whole roasted beans just the smell the wonderful smell was enough to pry his eyelids farther apart yeah thats the straight goods sure as hell chester said reverently i got me some eggs the lieutenant said got me some butter too gonna scramble em up with this ham for a moment they both forgot about the war then the confederate officer turned and waved to his men chester also turned ceasefire he yelled two hours medics forward he nodded to the lieutenant you can head on back now thanks the officer raised his hand in what wasnt quite a wave and wasnt quite a salute away he went from both sides of the line men with red cross smocks and with the red cross painted on their helmets moved up to gather casualtiesand to share cigarettes and food and coffee and maybe an unofficial nip or two from a canteen men on both sides stood up and stretched and walked around without fear of getting shot if they were smart they tried not to show exactly where their hiding places were snipers had a nasty habit of remembering stuff like that corpsmen brought back a soldier with a wound dressing on his leg how you doing miller chester asked im out of the fucking war for a while anyway miller didnt sound sorry hed got hit a lot of people who caught hometowners felt the same way chester kept smelling that wonderful coffee he wanted to smash up the beans with the hilt of his belt knife or find a hammer to do it and to make himself three or four cups worth of joe right then the enemy lieutenant had probably brought it forward the same way hed carried the cans of deviled ham the fellow had to know what a damnyankee would want another wounded man came in this one with a bloodsoaked bandage on his head the medics looked grim bad chester said about as bad as it gets one of the medics answered head wound in one side and out the other god knows how hes still breathing with half his brains blown out take a miracle for him to get better take a miracle for him to still be breathing this time tomorrow another medic said the man whod spoken first didnt tell him he was wrong shaking their heads the stretcher team carried the wounded soldier back towards an aid station fuck chester martin said softly krikor hartunianhell of a namedidnt belong to his platoon but he came from captain rhodes company he was a baby when his folks were lucky enough to escape from the ottoman empire an awful lot of armenians hadnt been so lucky some people said the massacres the turks pulled off helped give jake featherston the idea for getting rid of the csas negroes chester had no idea if that was true all he knew was that a confederate bullet had slaughtered krikorusually called greg the kids folks had a farm somewhere in central california nowadays pretty soon a western union messenger would deliver a deeply regrets telegram from the war department people didnt want to see western union messengers these days chester remembered his folks talking about that during the last war these days they called the poor kidswho were only doing their jobangels of death wasnt that a hell of a thing here in southern tennessee death came without angels when the truce ran out both sides fired a few warning shots anybody still up and around and out in the open ran for cover then they got back to the business of murder xiv gracchus band of black guerrillas kept growing at first cassius thought that was wonderful then he noticed how worried the rebel leader looked whats the matter he asked gracchus eyed him with something less than joy howm i gonna keep all you sons of bitches fed he burst out oh cassius had no answer for that hed eaten well his whole life in augusta hed gone on eating well or as well as any negro could after the freedom party enclosed the terry in barbed wire only after he escaped did he discover what living with his belly bumping his backbone was like a full stomach was better how his father his old fussy precise father would have laughed at him for that brilliant discovery he hoped scipio wherever he was still could laugh what he hoped and what he feared were very different things oh gracchus echoed sardonically yeah you kin say oh but you only gots to say it i gots to do somethin about it cassius paused to fiddle with the sling to his tredegar when he first got the rifle he messed with it all the time trying to make the ninepound weight comfortable now as often as not he forgot he was carrying it if the sling hadnt found some way to twist he wouldnt have noticed it when i was in the city i reckoned country niggers lived in these little villages he said yalld grow your own corn and raise chickens and pigs and like that an i reckoned thered be plenty o vittles used to be like dat gracchus said bitterly i was a sharecropper had me a pot bellybest believe i did he was skinny as a snake now and at least as mean freedom party git in they start makin all kinds o harvesters an combines an shit put all us niggers outa work fucked them villages like you wouldnt believe got the factories set up so they could make barrels too cassius said thats a fact gracchus eyed him you aint dumb is you me cassius said in surprise he always thought of himself as pretty dumb he measured himself against his fatherwhat young man doesnt his father as far as he could tell knew everything there was to know he could even talk white and do it better than most whites could hed tried to teach cassius some of what he knew cassius could read and write and cipher past that he hadnt cared to learn for the first time he wondered if hed made a mistake it was too late of course life didnt hand you many second chances if you were black in the csa life didnt hand you many first chances i aint talkin about demosthenes over there gracchus said demosthenes was larger than cassius stronger than cassius braver than cassius as far as cassius could tell demosthenes feared nothing and nobody he was hung like a horse too on the other hand he was so dumb he had to remind himself out loud how to tie his shoes gracchus went on we need folks wholl do whatever somebody tells em to do an do it right now gots to have folks like dat no two ways about it but we gots to have people who kin think some too me cassius said again reckon so gracchus answered next thing we gots to see is if folks jump when you tells em to we fight the damn mexicans again you try it see what happens things go good got us a new officer me cassius knew he was starting to sound like a broken record what he didnt know was whether he wanted to be an officer he didnt like other people ordering him around his father could speak volumes on thatif he was in a position to speak volumes on anything cassius didnt see why other people would want him ordering them around either but gracchus had no doubts from everything cassius had seen gracchus hardly ever had doubts that was one of the things that made him a leader you he said now with a decisive nod if you kin do the job you better step up an do it that cut close to the bone francisco joses mexicans had made most unwilling soldiers when they first came to the csa now they seemed to realize they werent going home any time soon and that it was the black guerrillas fault just as blacks wanted revenge on whites so the mexican soldiers wanted revenge on blacks and if they didnt unconscripted confederate whites did the lame the halt the old the very youngsome of them could take rifles out into the field and go after the rebels haunting georgia and even the ones who couldnt served as sentries and guards and did all they could to make life difficult for raiding bands of negroesand to fire up the mexicans so they fought harder too all of which made this march through the central part of the state grim and hungry gracchus had scouts out before and behind to the left and to the right he knew the guerrillas were hunted all right so far though they kept slipping through the net and how much good does it do cassius wondered he wished he hadnt thought of the raiders as haunting the georgia countryside that made them too much like ghosts of what had been there before what would never come back to life again whites in the towns were real everything out herewell so what a lot of town dwellers had to see things that way anyhow but without the countryside where would the confederates states get their cotton and peanuts and tobacco their corn and rice and hogs thanks to the freedom party and the machinery the countryside needed far fewer workers to produce its crops than it had ten years earlier but it still needed some and it still needed the machines if farmers and farmworkers got shot if combines got torched how was the confederacy supposed to bring in any kind of harvest at all nobody challenged the guerrilla band as it tramped along a narrow blacktop road gracchus probably knew where the fighters were going but cassius had no idea the countryside was a whole different world and not one where he belonged he knew every alleyway and corner of the terryand much good that ended up doing him now he had something new to learn and he wouldif he lived long enough something buzzed overhead for a second cassius thought it was a stupid country bug that didnt come into cities then he saw other guerrillas pointing and heard them swearing his eyes followed their upraised fingers the biplane circling up there had been obsolete as a fighting machine since the mids if not longer but it did just fine spotting people who couldnt shoot it down goddamn thing gracchus snarled bet your ass some fucker with a wireless set bringin sojers down on us that struck cassius as much too likely but the biplane pilot had other things in mind too he dove on the guerrillas scatter three blacks yelled at the same time the airplane mounted two machine guns set above the engine and firing through the prop cassius could see them winking on and off on and off as the pilot fired one short burst after another afterwards he couldnt have said why he didnt run like most of the other men it wasnt lack of fear with bullets from the guns cracking past and with others pinging and shrieking as they ricocheted off the paving he would have been an idiot not to be afraid hadnt gracchus just called him a smart fellow wounded men screamed to either side of the road cassius raised his rifle to his shoulder and fired two shots at the swooping biplane he knew he wasnt the only guerrilla shooting at it but he was sure one of his shots caught the pilot in the chest he had a good bead on the man and saw him throw up his arms when he was hit the biplane never pulled out of the dive but slammed into the ground less than a hundred yards away do jesus cassius exclaimed through the crunching thud of the impact and the roar of the fireball that went up an instant later do jesus machinegun rounds in the burning wreck started cooking off pop pop pop like firecrackers on the fourth of july a bullet snapped past cassius head as if the pilot were still fighting back from beyond the grave you the one who nailed that ofay asshole gracchus asked coming out from between the rows of corn that grew to either side of the road reckon i am cassius answered then he coughed the breeze was blowing back from the downed airplane toward him it was thick with the smells of burning fabric burning fuel hot metaland charred flesh he thought that odor would stay with him the rest of his life how come you didnt run and hide the guerrilla leader asked beats me cassius said honestly just didnt think to i guess didnt think to didnt fuckin think to gracchus came up and gave him an affectionate clout in the side of the head hope you do some more not thinkin real soon now you hear you know what the ofays gonna do when they find out you shoot down their fancy airplane they gonna shit thats what he clouted cassius again which the younger man could have done without cassius knew better than to say so he looked down at the asphalt around his feet bullet scars pockmarked it the white man in that airplane had done his level best to kill him one of the bullet marks lay right between his feet he started to realize just how lucky he was it didnt make him feel proud or brave no it made him want to shiver instead not everybody was so lucky the guerrillas were doing what they could for their wounded what they could do was pitifully little they could bandage they could suturecrudely they could put alcohol or iodine on injuries if they were desperate enough they could put ether on a rag and go after a bullet with stolen forceps past thatno was there a black doctor a black surgeon anywhere in the csa cassius didnt think so oh maybe in new orleans people went on and on about what negroes in new orleans were supposed to be able to do were there any negroes surgeons or otherwise in new orleans these days or had they all gone to the camps like the rest of cassius family if they had would any of them ever come out again cassius feared he knew the answer he knew it but he didnt want to think about it thinking about it would have meant thinking about his mother and father and sister we gots to get outa here gracchus said even if that fucker wasnt on the wirelessan he was bound to be damn himthey gonna come see how come their airplane done crashed ambush em cassius asked gracchus blinked he thought at last reluctantly he shook his head dont reckon we could pull free an disappear fast enough afterwards he said they be on our trail like bloodhounds had he ever read uncle toms cabin cassius had though the novel remained banned in the csa sixty years after the slaves wereallegedlymanumitted but he didnt think gracchus could read at all he couldnt very well argue with the guerrilla leader about the risks since he couldnt he made himself nod instead whatever you say to a commander that was always the right answer because it was gracchus condescended to explain this aint the army i lose my men i cant pick up no telephone an git mo i gots to find em same way i found you sometimes i gots to learn em to fight way i learned you dont want to lose em happens but i dont want it to want the ofays an the mexicans to lose their bastards instead hed learned war in a sternly practical school cassius knew he himself remained a beginner even if he was a beginner whod just luckily aced an important test he nodded and gave back the magic words once more whatever you say i say we gets outa here gracchus declared and they did if cassius wished for what might have beenthis wasnt the first time nor the most urgent he hurried away with the rest every time jonathan moss read in captured papers about us advances deeper into tennessee he wanted to head north when he and nick cantarella escaped from andersonville he never imagined men in greengray could penetrate the confederacy the way the usas soldiers were jake featherstons butternutclad troops were pushing into western pennsylvania then and it hadnt been clear whether anything or anybody could stop them no matter what moss wanted to do now his desires ran up against reality in the shape of spartacus tennessee line still a hell of a long ways from here the guerrilla leader said got to git around atlanta some kinda way if we heads up there that aint country i know could you pass us on to an outfit that operates north of you moss asked you know like the underground railroad in the old days spartacus only shook his grizzled head yankee sojers come down here fine till then i needs you an nick too much to turn loose of you and that was that the two white men might slip away on their own but what could they do next they would be all alone in a country that hated them all alone in a country where their accents gave them away whenever they opened their mouths could they get up to chattanooga on their own it seemed unlikely the only hope for help they had came from other bands of black guerrillas and would some other bands chieftain be any more willing to let them go than spartacus was one more unlikelihood and if moss and cantarella got caught trying to slip away they would forfeit spartacus trust that wouldnt be good that would be about as bad as it could get in fact so they didnt go north they went east with the guerrillas instead they moved mostly by night more and more often confederate authoritiesor maybe it was just the locals on their ownput up a barnstormers review of antique airplanes during the day to keep an eye out for guerrilla bands moss watched the twodeckers from the cover of pine woods with a fierce and terrible longing you could fly one of those fuckers couldnt you nick cantarella asked one day first making sure no blacks were in earshot in my sleep moss answered at once i flew worse junk than that in the great warnot a lot worse some of the time but worse cantarella looked around again and dropped his voice even lower you think we could steal one youre reading my mindyou know that moss spoke hardly above a whisper i only see one hitch yeah walking up to the damn thing hopping in and flying off moss paused well two hitches he said sheepishly whats the other one from here we need a full tank of gas to get up to the us line we run low we cant stop at the local esso station and tank up not hardly the younger man laughed then he sobered again so how do we know how much gas is in the son of a bitch we take i fire up the engine and look at what the fuel gauge says moss answered no matter what it says though ive got to take off after that this isnt one of those deals where you can try again if you dont like what you see suits me cantarella said suits me fine far as i can tell weve done our duty by these people and then some time to do our duty for the us of a too and you know what else tell me moss urged we got one great big thing going for us when we waltz up to that airplane cantarella waited till moss made a questioning noise then he said were white they wont be looking for ofayshe grinned when he used the wordto up and steal a flying machine not in a month of sundays they wont moss didnt need to think about that very long before he nodded well youre right too bad we wont be able to see the looks on their faces after we take off it sounded so good so easy so inevitable that they overlooked something they werent anywhere near an airstrip they didnt come anywhere near one for quite a while either their sole relationship with airplanes was hiding from them after a few days moss told cantarella you ought to suggest to spartacus that we go hit an airport so they cant spy on us so well i ought to the army officer pointed at him what about you no moss shook his head if it comes from you its strategy hes used to that if it comes from me its the pilot wants to get his hands on an airplane and hed be right cause i do better the other way whiskers rasped under cantarellas fingers as he scratched his chin yeah that makes sense ill do it he said at last dont know whether hell listen to me but its a pretty good shot a lot depends on how well they guard their airstrips moss said if theyre locked up tight spartacus wont want anything to do with them and how do you blame him but if he knows one where the locals are asleep at the switch if there was an airstrip like that spartacus would know about it the grapevine worked not all negroes had disappeared from confederate societyjust most of them there were still cooks and maids and janitors they heard things they knew things and what they heard what they knew they managed to pass to guerrilla leaders like spartacus nick cantarella planted the seed he and moss waited to see if it would bear fruit while they waited they tramped along they couldnt stay anywhere for more than a couple of days if they did they started eating the countryside bare it seemed bare enough to moss as things were got a question spartacus said as they marched through a weary night you git your hands on an airplane with machine guns in it could you shoot at the confederates with it as long as i have fuel as long as i have ammo as long as the motor keeps working the way its supposed to moss said you do it in the nighttime or you have to wait fo daylight daylight would be better moss answered a lot better i wouldnt want to try to land in the dark without good airport lights and without somebody on the wireless talking me down night flyings a whole different ballgame all right spartacus nodded reckon that means we gots to hit at daybreak so you kin git the airplane up an shoot up the town before you lands it somewhere an we gits you out what town moss asked name o the place is pineview spartacus said wes about ten miles from there now they got an airstrip outsidereckon we could swoop down on it do you want to do that the guerrilla chieftain nodded any way i kin hurt the ofays i wants to do it strips wont be guarded much is sure of dat ofays dont know we got us a pilot they reckon we aint nothin but a bunch o dumb fuckin niggers we show em we fuck em goodyoud best believe it later that day nick cantarella tipped moss a wink if moss hadnt been looking for it he never would have noticed he gave back a discreet thumbsup spartacus didnt charge ahead without checking he sent scouts out under cover of darkness to give the airstrip a onceover they reported a few strands of barbed wire and some sleepy guards ambling around the perimeter we kin take em out then spartacus said oh hell yes boss one of the scouts said the other black man nodded spartacus smacked his right fist into his cupped left palm lets go do it then he declared we gonna make the ofays shit all the colored guerrillas who heard that grinned and clapped and whooped so did jonathan moss and nick cantarella if they had reasons of their own that the negroes knew nothing aboutthen they did that was all since the attack on the airstrip outside of pineview wouldnt go in till morning twilight brightened the sky the guerrillas had plenty of time to grab some sleep early in the evening and deploy as soon as the moon went down moss had trouble getting any rest he was always nervous before missions cantarella snored like a buzz saw biting into a knot if he worried ahead of time he didnt show it that way flopped down in the dirt mud smeared on his face so it wouldnt show moss peered hungrily at the airstrip there wasnt much to see a couple of runways flattened with steamrollers a couple of oldfashioned airplanes at the end of one of them a sentry with a limp who patrolled this stretch of barbed wire moss knew what wire was supposed to be like this barely counted for a token effort lets go spartacus said three men with wire cutters slid forward the strands of barbed wire parted with soft twangs the men waved the rest of the guerrillas loped toward the gaps someone shone a flashlight toward the rear the prize pickup with the machine gun in the bed would be coming too halt who goes there a white man spoke in peremptory tones when he didnt get the answer he liked his rifle barked moss saw the muzzle flash half a dozen answering shots rang out the sentry screamed and toppled come on spartacus shouted aint got much time now he was wrong they had no time at all electric lights blazed on illuminating the advancing raiders much too well get down nick cantarella yelled its a before he could say trap or ambush or whatever he was going to say three machine guns opened up and said it for him spartacus men were caught out in the open on flat ground at short range the pickup went up in flames before it even got to the barbedwire perimeter maybe some of the negroes whod fed spartacus information did the same thing for their white bosses maybe the whites told them what to feed him however that worked the result was a massacre moss hugged the dirt bullets cracked past hardly more than a foot over his head the gunners were shooting low trying to pick off anything that moved he couldnt stay where he was not if he wanted to stay alive he crawled toward the pine woods from which the guerrillas had come was somebody with binoculars watching them all the time while they advanced moss wouldnt have been surprised theyd trusted too much and theyd walked right into the meat grinder somebody behind him screamed would anyone get away spartacus still alive nick cantarella asked beats me moss answered im amazed im alive myself tell me about it cantarella said they fucked us good the bastards talk about a sucker punch i know moss said mournfully i was just thinking that are we far enough away so we can get up and run go ahead if you want to me im staying flat a while longer moss stayed flat too cantarella knew more about this business than he did of course hed thought spartacus knew more about it than he did too and hed been right but spartacus didnt know enough to keep from making a disastrous mistake even if the leader survived his band was a shambles by the time moss reached the woods his knees and elbows were bloody but he didnt get shot so he was one of the lucky ones spartacus made it back too do jesus he said over and over again his voice and his face stunned do jesus what do we do now keep on fighting or try and disappear cantarella said those are your only two choices how can i fight after this spartacus said how do jesus neither white man had any answer for him the first thing flora blackford did when she got up in the morning was turn on the wireless to find out how the war had gone while she slept the wireless didnt always tell the truth she knew that in the black days of and news reports of confederate advances often ran days behind what really happened losses to enemy bombs were minimized as were us casualties the uprisings in utah and canada had got short shriftthe one in canada still did but if you knew how to listen you could get a pretty good notion of what was going on today for instance the broadcaster declared confederate air raids over bermuda are of nuisance value only the enemy has suffered severe losses in terms of bombers and trained crewmen that was true but like a lot of true things didnt tell the whole story or even most of it the joint committee on the conduct of the war had had some pungent things to say to the generals and admirals in charge of the reconquest of bermuda it was back in us hands but the whole business had proved much more expensive than anyone expected why hadnt the generals and admirals figured confederate bombers would keep paying nighttime visits it wasnt stupidity not exactly as far as flora could see it was more like the blind certainty everything would go fine and an unwillingness to examine ways in which things might not go fine to the men on the lowlying ground who had to put up with bombs coming down on their heads it probably looked a lot like stupidity even if it wasnt flora made coffee and scrambled a couple of eggs they were the only ones she would eat this week she made a point of sticking to the limits rationing imposed on everybody else not all representatives and senators did but she didnt see how government could force such things on the country without observing them itself tomorrow it would be corn flakes or toast and jam she was low on butter too but she couldnt get more till after the first of the month in europe the newscaster went on german wireless reports that the kaisers armored units have driven british forces over the dutch border for the first time since the outbreak of war germany is free of invaders british prime minister churchill denies the german claim and insists that strong british counterattacks are imminent how can he do both at once flora wondered but churchill was formidable no doubt about it hed overshadowed mosley in the british government and britain was overshadowing france in the antigerman alliance though action francaise had held power longer russia claims the german assault column aimed at petrograd has been turned back with heavy losses the broadcaster continued more weight would attach to this claim if the tsars government hadnt made it repeatedly over the past few weeks each time without its being true the situation in the ukraine however remains as confused and chaotic as it has been since the beginning of the war serbian terrorists have taken credit for the people bomb that exploded in budapest day before yesterday and killed several prominent hungarian military officials the austrohungarian empire has vowed reprisals flora sighed as she put salt on her eggs the cycle of revenge and reprisal was lurching forward another couple of cogs she saw no end to it serbs croats bosnians albanians macedonians bulgariansaustriahungary had security worries that made the usas seem simple by comparison in sports flora got up and poured herself another cup of mostly ersatz coffee she didnt care about the football scores joshua would have and no doubt still did but he was off doing his basic training the apartment seemed empty without him somewhere out in washington state scientists were trying to build a bomb that might make soldiers obsolete with joshua in uniform flora had one more reason to hope they succeeded soon and somewhere down in the csa other scientists were trying just as hard to build the same damn thing flora didnt think the confederates could win the war as a slugging match not any more but if they got that bomb ahead of the usaroosevelt thought the enemy was running behind was he right the joint committee on the conduct of the war couldnt hold hearings to find out as far as flora knew she was the only committee member whod ever heard of uranium bombs or understood the difference between u and u there though she didnt know how far she knew robert taft might share the secret so might any other member the only way to find out was to ask and asking meant breaching security she kept quiet so did any other members who knew maybe it would all come out after the war she went downstairs and flagged a cab they were easy to get on this block where so many congressmen and senators lived where to maam the driver asked in most of philadelphia flora would have been lady the same as in new york city this fellow remembered where he was and took no chances congressional hall flora said yes maam he probably thought she was a secretary but politeness could still be good for his tip he had to detour from the shortest route a couple of times sawhorses and ropes blocked the street signs said bomb damage do you know whats going on flora asked i didnt hear any bombers overhead last night neither did i maam the cabby agreed but i heard one of em was an auto bomb and the other one was a people bomb oy flora said has anyone claimed responsibility confederates mormons who dont want to give up canadians god only knows he said you can walk along minding your owndarn business and out of the bluekaboom out of the blue makes it worse flora said and the driver nodded when someone said hed planted an auto bomb when a group proclaimed that one of its members hated you enough to blow himself to red mist to hurt you at least you knew why youd been injured when the question hung in the airwhen the question hung in the air what could you do but stay afraid all the time flora didnt think the cabby had several hundred pounds of tnt in the trunk of his beatup packard or under the floorboards but she couldnt prove he didnt and he couldnt know she hadnt strapped an explosive belt around her waist scary times all the way around as if to prove as much concrete barricades kept motorcars from getting too close to congressional hall flora paid the driver the packard wheezed away she approached the building despite her status despite her congressional id security guards went through her handbag and attache case a hardfaced policewoman patted her down shed got complaints that some of the women who frisked other women enjoyed themselves as much as men would have she didnt know what anyone could do about that this one seemed all business you can go on she said when she finished thank you so much flora said the sarcasm rolled off the policewoman like rain off a tin roof her secretary was in the office before flora got there good morning congresswoman she said coffees just about ready thanks bertha it smells good flora said isnt it terrible about the bombs this morning i should say so bertha answered i hear the people bomb was one of those horrible mormons was it how do they know flora asked i dont know but id believe anything about those people her secretary said they caused us so much trouble so much miserywhy wouldnt they go on doing it even now that wasnt evidence it wasnt anything even close to evidence flora knew as much even if bertha didnt the ceasefire in utah was holdingmostly but there were mormons who werent ready to give up the fight against the government that had spent a lifetime abusing them some didnt care if they lived or died the united states were painfully learning that men or women who didnt value their own lives were the hardest kind of foes to stop what are my appointments this morning flora already knew most of them but bertha couldnt go on ranting about mormons if she had to check senator taft called a few minutes ago and said hed like to come by she answered i told him it was all right i hope that wasnt wrong she didnt like making mistakes which made her a good secretary flora had known some who just didnt give a damn one way or the other she nodded now im always glad to see senator taft she said they disagreed politically more often than notthey disagreed on almost everything in fact except that jake featherston needed suppressing but they had an odd acrid friendship each knowing the other was sincere and honest flora went on did he say what it was about not to me he didnt bertha sniffed like a secretary should know what was going on noooo she stretched the word out into a long sound of complaint all right ill find out when he gets here flora carefully didnt smile robert taft came in about twenty minutes later good morning flora he said he was only half the man his father had beenliterally he was lean and spare where william howard taft had been wide as a football field william howard taft had been deceptively clever a good mind darting out from that vast bulk there was nothing deceptive about robert tafts cool dry piercing intelligence good morning flora brought him a cup of coffeehe would have done the same for her in his office what can i do for you today she was sure he wanted her to do something he didnt waste time on social calls his father whod lived up to the cliches about fat men had been far more outgoing sure enough robert taft went straight to business i want your support for the measure readmitting kentucky and tennessee to the united states do you really think the time is ripe flora asked we dont hold all of either onewe dont hold most of tennessee i know some white people in kentucky really are prousa but in tennessee wed only have negroes to work with and how many has jake featherston left alive some tennessee whites will work with us you can always find front men taft said which was probably true but the real reason for readmitting them is to show that we aim to end this war by ending the confederate states and that featherston cant stop us that was the rationale for reviving houston too and the more states we take back the more states that fall out of the confederacy the more political pressure we put on richmond how long will the confederate people and the confederate army go on backing a loser these us states would be shamsand theyd elect democrats not socialists flora said isnt that part of what you have in mind we can work out an arrangement like the one we used in utah if thats whats troubling you taft said as long as they stay under martial law they dont vote in national elections you wont see the house and senate swamped with undesirables he smiled a wintry smile flora considered a deal like that only put off the evil day but it was liable to put off the day for a long time because no confederate state would be reconciled to returning to the usa any time soon anyone who remembered the interwar histories of kentucky and houston knew that she found herself nodding i think we have a deal she said here you are mr president lulu set the latest pile of wireless intercepts and press clippings from the usa on jake featherstons desk thank you kindly he said and put on his reading glasses to go through them he never let himself be photographed wearing the damned things but without them print was just a blur these days he waited till lulu left his underground office before he started swearing she didnt like it he could cuss out his generals but he wouldnt swear in front of his secretary that was crazy but it was how things worked of course he couldnt stand most of his generals and he liked lulu keeping her happy mattered to him but he had plenty to cuss about the damnyankees now that theyd grabbed the ball showed no signs of wanting to let go of it jake shook his head in furious wonder that wasnt how things were supposed to work the confederate states were supposed to jump on the united states with both feet and never let them up again jake had intended to make the csa the dominant country in north america what hed intended and what was going ondidnt turn out to be the same thing dammit the damnyankees were methodically building up in tennessee the same way theyd built up north of the ohio before slamming down into the confederacy the counterattack through the mountain gaps into their flank hadnt fazed them featherston muttered in profane discontent as he shook his head the counterattack hadnt fazed them much without it they might already be in chattanooga even so they were gloating about how far they had come they were gloating about how well things were going in what they called houston too part of that was thumbing their noses because theyd revived the state that everyone who lived in it hated part of it was a threat a us officer out there said before too long we hope to shut down the confederates murder factory near snyder fuck you asshole featherston growled that hit him where he lived getting rid of the csas negroes was at least as important as putting the united states in their place as far as he was concerned if the yankees thought they could stop him they would have to think again he made a note to himself to talk to ferdinand koenig about that before he could do anything about the note lulu stuck her head in again and said major general patton is here to see you sir send him in jake said lulu nodded and withdrew patton came in wearing what was practically dress uniform with medals hanging on his chest in two rows that wasnt the way to make jake featherston love him not that jake had anything against courage but he had everything in the world against showoff officers pattons salute could have come straight out of vmi too the holsters on his belt were empty though the presidents guards had his pistols mr president he said in his gravelly voice sit down general featherston waved patton to a chair when patton had taken his seat jake fixed him with his stoniest glare you didnt give me what i needed general you didnt give the country what it needed what have you got to say for yourself eh two things sir patton replied first is if youre not satisfied with me put in someone you like better and stick me in a penal battalion ill fight for the confederate states any way you please second thing is whoever you put in my place will have as much trouble succeeding as i did unless we can get some air cover my men were naked under the sky and they paid a dreadful price for it featherston stared at patton again this time sourly the high and mighty general had just taken much of the wind out of his sails anyone who volunteered for a penal battalionthose outfits were made up of officers and men whod disgraced themselves one way or another commanders threw them in wherever the fighting was hottest soldiers who redeemed themselves could earn their old rank back most of the poor damned bastards ended up as casualties instead they were there to end up as casualties and with luck to help the cause a little before they did i goddamn well ought to throw you in a penal battalion jake growled but even he could hear his heart wasnt fully in it do whatever you need to do mr president ill go patton was nearly as stubborn as jake was himself ill get more mileage out of you if i keep you in command featherston didnt like that conclusion but hed had to deal with a lot of things he didnt like lately can you hold chattanooga i can try patton answered if they mass enough force to outweigh us six to one or something like that though i dont know how ill manage it im a better than decent general sir but i dont work miracles will you fight house by house and block by block make those damnyankee sons of bitches pay the way we paid in pittsburgh yes sir patton didnt hesitate in that too he was like the president of the csa all right then go do it featherston said it wasnt all right or anywhere close to all right but jake came from the school that didnt believe in showing where it hurt anything that gave anyone a grip on you was to be avoided patton rose and saluted again you wont be sorry sir or if you are ill be too dead to know about it without waiting for a reply he did a smart aboutturn and marched out of the office a procession of one im already sorry jake muttered he was sorry he had to use an attacking general to defend he was sorry he had to defend so deep inside the confederacy hed planned to fight this war almost entirely on us soil well what was life but the difference between what you planned and what you got he walked to the door and asked lulu whos next general potter mr president she sniffed she didnt like clarence pottermostly because jake featherston didnt like him jake hid a smile that was about as funny as anything he had going on these days but like potter or not the president knew he was useful send him in yes sir lulu sighed although jake felt like sighing too he didnt not around potter he didnt trust the intelligence officer enough to show that he didnt enjoy his company all he said after the usual formalities was being in the line isnt as easy as it looks is it no sir its like juggling knives when someones shooting at your feet potter answered maybe experience helps i hope to god it does anyway ive got a little nowthe hard way they were grabbing for anybody they could find with wreaths on his collar and they tapped me i gave it my best shot what else could i do go out there and kick those yankees asses featherston suggested not at all sardonically sir i would have loved to potter said but we hardly even got to the front let alone fought there us air power chewed us to pieces coming through the gapsslowed us down gave us casualties tore the crap out of our trucks and armor we wouldnt have been in good shape even if we had done more fighting we need more airplanes and more pilots we need more of everything goddammit jake said yes sir we do with four words potter skewered every freedom party policyevery policy of jake featherstonsat least as far back as the presidents first inauguration and featherston couldnt do one damn thing about it because all the crossgrained intelligence officer had done was agree with him in lieu of snarling at him for agreeing jake asked were you able to keep putting professor fitzbelmonts feet to the fire while you were in the field by messenger yes sir potter answered it meant letting one more man in on the secret but chuck doesnt blab and i figured that was better than doing it by telephone or wire or letter with a messenger in the know i could really speak my mind fair enough jake said fitzbelmonts got to know how bad we need that bomb and how important it is for us to get it before the united states do if the confederate states got uranium bombs ahead of the usa and kept on getting more of them shortages of everything elseeven airplanes even manpowerwould stop mattering if the csa had uranium bombs and the usa didnt the confederacy would damn well win if he doesnt know its not because he hasnt been told potter said i believe hes doing everything he knows how to do i believe hes the best man weve got for the slot too whatever else he is hes bright what about the men the damnyankees have featherston asked have you worked out some kind of way to hit em up in washington again if we can land a mortar team by submersible it might be able to get close enough to shell their operation potter said im not sure how far out their ground perimeter extends i dont think we can hit them from the air again theyre alert for that now a lot of things you can do once chances are you cant do em twice the ground operation would be a suicide run too chances are yeah chances are jake agreed either you get dedicated people who dont care or you dont tell em beforehand how dangerous the mission is both ways work if i can ill use people who know what theyre doing and are willing to do it anyhow potter said i dont like sending people off to die when they dont know thats in the cards if you can fine but if you cant do it the other way dont get thinskinned on me potter jake said this country is in trouble if blasting the crap out of the us uranium factory helps get us out of trouble we do it period we do it you got that oh yes mr president ive got it youre always very plain about what you want clarence potter spoke respectfully he spoke obediently how then did he make jake feel as if hed just got slapped in the face he had all kinds of unpleasant talents jake held up a hand one other thing i need to find out any sign the yankees know where our uranium works is at sir the first sign of that youd get would be every us bomber ever built coming straight at washington university with the heaviest load of bombs it could carry potter answered he was bound to be right and he was serious too when he talked about the confederate uraniumbomb project the subtle mockery disappeared from his voice he was a confederate patriot jake featherston used that button to keep him loyal to the freedom partyand loyal to the president of the csa too if potter ever separated jake featherstons cause from the confederacysif that ever happens ive got to get rid of him because then he turns as dangerous as a rattler in my bed jake thought id better keep a closer eye on him none of his thoughts showed on his face all he said was youre doing a good job of keeping the secret then thanks thats one more thing the country needs yes sir again potter sounded brisk and assured but he couldnt resist one more gibe wed be further along now if fitzbelmont got funding sooner oh give me a break jake exclaimedthat rubbed him the wrong way he came to me with this bluesky story an idiot dog wouldnt believe so maybe itll turn out to be true i hear a dozen bluesky stories every day and damn near all of em are nothing but shit would you have believed this one way back then potter pursed his lips well no he admittedhe was almost compulsively honest but somebody made the united states believe it i wonder how that happened the united states follow the germans wherever they gomaybe thats got something to do with it jake said i wonder how far along england and france are got any ideas no mr president they arent talking to me to me neither jake snarled they reckon im a poor relation well when we get this here bomb ill show em whos a poor relation to who by god see if i dont the whole damn worldll see if i dont jefferson pinkard heard the distant boom of artillery off to the northwest hed heard it before but only as a rumble on the edge of audibility now it was louder and more distinct than hed ever known it that meant only one thing the damnyankees were closer to camp determination than theyd ever got before when pinkard called the local commander to complain brigadier general whitlow ling said if you want to put your guards under my command and send em off to the front here ill listen to you otherwise butt out of my business i cant do that jeff said then butt out of my business the army man said firmly but camp determination is important to the whole country jeff said and im doing every damn thing i know how to do to keep the us eleventh army away from it ling said if you think youre helping when you joggle my elbow youd better think twice cause it aint so we set up this camp way the hell out here so the yankees couldnt get at it pinkard said weve got important business to take care of here i dont know anything about that ling said all i know is general dowling has more men than i do he has a better logistics train than i do he has a fuck of a lot more airplanes than i do you want miracles go talk to moses so dont fight him straight up jeff said go around him and how am i supposed to do that when richmond wont give me the barrels i need brigadier general ling seemed sure the camp commandant wouldnt have an answer for him but thanks to the newspapers and magazine jeff did load machine guns and cannons onto a bunch of trucks and go raiding he said the canucks are doing it to the usa hell the damn niggers in georgia and mississippi are doing it to us can we fight as smart as a bunch of coons hope to god we can had he laid that on too thick would ling hang up on him instead of listening if ling thought he could get away with that he had another think coming because jeff would get on the horn to ferdinand koenig if the attorney general couldnt make a mere soldier say uncle jeff was backing the wrong horse ling didnt hang up he said you want us to turn guerrilla then i dont care what you call it general pinkard answered i want you to make the damnyankees stop i want you to make em go backwards i dont give a rats ass how you do it heres something you havent tried thats all its worked good some other places what have you got to lose he waited it wouldnt be that expensive ling said in musing tones wouldnt cost that many men wouldnt cost that much materiel might be worth a shot anythings worth a shot right now wouldnt you say jeff answered ling only grunted that was probably as it should be a soldier wouldnt admit his side was in trouble even if it wasmaybe especially if it was if he hurt the troops morale what would that do cause his side more trouble still well see what happens ling said at last and he did hang up hooked him by god jeff said happily as he set down his own telephone i do believe i hooked him he hadnt been sure he could he looked out through his window at the mens half of camp determination a long queue of negroes waited to go into the bathhouse and delousing station they would go in all right but they wouldnt come out againnot breathing anyhow guards with submachine guns flanked them to either side to make sure nobody did anything stupid or desperate right this minute everything seemed calm the camp was busier than it had been for a while too us bombers had eased up on the railroad line leading into camp determination they still hit it every so often but repairs stayed ahead of damage now and theyd eased up on snyder too pinkard thanked god for that he had his family to worry about and it mattered more to him than anything else in the world as much as he hated to do it hed just about decided to send edith and her boys back to louisiana maybe he would have looked at things differently if she werent expecting but alexandria was safe in a way snyder wasnt even though it also had a camp nearby the united states were in no position to bomb it if they brought bombers south they wouldnt bother with a halfassed target like alexandria theyd go and unload on new orleans which really mattered jeff watched the queue snake forward everything went smoothly hed set it up so everything would but seeing that it did still made him feel good it wasnt a guarantee these days a year ago all the negroes who went through the camp believed the guards when they said the bathhouses and the trucks were just procedures to be put up with as they got transferred somewhere else not now the blacks brought out of colored districts and the captured red guerrillas had a pretty good idea of what went on here jeff blamed damnyankees propaganda for that it made camp determination harder to run because the inmates understood they had nothing to lose he breathed a silent sigh of relief when the last negro moved through the barbedwire gate and into the bathhouse that meant he could go back to his paperwork with a clear conscience it never went away and it was the part of the job he hated most he hadnt signed up to be a bureaucrat hed signed up to do things by god but you couldnt just do things not in the csa you couldnt you had to keep records to show youd done them too and you had to keep records about things that went wrong hed just sent away two more guards from the womens side for having lesbian affairs with the prisoners and one male guard whod got caught cornholing colored boys those involuntary separations required a mountain of forms you couldnt just fire somebody for something like that you almost had to catch people in the act because those accusations could ruin somebodys life one of the women was raising a stink she denied everything on a stack of bibles jeff didnt care he had witnesses to prove shed been carpetmunching that was dirty enough when a man did it to a woman though pinkard sure didnt complain when edith went down on himoh no when another woman did it it was about as disgusting as cornholing this gal had to go and she would shell probably end up a girls gym teacher someplace where word of this hasnt spread jeff thought under the freedom party records were a lot more thorough and complete than they had been back in the old days but they werent perfect not by a long shot hed just signed the last of the papers that would get rid of the dyke when airraid sirens started wailing and airplane engines droned overhead a minute or so later the antiaircraft guns around camp determination thundered into action in the camp compound he watched guards hastily don helmets falling shrapnel could cave in a mans skull the colored prisoners of course had no helmets jeff only shrugged that wasnt his worry if one of the smokes got clobbered well so what it only meant he was buying his plot a little sooner than he would have otherwise a thunderous explosion rattled the window in his office it was safety glass reinforced with chicken wire but it almost blew out anyhow that wasnt a bomb going off that was a bomber crashing and its whole load blowing up at once the gunners didnt nail very many but every once in a while they came through prisoners in the yard were pointing up in the sky at the bomber stream they were cheering and dancing and urging the damnyankees on rage ripped through pinkard how dared they root for the other side they deserved everything they were catching all right whether they would have cheered for the united states if they werent catching hell from the confederate states never once crossed his mind not surprising not when he had other more important things to worry about the bombers started unloading on snyder again more antiaircraft guns protected the towns but flak alone couldnt keep bombers away if the confederacy had some fighters of its own in the air but the confederacy damn well didnt basically snyder had to sit there and take it i will get edith and the boys back to alexandria so help me god i will jeff thought if the damnyankees were going to bomb innocent civiliansagain he didnt dwell on what the confederates had done to innocent civilians on the other side of the border let alone on what the men he commanded were doing to civilians right here in this camp he hated those strings of boom boom boom one right after another sure edith and willie and frank would be down in the storm cellar sure it would take a direct hit to harm them the odds against that were long but it could happen as he knew too well and he couldnt do one damn thing about it he hated that even more here inside camp determination he was safe as houses the yankees had never bombed the camp they cared more about the worthless niggers inside it than they cared about the honest white people they were trying to murder another bomber exploded this one sounded as if it blew up in midair the united states were paying for things today anyhow sometimes the bombers got off scotfree that was just plain embarrassing at least the gunners werent standing around with their thumbs up their asses jeff knew losing a few bombers wouldnt keep the usa from coming back he also knew how helpless he was to do anything about it what choice did he have but wait here till the raid ended and then go back to snyder and see if he still had any family left none none at all bombers stayed above snyder for most of an hour as soon as the bombs stopped falling jeff jumped into the birmingham that was his to use he didnt wait for a driver but gunned the engine to life and roared off to find out if his family was all right he had to go off the road and onto the shoulder a couple of times to avoid craters he was glad it hadnt rained any time lately or his auto might have bogged down but the fires rising from snyder made him mutter and curse and pray all in a confused jumble he knew what he meant but he doubted anybody else even god would have once he got into snyder he had to make more detours both because of holes in the streets and because of burning buildings the bombs hadnt smashed the towns one fire engine its bell clanged like the shrieks of a lost soul as it raced from one disaster to the next how much good could it do at each stop some maybe jeffs heart was in his throat when he turned onto his street a house half a block in front of his had taken a direct hit part of a body lay on the front lawn pinkard gulped and looked away but there were edith and frank and willie his wife was bandaging a neighbor lady who looked to have been cut by flying glass his stepsons watched with more interest than horror theyd seen things like this before kids got used to war and other disasters faster than grownups did for them it soon became routine for jeffthank god youre all right he called as he sprang from the motorcar and ran over to edith this was a bad one but we made it into the cellar quick as we could the windows are already cardboard and plywood so we didnt lose any glass i dont smell gas the powers out but itll come back as edith talked she went on bandaging the neighbor ladys head there you go vera its not too deep and i dont think the scar will be bad thank you edith with middleclass politeness vera nodded to jeff hello mr pinkard sorry we have to run into each other like this its a miserable war isnt it it sure is maam jeff coughed on the smoke in the air he shook his fist toward the west its a miserable war but by god well win it cabo san lucas wasnt quite the ass end of nowhere but you could see it from there george enos knew damn well he wasnt any place he wanted to be as usual nobody in the navy bothered asking his opinion the marines had taken the place away from the empire of mexico us army troops were pushing down from san diego to occupy the rest of baja california the godawful terrain and the heat and the lack of water were giving them more trouble than francisco joses soldiers were also annoying or worse than annoying to the men in greengray and forest green were air raids across the gulf of california from confederate sonora cs bombers struck by night when they were harder for us fighters to find and shoot down the confederacy didnt keep a lot of airplanes in sonora but the ones they had did what any small force was supposed to do they made the other side hate their guts and they were the reason the townsend lingered by cabo san lucas more and more escort carriers came down the coast of baja california sooner or later theyd try to force their way into the gulf of california and put cs air power in sonora out of business when they did they would need escorts to deal with confederate and mexican surface raiders and submersibles that was what destroyers were for this would go quicker if we got a couple of fleet carriers instead of all these chickenshit little baby flattops george grumbled an escort carrier isnt big enough to hold many airplanes and the damn things cant make twenty knots if you throw em off a cliff fremont dalby gave him the horselaugh now tell me another one he said like theyre gonna waste fleet carriers down here fast as we build more of em they go into the atlantic its just like last time we cut off englands lifeline to argentina and brazil we screw her to the wall yeah george said that was what the father he barely remembered was doing in and how the senior george enos died after the csa threw in the sponge dalby didnt notice george was feeling subdued maybemaybethe sandwich islands get one he said depends on how serious we are about going after the japs makes sense i guess george said if its up to me though we wait till were done with the really important stuff and then we kick their scrawny yellow asses thats how id do it too dalby agreed course that doesnt mean its how the admirals will want to handle it expecting the brass to do shit that makes sense is like expecting a broad to understand if you screw around on her you can expect it yeah but that dont mean its gonna happen like for instance you know what i heard im all ears george said youd look even funnier than you do now if you were and thats saying something dalby told him altogether without malice george flipped the gun chief the bird since dalby was ribbing him personally he could get away with that had the conversation had anything to do with duty or the ship he would have had to take whatever abuse the older man dished out dalby went on anyway scuttlebutt is theyre keeping a flotilla biggern this one off the northwest coast near where the columbia lets out into the pacific carriers escorts subs the whole nine yards thats pretty crazy george said why would they put so many ships up where they dont do any good fremont dalby shrugged and lit a cigarette he held out the pack to george who took one too after a couple of puffs dalby said its almost like theyre guarding that whole stretch of coast like theres something up there they dont want the japs to hit no matter what what could there be george asked they think the japsll bomb the salmoncanning plants or what beats me dalby said like i told you this is all scuttlebutt maybe its just a cloud of stack gas but the guys i heard it from say its the straight skinny somethings going on that we dont know about george said dalby gave him exaggerated silent applause no kidding sherlock he said george laughed maybe it would all make sense after the war was over maybe it would never make sense some of the dumb stunts the brass pulled were like that too the townsend was one of the lead escorts when a flotilla centered on three escort carriers steamed into the gulf of california the flotilla had minesweepers along too in case the confederates and mexicans had surprises waiting for any newcomers george would have if he were waiting for trouble from the usa tell me about it dalby said when he worried out loud mines are simple mines are cheap minesll blow your sorry ass skyhigh if you hit one what more could anybody want from the fuckers they didnt hit any mines the first day inside the gulf on the second morning klaxons hooted the men to general quarters now hear this now hear this aircraft approaching from the northeast aircraft approaching from the northeast fighters zoomed off the baby flattops decks from what george had heard confederate asskicker dive bombers were great when they operated unopposed but they were sitting ducks for fighters he didnt know if what hed heard was the gospel but had the feeling hed find out pretty damn quick confederate fighters escorted the dive bombers up till recently landbased aircraft were always hotter than their carrier counterparts which needed heavier airframes to stand up to the stresses of catapultaided takeoffs and landings cut short by tailhooks and arrester wires but the latest us carrierbased fighters were supposed to be as tough and fast as anything in the air an airplane tumbled down toward the sea fremont dalby had a pair of binoculars thats an asskicker he said got the fixed landing gear and flies with its wings going up on either side like a goddamn turkey buzzard another airplane plummeted whos that fritz gustafson asked dunno dalby answered i think it was one of ours though theyve got blunter noses than cs hound dogs do two more machines fell out of the sky both burning keeping track of who was doing what to whom got harder and harder the rolling roiling fight drew ever closer to the flotilla here we go at fremont dalbys orders the gun layers swung the twin mm mount toward the closest confederate airplane george enos passed fritz gustafson two shells and got ready to give him more dalby put the guns exactly where he wanted them and opened fire casings leaped from the breeches george fed shells as fast as he could thanks to gustafsons steady hands the twin mms devoured them just as fast black puffs of smoke appeared all around the oncoming cs bombers and fighters all the other guns on the townsend were blasting away too not just the mm mounts but the dualpurpose fiveinch main armament and thecaliber machine guns that were stationed wherever the deck offered a few feet of space the noise was terrific impossible overwhelming got one everybody at georges mount yelled the same thing at the same time george couldnt be sure a shell from one of his guns hit the hound dog but he thought so the fighter pilot tried to crash his airplane into the destroyer but fell shorthe went into the drink about a quarter of a mile off the port bow george never saw the asskicker that hit the townsend till too late one second he was passing shells as fast as he could the next altogether without knowing what had happened he was flying through the air with the greatest of ease like the daring young man on the flying trapeze unlike the daring young man he didnt have a trapeze he didnt have a net either the gulf of california reached up and smacked him in the face and in the gut if his wasnt the worst bellyflop of all time he surely got no lower than the bronze medal at least the water was warm he didnt swallow too much of it his life vest kept him from sinking he looked up just in time to watch a cs mule zoom off not far above the waves dalby was rightwith those uptilted wings the damn thing was as ugly as a turkey vulture it made a much better killing machine though he didnt realize what had happened to the townsend till he looked back at his ship before that he thought whatever happened to him was some sort of private accidentthough how a private accident could have hurled him close to a hundred yards was anything but obvious he slowly decided he wasnt thinking very well at all but he didnt need to be a genius to see the destroyer was history her back was broken smoke billowed from her the gulf of california all around her was full of sailors some with their heads out of the water and paddling others facedown and still and dead holy jesus george blurted we got nailed that was if anything an understatement even as he watched the townsend settled lower in the water she wouldnt stay afloat much longer but george only thought he was afraid till he saw gray dorsal fins knifing through the water hed watched sharks from the destroyers deck that was fine watching them from the sea with a freelunch course spread out all aroundgeorge crossed himself the ave maria he blurted out might not help but it sure couldnt hurt he looked around not just for sharks but also for his buddies he didnt see fremont dalby anywhere a big blond body floated not far away was that fritz george didnt paddle over to see he didnt want to know that bad fuel oil spread from the stricken destroyer george swam away from it that stuff would kill you if you swallowed it hed seen as much in the sandwich islands his voice rose with others calling for nearby ships to pick them up the minesweeper that had led the flotilla swung back toward the townsend whose deck was almost awash now when the destroyer went down her undertow dragged luckless sailors too close by under with her george had got too far away for that to happen to him but someone not nearly far enough from him screamed dorsal fins converged as red spread through the deep blue george rattled off more hail marys and an our father for good measure a life ring attached to a line splashed into the sea maybe fifty yards off he swam over and put it on sailors aboard the minesweeper hauled him in like a big tuna the ship had nets down they helped him scramble up the side well welllook what the cat drug in fremont dalby said he was soaked of course but he already had a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth drop dalby in horseshit and hed come out with a pony but his sardonic grin slipped as he asked spot any of the other guys maybe gustafson george pointed his thumb down at the deck fuck the gun chief looked at the oil slick and the bobbing men and debris that were the sole remains of the townsend that asskicker sure kicked our ass didnt he hit us right where it did him the most good the son of a bitch airplanes were still mixing it up overhead george enos hardly noticed he was luxuriatingrejoicingin being alive we just got ourselves some leave he said and you know what i wish to god we didnt dalby nodded xv jorge rodriguez and gabriel medwick made unlikely friends jorge was skinny and swarthy and spoke with a spanish accent medwick was big and blond and handsome in a jutjawed way if not for the war they never would have met but theyd shared in the grinding confederate retreat through tennessee now just outside of chattanooga the powers that be were saying cs troops wouldnt fall back another yard jorge didnt know if they were right but they were saying it a lot of men whod come over from virginia with jorge and gabriel were dead or wounded now jorge didnt think much of their replacements oldtimers in the company doubtless hadnt thought much of him when he first joined it either two company commanders had gone down since captain hirsch they were both supposed to recover but that didnt help much now a first lieutenant named jubal frisch had the company at the moment and didnt seem to know what to do with it sergeant hugo blackledge hadnt got a scratch he was another reason jorge and gabriel were friendsthey both hated him he had a platoon now not just a squad that let him spread his bad temper around more but did nothing to make it good why dont they bring in a lieutenant to take over for him medwick mourned even if they did hed still be running the platoon jorge said thats what sergeants do the officer would just behow do you saythe guy in front the front man medwick said thats it thanks the front man yeah jorge said blackledge he can handle a platoonno doubt about that oh i know i know gabriel medwick looked around carefully and lowered his voice to a nearwhisper he can run it sure that aint the problem the problem is hes a fuckin asshole you got that right jorge whispered they both nodded satisfied theyd figured out at least one small part of how the universe worked blackledge couldnt have heard them he would have come down on them harder than a sixinch shell somehow or other though they both ended up on sentrygo that night the front wasnt quiet snipers and raiding parties slipped back and forth that was the small change of war and nobody worried much about it one way or the other except the people who got wounded or killed but sentries were a trip wire too if a big push came they were supposed to get word back to the main force jorge peered out into the darkness all eyeballs and nerves and apprehension every time an owl hooted he thought it was a damnyankee signal every time a firefly blinked he feared it was a muzzle flash he clutched his automatic rifle and hoped nothing would happen till his relief took over out of the darkness came a lowvoiced call hey you there yeah you confederate jorge crouched in good cover even if a machine gun opened up he was safe enough so he cautiously called back yeah what you want got some smokes the other man had a funny accenta yankee accent wanna swap em for rations i can use coffee too if you got it i got cigarettes jorge answered not much coffee you got deviled ham buddy i got a dozen cans the us soldier said proudly i came preparedbet your butt i did i got threefour packs i can trade you jorge said you see a stump by a rock up in front of you a pause presumably while the wouldbe merchant scanned the area yeah i see it bueno jorge said put four cans on it then go away i put four packs on it then i go away you come back and get em and you shoot my sorry ass off the us soldier said ill put two you put two then we do it again got to be some kind of way to keep both of us interested in the deal all the way through all right jorge said though he didnt much care whether it went through or not the only thing that kept him going was the reasonable certainty that killing him would cause more trouble than it was worth go ahead i dont shoot fuckin better not the us soldier said which was true enough under the circumstances he moved quietly when he came jorge didnt know he was there till he got to within a few feet of the stump and boulder he set down the cans waved in jorges general direction and disappeared again but he had style he made more noise retreating than he had advancing so jorge could be sure he really was leaving even so jorges heart pounded as he went up to the stump if more yankees waited nearby they could jump out and capture him hed picked this spot himself but he grabbed the cans and almost forgot to set down the cigarettes after he did he headed back to his foxhole up came the us soldier yeah you play fair he said as he snatched up the packs heres the rest he set down two more cans and withdrew again after jorge took them and left the last two packs of dukes he was tempted to shoot the us soldier when he came forward but what was the point it wouldnt win the war it wouldnt move the war toward being won by even a hairs breadth it would only start a firefight in which he was liable to get hurt himself he would fight when he had to when he didnt have to he didnt want to like a ghost the us soldier materialized thanks buddy he said collecting the last two packs of dukes stay safe i wont plug you unless ive got to try and do the same for me he vanished into the darkness again the deviled ham would be good jorge could always get more smokes he wondered how long that would last though the united states had overrun a lot of tobacco country how long could the confederacy go on turning out cigarettes there was a scary thought when his relief came up he almost shot the other confederate soldier it wasnt even that his countryman messed up the password he was just jumpy he went back to the companys forward position rolled himself in his blanket and slept till sunup he got coffee and fried eggs from the company cook when he spooned deviled ham into his mess kit to go with the eggs his buddies gave him jealous looks whered you get that gabe medwick asked found it on a tree stump jorge answered which was technically true but not what anybody would call responsive medwick rolled his eyes sergeant blackledge was blunter you trading with the enemy uh yes sergeant jorge didnt have the nerve to lie didnt pay more than one pack of smokes for a can did you blackledge demanded uh no sergeant goddamn well better not you jack up the price for everybody else if you do the sergeant tramped off jorge let out a sigh of relief louder and more heartfelt than the one that had escaped him after he finished the deal with the damnyankee he was just finishing his coffee when somebody yelled mail call he hurried over to see if there was anything from his brothers pows were allowed occasional letters so pedro sometimes wrote or from his family back in sonora the fieldpost corporal had a devil of a time pronouncing his last name but a lot of ordinary confederates did so he took that in stride whos it from gabe medwick asked he had a large family in alabama and got letters all the time my mother jorge answered got to remember how to read spanish he said that only for effect he wouldnt have any trouble and he knew it when he opened the letter what he got wasnt what he expected they say your father killed himself his mother wrote i dont believe them i will never believe them not just because killing yourself is a mortal sin but because your father would not do it he would only do such a thing if he found out he had committed some great wrong and he had no other way to make up for it and that is not so he was doing something great something wonderful something important he always said so when he wrote me and so it must be a lie maybe they tell me these things because he died fighting and he promised me he would not go into any danger when he left to put on the uniform again i cannot think of anything else that would make them say such things and they are paying me a pension for him would they do that if he really killed himself i dont believe it jorge stared at the scrawled words he read them two or three times and they made no more sense than they had at the beginning he couldnt believe his father would kill himself either some great wrong his mother said what could his father have done that was wrong it wasnt in his father to do such a thingwas it he didnt see how you all right buddy gabriel medwick asked by the look on his face jorge got the idea hed asked the same question before maybe more than once and hadnt got an answer for it gabe went on you look like somebody just reduced your population man you got bad news from home a white confederate from alabama could no more read spanish than he could fly jorge reminded himself he didnt want to lie but he didnt want to tell the truth either its not as good as it could be anyhow he said not more trouble on top of your dad i hope medwick knew hipolito rodriguez was dead he didnt know howup till this moment jorge hadnt known how himself i still dont dammit he thought fiercely no not on top of my father gracias a dios jorge said which was even true justtrouble winding up his affairs i guess you would say thats no good gabe said seriously stuff like that can get a whole family riled up with lawyers or maybe guns depending some neighbors of ours started feuding over a will and now everybody hates everybody else you dont want something like that to happen no no jorge said again i dont think it will but everything is moremore complicated than anyone thought it would be not easy when somebody dies im sorry medwick said no not easy jorge agreed before he could say anything more his head went up like a hounds when it took a scent he didnt smell anything but he heard trouble in the air gabe medwick shouted it louder than he did incoming they both dove for the closest hole in the ground it wasnt really big enough for both of them but they made do and when the us shells started bursting around them they both tried to make themselves as small as they could which made the hole seem bigger that had to be crazy but jorge thought it was true the damnyankees had shelled confederate positions in front of chattanooga before but this was different that had just been harassing fire this time they meant it they wanted to blow a big hole in the confederate line right here smash on through it and head straight for the city the soldiers in butternut had defended so long and so hard they were liable to get what they wanted too jorge had never been in a bombardment like this not here and not back in virginia either beside him gabe medwick was screaming for his mother he wasnt hurthe was just scared to death jorge couldnt blame him not when he was scared to death too as suddenly as it had begun the barrage stopped up jorge said weve got to get out and fight or theyll murder all of us he looked aroundand found he might have been in the mountains of the moon after a pounding like that could the confederates fight back if you wanted something and the fellow who had it didnt feel like handing it over one way to get it was to put a big rock in your fist and then slug him the usa wanted chattanooga the confederates didnt feel like giving it up lieutenant michael pound knew a certain amount of pride at being on the pointy end of the rock as soon as the us bombardment let up he got on the wireless circuit to the other barrels in his platoon lets go get em they think they can stop us i say theyre wrong and i say well prove it in war proving the other guy was wrong often meant proving he had no business breathing pound was ready to use that kind of logic against jake featherstons men why not featherston had tried using it against the united states as his barrel rumbled forward pound wondered if he would spot general morrell this was morrells operation and pound knew how morrell thought how he fought better than anyone else except possibly george patton one thing morrell did was lead from the front hed be here somewhere old home week pound muttered what was that sir sergeant scullard asked nothing woolgathering pound said embarrassed the gunner had overheard him he still wasnt used to getting called sir either the bow machine gun chattered knocking over a couple of soldiers in butternut unlucky enough to get caught away from cover another confederate dropped his submachine gun and raised his hands over his head what do i do sir the question came back to pound over the intercom let him live pound answered weve got infantry along to scoop up prisoners and he doesnt look like hell do any more fighting well play fair when we can and when they couldntand there would be times like thathe would do whatever needed doing and he wouldnt lose any sleep over it he stood up in the turret riding with head and shoulders out so he could see more only a little smallarms fire was coming back at the barrels the barrage had left the confederates more discombobulated than usual maybe they were finally starting to crack he could hope so anyhow more soldiers in butternut threw away their weapons and surrenderedor tried to anyway a machine gun behind them opened up and cut down several of them even the enemys machine guns packed more firepower than their us equivalents cs machine guns fired too fast to let you hear individual rounds going off the noise sounded like the devil tearing a sail in half it was enough to make pound duck down into the turret and slam the cupola lid shut behind him he didnt mind taking chances but he didnt like taking dumb ones and you couldnt get much dumber than to offer that gun a clean shot at you can you spot the son of a bitch he asked scullard havent yet sir the gunner answered shall i give him a round or two of he if i do damn straight pound said theyre starting to shoot their own people now they might as well be russians or japs they rolled past wherever the machine gun was concealed without spotting it pound wasnt too worried about that another barrel or the infantry would take care of it he just hoped it wouldnt cause many casualties before that happened any which way the machine gunners were in more trouble than they knew what to do with somehow or other soldiers who served machine gunsespecially soldiers who served them right up to the last minutehad a lot of trouble surrendering pound peered through the periscopes set into the cupola it wasnt as good as riding with his head out but it would have to do he wondered where the confederate barrels were they couldnt stay very far behind the line not unless they didnt intend to fight this side of the chattanooga city limits sowhere front the gunner spotted the first enemy machine before pound did it squatted hulldown behind the rubble of what had been a roadside diner and its crew had seen this barrel before anyone spotted it even as the gunner yelled for an armorpiercing round the enemy cannon swung toward the barrel and spat fire clang less than a second later the enemy ap round hit the turret it was like having your head stuck in gods cymbals when he clashed them together but the thick wellsloped armor kept the round from penetrating thank you jesus scullard said amen michael pound laughed from sheer relief at being alive by the shape of its turret the enemy barrel was an old model one that carried only a twoinch gun that cannon was better than good enough when the war started but not any more give him some of his own medicine if you please yes sir the gunners enthusiasm surely also sprang from relief he fiddled with the gunlaying controlsbut not for long because theyd be reloading with frantic haste in that other barrel and they might get lucky the second time around the us barrels gun spoke before the enemy got off his second shot it wasnt an easy target not with only the confederate machines turret showing pound wished he were making it himself not that scullard wasnt a damn good gunnerhe was but pound knew he was better than a damn good gunner himself he commanded the barrel though he couldnt hop into the seat on the other side of the turret sometimes you had to trust the men under you no matter how hard that was times like this he wished he had his stripes back being an officer was no fun at all and then suddenly it was the inch ap round punched through that oldfashioned turret as if its steel armor were so much cardboard it knocked the turret half off the ring knocked the enemy gun all askew then the ammunition stored inside the turret started cooking off better not to think about what happened to the confederate barrelmen when a tungstenpointed projectile started ricocheting around inside that crowded space much better not to think about it because it had almost happened here instead good shot scullard pound said hell of a shot you could talk about the shot as if it were part of a game you could talk about the enemy barrel as if it fought by itself as if it had no crew inside that way you didnt have to think about what happened to the men in there what youd just done to them thank you sir the gunner laid an affectionate hand on the cannons breech if our turtle didnt have a thick shell those fuckers wouldve done unto us before we could do unto them first shot is better but we madeyou madethe second one count pound gave credit where it was due scullard sent him a sly grin bet you wished you were doing the shooting yourself he knew pound had been shifting in his seat well maybe a little the barrel commander admittedhe couldnt very well deny it but he went on probably just as well i wasnt you know the controls for this weapon better than i do that was not only polite but true hed fired a few rounds to familiarize himself with the cannon in case something happened to the gunner but it was scullards baby pound always thought he could do anything maybe getting reminded every once in a while that that might not be true was good for him youre a gent sir scullard said pound laughed only shows you dont know me as well as you think you do sergeant he called the driver on the intercom lets get moving again we keep sitting around we give those bastards too good a shot at us yes sir the driver said the barrel lurched forward a couple of minutes later machinegun fire started clattering off the machines armored side and the turret it sounded like hail on a corrugatediron roof pound traversed the turret to the left there was the machine gun sure as hell muzzle flash winking like a lightning bug it had a damn fool running ithe couldnt hurt a barrel with all the ammo in the world front pound sang out identified sir scullard replied he spoke to the loader he you got it the highexplosive shell went into the breech fire pound yelled and the gunner did the shell casing leaped from the gun and clattered off the turret floor dirt and smoke fountained up a few yards in front of the machinegun nest short pound said give em another round or two well shut the bugger down by god yes sir scullard said and then he again his sensitive fingers raised the cannon a hair he fired the gun this time the sandbags that warded the confederate machine gun went flying one of the men from the crew started to run scullard cut him down with a burst from the coaxial machine gun that takes care of that pound didnt answer he was turning his head this way and that trying to look through all the periscopes set into the cupola somewhere not far away a us barrel was burning it wasnt one from his platoon but that didnt matter he watched a rocket with a tail of fire brew up another us barrel that made him angry goddammit where is our infantry he said theyre supposed to keep those bastards with the stovepipes too far off for them to shoot up our barrels that way then he forgot about enemy soldiers with rocket launchers the confederates werent saving all their armor inside chattanoogano indeed butternut barrels rumbled forward so did barrelbusters selfpropelled artillery pieces without turrets so they had only a limited traverse but with largercaliber cannon than barrels carried the united states were starting to use them too they could be dangerous both because of the punch they packed and because their low silhouette made them easy to hide and hard to spot they were well armored too but not well enoughas pound rapidly provedto hold out a inch ap round the armored melee was as wild as anything pound had ever seentill us fighterbombers appeared overhead and tore into the confederate machines with rockets of their own the enemy had no answer to those flaming lances slicing down from the sky several barrels and barrelbusters went up in flames others pulled back toward better cover forward pound called to his platoon one of the barrels couldnt go forward it had a track shot off and needed repairs the other four including his pressed on they cant stop us he exulted maybe the confederates couldnt but nightfall did he wouldnt have minded storming forward after dark but he got explicit orders to hold in place he tried to tell himself it might be just as well if greengray infantry did come forward in the night the enemy wouldnt be able to use their rocket launchers against us armor come morning and if the infantry didnt come up pound wanted to know why not he didnt mind the chance to get out of the barrel and stretch his legsand to empty the bottle into which he and the rest of the turret crew had been pissing all day long he whistled softly when he got a good look at the groove the enemy ap round scored in the hard steel of the turret before bouncing off that was closer than i really like to think about he said to scullard bet your assuh yes sir the gunner answered he greedily sucked in cigarette smoke lighting up inside the turret wasnt a good idea us artillery came down on the confederates not far ahead pound approved of that things seemed to be goingwell enough anyhow jorge rodriguez wasnt just glad to be alive after everything hed been through the past few days he was amazed the damnyankees were throwing everything they had into their drive on chattanooga his own side was throwing in everything it had to stop them if anyone came out of the collision point still breathing it meant one side or the other was falling down on the job if he saw the us soldier whod traded him ration cans for cigarettes he knew he would shoot the son of a bitch in a minuteunless the yankee shot him first this wasnt trading time not any more hed hoped the coming of night would slow the us armored advance it did but us artillery lashed the confederates in their trenches and holes nobody talked about artillery much but it was a worse killer than gunfire it reached farther back from the line and it could kill you even if you stayed in your hole staying down kept you out of the way of bullets if a shell came down where you wereif that happened then you werent not any more during a lull a little before midnight gabe medwick called hey jorge you still alive i think so that was about the most jorge could say how about you last time i looked his friends laugh was shaky way that last barrage came in i wouldnt bet on anything you guys want to shut the fuck up yes sergeant blackledge was still breathing too he would be jorge thought darkly blackledge went on you goddamn well better believe theres damnyankees close enough to hear you runnin your mouths sniper with a scope on his rifle spots you moving around in your hole youre a deeply regrets wire waiting to happen he wasnt wrong somehow that made listening to him more annoying not less voice sly gabe medwick said what about you sarge you just now talked moren both of us put together yeah but i aint dumb enough to let those shitheads draw a bead on me and you dingleberries are blackledge said jorge didnt know what a dingleberry was but he didnt think it was anything good he wouldnt have sassed the sergeant hed been brought up to respect authority not to harass it his fathers hard hand made sure of that his fatherhe still didnt know what to make of his mothers letter why would his father kill himself hed jumped at the chance to put on the uniform of the confederate veterans brigades from his letters hed been proud to guard the camp in texas what could have made him change his mind nothing but mallates in the camp not from what his father had said it wasnt as if they were real people or anything so why would his old man have flabbled about them the artillery barrage picked up again crouching in his hole with clods of earth thudding down on him from near misses wondering if the next one in wouldnt be a near miss jorge felt more comfortable than he did wondering what was going through his fathers mind in the last few seconds of his life hed learned to master simple terror incomprehension was a different story in spite of the shelling he snatched ten minutes of sleep here twenty there so that when the sun came up over missionary ridge he felt weary but not quite ready to keel over if the yankees felt weary they didnt show it their barrels growled forward even before sunrise jorge looked in vain for confederate armor to throw them back an antibarrel gun set one enemy machine afire a mine blew a track off another the stovepipe rockets some soldiers were getting stopped a couple of more but most of the greengray barrels kept coming with foot soldiers loping along between them if you didnt have a stovepipe what could you do you could fall back or you could die jorge fell back he fired at enemy infantrymen he had no idea if he hit anybody but he made the damnyankees hit the dirt even slowing them down felt like a victory once sprawled behind what was left of a stone fence he saw sergeant blackledge on his belly not far away blackledge nodded to him they were both still fighting even if they were retreating jorge looked around for gabe and didnt see him he hoped his buddy hadnt stopped something for his country on that battlefield an upright man was a prodigy an upright man in dress uniform seemed like a hallucination but the officer who came forward wore a chromed parade helmet with a generals three stars in a wreath on the front in gold plateor for all jorge knew in solid gold this spotless apparition also had a pearlhandled revolver in a holster on his left hip and another one in his right hand however magnificent he looked he sounded like hugo blackledge come on you stinking cowardly scuts he roared drive these yankee bastards back theyre not getting into chattanooga and thats flat its ours and were damned well going to keep it come on do you want to live forever yes jorge thought oh yes but the general fired that revolver and ran forward get moving you sorry bastards sergeant blackledge yelled anything happens to general patton you fuckersll wish the yankees blew your asses off move god damn you general patton fighting at the front line general patton fighting like a private soldier like a crazybrave private soldier jorge supposed it was possible hed heard weird things about patton a general who actually liked fighting for its own sake was a rare breed patton filled the bill jorge did go forward to protect the crazy general he believed sergeant blackledge if anything happened to patton the unit that let it happen would catch hell with the damnyankees throwing hell around in carload lots that wouldnt be hard to arrange incoming gabriel medwick shoutedhe wasnt hurt after all then he added hit the dirt general jorge hit the dirt he knew what that rising hateful scream in the air was whether george patton did or not my namesake he realized patton would be one dead namesake if he didnt get down he didnt the shell burst not far away smoke and dirt fountained up splinters knifed out in all directions none of them touched patton certain madmen were supposed to be able to walk through the worst danger without getting scratched as far as jorge was concerned patton qualified you had to be loco to stay on your feet when you heard artillery coming in but if you did it and if by some accident you lived through it you could pull a lot of soldiers with you jorge and the men near him had started forward to try to keep general patton from getting himself killed when they saw he didnt they kept going forward to share his luckand they drove the startled us soldiers back before them the men in greengray hadnt dreamt that the battered pressured confederates owned this kind of resilience jorge couldnt blame them he hadnt dreamt any such thing himself and then the spell broke patton ran up to a soldier crouched behind a rock come on son he roared weve got yankees to kill up and at em the soldier didnt move jorge was close enough to see he was gray and shaking shellshock he thought not without sympathy sometimes too many horrible things could happen to a man all at once or a bunch of smaller things could accumulate over time then hed be worthless for a while or only good for light duty if you let him take it easy he usually snapped out of it after a while if you tried to make him perform while he was at low ebb chances were you wouldnt have much luck patton didnt his face darkened with anger get up and fight you shirking son of a bitch he bellowed im sorry sir the private said im doing the best i can but no buts patton growled ill boot your butt thats what and he did with a jackboot almost as shiny as his helmet now fight tears ran down the young soldiers cheeks his teeth chattered im sorry im not at my he got no further patton slapped him in the face forehand and then backhand when that still didnt get the kid moving the general raised his fancy sixshooter hold it right there general the shout came from sergeant blackledge but his wasnt the only automatic weapon pointed somewhere near pattons midriff sir you dont shoot a man with combat fatigue you do youll have yourself a little accident you wouldnt dare patton said sir you pull that trigger itd be a pleasure blackledge replied jorge listened in astonished admiration hed known blackledge wasnt afraid of the enemy knowing he wasnt afraid of his own brass eitherthat took a rarer brand of courage jorge waited for patton to demand the sergeants name he didnt know whether the general would want to know to arrest blackledge or to promote him on the spot but patton did neither all right then if you want to stick with a lousy stinking coward you can he ground out but youll see what it gets you as if there werent us soldiers no more than a hundred yards away he turned on his heel and stalked off his gait put jorge in mind of an affronted cat blackledge called freedom after the departing general pattons back stiffened he kept walking thththank you the guy with combat fatigue got out dont worry about it buddy sergeant blackledge said that fancypants asshole comes up here for half an hour so he reckons hes hot shit let him stay in the line for weeks at a stretch like us and see how he likes it being brave is one thing staying brave when all kinds of shit comes down on you day after day thats a fuck of a lot tougher iill try and go forward the shellshocked soldier said blackledge only laughed dont worry about it he repeated we aint doin any more advancing not for a while he raised his voice everybody dig in damnyankees are gonna hear were getting frisky in this sector so theyll hit us with everything but the kitchen sink you forget something sergeant jorge said yeah whats that the sergeant bristled at the idea he could have overlooked anything any second now our own side they gonna start shelling us too jorge answered sergeant blackledge stared at him then grudged a chuckle thatd be a good joke if only it was a joke you know what i mean fucking pattons probably ciphering out how to get us all killed right this minute shoulda scragged him when we had the chance gabe medwick said dirt flew from his entrenching tool as he scraped out a foxhole jorge was also doing his best to imitate a mole nah reluctantly blackledge shook his head somebody woulda blabbed and wed all be in deep shit then deeper shit if there is shit deepern this besides who says the next jerk with stars and a wreathd be any better oh chances are he wouldnt grandstand so much but hed still do his best to get us killed generals get their reputations for getting guys like us killed somere smart assholes and somere dumb assholes but theyre all assholes pretty much good thing the enemy hes got assholes for generals too jorge said before blackledge could answer us artillery started coming in the sergeant called that one right on the button jorge hoped the yankees didnt have barrels to follow up the bombardment if they did he knew damn well the outfit would have to retreat he didnt think they could hold the line theyd been in before patton brought them forward either if theyd had armor of their own maybe but one general in a chromed helmet didnt make up for what was missing barrels painted greengray did come clanking south jorge retreated machinegun bullets nipping at his heels his other choice was dying patton would have approved of that for him for himself he didnt like it for beans irving morrells barrel rattled forward the confederates had done everything they could to fortify the ground in front of chattanooga he was doing his best to show them that everything they could do wasnt nearly enough time to make some more of those poor sorry bastards die for their country frenchy he told the gunner sergeant bergeron nodded long as i dont have to die for mine sir that sounds real good to me youve got the right attitude morrell knew there were times when a soldier didnt have much choice about dying for his country sometimes you had to lay down your life to keep lots of your buddies from losing theirs frenchy bergeron knew that too morrell had seen him in enough action to be sure of it only a man who did know about it could joke about it but you could also get killed from stupidity or plain bad luck you not only could it was much too easy that was the kind of thing frenchy was talking about the confederates werent crumbling the way morrell had hoped they would they were fighting hard even as they fell back they knew where he was headed and they had a pretty good notion of how he would try to get there that made for slow expensive combat not what morrell wanted at all john abell warned me slicing them up might take two campaigning seasons morrell remembered he hadnt wanted to believe it he still didnt but there was a pretty fair chance the general staff officer knew what he was talking about sir an infantry counterattack just pushed us back a few hundred yards in sector blue someone said in his earphones blue roger that morrell said ill pass the word on to the people who can do something about it thanks to the fancy wireless gear that crowded the turret of his barrel he could the artillerymen at the other end of the connection promised him mm fire and brimstone would start dropping on that map sector in a couple of minutes the confederates wouldnt enjoy the little gains theyd made satisfied morrell went back to commanding his barrel it was plowing through what had been the last major land defenses in front of the tennessee river crossing the river and getting into chattanooga itself would be another adventure but just getting to it would give the war effort a kick in the pants from the north side of the river line the s now punishing sector blue would be able to knock chattanooga flat and leave it useless to the confederate states a lot of us generals would have been delighted to do that much morrell was a different kind of officer and always had been doing what most people expected and no more didnt interest him he didnt want to wound the confederates here he wanted to ruin them chattanooga wasnt a goal in itself not to him it was a gateway with it in his hands with communications over the tennessee secured he could plunge his armored sword into the confederacys heart unfortunately somebody on the confederate general staff or maybe jake featherston himself had seen that as plainly as morrell had the depth of these trench lines the barbed wire the minefieldsnow marked by signs painted with skull and crossbonesand the concrete pillboxes some of them sporting antibarrel cannon told the story very clearly so did the stench of death the fancy filters that were supposed to keep the barrels interior free of poison gas if it was buttoned up tight were powerless against the stink the barrel clattered past a dead pillbox scorch marks around the slit that let a machine gun traverse in there told what had happened morrell was a brave soldier an aggressive soldier not for all the money in the world would he have strapped the fuel and gas cartridges for a flamethrower on his back the men who did were either a little bit nutssometimes more than a little bitor didnt know the odds against them along with disposing of unexploded bombs lugging a flamethrower was one of the military specialties where the average soldier lasted a matter of weeks not months using men who didnt know as much seemed unfair that didnt stop the army maybe ignorance was blissfor a little while a us helmet sat on top of a rifle stock the rifles bayonet had been plunged into the ground above a hastily dug grave did the flamethrower man lie there morrell wouldnt have been surprised he saw two other pillboxes that covered the burnedout one of course the confederates would have interlocking fields of fire they werent amateurs an armorpiercing round had put paid to one of those pillboxes he couldnt make out what happened to the other one but a us soldier leaned against it eating from a ration can so it was under new management a salvo of rockets screamed in from the south the soldier dove into a hole morrell hoped that would keep him safe sometimes blast from the screaming meemies killed even if shrapnel didnt as the explosives in the rockets noses burst morrells barrel shook like a ship on a stormy sea he hoped he would stay safe himself those damn things could flip a fiftyton barrel like a kids toy fun frenchy bergeron said when the salvo ended morrell looked at him how many times did your mother drop you on your head when you were little the gunner grinned oh enough i expectsir i guess so morrell said with feeling and the gunner laughed out loud were morrell in pattons shoes he would have pulled back over the tennessee and made the us commander figure out how to get at him on the south bank patton seemed to want to fight it out as far forward as he could some of the things morrell was hearing from intelligence suggested patton had to worry about political pressure from richmond or in plain english jake featherston was screaming his head off fighting the enemy was hard enough fighting the enemy and your own leaders had to be ten times worse morrell had had his arguments and squabbles with the war department himself the suspicion with which he and john abell had watched each other ever since the middle of the last war proved thatas if it needed proving but when a president ran the war himself something was bound to get screwed up somewhere being sure of that made morrell keep his eyes open in a special way if patton goofed or even if he didnt but a us attack threw his men north of the river into disarray morrells troops might be able to get over the tennessee before the confederates knew theyd done it and if they could chattanooga would fall how angry would that make jake featherston angry enough to sack general patton morrell hoped so patton made no bones about having learned armored warfare from him morrell could have done without the compliment because the confederate officer made much too good a pupil the drive into ohio was a small masterpiece the one into pennsylvania almost worked too and the counterattack through the mountains in eastern kentucky and tennessee was well conceived patton just didnt have the men and materiel to bring it off through a cupola periscope morrell watched a us barrel commander leading a platoon of newmodel barrels toward the hottest fighting the sergeant or lieutenant or whatever he was stood head and shoulders out of his cupola morrell knew a stab of jealousy he wanted to fight the same way only a cold calculation of his own value to the advance kept him buttoned up in here that fellow out ahead of him had the freedom insignificance could bring son of a bitch morrell muttered whats cookin sir sergeant bergeron asked nothing morrell said it wasnt quite a lieit was nothing that would matter to frenchy but damned if the broad shoulders on that barrel commander didnt remind morrell of michael pound he knew theyd finally dragged his old gunner up into officer country kicking and screaming all the way pound was on this front too so why wouldnt he be in charge of a platoon of barrels no reason no reason at all that barrel stopped and fired something too far away for morrell to make it out very well burst into flames morrell slowly nodded he wouldnt want to be michael pounds gunner not for anything pound knew the business too well chances were he made an impossibly demanding commander but the gunner in that machine had scored a hit pound couldnt complain there steer left a little morrell called to his driver follow that platoon up ahead of us they look like theyre going places yes sir the driver said and he did sweat rivered off morrell he wished he were on the cool north german plain pushing the british back through holland you could stand staying buttoned up in a barrel in weather like that doing it in late summer in southern tennessee was a recipe for hell on earth or possibly a new england boiled dinner barrelmen poured down water by the gallon and gulped salt tablets like popcorn it helpedsome michael pounds barrelif that was pound in the cupolafired again something else blew up morrell mentally apologized to that gunner he was good enough to meet anybodys standards a shell clanged off another barrel in the platoon the round didnt penetrate the sparks that flashed as it ricocheted away made a pretty fair lightning bolt the barrel kept moving forward that hit would have wrecked one of the early models and probably would have killed a secondgeneration machine too but these babies didnt just dish it out they could take it too ill be goddamned morrell said one of the more reverent curses hed ever used theres the river the tennessee sir bergeron said damn straight maybe half a mile ahead morrell answered lets go grab the bank yes frenchys promotion was way overduehe had plenty of aggressive spirit and morrell nodded yeah lets then we see what happens next getting there wasnt easy an antibarrel round disabled one of the machines from the platoon ahead the barrel lost a track the crew safer than they would have been if they bailed out stayed inside and fired back machinegun rounds clattered off morrells barrel he had an advantage over junior officers he could call in air strikes and artillery and get what he wanted when he wanted it he could also summon reinforcements he did all those things and resistance faded careful sir frenchy bergeron said when he opened the hatch and stood up in the cupola he was being carefulor he thought he was anyhow the loop of the tennessee river protecting chattanooga was summernarrow but still too broad and swift to be easy to cross beyond lay the city smoke from the pounding it had taken partly veiled lookout mountain to the south morrell wasnt sorry to see that not in the least the confederates would have observation posts and gun emplacements up there if they had trouble seeing his men they would also have trouble hitting them he cupped his hands and shouted to the platoon commander whose barrel idled not far away that is you michael you did a good job getting here thanks sir i was hoping to see you again pound patted the top of his turret weve finally got what you could have given us twenty years ago they should have listened then ifs and buts morrell said with a shrug he wasnt done being angry but he was done thinking being angry made any difference pound pointed south toward chattanooga how do we get over the river even more than frenchy he had a grasp of the essential morrell shrugged again i dont know yet but i expect well think of something georgia jerry dover muttered im back in fucking georgia he wasnt very far inside of georgia but he was south of the tennessee line there was no place in southeastern tennessee yankee artillery couldnt reach bombers were bad enough but you couldnt keep a major supply depot in range of the enemys guns they would ruin you as dover had farther north he built another dump a dummy not far from the genuine article experience made him sneakier instead of leaving this one out in the open he camouflaged itnot too well instead of leaving it empty he stored things he could afford to lose there umbrellas condoms a good many cigarettes cornmeal he put more noncoms at the dummy depot too though he made sure they had the best bomb shelters they could the more realistic the dummy seemed the better its chance of fooling spies and reconnaissance aircraft it got bombed but not too heavily the real depot also got bombedagain not too heavily the damnyankees dropped explosives on anything that looked as if it might be dangerous even a little bit dover wished his own side could use bombsand bomberswith such reckless abandon one reason the depots didnt get hit harder was that the united states seemed to have decided the most dangerous things in northwestern georgia were the highway and railroads up from atlanta in their place jerry dover probably would have decided the same thing if reinforcements and ammunition and rations couldnt get close to chattanooga supply dumps didnt matter dover felt sorry for whoever was in charge of keeping the railroad line supplied with rails and crossties and switches and whatever the hell else a railroad line needed that included everything you needed to fix bridges and reopen tunnels too he laughed to himself imagining that harried officer requisitioning a new tunnel from somewhere waiting till he got it and then driving it through a mountain when he told the joke to pete the quartermaster sergeant laughed fit to bust a gut then he said you know sir nobody who aint in the business would reckon that was funny yeah that crossed my mind too dover answered but what the hell there are doctor jokes and lawyer jokes why not supply jokes beats me pete said just having anything to laugh about feels pretty goddamn good right now you know tell me about it dover said the more antibarrel cartridges and rockets he sent to the front the more trouble he figured confederate forces were in gunboats had almost stopped going up the tennessee to shell us positions fighterbombers descended on them like hawks on chickens when they tried the gunboats couldnt steam far enough south by daybreak to get out of danger several lay on the bottom of the river the day of the river warship had come and gone a fieldpost truck brought the mail to dovers depot that kicked most peoples morale higher than any jokes could men who heard from home glowed like lightbulbs the handful who didnt seemed all the gloomier by contrast jerry dover had two letters from his wife he also had one from savannah he put that one aside his family came first he read the letters from home in order of postmark everything back in augusta was fine his son and daughter were flourishing he wasnt sorry that jethro at thirteen was too young to worry about conscription no he wasnt one bit sorry not the way things were going but he read sallys letters with only half his attention his eye kept going back to the envelope from savannah at last having gone through the news from home three times he picked up the other envelope it looked no different from the ones from augusta not on the outside same cheap coarse paper on the envelope same fourcent stamp with a barrel and the word freedom printed across it no matter how it looked he picked it up as warily as an army engineer dug up a land mine yes it was from melanie hed known that as soon as he saw the handwriting let alone the postmark it wasnt so much that hed once had a lady friend his wife didnt known about if that were allif that were all he wouldnt have opened the envelope with so much trepidation it wasnt even that she wanted money every now and then she never asked for more than he could affordand she seemed to know just how much that was hed sent xerxes down to savannah with cash one time when he couldnt get away himself sometimes though melanie didnt want money when he was managing the huntsmans lodge shed sometimes been interested in knowing who came to eat there and what they had to say shed made it much too plain that she would talk to sally if he didnt tell her so he did why not if she was blackmailing other people besides him he wouldnt lose much sleep over it but what could she want now that he was back in uniform if it was only money hed pay off if it was anything besides moneyin that case he had a problem if she wasnt just a homegrown blackmailer if she was looking for things another governmentsay the usas yes say itsay it loudmight find interesting then having sally find out about her was the least of his worries she knew where to find him he hadnt told her he didnt know anyone who would have told her she knew though he didnt think that was a good omen the faintest whiff of perfume came from the stationery she used unlike the envelope the paper was of excellent quality it had to date back to before the war he unfolded the letter and apprehensively began to read her script was fine and feminine dearest jerry she wrote i hope this finds you well and safe i know you are doing all you can to keep our beloved country strong freedom he muttered under his breath did she mean that or was it window dressing to lull any censors he didnt think the envelope was opened before he saw it but he could have been wrong only one way to find out he kept reading things here havent changed much since the last time i wrote she went on prices have gone up some though and the stores dont have as much as i wish they did if you could send me a hundred dollars it would help a lot he breathed a sigh of relief he had a hundred dollars in his wallet hed had good luck and a good partner at the bridge table two nights before if that was all but it wasnt he might have known it wouldnt be hell he had known you ought to tell me about your friends she wrote i never hear about how things really are at the front where are you exactly dover snorted as if she didnt know what are you doing how are you going to lick the damnyankees jerry dover didnt snort this time he sighed he feared he knew what she was asking for hed wondered if she would he hadnt wanted to believe it but here it was and he was liable to end up in trouble on account of it hed end up in worse trouble if he told her the things she wanted to know though he sent a soldier after his secondincommand here a bright eager captain named rodney chesbro dont let them steal this place while im gone he said ive got to talk to the intelligence people find out how were going to kick the damnyankees in the slats chesbro askedyes he was eager if they tell you will you tell me too if they say i can dover answered which was less of a promise than it sounded like he drove a beatup birmingham north toward chattanooga the road was in bad shape he was glad no us fighterbombers showed up to strafe him or drop explosives on his head it was only a few miles to division hq but getting there took twice as long as hed thought it would as always the tent where the g men worked was inconspicuous intelligence didnt advertise what it was up to if you didnt need to talk to those people they didnt want you around dover wished he didnt but he did a few words to a scholarlylooking noncom got him sent over to a major claude nevers what can i do for you colonel nevers asked i have a problem major dover answered ive got a lady friend whos been quietly squeezing me for money for quite a while i wouldnt waste your time if that were all but now shes trying to get information out of me too he showed the intelligence officer the letter nevers read it and nodded i think youre right shes smooth but thats the way it looks to me he eyed dover you realize were going to have to look at you too yeah dover said without enthusiasm but youd look a lot harder and youd have some nastier tools if i kept mum and you found out about this anyway so do whatever you need to do and ill worry about that later all right colonel nevers didnt call him sir most of the time id remove you from active duty too but were strapped for men now and ive heard more than a few people who ought to know talk about what a good job youre doing so give me the particulars about this ah melanie melanie leigh dover spelled the last name brunette blue eyes maybe thirtyfive maybe forty about five feet four nice figure youve got the address there ive been sending her cash now and then for years so my wife wouldnt hear about her she cant live on what i give her though i have no idea if she has other guys on the string or how many i dont know how shed get word out eitherbut she likely has a way uhhuh nevers said send her this hundred she wants write her a chatty letter about the kind of stuff you do tell her funny stories nothing she can really use with luck well drop on her before she can write back saying that isnt what she wants tunnel requisitions dover murmured major nevers looked blank i understand what youre talking about major dover told him ill do it maybe im seeing shadows where nothings casting them but yes but nevers said go tend to it colonel well be in touch right dover said unhappily when he got back to the dump he had to explain to captain chesbro that he didnt know how the confederate states were going to drive the yankees back to the ohio by wednesday next writing a cheery chatty letter to a woman he feared was a spy wasnt easy but he managed he let major nevers vet it before he sent it out he didnt want the g man thinking he was warning melanie he left it and the money and an envelope with the major to mail then he tried to worry about logistics he got a call from the major that nightin the middle of the night in fact a noncom woke him to go to the telephone without preamble the intelligence officer said she flew the coop dammit dover said the first thing that came into his mind i didnt have anything to do with it i know that the intelligence officer answered weve had you under surveillance since you came to me earlier today we you and your pals you and your tapeworm you and god dover was silly with sleepiness how did she know to disappear then he asked good question major nevers said i hope we find outthats all ive got to tell you youve exposed a security leak thats for damn sure i suppose i ought to thank you he didnt sound grateful dover yawning didnt suppose he could blame him every time major general abner dowling saw a pickup truck these days he winced the confederates improvised gun platforms had caused him a hell of a lot of grief their flanking attacks had stalled his drive on camp determination and snyder they hadnt made him fall back on lubbock let alone driven him over the border into new mexico the way the enemy probably hoped but his men werent going forward any more either and so he grimaced when a pickup truck approached eleventh army headquarters out there in the middle of nowhere even though the truck was painted us greengray and he could see it had no machine gun mounted in the bed no matter what color it was painted guards made sure it wasnt carrying a bomb before they let it come up to the tent outside of which dowling stood he started to laugh when the truck door opened and a brisk woman not far from his own age got out whats so damn funny buster ophelia clemens demanded cigarette smoke streaming from her mouth as she spoke the guards were looking for explosives but they let you through anyhow dowling answered you cause more trouble than any auto bomb or people bomb ever made she batted her eyes at him which set him laughing all over again you say the sweetest things darling she told him do you still keep a pint hidden in your desk it was only a half pint he said and now ill have to put a lock on that drawer that made her laugh come on in he continued ill see what i can find its good to see you by god people i talk to arent supposed to tell me things like that the reporter said severely theyre supposed to say jesus christ heres that clemens bitch again she was kidding and then again she wasnt i never do things im supposed to would i be here if i did dowling held the tent flap wide wont you walk into my parlor said the fly to the spider thats more like it ophelia clemens ducked inside dowling followed her he did produce some whiskey and even a couple of glasses as hed seen her do before miss clemensshed never marriedknocked hers back like a man and thats more like it too she said thanks youre welcome dowling said i dont suppose you came way the hell out here just to drink my booze so suppose you tell me why you did i want to do a piece on camp determination she answered i want to show people in the usa what that murderous son of a bitch in richmond is doing to his negroes that would be good dowling said carefully but a lot of what we know is classified i dont know how much im authorized to show the press some of what we have shows how we got it which isnt so good this will have to pass the censors before it goes out she said as for authorization she fumbled in her purse which held only a little less than a privates pack here she thrust a folded piece of paper at him he unfolded it it was a letter from assistant secretary of war franklin d roosevelt allowing and indeed requiring him to tell miss clemens what he knew since this information when widely publicized will prove valuable to the war effort he set it down well youve persuaded me he said im putty in your hands promises promises ophelia clemens said they both grinned the game of seduction played for farce with neither of them intending to conquer was almost as fun in its own way as it would have been for real what have you got dowling produced aerial photos heres the camp the side north of the train tracksthats this wayholds women and children the other side which is older is for men uhhuh like him the reporter wore bifocals how big is this thing you see these little tiny rectangles here by the mens side dowling waited for her to nod then went on those are trucks theyre about the size of our deuceandahalfs ophelia clemens blinked the place is that big now dowling nodded she whistled its not a camp its a goddamn city no maam dowling said theres one big difference a city has a permanent population people go into camp determination they go through it but they dont come out againnot alive anyway and your evidence for that is he passed her more photos this iswasa stretch of texas prairie not far from the camp barbed wire keeps people out not that anybody who doesnt have to is likely to want to go out to the back of beyond the bulldozers give you some idea of scale here they also dig trenches you can see that most of those are covered over the couple that arentthose are bodies inside he gave her another picture a lowlevel run by a fighterbomber got us this one you can really make out the corpses here jesus she studied it how many bodies are in here have you got any idea only a rough one dowling answered hundreds of thousands of people thats for sure the experts who are supposed to be good at figuring this stuff out say its unlikely there are more than a millionso far anyway jesus ophelia clemens said again more violently than before give me that bottle again will you i need another drink hundreds of thousands maybe a millionwhat did they do to deserve it they were born colored dowling said to the freedom party thats a capital offense if thats a joke its not funny she said as he passed her the bottle her throat worked when she drank i wasnt kidding he told her the other thing you have to remember is this isnt the only camp the confederates have we think its the biggest but weve also been able to disrupt operations here better than anywhere else the ones farther east in louisiana and mississippi they go right on working all the time because we cant reach them ophelia clemens looked from one photograph to another with the kind of horrified fascination a bad traffic accident might cause but motorcars hadnt banged together herewhole races had and one was running over the other if they keep this up there wont be many negroes left in the csa by the time theyre done no maam thats not quite right dowling shook his head ophelia clemens made a wordless questioning noise he explained they dont aim to leave any colored people alive not one thats what theyre aiming for they dont even bother hiding it hell some of the freedom party guards weve captured brag about what theyre doing far as theyre concerned its gods work gods work she spat out the words as if they tasted bad if i believed in god general these photos would turn me into an atheist these photos would turn the pope into an atheist i doubt it dowling said the vatican kept quiet when the turks slaughtered armenians it hasnt said boo about the russian pogroms against the jews so why should pope pius give a damn about what happens to a bunch of coons who mostly arent catholic on the other side of the ocean who mostly arent catholic ophelia clemens repeated yes thats about the size of it im afraid hed bellow like a bull if they were but since he doesnt care what are you doing about it im trying to take camp determination thats what dowling answered its not easy but im trying why isnt it easy this ought to be one of the most important things were doing she said hundreds of thousands of bodiesattila the hun didnt kill that many people i bet there werent so many people to kill back then dowling said and why isnt it easy because this is a secondary front thats why im short of men im short of barrels and im short of artillery i used to be short of airplanes too but im not any more of course the confederates are even shorter on everything than i am thats why ive managed to come as far as i have its criminal that youre short ophelia clemens pencil raced across the notebook page that smells as bad as all those bodies put together and im going to let the world hear about it no dowling exclaimed she stared at him in surprise anger and something not far from hatred no he repeated dont raise a fuss about it please dont his earnestness must have got through to her her voice was hard and flat when she said youre going to have to explain that but she didnt sound as if she would poison a rattlesnake when she bit it glad she didnt dowling said i will i used to think different but its simple when you get down to it the best way to put camp determination out of business is to lick the csa thats what general morrell is doing over in tennessee and more power to him more power to him literally if i had two or three times the men and materiel i do id be taking them away from him and i dont want to do that i can annoy the confederates i can embarrass them he can win the war do you see the difference she didnt answer for a long time at last she said i never thought id want to punch a man in the nose for being right it happens dowling said look at george custer for instance a point she admitted i cant tell you how many times i wanted to punch him but he won the great war didnt he oh not all by himself but more than anybody else i think dowling answered he saw what barrels could do and he made sure they did it no matter what the war department said general morrell was in on that too remember though he wasnt a general then of course she pointed at him so were you maybe a little dowlings main role had been to lie through his teeth to the big wigs in philadelphia had custers brutal simplicity failedas it was known to dodowling would have lied away his own career along with his superiors but for once custer was right and success as usual excused everything else modest at your age ophelia clemens jeered how quaint how positively victorian you say the sweetest things dowling told her just dont say i want more men because honest to god i dont im keeping the confederates busy they cant send reinforcements east from this front theyve had to reinforce it in fact to keep me away from camp determination and every man they send out here to the far end of texas is a man they dont have in tennessee they also serve who only stand and wait she quoted is that shakespeare to dowling anything that sounded old had to be shakespeare but she shook her head milton i think if you say so its true here though except im not standing im staying busy with what ive got i think i can go another forty miles if you go thirty you can shell the camp she said we havent bombed it because we dont want to go into the negrokilling business ourselves dowling said same problem with shelling the people in the camp would be on our side if they got guns they are on our side they just cant do anything about it any way to change that ophelia clemens asked i dont see one dowling said regretfully i wish i did xvi artillery was coming down not far from the supply dump where soldiers unloaded cincinnatus drivers truck the army had put everything as close to the front as it could with us soldiers on the north bank of the tennessee river with the big brass trying to work out how to get across nobody wanted to run short of anything you need me to i take this shit right up to the fellas doin the fighting cincinnatus called to the quartermaster sergeant checking things off on a clipboard thats awright buddy the noncom said in a bigcity accent well move it forwardthat aint no skin off your nose what you gotta do is you gotta go back get some more shit and bring it down to us here ill do that then cincinnatus said this fellow didnt mock him he argued from efficiency which was reasonable enough as soon as the big trucks were empty the convoy did start north to fill up again armored cars and halftracks escorted it by now us forces had a pretty good grip on the roads leading down to chattanooga but pretty good wasnt perfect holdouts or civilians fired at the convoy they knocked out two windows and gave a truck a flat cincinnatus didnt think they hit anybody though which made the northbound journey a success when the convoy got to the supply dump soldiers in greengray surrounded it somethings up cincinnatus thought and wondered what a full colonel came forward to lead the trucks to tents that hadnt been pitched when they set out a few hours earlier the troops the colonel commanded spread out they set up cloth barriers to make sure no one outside the depot could watch what was going on inside what the hell hal williamson shouted from the cab of his deuceandahalf cincinnatus was glad to find he wasnt the only driver wondering if somebodyd slipped a cogor more than one this is a special transport mission the colonel shouted you are not to talk to anybody about what youre going to see do you understand that anyone who doesnt care to go along can withdraw now without prejudice nobody withdrew after that buildup cincinnatus was too curious to back out he and the other truckers hauled vital munitions all the time what could be more special than the stuff soldiers needed to blow featherstons fuckers to hell and gone all right the colonel said the other thing i need to warn you about is dont panic and dont reach for your weapons when you see whats going on these men are on our side the side of the united states of america if he hadnt said so cincinnatus wouldnt have believed it as things were cincinnatus had trouble believing it anyway the soldiers who came out of the tents wore confederate uniforms they had on confederate helmets they all carried submachine guns or automatic tredegars the fuck cincinnatus was far from the only driver to say that or something very much like it theyre on our side the colonel repeated this is the rd special reconnaissance company theyre all us citizens who grew up in the csa or lived there for years they look like confederates they act like confederates they talk like confederatesand theyre going to screw the confederate states to the wall the enemy did this to us in pennsylvania last year turnabout by god is fair play cincinnatus stared at the pseudoconfederates do jesus he said softly little by little a wide predatory grin spread across his face if these fellows sounded as good as they looked they could cause the confederates a world of grief were they going to cross the tennessee if anyone could do it on the sly this was the outfit if they got caught theyd get killedprobably an inch at a time you had to have balls to try something like this even so cincinnatus hackles rose when some of them got into the back of his truck those uniforms those weapons that accentthey all screamed murderers to him dont worry pal one of them said through the little window between the rear and the cab we dont bite honest he sounded like an alabaman which didnt help after the rd special reconnaissance company boarded the trucks the guards at the depot took down the screens no one from outside could hope to see into the deuceandahalfs but then everybody just sat there the trucks didnt roll south cincinnatus wanted to go he wanted to get these men out of his truck they looked so much like the enemy they gave him the cold horrors and he couldnt do anything about it he must have been wiggling on his seat because that counterfeit confederate spoke up again dont flabble man its better if we get there after dark if those fuckers dont see us coming we can surprise em better i guess cincinnatus said makes sense and it did no matter how sensible it was nothing could make him like it sundown seemed to take forever he knew it didnt but it sure seemed to at last as twilight deepened the lead truck rumbled to life cincinnatus thumbed the starter button with vast relief the engine caught at once he wouldnt have been heartbroken had it died the false confederates could have found another truck and he would have stayed here no such luck he turned on his headlights he might as well not have bothered the thin strip that masking tape didnt cover gave a little more light than a smoldering cigarette but not much the truck convoy wouldnt hurry down toward chattanooga not at night it wouldnt it did keep its escort that was good in case anything went wrong soldiers in real us uniforms in the halftracks might protect the impostors from men who didnt know who and what they were those soldiers might protect the drivers too if ordinary us troops spotted these fellows in butternut everybody anywhere near them would need a hell of a lot of protecting cincinnatus was sure of that he rattled along at about fifteen miles an hour every once in a while on a straight stretch of road he got up to twenty or so no shots came from the woods maybe all the bushwhackers went to bed early he could hope anyway he followed the narrow stripe of tail light the truck ahead of him showed and hoped that driver didnt get lost if he did all the trucks behind him would follow him straight into trouble after a while cincinnatus went past the depot hed visited earlier in the day he thought it was the same one anyhow the artillery duel seemed to have flagged with the coming of night a mosquito bit him on the arm he swore and slapped and didnt squash it next to the bite of a shell fragment though it seemed almost friendly those stripes of red got a little brighter the truck ahead was hitting the brakes cincinnatus did the same the driver in back of him was paying attention too because that truck didnt smack his rear bumper somebody by the side of the road gestured with a dimmed flashlight you guys with the special cargoover this way he called like the rest of the convoy cincinnatus went over that way the trucks were crawling along now that made them quieter but not what anybody would call quiet with luck though gunfire masked most of their noise this was about as close to the front as cincinnatus had ever come peering through the windshield he could see muzzle flashes across the river another soldier with a feeble flashlight said lights out cincinnatus hit the switch and went from dimness to darkness his eyes adapted fast though he soon spotted strips of white tape somebodyengineershad put down to guide the convoy to where it was supposed to go he nodded to himself theyd done things like that during the great war too here we are a loud authoritative voice that one if it didnt belong to a veteran noncom cincinnatus would have been amazed he hit the brakes lets go that voice came from the back of the truck the us soldiers in butternut piled out they gathered with their pals from other trucks good luck cincinnatus almost couldnt force the words out had the ordinary us soldiers here been briefed if they hadnt thered be hell to pay in nothing flat the thought had hardly crossed his mind before gunfire broke out some of the weapons were us others confederate shouts and screams filled the air do jesus cincinnatus burst out hed feared things might go wrong but he hadnt imagined they could go as wrong as this only shows what i know he thought bitterly the army could screw anything up and then little by little he realized the chaos and the gunfire werent screwups after all they were part of a plan the fake confederates got into rubber rafts and paddled across the tennessee toward the southern bank which real confederates held tracers came close to those rafts but cincinnatus didnt think they hit any of them he started to laugh if the shooting fooled him wouldnt it fool jake featherstons troops on the far bank wouldnt they think some of their buddies were getting away from the damnyankees and wouldnt the phonies be likely to have all the passwords and countersigns real confederates should have so what would happen to the genuine confederates who greeted the troops they thought were their countrymen they would get a brief painful and probably fatal surprise and what would happen then cincinnatus didnt know not in detail but he could make some pretty good guesses when he did he laughed some more the only thing he wished was that he were a white man in one of those rafts carrying a confederate automatic rifle he wanted to see the look on the face of the first real confederate he shot the counterfeits in butternut would be getting close he couldnt hear the shouts across the water not for real but he could imagine them in his minds ear he sat in the cab of his truck and swatted at more mosquitoes he wished for a smoke but didnt light up he waited and waited and sudden gunfire on the south bank of the tennessee as if that was a signaland no doubt it wasus artillery opened up cincinnatus could see where the shells came down by the flashes of bursting shells across the river it made a tight box around the place where featherstons phony fuckers had come ashore the artillerymen would have range tables and maps marked with squares so they could put their bombardment right where they needed it and more boats started across the river these werent paddlepowered rubber rafts cincinnatus could hear their motors growling they would land real us soldiers in real us uniforms and no doubt everything the troops needed to fight on the far side of the tennessee mortars and antibarrel guns and ammo and command cars and maybe even barrels the invaders would secure the bridgehead punch a hole in the enemy defenses and then try to break out and the whole enormous force on the north bank would slam in right behind them cincinnatus waved there in the deuceandahalf so long chattanooga he said next stop fuckin atlanta if things worked why wouldnt they though somebodyd planned this one to a faretheewell once the us forces punched through the lines the confederates had fortified what could stop them theyd be fighting in the open and the enemy would have to fall back or get rolled up smallarms fire on the other side of the river suddenly picked up cincinnatus whooped he knew what that meant knew what it had to mean us soldiers in greengray were across the tennessee go you bastards he yelled as if they were his favorite football team go jake featherston didnt order clarence potter courtmartialed and shot for his failure in the flanking attack on the damnyankees in tennessee there was plenty of failure to go around featherston extracted a nastier revenge on the intelligence officer he kept him in a combat slot potter protested sayingaccuratelythat he was more valuable back in richmond no one felt like listening to him the confederate states needed combat officers he wasnt the only retreadfar from it officers from the quartermaster corps even from the veterinary corps commanded regiments sometimes brigades when you ran short of what you needed you used what you had they were using potter he hoped they didnt use him up he wanted to do in chattanooga what the united states had done in pittsburgh he wanted to tie the enemy down make him fight house by house and bleed him white he thought jake featherston wanted the same thing he hoped that even if chattanooga fell the confederates could take so much out of the us forces attacking them that the yankees would be able to go no farther that would give the csa a chance to rebuild and regroup with cs forces holding lookout mountain to the south and missionary ridge to the east the defensive position should have been ideal but potter couldnt get anybody to listen to him george patton had gone up to talk to the president even so he kept fighting the campaign his own way hurling troops andworsearmor into fierce counterattacks trying to throw the men in greengray back over the tennessee potter hated to learn that us soldiers in butternut had confused confederate defenders long enough to help the main us push get over the river in the first place that was one more trick the enemy had stolen from his side as hed feared from the beginning any knife that cut the usa would also cut the csa dammit we can hit them in the flank and smash them patton shouted again and again it worked in ohio it worked in pennsylvania till they got lucky itll work here too he didnt mention that it hadnt worked in kentucky and here in tennessee not long before and he didnt seem to realize that the confederates enjoyed the edge in firepower and doctrine in ohio and also for a while in pennsylvania now the us forces understood what was what as well as their cs counterparts and the yankees had the firepower edge damn them whenever the confederates surged to the attack they got hit by artillery fire the likes of which theyd never seen in the fondly remembered days of fighterbombers roared across the battlefield adding muscle to the bombardment they had a much better chance of getting away to do it again than the slow ungainly confederate asskickers did even more revolting the united states had not only more barrels but also better barrels the confederates desperately needed a new model to match or surpass the latest snorting monsters from pontiac they needed one but where was it where were the engineers who could design it where were the steelworkers and auto workers who could build it clarence potter knew where they were too damn many of them were in uniform doing jobs for which they werent ideally suited just like him the confederacy was running headlong into the same problem that bedeviled it during the great war it couldnt walk and chew gum at the same time one or the other yes one and the other not so well as the united states after pattons third ferocious lunge failed to wipe out or even shrink the yankee bridgehead on the south bank of the tennessee he called an officers meeting in an elementaryschool classroom sitting at one of those little desks smelling chalk dust and oilcloths took potter back over half a century what are we supposed to do patton rasped weve got to stop those bastards any way we can if they get into chattanoogaif they get past chattanoogawere screwed if that happens how do we stop em though for all practical purposes only an amateur here potter raised his hand again he thought of himself in short pants he hadnt been shy then and he wasnt shy now patton pointed to him lets make the enemy come to us for a change he said lets pull back into the city and give him the fun of digging us out that worked up in pennsylvania we can make it work for us too it means abandoning the river line patton said are we going to get it back sir potter asked patton gave him a dirty look chances were the general commanding had intended his remark to close off debate not keep it going potter nodded to himself yes patton had more than a little jake featherston in him well too bad he shouldnt have called this council if he didnt want to hear other peoples ideas we will if we can get some more air support patton said from where potter said the damnyankees have had more airplanes than we do ever since the pennsylvania campaign went sour pattons expression turned to outright loathing hed been in charge of the pennsylvania campaign and didnt like getting reminded it hadnt worked too bad potter thought again he spoke his mind to jake featherston a mere general didnt intimidate him a bit if the airplanes come patton tried again where will we get them from potter repeated we cant count on things we dont have or well end up in even hotter water than were in now you talk like a damnyankee patton said in a deadly voice i bet you think like a damnyankee too by god i hope so potter said which made pattons jaw drop about time somebody around here did dont you think theyve done a better job of thinking like us than we have of thinking like them and were paying for it you havent got the offensive spirit patton complained not when we dont have anything but our mouths to be offensive with no sir potter said the more we keep charging the us lines the more they slaughter us the worse off we are let them come to us let them pay the butchers bill let them see how well they like that maybe well be able to get out of this war with our freedom intact he used the word with malice aforethought ill report you to the president patton said go ahead its nothing i havent told him too potter said cheerfully having people who love you is all very well but you need a few men who are there to tell you the truth too he mocked featherstons wireless slogan as wickedly as he took the freedom partys name in vain several officers moved away from him as if afraid whatever he had might be contagious he saw a few men nod though some people still had the brains to see that if what they were doing now wasnt working they ought to try something else he wondered whether patton would no such luck potter hadnt really expected anything different he thought about going over pattons aggressive head and complaining to jake featherston himselfthought about it and dismissed it from his mind featherston was as fanatic about the offensive as patton was or he would have pulled back sooner in pennsylvania and lost less we open the new counterattack at tomorrow patton declared general potter you will be generous enough to include your brigade in the assault potter didnt want to what was the point of throwing it into the meat grinder now that it was rebuilt to the point of becoming useful again wasted materiel wasted lives the confederacy couldnt afford to throw awaybut he nodded yes sir of course sir i dont disobey orders you find other ways to be insubordinate patton jeered i hope so sir when insubordination is called for potter was damned if hed let the other general even seem to put him in the wrong he got the brigade as ready as he could if they were going to attack he wanted them to do it up brown he didnt think they could reach the objectives patton gave him but he didnt let on maybe he was wrong he hoped so if they succeeded they really would hurt the us forces on this side of the tennessee it all turned out to be moot at confederate guns in chattanooga on lookout mountain and on missionary ridge were banging away at the yankee bridgehead potter looked at his watch one more hour and then they would see what they would see but then a rumble that wasnt gunfire filled the sky potter peered up with trepidation and then with something approaching awe what looked like every us transport airplane in the world was overhead some flew by themselves while others towed gliders they were so low he could see the lines connecting airplane and glider one stream made for missionary ridge while the other flew right over chattanooga toward lookout mountain oh my god potter said afraid he knew what he would see next and he did string after string of paratroopers leaped from the transports their chutes filled the sky like toadstool tops confederate soldiers on the high ground started shooting at them while they were still in the air some of them fired back as they descended by the sound of their weapons they carried captured cs automatic rifles and submachine guns the damnyankees had seized plenty and the ammo to go with them in their drive through kentucky and tennessee now they were using them to best advantage as the paratroopers landed atop lookout mountain and missionary ridge a captain near potter said they cant do that they cant get away with it why not potter answered what happens if they seize the guns up there what happens if they turn em on us the captain thought about it but not for long if they do that were fucked i couldnt have put it better myselfor worse depending on your point of view potter said the racket of gunfire from the high ground got louder the usa had dropped a lot of men up there they werent likely to carry anything heavier than mortarsthough god only knew what all the gliders heldbut they had the advantage of surprise and probably the advantage of numbers they caught patton with his pants down potter thought and then hell they caught me with my pants down too they caught all of us were not going to go forward at now are we sir the captain asked sweet jesus christ no potter exclaimed weour sideweve got to get those yankees off the high ground that comes ahead of this counterattack if patton didnt like it too bad but no sooner were the words out of his mouth than a wireless operator rushed up to him sir were ordered to hold in place with two regiments and to bring the third back fast as we can to use against lookout mountain hold with two move the third back potter echoed all right ill issue the orders he wondered if he could hold with twothirds of his brigade if us forces tried to break out of the bridgehead now at the same time as they were seizing the high ground and guns in the cs flank and rear couldnt they just barge into chattanooga and straight on past it he hoped they wouldnt try maybe their right hand and left didnt have even a nodding acquaintance with each other it had happened before not this time twenty minutes later as his rearmost regiment started south toward lookout mountain us artillery north of the tennessee awakened with a roar greengray barrels surged forward it was only august but winter came to live in clarence potters heart dr leonard odoull worked like a man possessed in part that was because the new senior medic working with him sergeant vince donofrio couldnt do as much as granville mcdougald had donofrio wasnt bad and he worked like a draft horse himself but granny had been a doctor without the md and donofrio wasnt that made odoull work harder to pick up the slack he would have been madly busy even with mcdougald at his side the united states hadnt quite brought off what they most wanted to do close off the confederates line of retreat from chattanooga with paratroops surround their army inside the city and destroy it featherstons men managed to keep a line of retreat open to the south they got a lot of their soldiers and some of their armor and other vehicles out through it down in northern georgia pattons army remained a force in being but the stars and stripes floated over chattanooga over lookout mountain over missionary ridge the aid station was near the center of town up in the usa newspapers were bound to be singing hosannas they had the rightthis was the biggest victory the united states had won since pittsburgh it was much more elegant than that bloody slugging match too which didnt mean it came without cost odoull knew too well it didnt he paused in the middle of repairing a wound to a soldiers left buttock to raise his mask and swig from an autoclaved coffee mug his gloved hands left bloody prints on the china he set the mug down and went back to work poor bastard lost enough meat to make a rump roast didnt he doc donofrio said damn near hell sit sideways from now on thats for sure odoull replied like the old lady in candide he knew what he meant hed read it in english in college and in french after he moved up to the republic of quebec but sergeant donofrio just said huh odoull didnt try to explain jokes you explained stopped being funny but he was willing to bet granny would have got it he finished sewing up the fellows left cheek the stitches looked like railroad lines it was a nasty wound you made jokes that didnt need explaining when somebody got hit there but it was no joke to the guy it happened to this fellow would spend a lot of time on his belly and his right side odoull didnt think he would ever come back to the front line after the stretcherbearers carried the anesthetized soldier away they brought in a paratrooper whod got hurt up on lookout mountain he had a splint and a sling on his right arm and a disgusted expression on his face what happened to you odoull asked him i broke the son of a bitch sure as hell the injured man replied looked like i was gonna get swept right into a tree so i stuck out my arm to fend it off like yeah i know they teach you not to do that so i was a dumb asshole and i got hurt without even getting shot believe me corporal you didnt miss a thing odoull said but i let my buddies down the paratrooper said some of them mightve bought a plot cause i fucked up i shot myself full of morphine and took a pistol off a dead confederate but even so i wasnt doing everything i should have dammit what did you do when the morphine wore off donofrio asked gave myself more shots thats wonderful stuff killed the pain and kept me going just like coffee would ive been running on it two days straight the corporal said sergeant donofrio looked at odoull theres one you dont see every day doc yeah odoull said morphine made most people sleepy a few though it energized youve got an unusual metabolism corporal is that good or bad neither i dont think its just different why dont you get up on the table well put you under and make sure your arms set properly and get it in a cast thatll hold things together better than your arrangement there how long will i take to heal up the soldier asked as he obeyed a couple of months probably and youll need some more time to build up the arm once you can use it again odoull said the paratrooper swore resignedly he wasnt angry at being away from the fighting so much as for letting his friends down odoull gave him ether after the soldier went under the doctor waved for vince donofrio to do the honors setting a broken bone and putting a cast on it were things the medic could do he took care of them as well as odoull might have they fixed several more fractures arms ankles legs paratroopers didnt have an easy time of it coming down somewhere rugged like the top of lookout mountain was dangerous in itself add in the casualties the desperate confederates dealt out and the us parachute troops suffered badly but they did what they were supposed to do they silenced the enemy guns on the high ground they turned some of those guns against the confederates in and in front of chattanooga and they made featherstons men fear for their flank and rear as well as their own front if not for the paratroopers the stars and bars would probably still fly above chattanooga the wounded men seemed sure the price theyd paid was worth it one of them said my captain got hit when we were rushing a battery make it count he told us he didnt make it but by god we did like he said hed had two fingers shot off his left hand and couldnt have been prouder only thing worse than getting hurt when you win is getting hurt when you lose donofrio remarked after they anesthetized the paratrooper then you know your country got screwed along with you maybe sergeants thought alike grannyd said the same thing they treated wounded confederates who went a long way toward proving the point you bastards win youre gonna screw us to the wall said a glum pfc with a bullet through his foot i gave it my best shot but what the hell can you do when you stop one he seemed sunk in gloom you came through alive odoull said whatever happens youre here to see it hot damn the confederate answered donofrio put him under odoull did what he could to patch up the damage from the bullet he didnt know if the wounded man would ever walk without a limp but he was pretty sure he saved the foot away went the wounded pfc next up on the table was a much more badly hurt confederate with an entry wound in the right side of his chest and a far bigger exit wound in the right side of his back bloody foam came from his mouth and nostrils he wasnt complaining about how the war was going he was gray and barely breathing sergeant donofrio got a plasma line into him before odoull could even ask for it odoull wished he could transfuse whole blood they were supposed to be working the bugs out of that but whatever they were doing hadnt got to the field yet this guy needed red cells to carry oxygen but he would have to use his own that means ive got to keep him from bleeding to death in there odoull thought unhappily he opened the confederates chest even as donofrio stuck the ether cone over the mans face the wounded soldier was too far gone to care the bullet had torn hell out of his right lung odoull hadnt expected anything different he cut away the bottom half of the organ tying off bleeders as fast as he could make it snappy doc donofrio said his bps dropping im doing everything i can odoull answered keep that plasma coming i gave him the biggestgauge needle we have the medic answered only way to get it in there faster is with a fuckin funnel all right odoull said but it wasntnot even close too much blood loss too long trying to breathe with that ruined lunghe knew exactly when the wounded man died because he felt his heart stop he swore and tried openchest massage he won a couple of feeble contractions but then the heart quivered toward eternal silence odoull looked up and shook his head shit close the line vince hes gone oh well you tried doc dont feel bad about it every time they lost somebody odoull heard the same thing there wasnt much else to say donofrio went on not like he was one of ours anyway i work just as hard on them odoull said that way i can stay honest when i hope they work just as hard on our guys well yeah donofrio said but even soyou know what i mean odoull nodded he knew exactly what the younger man meant he worked as hard as he did on enemy wounded not least because he knew as long as he was honest about that losing confederate casualties bothered him as little as possible if he only went through the motions if he lost men he might have saved by working harderwell how could he shave in the morning without wanting to slice the razor blade across his throat corpsmen lifted the dead confederate off the operating table and carried him away odoull peeled off his gloves he threw them into a trash can he had blood on his arms up past the gloves hed been deep inside the soldiers chest he scrubbed with strong soap that smelled of carbolic acid then went to get a towel with his wrists bent up so the water would run away from his fingers hands dried he took a deep breath whew he said feels like im coming up for air enjoy it while you can vince donofrio said chances are it wont last long he stretched and twisted his back something in there crackled he was grinning as he took off his mask thats better wonder what chattanoogas like havent hardly had a chance to look around chattanoogas a mess odoull said which was true in the same sense that jake featherston was not a nice person chattanooga was bombed and shelled and shot up but that wasnt all of what donofrio meant odoull went on probably not all the women refugeed out sure as hell hope not chasing skirt was donofrios hobby the way fishing was for some men and carpentry for others be careful what you catch after youve got it for a little while youll decide you dont want it any more odoull knew a lot of skirtchasers and didnt understand any of them he was happy enough with one woman oh he looked at others but he didnt touch plenty of men did yeah yeah im a big boy doc donofrio told him impatiently the medic was readyeagerto comb through the ruins of chattanooga for anything that didnt take a leak standing up just remember your initials odoull warned funny funny vince donofrio said hardeharhar see im busting up yeah well use a pro station when youre done laughing odoull said sulfas pretty good for the clap but it doesnt do anything about syphilis i know i know ill be careful donofrio said is that other new stuff coming out of the labsthat peniwhateverthehellis that as good as everybody says it is havent got my hands on any so i dont know for sure odoull answered the literature sure makes it sound like the second coming though doesnt it hed seen plenty of literature like that for one patent medicine or another and that always turned out to be less than met the eye but people raved about penicillin in professional journals that was different he hoped it was anyway drugs that killed germs without poisoning patients gave doctors an edge theyd sorely missed in the great war im gonna slide outa here if i get a chance donofrio said he didnt not even a minute later corpsmen brought in a confederate groaning with a shattered shoulder the medic went to work without complaint if he was thinking about women while he did well wasnt that better than brooding about blood and bullets and broken bones armstrong grimes was new to the rituals of the reppledepple hed stayed with the same unit from ohio to utah to canada now he didnt belong to anybody or anything hed been dissolved away from everything that went before and was floating free he was awhat the hell did they call them in chemistry he muttered to himself flogging his memory an ion that was it he was an ion the replacement depot had been a high school somewhere in the middle of tennessee he didnt know exactly where or care very much all he knew was that it was a hell of a lot hotter and muggier than manitoba and he knew the locals here like the ones up there and the ones in utah didnt like us soldiers worth a damn a barbedwire perimeter with sandbagged machinegun nests around the depot rubbed that in he lit a cigarette confederate tobacco was easy to come by around here anyway he sucked in smoke held it and blew it out the kid in the seat next to his said bum a butt off you sergeant sure armstrong held out the pack thanks the kid took one pulled a lighter out of his pocket and got the duke going he smoked it halfway down then said you rather go to the front or do you want occupation duty christ the front armstrong said ive done occupation duty you can have it i want to get some licks in at the real enemy for a change what about you i got wounded when we were outflanking nashville the kid answered if i could find a nice quiet spot where nothing much happens youre an honest goldbrick anyway armstrong said laughing id have to smoke funny cigarettes to really believe it not nice ones like these the young private said the only guys who draw duty like that are congressmens kids not even them there was one in my outfitwell a nephew but close enough armstrong said he was a regular joe yossel was did the same shit everybody else did took the same chances when the shooting started he had balls toosheenies must be toughern i figured up at the front of the reppledepple where the principal would have given the students whatfor a personnel sergeant sat reading a paperback with a nearly naked girl on the cover a young officer came up and spoke to him he nodded put down the book and picked up a clipboard he read off several names and pay numbers men grabbed their gear and went out with the shavetail a few more soldiers came in and found seats the personnel sergeant called other names and numbers men slung duffel bags or shouldered packs and found themselves part of the war again a poker game started armstrong stayed away hed played a lot of poker in the hospital and had less money than he wished he did because of it another lieutenant talked with the personnel sergeant the sergeant looked at his clipboard among the names he read was henderson calvin the kid next to armstrong got up and walked to the front of the room then the noncom said grimes armstrong and rattled off his pay number he got up too his leg hurt a little but he got around all right he went up and said im armstrong grimes hello sergeant im lieutenant bassler the officer said ive got a squad for you youve led a squad before ive led a platoon sir armstrong answered lieutenant bassler took it in stride good youll know what youre doing then where was that in utah sir and up in canada all right and youre in the reppledepple because did you foul up did they take your platoon away from you armstrong could read between the lines i got wounded sir he touched his leg i can use it pretty well now ah i caught one about there myself last year bassler said gives us something in common even if we dont much want it hell of a lot better to shoot the other guy armstrong agreed well youll get your chance come on bassler said hold it the personnel sergeant held up a hand i gotta sign these guys out armstrong and cal henderson and the other men signed on their lines on the clipboard now the military bureaucrat nodded approval he reminded armstrong of his own father he wanted all the is dotted and the ts crossed and he didnt think anything was official till they were when the soldiers got outside armstrong said sir you mind if i load my weapon never can tell whats waiting out here the question wasnt just practical though it was that it would also show him something about how lieutenant bassler thought the officer nodded right away youd all better do that he said and pulled his own from its holster armstrong put a clip in his springfield and chambered a round all but one of the other men also had springfields the odd man outhis name armstrong remembered was kurowskicarried a submachine gun not a confederate model but a big brutal thompson made in the usa the lieutenant had a couple of command cars waiting to take his new men down to the front he said ill handle the machine gun on one of these who wants to take the other one ill do it sir cal henderson said ive used acaliber gun before havent fired one of these big mothers but they work the same way right near enough lieutenant bassler said acaliber gun shoots farther and flatter and harder thats all sounds good to me henderson said it sounded good to armstrong too but lieutenant bassler didnt put him in with the kid the officer stuck armstrong in his own command car and grilled him as they thumped down the battered road he got more out of armstrong about where hed fought and what hed done he probably also learned a bit about how armstrong thought but that didnt occur to armstrong till later when they came into chattanoogaluckily without needing to use the machine guns on the waybassler said ever see anything this torn up sir this isnt a patch on ogden and salt lake city armstrong answered the mormons hung on till they couldnt hang on any more then they pulled back a block and did it again an old man picking through ruins with a stick glared at the command cars as they went by if he had a riflebut he didntnot here anywayso he could only hate what do we do with themwhat do we do to themonce we lick them bassler said how do we keep from fighting another round twenty twentyfive thirty years from now how do we keep them from putting bombs under their shirts and blowing themselves up when they walk into a crowd of our soldiers armstrong remembered that woman in utah when he was heading for r and r he shivered despite the humid heat sir i wish to hell i knew he said im just a dumbass sergeant what do you think how do we do it either we make them like us good luck armstrong broke in uh sir yeah i know bassler wasnt more than a few years older than armstrong when he grinned the difference hardly showed fat chance but if we could do that it would sure save us a lot of trouble down the road if we cant maybe we can make them too scared of us to turn terrorist very often thats what they tried in utah armstrong said it sort of worked but only sort of you start shooting hostages and stuff you just make people hate you worse im afraid youre right bassler said sourly and the confederate states are a lot bigger than utah we occupy them all there are bound to be lots of places where were too thin on the ground to do it right and those are the places where trouble starts i know one thing we could do armstrong said bassler raised a questioning eyebrow armstrong went on we could give whats left of the niggers guns if half the shit they say about what featherstons fuckers are doing to them is true theyll want payback like you wouldnt believe they may not love us but they sure as hell have to hate the bastards whove been screwing em over for so long lieutenant bassler stayed quiet for so long armstrong wondered if hed said something dumb well too bad if he had bassler shouldnt have asked him if he didnt want to know what he thought then the young officer said you know grimes im going to pass that up the line we dont think about the negroes in the csa as much as we should im sure were doing some things to help them same as the confederates did what they could to help the mormons in utah mostly the mormons used our weapons sir armstrong said that way they could get ammo from us sometimes they took our guns too but they already had a lot when we got there yeah uhhuh bassler said but thats not my point my point is that we ought to be using the negroes systematically and we arent somebody with stars on his shoulder straps needs to think about that maybe the president does too armstrong was convinced they wouldnt think about it on the suggestion of a noaccount noncom then they drove through the gap between lookout mountain and missionary ridge the gap us forces now held barechested gun bunnies fed s that sent death down into georgia eyeing the high ground to either side armstrong said my hats off to those paratroopers they saved us a world of grief you can sing that in church sergeant bassler said we got over the tennessee with a ruse and we took the mountains with a trick makes you wonder what well have to do to go forward from here well the country looks easier anyway armstrong said if we start banging barrels through the gap can those butternut bastards stop us good question i think well find out before too long once the logistics buildup gets done bassler said they were close enough to the front to watch incoming artillery burst less than a quarter of a mile away bassler tapped the driver on the shoulder thisll do well hoof it from here theyll start aiming at the command cars if we come much closer looking grateful the driver hit the brakes armstrong ended up with cal henderson in his new squad he was introduced to whitey and woody and alf and rocco and hy and squidface and zeb the hat when he said lets try not to get each other killed all right they all nodded youve been through some shit squidface opined thats good a little bit armstrong allowed you guys look like you have too hell were here squidface said he was a pfc skinny and dark and needing a shave he didnt have tentacles or even particularly buggy eyes one of these days armstrong figured hed find out how the nickname happened till then he didnt need to flabble about it the confederates threw a little more artillery at the us positions nobody in armstrongs new squad even moved these guys were veterans all right they could tell by listening when falling shells were liable to be dangerous they watched armstrong as the shells burst too they wanted to see if he got all hot and bothered when he lit up a duke and went on talking as if nothing were happening they relaxed a little you guys think we can break out he asked hed heard what lieutenant bassler had to say these men would have to do the bleeding so will i armstrong thought so would basslersecond lieutenants were expendable too but armstrong didnt worry about him they all loudly and profanely insisted they could armstrong figured that meant theyd get the chance to try before real long jonathan moss counted himself lucky to be alive he didnt think what was left of spartacus band would attack another airstrip any time soon doing it once had cost the black guerrillas too much they was layin for us spartacus said he moss nick cantarella and a dozen or so negro fighters sat around a couple of small campfires was they layin for anybody who come by or did somebody rat on us that was an ugly thought a negro would have to be crazy or desperate to betray his comrades to whites in the csa but it could happen if a man knew his loved ones were in a camp could he make a bargain with the devil of course he could moss could find other reasons that might make a black turn traitorsimple jealousy of spartacus came to mindbut saving kin stood highest on the list of likely ones some lyin nigger might be sittin right here next to me spartacus said damn cottonmouth might be gittin ready to bite again the guerrillas stirred one of them a heavyset fellow called arminius said we went to the damn airstrip on account o these ofays anybody sell us out reckon theys the ones like calls to like folks say it couldnt very well have been us moss said you people have kept an eye on us ever since we joined the band you think we dont know that i dont blame you for doing it but its no secret he talked like a lawyer he reasoned from evidence no surprisehe was a lawyer sometimes though legal tactics werent what the situation called for moving quickly but without any fuss nick cantarella got to his feet anybody says i kiss jake featherstons ass can kiss mine he eyed arminius shall i drop my drawers for you the black man jumped up with a roar of rage he charged cantarella he was a couple of inches taller than the escaped pow and much wider through the shoulders he wasnt afraid of anythingmoss had seen that plenty of times he swung an enormous haymaker intending to knock cantarella into the middle of next week no doubt the white officer tried to infuriate him so he would fight foolishly cantarella got what he wanted he grabbed arminius arm jerked and twisted the negro let out a startled squawk as he flew through the air he landed hard cantarella kicked him in the side arminius groaned but tried to yank cantarellas foot out from under him naughty the us officer said and kicked him above his left ear arminius groaned and went limp the brawl couldnt have lasted half a minute cantarella looked around anybody else no one said anything sit down spartacus told him i dont reckon you done nothin i reckon you did you be dead no matter how fancy you fight you gots to sleep some o the time throw water on arminius cantarella said hell be fine once his headache goes away i dont think i broke anythingdidnt do it on purpose anyhow a bucketno they call it a pail here moss thoughtfrom a nearby creek revived arminius he didnt remember the fight or what led up to it he did say my head bangin like a big ol drum i bet it is spartacus said he eyed cantarella where you learn dat here and there cantarella answered you learn me how to do it probably the us officer said most of the time its no damn good somebody got a gun hell punch your ticket for you before you get close enough to throw him through a wall learn me anyways spartacus said mebbe i got to impress some niggers git em to jine up with me i do dat fancy shit dey reckon is tough enough to suit he paused his mouth twisted hope i find me some niggers to impress aint so many left no more cept for the ones already totin guns he was right about that ten years earlier the countryside hereabouts would have been full of sharecropper villages full of blacks mechanization and deportation had taken care of that not many negroes remained out here and fewer all the time mexican soldiers and freedom party stalwarts and guards from the towns took ever more to train stations off they went to one camp or another and it grew clearer and clearer that the camps didnt house them or not for long the camps just killed them as fast as they could assembly line for murder jonathan moss murmured what you say spartacus asked nothing woolgathering thats all moss was glad the guerrilla chief hadnt understood him nick cantarella had armys coming he said wont be too fucking long either chattanoogas fallen even the confederate propaganda mill cant spew lies about that any more if our guys arent in georgia already they will be pretty damn quick territory north of atlantas rough but its not that rough i dont think featherstons fuckers can stop em once they get rolling again we still be breathin when they gits here spartacus asked cant hardly think about hittin towns no mo got to stay alive first what happen to me arminius asked holding his head as if afraid it might fall off any minute now considering what cantarella did to it it might too moss wouldnt have wanted a wellaimed shoe clomping into the side of his noggin you done did somethin dumb dats what spartacus answered and then came back to the problem at hand wanna hit the damn ofays dont wanna jus lurk out here like swamp niggers in slavery days you can get dynamite right cantarella asked spartacus nodded cantarella went on and you can get alarm clocks too yeah reckon so spartacus said what you thinkin bout people bombs is too risky even if we finds folks willin to do it these days ofays see a nigger they dont know they jus start shootin cant get close enough to blow up a lot of em auto bombs cantarella said set the timer for sunup but drive in during the middle of the night park the son of a bitch and then get out if you can all the shrapnel flying auto bombs make a mess of things even if they dont have a big crowd around em spartacus sighed yeah we do dat dey dont patrol as good as dey oughta but it aint the same you hear what i say we hear moss said he didnt want to make himself too prominent right now the guerrillas had attacked the airstrip on his account he would have enjoyed strafing confederates in georgia if hed stolen an airplane he would have enjoyed flying off to usheld territory even more insteadinstead the band wrecked itself that was all there was to it spartacus and the surviving negroesfewer than half those whod gone to the airportdidnt want to admit that even to themselves for which he couldnt blame them but it was true theyd fought the mexicans on even terms before the debacle now they ran from them they had to they would get chewed to bits if they didnt a buzz in the air overhead made everybody look up nervously reckon the woods hides our fires good enough spartacus said well find out nick cantarella answered that wasnt what moss wanted to hear and a minute or so later he wanted even less to hear the screech of falling bombs they wouldnt be big onestenpounders say thrown out of the airplane by hand the way bombardiers did it back in the early days of the great war but when he had no trench or foxhole to jump into all he could do was flatten out on the ground and hope for the best the confederate pilot wouldnt be aiming any fancy bombsight not in an obsolete airplane like the one he was flying hed just fling the bombs out and hope for the best not much chance of doing damage that way not unless he got lucky but when the first bomb knocked down a tree less than a hundred yards from the fires moss wasnt the only one who cried out in fear more bombs rained down some bursting farther away others closer fragments snarled past one mans cries went from fear to pain moss got up and bandaged the gash in the negros leg he didnt have needle and thread but used a couple of safety pins to help close the wound thank you kindly suh the guerrilla said and then hurts like a motherfucker im sorryi dont have any morphine moss said didnt reckon you did the black man answered somebody round here will mebbe when the bombs let up he get up off his ass an stick me you got balls ofay movin while theys comin down thanks moss didnt think the risk was especially large which was why hed done it he didnt say that though being old and white isolated him from spartacus band no one till arminius had blamed him for the fiasco at the airstrip but it stuck in his mindand no doubt in the guerrillas minds too any way he could find to win back respect he gladly accepted after a few minutes the little puddlejumper of an airplane buzzed and farted away the negro moss had bandaged was the only man hurt spartacus said we gots to git outa here that pilot he gonna tell the ofays an the greasers where we at they come after us in the mornin we ought to pull out yeah nick cantarella said but we should set up an ambush blast the crap out of those bastards when they poke their noses where they dont belong spartacus thought about it at last reluctantly he shook his head cant afford to lose nobody now cant afford to lose no machine gun neither cantarella looked as if he wanted to argue after a moment he shrugged instead youre the boss me im just a staff officer nah them fuckers never come up where they kin hear the guns spartacus said moss and cantarella both guffawed most of the guerrillas looked blank sure as hell spartacus had seen staff officers in actionor in inactionwhen he wore butternut during the last war the men he led werent old enough to have fought for the csa the last time around if theyd had the chance if theyd been treated decently they might have done it this time how many divisions could the confederates have squeezed from their colored population enough to give the usa fits moss was sure of that but the freedom party didnt want negroes on its side it wanted them gone and it didnt care what that did to the country moss shook his head he didnt have it quite right the freedom party thought getting rid of negroes was more important than using them that struck moss as insane but it made whites in the csa happy jake featherston wouldnt have got elected if it didnt it wasnt as if he ever made any secret about what he had in mind the guerrillas had to rig a litter of branches and a blanket to take the wounded man alonghe couldnt walk he offered to stay behind and shoot as many soldiers and stalwarts as he could but spartacus wouldnt let him cant do enough with no rifle and we aint leavin no machine gun here he said they got the negrohis name was theophrastusonto the litter and hauled him away moss let out a mournful sigh if things had worked out the way he wanted he would be back on the us side of the line now he might be flying a fighter again how much had they improved while he sat on the shelf here he didntcouldntknow but he was still fighting the enemy which he hadnt been while stuck in andersonville it wasnt much but it would have to do way to go pat sam carsten held out his hand i knew youd do it now get out there and give em hell thank you sir the exec shook the proffered hand you dont call me sir any more i call you sir nowsir sam said cooley was getting his own ship and getting promoted away from the josephus daniels he hadnt yet put on his oak leaves or sewn the thin gold stripe that transformed him from lieutenant to lieutenant commander onto each sleeve but he had the rank even without its trappings rank or no rank he shook his head doesnt seem right it isnt right dammit youve taught me so much my ass carsten said like the old cpo he was you knew more than i did when i got here now you know a lot more than i do and the navy departments finally figured it out we both knew this day was coming youre headed for the top and im doing the best job i know how and thats the way it ought to be you ought to have a carrier not a destroyer escort cooley blurted what the hell would i do with a carrier run it on the rocks thats what sam had to belittle that he didnt want tohe didnt dareadmit how much he wanted it he thought he knew what to do hed spent enough time aboard the remembrance first as a rating and then as an officer but even the baby flattops they were cranking out now had threestripers in command and he knew hed be lucky if he ever made two and a half he was damn lucky to have made a lieutenants two you could swing it pat cooley said you can handle men you know guns you know damage control for everything elsehe winkedyou could lean on your exec till you got the hang of it sam laughed you remember to lean on yours he said youre the old man now youre the good guy the mild guy let him be the professional son of a bitch thats his job its not yours any more i wont forget cooley slung his duffel over his shoulder as he walked off the deck and onto the gangplank that led to the boston navy yard the crew called out good luck and good wishes to him cooley waved and grinned he hadnt been an outandout tartar the way a lot of execs were the sailors might not love him but they did respect him wonder who well get now one grizzled petty officer said to another some hotshot who shaves once a week the other cpo predicted well well break him in by god yeah well the first chief noticed sam listening and shut up with a snap i know what you guys will do sam said holding in a smile remember ive done it myself if you dont ride the guy too hard everythingll be jake sometimes we forget youre a mustang sir the first chief said sheepishly you just act like an officer you know was that a compliment or an insult sam didnt try to parse it with a snort he said yeah like the oldest goddamn lieutenant in the us navy if im not a mustang im a screwup better for the ship if i came up the hawser those were the magic words if something was good for the ship nobody would say a word about it the two chiefs didnt hang around though they went off someplace where they could slander the outgoing and incoming execsand probably the skipper toowithout getting overheard as for sam he walked back to his cramped cabin and wrestled with the ships accounts after a spell in combat you could always write some things off as lost in action which simplified your life he thought about keeping accounts for an airplane carrier that almost made him decide not to touch the job with an elevenfoot bohunk which was what you used when a tenfoot pole wouldnt reach but if he ever got the chance he knew he would leap at it he laughed but he was angry too pat cooley had given him a new itch even if it was one he didnt think hed ever be able to scratch more shells and smallarms ammunition came aboard so did all kinds of galley supplies the ship got refueled too and he had to sign off on everything one of these days if the josephus daniels didnt get sunk under him hed have to turn her over to somebody else and he wanted the books to balance or at least get within shouting distance of balancing when he did the new exec came aboard the next day lieutenant myron zwilling couldnt have been more different from pat cooley had he tried for a week he was short and squat and dark he was also fussily precise if he had a sense of humor he kept it so well hidden even he didnt know where it was he stared at sams right hand a glance at zwillings hand told the skipper what he was looking for an annapolis ring zwillings was lovingly displayed and couldnt have been polished any brighter reporting as ordered sir he said trying to hold in his disappointment at not finding sam a naval academy graduate when he saluted the ring flashed in the sun pleased to meet you mr zwilling sam said reflecting that the new exec was either an optimist or a jerk one how could a twostriper in his midfifties possibly be anything but a mustang well give em hell wont we i hope to aid in making this ship an efficient fighting unit sir zwilling said and sams heart sank he had nothing against efficiency but he didnt want to sing hymns to it and zwilling plainly did have you ever served on a de before sam asked no sir zwilling replied my last tour of duty was aboard a fleet oiler and before that i was a junior officer on the idaho i have my personnel records with me for your review of course you do sam thought that wasnt fair but he couldnt help it trying not to show what he was feeling he said well lets give you the quick tour then therell be places where you want to watch your headnot a lot of room in one of these babies ill be careful sir zwilling said and sam believed him he was unimpressed with the pair of inch guns that made up the josephus daniels main armarment the secondary weapons on a battleship are bigger than these he sniffed tell me about it i fought a fiveincher on the dakota carsten said as battery chief zwilling asked with his first show of interest in his new skipper as a human being nope sam shook his head i was a loader when the great war started and ended up running a gun a loader i see zwilling looked as uncomfortable as if sam had admitted to eating with his fingers when he was a kid there wouldnt be any talk about professors or courses not on this ship there wouldnt sam took him through the destroyer escort galley bunkrooms engines and all finally he said what do you think everything seems orderly enough the new exec allowed still im sure theres room for improvement there always is sam said not liking the way the commonplace sounded in zwillings mouth do you think you can find your way back to your cabin from here i do zwilling didnt lack for confidence anyhow well ask a sailor if you get lost sam inserted the needle with a smile ill let you get settled and well talk some more in the wardroom tonight yes sir zwilling saluted again and strode off after sam went up on deck he watched a sailor standing on the pier kissing a redheaded woman goodbye a couple of sniffling little boys in dungarees stood by her so she was probably the sailors wife after a last embrace he slung his duffel bag and asked the officer of the deck for permission to come aboard welcome to the josephus daniels sam said who are you and what do you do im george enos junior sir the sailor answered i jerked shells on a mm on the townsend goddamn confederate asskicker sank her in the gulf of california well we can use you carsten paused enos the name rang a bell he snapped his fingers wasnt your mother the one who she sure was enos said proudly my father was a fisherman before he went into the navy and so was i good to have you aboard sam said good to meet you too by god thank you sir the sailor cocked his head to one side have we ever met before you look kind of familiar with his very blond hair and pink skin sam sometimes got mistaken for other fair men he shook his head not that i know of anyway you live around here after enos nodded sam went on ive been through more times than i can count so you may have seen me somewhere but ive got to tell you i dont remember maybe itll come to me enos grinned like a kid or maybe im talking through my hat who knows will i go on a mm here sir have to see how everything shakes down but id say your chances are pretty darn good sam answered go below for now and sling your duffel somewhere the chiefs will take charge of you aye aye sir with a crisp salute george enos headed for a hatch he could have been a kid when we bumped into each other sam realized but if he was why would he remember me he shrugged he had no way of knowing maybe it would come back to enos and maybe it wouldnt the world wouldnt end either way orders came the next day join up with a task force heading east across the atlantic to raid ireland this is where i came in carsten thought hed run guns to the micks during the great war and shelledand been shelled bybritish positions in ireland afterwards the difference this time around was an abundance of british landbased air he wondered how much the navy department brass down in philly had thought about that when he showed myron zwilling the orders the new exec just nodded and said thats what well do then well yeah sam said id like to have some kind of hope of coming back afterwards though if they need to expend us sir zwilling began hold your horses sam held up a hand if they need to expend us on something important then sure we needed to take bermuda back if we couldi guess we did anyhow ive pulled some raids on the confederates that i think really hurt those bastards but this this looks chickenshit to me you dont know the big picture sir zwilling said he was right sam didnt what i do know i dont like you cant refuse the mission the exec said he was right again that would mean a courtmartial probably or else just an ignominious retirement im not refusing it carsten said hastily im worrying about it thats a different kettle of fish yes sir the way zwilling said it it meant no sir youre not helping sam thought an exec was supposed to be a sounding board someone with whom he could speak his mind he wasnt going to get that from myron zwilling he didnt need to be an annapolis grad to see as much well give it our best shot thats all sam thought about george enos jr and well make damn sure all the antiaircraft guns and ashcan launchers are fully manned of course sir myron zwilling said xvii georgia chester martin looked south and east he was really and truly in georgia if only in the northwesternmost corner of the state when he looked across it though he knew what he saw on the other side the end of the war damned if i dont he thought if the us army could grind across georgia it would cut the confederate states in half it would take atlanta or else make the city worthless to the csa how could the enemy go on fighting after that oh both halves of a worm wiggled for a while if you sliced it in twobut not for long and the confederates had to know that as well as he did their artillery stayed busy all the time they staged night raids with everything from big bombers down to little puddlejumping biplanes that flew along at treetop height and peeked right into your foxhole no matter what they did at night the usa ruled the daytime skies twoengine and fourengine bombers pounded confederate positions so did us fighterbombers after they dropped their bombs they climbed to go after the outnumbered cs hound dogs that still rose to challenge the us air armada and fewer hound dogs rose each week than had the week before little by little the confederate states were getting ground down us artillery on lookout mountain and missionary ridge sent volleys as far into confederate territory as they would reach announcing that the high ground had a new owner some of the guns up there had belonged to the confederacy unlike small arms their artillery shared several calibers with its us equivalents they must have thought they would capture us guns not the reverse but those streams of paratroopers floating down from the sky caught them by surprise captain rhodes came forward and cautiously looked at the fields and pine woods ahead he didnt use field glassesthey were a dead giveaway that an officer was up there snooping and an invitation to a sniper to draw a bead on him he looked from one end of a trench walked fifty feet with his head down then popped up for another peek some of the fields out there were minefields the confederates had marked some of them with signs that said mines or warned people away with skulls and crossbones some of the signs were genuine others by what chester had seen before were bluffs and real minefields sometimes went unmarked too advancing us soldiers and barrels would find them the hard wayand probably come under machinegun fire once slowed down in them we can take those bastards rhodes said chester martin nodded yes sir i think we can too wont be too easy wont be too cheap but we can do it the company commander turned and looked west we ought to be cleaning out the rest of tennessee too so we dont have such a narrow front here we can sure as hell do that even now the confederates have a devil of a time getting men and materiel from east to west yes sir chester said again thats how nashville fellalmost an afterthought you might say sure rhodes grinned goddamn big afterthought wasnt it but youre right sergeant once we pushed past to the east once we got over the cumberland nashville stopped mattering so much the confederates had bigger worries closer to home so they pulled out and let us march in and they tried to hold chattanooga instead chester looked back over his shoulder toward the city captain rhodes had named and they couldnt do that either he said happily nope rhodes sounded pretty happy too theyre like a crabtheyve got claws that pinch and a hard shell to go with it but once you crack em theres nothing but meat inside sounds good to meexcept the meat in our rations is better than the horrible tinned beef they use martin said even they call it dead donkey but their smokes are still good he took a pack of dukes out of his pocket and offered it to rhodes want some thanks dont mind if i do the company co took one lit it and started to hand the pack back keep it chester said ive got plenty lots of dead confederates these days and lots of pows who dont need cigarettes any more thanks rhodes repeated and stuck the pack in his shirt pocket he took a drag blew it out and then shook his head hate to pay you back for your kindness this way chester but i dont know what i can do about it whats going on chester grew alert it wasnt the same sort of alertness he used around the enemy but your own side could screw you too well i hear reppledepples coughed up a shiny new second looey for us so im afraid youre going to lose your platoon rhodes said oh martin weighed that it stung but not too much ill live when they made me a first sergeant after i reupped i figured theyd have me breaking in shavetails ive had some practice by now i think im halfway decent at it fine rhodes set a hand on his shoulder youve got a good attitude im glad youre not getting pissy about it life is too short on the battlefield chester had seen how literally true that was second lieutenant boris lavochkin turned out not to be what he expected oh he was young the only second lieutenants who werent young were men up from the ranks and they didnt need a graying first sergeant to ramrod them lavochkin was squat and fair and toughlooking with the meanest palest eyes chester martin had ever seen youre going to show me the ropes are you the youngster asked thats the idea sir martin sounded more cautious than hed thought he would and youve done what to earn the right lieutenant lavochkin seemed serious i lived through the great war i ran a company for a while ive seen a good bit of action this time around toosir those icy eyes measured chester like calipers maybe lavochkin took off his helmet to scratch his head when he did he showed chester a long straight scar above his left ear you got hit sir chester said that had to be why lavochkin was coming out of the replacement depot he shrugged broad shoulders only a crease youve been wounded too once in the arm once in the leg you were lucky getting away with that one if i was lucky the shithead would have missed me lavochkin peered south give me the situation in front of us i want to lead a raid let the men see ill go where they go they need to know im in charge now a lot of shavetails wouldnt have been even with the rank to give orders lavochkinlavochkin was a leader a fighter a dangerous man hed go placesunless he stopped a bullet but they all took that chance sir maybe youd better check with captain rhodes before we go raiding chester said lavochkin scowled that made him look like an even rougher customer than he had before in the end though he nodded ill do that he said rhodes came up to chester a couple of hours later a small bemused smile on his face he glanced around to make sure the new lieutenant wasnt anywhere close by before remarking looks like weve got a tiger by the tail yes sir i thought so too martin said you going to turn him loose i sure am the company commander answered he needs to find out what he can do and so do we and if things go wrong well youve got your platoon again thats all if i come back chester said im not gonna let him take my guys out by himself im going too lieutenant lavochkin didnt like that i dont need you to hold my hand sergeant im not doing it to hold your hand sir chester said evenly im doing it for my men in case i dont cut it yes sir martin didnt beat around the bush lavochkin gave him one of those singularly malignant stares chester just looked back the young officer tossed his head well come on then well see who learns something the raid went in a little before midnight lavochkin knew enough to smear mud on his face to darken it he carried a captured confederate submachine gun along with the usual officers he also had a great war trench knife on his belt was he showing off or had he been in some really nasty places before he got hurt well find out chester thought lavochkin moved quietly the confederate machinegun nest ahead sat on a small rise but brush screened one approach most of the way up chester would have gone at it from that direction too lavochkin slid forward as if he could see in the dark suddenly he stopped moving theyve got wire the bastards he said he didnt ask for a wirecutterhe had one a couple of soft twangs followed this waystay low chester flattened out like a toad under the wheels of a deuceandahalf he got through before long he could hear the confederates at the machine gun talking he could smell their tobacco smoke and see the glow of a cigarette coal they had no idea us soldiers were in the neighborhood everybody ready lavochkin whispered no one denied it chester was close enough to the lieutenant to see him nod all right then he said at my signal we take em remember we want prisoners but shoot first if youre in trouble runnels scoot over to the left like we planned yes sir the soldier said softly he was little and skinny lavochkin had picked the right guy for quiet scooting hes a prick but i think he knows what hes doing chester thought lavochkins signal was nothing if not dramatic he pulled the pin from a grenade and tossed it about halfway between runnels and the confederate position as soon as it burst runnels who carried a captured automatic rifle fired several quick rounds naturally the confederates in the machinegun nest started shooting at the noise and muzzle flashes chester saw the flame spurting from their weapons he hoped runnels was all right he hoped he would be all right himself too because he was up and running for the enemy entrenchment as fast as he could go runnels squeezed off another burst to keep featherstons men thinking about him and nobody else he yelled like a wild man too the deception worked just the way lieutenant lavochkin hoped it would the confederates didnt notice the footfalls of the onrushing us soldiers till the men in greengray were right on top of them martin heard a startled what the fuck as one of the machine gunners tried to swing his piece around too late lavochkin cut him down with three accurate rounds from his submachine gun then he leaped down into the entrenchment the rest of the us soldiers followed chester hadnt used a bayonet for anything but opening cans and holding a candle since trench raids a generation earlier he discovered he still knew how he stuck a machine gunner who was grabbing for a submachine gun of his own the sharpened steel grated on a rib then went deep the confederate let out a gurgling shriek as he crumpled seeing one of their buddies spitted like a pig made the rest of the confederates quit trying to fight and surrender lets get em out of here lavochkin said get the guns off the tripods and take them too lets get us out of here chester said we woke up the rest of the butternut bustards sure as hell shouts and running feet said the confederates were rallying runnels alertly fired at them that made them hit the dirt they didnt know if he was there by himself or had buddies close by the raiders scrambled out of the nest with captives and booty and hurried back toward the us line a few wild shots sped them on their way but they made it with nothing worse than a sprained ankle and a fat lip from one of the confederates before three men jumped on him intelligence officers took the prisoners away for grilling in the trench from which theyd started out lavochkin eyed chester martin well sergeant he said do i pass so far so good sir chester answered the other half of the test is not doing that kind of shit real often you know what i mean lavochkin scowled at him but slowly nodded george enos thought the josephus daniels was a step down from the townsend as a ship she was smaller and older and slower and more crowded but she seemed a tight ship and a happy one too from what hed seen and heard those two went together almost as often as the cliche claimed hed slept in a hammock on the townsend having to sling one on the josephus daniels was no surprise and no great disappointment he started to make himself at home learning for instance that her sailors hardly ever called her by her last name alone he also found out that josephus daniels had been secretary of the navy during the great war after all the time hed spent on the townsend he still didnt know who townsend was with the ship at the bottom of the gulf of california he wasnt likely to find out now everyone liked the skipper sam carstens craggy face and pale pale hair kept trying to ring a bell in georges mind hed seen carsten somewhere before and not in the navy he kept picturing an oak tree nobody had a good word to say about the exec that was also normal to the point of boredom but people did speak well of the justdeparted pat cooley this zwilling item aint fit to carry cooleys jock said petty officer second class clem thurman who was in charge of the mm gun near the bow whose crew george joined no george said somebody was plainly meant to fuck no thurman spat a stream of tobacco juice into the atlantic cooley was the kind of guy whod find out what you needed and pull strings to get it for you this new one he looks in the book for reasons to tell you no he spat again thats no good george said tell me about it thurman said you ask me this mission were on is no damn good either ireland i got nothin against micksdont get me wrong we give them guns so they can yank on churchills nuts thats great we get our ass shot off tryin to give em gunsthats a whole different story charlie george looked east nothing but ocean ahead there nothing but ocean all around ocean and the rest of the ships in the flotilla none of those ships was a carrier they didnt have even a baby flattop along the cruisers carried scout aircraft but how much good would those do when enemy bombers appeared overhead not enough was the answer that occurred to george yeah well maybe were better off without an escort carrier thurman said when he grumbled about it eighteen knots hell they cant get out of their own wayand if we get jumped thirty airplanes probably wont be enough to stop the limeys especially since most of em wont be fighters no wonder the skipper has us at gunnery practice all the time george said no wonder at all the gun chief agreed course the other thing is he served a gun himself when he was a rating he knows whats going on he seems like a pretty good guy george said bet your ass thurman said hes on our sideand im not just saying that on account of the new exec is a dipshit carsten knows what makes sailors tick he works us pretty hard but thats his job i was in this ship when he took over and the difference is night and day george had been part of a good gun team on the townsend this one could beat it they went through more live ammo than the townsends skipper would have wanted to use sam carstens attitude seemed to be that everything was fine as long as they had enough to fight with when action came they went on watchandwatch a little more than halfway across the atlantic at the point where if they were unlucky enough a british patrol aircraft flying out of limerick or cork might spot them the irish rebels were supposed to be trying to sabotage those patrol flights but who could guess how much luck theyd have now hear this lieutenant zwillings cold unpleasant voice came on the pa system we have a wireless report that one of our submersibles just torpedoed a british destroyer about miles east of here no reports of other british warships afloat in that area that is all sounds good to me petty officer thurman said the gatekeepers gone we hope like hell he is anyway they made the closest approach at night at midnight they lowered a speedboat into the ocean it replaced two lifeboats its skeleton crew consisted of men either from ireland or of irish blood they were making a oneway trip to the emerald isle george passed crates of weapons and ammunition to the crane handlers who lowered them into the speedboat each ship in the flotilla was doing the same thing the irregulars battling the british occupation of their homeland would get a liftif the munitions and men arrived big powerful gasoline engines rumbling and growling the speedboats roared off to the east the josephus daniels turned around and hightailed it back toward the usa the black gang pulled every rev they could out of her engines they wanted to get as far away from the irish coast as they could by the time the sun came up she was slower than the townsend thurman had mocked an escort carriers eighteen knots george wasnt happy with the destroyer escorts twentyfour or twentyfive the townsend broke thirty easy as you please the flotilla stuck together to help with antiaircraft protection with really fast ships it could have got thirty or forty miles closer to home by dawn and if it had maybe the british flying boat wouldnt have spotted it the cruisers scout airplanes went after the big ungainly machine they even shot it down but the damage was done george was sure of that somewhere in the direction of the rising sun armorers were loading explosives onto bombers maybe fighters would come along as escorts if they could fly so far george shuddered remembering the carrierlaunched fighter that shot up his fishing boat waiting was hard hard time stretched like taffy maybe nothing would happen maybe this is the captain sam carsten sounded much more sure of himself on the pa than zwilling did the yranging officer says well have visitors in a bit give them the kind of friendly american welcome they expect do your damnedest boys if we ride out this wave chances are we get past the range where their lowlevel bombers can hit us they may send highaltitude heavies after us but those babies have to be lucky to hit a moving target from three miles up thats all george looked back toward ireland again he felt silly as soon as he did of course the yranging set reached farther than the mark one eyeball it wouldnt be worth much if it didnt but those airplanes with the bluewhitered roundels were on the way at least i can shoot back now george muttered whats that enos petty officer thurman asked when i was a fisherman a limey fighter shot up my boat i was luckyeverything missed me but the son of a bitch killed a couple of my buddies george set a hand on the mms breech this time by god ive got a gun too thurman nodded there you go pay those fuckers back hope so george said dont much like the idea of air attack again though not when my last ship got bombed out from under me the gulf of california had been warm and calm the north atlantic in the latitudes of ireland was rarely calm and never warm if the josephus daniels went down how long could he stay afloat long enough to get picked up he had to hope so well get em thurman sounded confident like a captain a gun chief was supposed to underlings could flabble the guys in charge stayed above all that the josephus daniels built up speed as far as george could judge pretty soon she was going flat out even so the cruisers in the flotilla could have walked away from her and the other destroyer escorts they could have but they didnt george was glad to see them stick around they put a lot of shells in the airand he told himself in what was half coldblooded pragmatism and half shameful hope they made bigger targets than destroyer escorts did bandits within ten miles lieutenant zwilling said over the pa system bearing wont be long now everybody stared back the way theyd come george pointed and yelled there as soon as anybody else and if he could see the enemy airplanes they could see his ship too one of them flew in low and slow straight for the josephus daniels fuck me if that aint a torpedo bomber thurman yelled he swung the twin mm mount around to bear on it weve got to blast the bastard fuck me if its not a twodecker george exclaimed as he passed shells and the gun began to roar which war are we in anyway next to japanese airplanes it seemed downright primitive tracers shot red fiery streaks toward the biplane its what they call a swordfish thurman said looks like a goddamn stringbag dont it but it can do for us if we dont knock it down first they did the swordfishs right wing tilted down and touched a wavetop then the airplane cartwheeled and broke up it never got the chance to launch the torpedo one down thurman shouted exultantly he couldnt be sure his gun had nailed the british torpedo bomber several others were also shooting at it another swordfish this one trailing smoke went into the atlantic but white wakes in the water said some of the slow ugly twodeckers managed to launch their torpedoes the josephus daniels zigzagged as hard as she could george automatically adjusted as the ship heeled first one way then the other he kept passing shells the gun never ran dry after this if there was an after this he would really be part of its crewthis was baptism by total immersion british fighters buzzed overhead like wasps every so often they would swoop down and sting machine guns blazing on their wings george had never got a good look at the one that shot up the sweet sue now he did the fighters seemed much more uptodate than the torpedo bombers he wished they didnt one of them raked the josephus daniels from end to end bullets clanging and whining as they ricocheted off steel and striking home with soft wet thwacks when they met flesh wounded mens shrieks rang through the gunfire petty officer thurman caught two bullets in the chest looking absurdly surprised he flailed his arms a couple of times to try to keep his balance then crumpling he tumbled off the gun mount and splashed into the sea only a puddle of blood said hed ever stood there jesus george said one of the aimers a guy named jorgenson stepped up to take over the twin mm the loader took his place and george stepped into the loaders slot jorgenson screamed at a sailor running by to jerk shells the man started to squawk but then settled down and started doing it the british fighter got away anyhow george had practiced as loader both here and on the townsend he knew what to do and he did it it kept him too busy to see what was going on which might have been a blessing in disguise after a while jorgenson said hold up george did that gave him his first chance in several minutes to raise his head no more airplanes he looked around in dull wonder where did they go back toward ireland he supposed he didnt think theyd come off a british carrier a couple of us ships had fires but they were all still moving with luck theyd get out of range before the next limey strikeif there was onecould come this far with more luck the speedboats had landed their weapons without getting spotted to the brass in the navy department that was the only thing that mattered in a way getting out of richmond was a relief for jake featherston he felt stifled in the concrete bunker under the gray house and in the confederate capital as a whole the damnyankees were clobbering the city with everything they had and they had more than jake ever dreamt they would hed done his best to flatten philadelphia and his best was pretty good but the united states were doing worse in and to richmond in another way though leaving the bunker leaving the capital made him sweat bullets as long as he stayed in the bunker he was safe all the reinforced concrete above his head laughed off even direct hits it had taken several without any damage to speak of once he got down to georgia he felt secure enough but getting there the trouble was you never could tell who was reading your signals even the ones in the codes your cryptographers swore were unbreakable those codes might not be such an ultra enigma to the usa maybe traitors had delivered cipher machines to the enemy maybe the yankees were just better codebreakers than anybody in the csa figured and if they were and if their fighters bounced jakes transport airplane or their bombers hit his trainwell in that case don partridge became president and the confederate states went straight down the crapper but it hadnt happened not this time he was down here talking things over with general patton and the yankees were in georgia not much of georgia but they were over the state line not kentucky not virginia not tennessee georgia theyd never got into georgia in the last war he hated their being here now you want my head sir you can have it i wont say boo patton told him as he had up in richmond i promised id hold chattanooga and i didnt do it its my fault no one elses if you need a head to roll heres mine not without a certain reluctance featherston shook his own head nah who would i get that was better besides could they have run you out unless the paratroopers dropped on lookout mountain and missionary ridge no way in helluh mr president patton said well i didnt reckon so myself jake said all rightthey fooled us once damn them can they do it again not that way anyhow the general answered i didnt think so either jake said if they can were in even worse shape than i figured so your job now is to hold em where theyre at not let em break loose into georgia i understand the need sir patton said i know how important atlantas industry and rail junctions are ill do everything i know how to do with the men ive got i wish i had more youve got everything we can give you tell you the truth youve got more than i can afford to give you featherston said manpowerwell were moving more women into factories and onto farms that frees up some new soldiers anyhow and weve got some new weapons well be trying out here new barrels patton asked eagerly you have no idea how galling it is to see the yankees outgunning and outarmoring us barrels are supposed to be our strength not theirs the new ones are on the drawing boards jake said theyll go into production as soon as we iron out the kinks it wouldve happened sooner but us bombers pounded the crap out of the factories in birmingham and that set us back if the united states werent able to base bombers in kentucky and tennessee they would have had a much harder time bombing a town in alabama featherston couldnt growl too loud about that not when patton had offered his head and hed declined to take it well all right mr president by the way patton said it it wasnt it didnt come close gathering himself the general asked what have you got for us then new rockets these babies can reach way the hell up into tennessee from here maybe even into kentucky jake said they arent real accurate yet but theyll let us shoot at things we havent been able to touch for a while theyre better than bombers thats for surewe dont lose a whole crew of trained men whenever one fails i hope they help patton sounded less delighted than featherston hoped he would most generalsmost officers come to thatwere stickinthemuds jake had seen as much during the great war after he took over hed tried to get rid of as much dead wood as he could but he couldnt retire or shoot the whole confederate officer corps no matter how tempting the idea was he could put patton in his place though whats this i hear about you slapping an enlisted man around yes sir i did that and id damn well do it again patton had the courage of his convictions anyhow the yellow coward wouldnt go forward after a direct order he blathered about combat fatigue what nonsense he spat with magnificent contempt i would have got him moving toohell with me if i wouldntif not for some nearmutineers i hope the yankees killed the lot of them when they overran chattanooga some good would come from the loss in that case general i dont like slackers nobody does but ive seen shellshock some men do break jake said when i took the oath in i promised that soldiers would get a square deal from their officers christ knows i didnt last time around ill give you the benefit of the doubtonce but if i hear about anything like this again youll have dug yourself one goddamn deep hole you got that you always make yourself very plain mr president patton plainly didnt like it too bad jake thought had they promoted him to lieutenant for scenting the negro uprising of he probably never would have become president of the csa the boiling resentment he still felt at being passed over fueled his rise to power a young officer came up to the president and the general saluting nervously the kid said siruh sirsyranging reports yankee airplanes on the way you might want to think about getting under cover in case they decide to unload on us up here near the front yranging jake muttered that was one more place where the usa had the jump on the csa if not for some quiet help from britain the confederacy might still be without it but he nodded to the kid and to patton come on general no phony heroics today the country needs us and wed better stay alive what do you mean phony heroics patton asked as the junior officer led them to a wellreinforced bombproof some men even of high rank are fond of fighting at the front in my opinion that is as it should be not if they throw their lives away to do it jake said we cant afford gestures like that not in the spot were in you dont see me going right up to the front any more do you you reckon i dont want to patton might have wanted to make a comment or two along those lines whatever he wanted he didnt do it featherstons record for fighting up near the front all through the great war spoke for itself and when things were going better hed already served the guns this time around you could say a lot of things about himhe knew the things his enemies did say but the only way you could call him yellow was to lie through your teeth bombs started thudding home a few minutes after jake and patton went to the shelter dirt pattered down between the planks that shored up the ceiling kerosene lamps lit the bombproof their flames wavered and jerked when bombs hit close once the junior officer moved one of them back from the edge of the table on which it sat jake didnt get the feeling he was in any great danger not down here how long you think thisll go on he asked the kid twenty minutes to a half hour sir if its the usual kind of raid theyre trying to wear us down patton said they were doing a pretty damn good job of it too jake held that thought to himself if patton couldnt see it for himself he didnt need to hear it what will the yankees be doing up top featherston asked the youngster maybe some raids to grab prisoners and squeeze them the officer looked unhappy we lost a machinegun nest like that last week but they may just sit tight and let the airplanes pound on us how many do we usually shoot down when they come over like this a few not enough the antiaircraft guns do what they can but we really need fighters to make the enemy pay we need more fighter pilots too patton said some of the kids who get into hound dogs these daysdont have enough practice before they do lets put it that way if they live through their first few missions they learn enough to do all right but a lot of them dont and that costs a man and a machine i know ciphering out what to do about its not so easy though jake said if we slow down the training program the pilots pick up more experience but we dont get em soon enough to do us much good if we rush em theyre still green when they come out like you say general the ones who live do learn sometimes they get killed anyway uh sir the junior officer said the damnyankees just have too many airplanes featherston glared at him he didnt like being reminded of that and since the front had moved south confederate bombers werent hitting us factories so hard the ones out in california and the pacific northwest which the csa could hardly hit at all were also making their weight felt in a war of production the united states had the edgeand they were using it after a little more than half an hour the bombs stopped falling lets get up there and see what the hell they did to us this time jake said theyd turned the area into one of the less pleasant suburbs of hell that was what craters pocked the red earth smoke rose here and there from fires the bombs had set several motorcars lay flipped over onto one side or on their roofs stretcher bearers and ambulances took casualties back to aid stations the wounded men groaned or screamed depending on how badly hurt they were nobody shouted freedom biting his lip featherston said its a bastard isnt it cant fight a war without casualties sir patton said i know that jake said impatientlyhe couldnt let the general think hed found a weak spot but i didnt reckon they could do so much damage so quick what if they did push through after an air raid like that could we stop em he watched patton pick his response with care patton after all was the general whose flank attack through the mountains hadnt driven the usa out of tennessee and kentucky and the general who hadnt held chattanooga when it desperately needed holding sir wed make it mighty warm for them patton said at last that meant he didnt know jake had no trouble reading between the lines if they break out again were in a lot of trouble a lot of trouble you hear me were doing everything we can with what weve got patton said thats the lords truth if you can pull any more rabbits out of your hat id love to have em maybe those rockets you talked about will do some good i hope so but if theres anything bigger i sure want to get my hands on it as quick as i can jake thought of professor fitzbelmont and his team at washington university he could still winthe csa could still winif they got their uranium bomb built faster than the damnyankees did if the usa beat them to that punchwell if that happened a breakout in georgia wouldnt matter any more i may have something for you general but i dont know when yet featherston said when you get it though itll be a humdinger patton looked northwest sir it had better be he said flora blackford smiled whenever she got a letter from joshua that wasnt often enough to suit hertwo a day wouldnt have been enough to suit herbut he did write two or three times a week when he found the chance and wasnt too tired camp pershing was in upstate new york between rochester and syracuse to flora that was the back of beyond joshua liked the weather how hed like it when september turned to november and then to january was liable to be another story he even liked the food in the mess halls which was a truly alarming thought by what flora gathered from his letters they fried everything and let him eat as much as he wanted to an eighteenyearold that made a pretty good start on heaven he wrote about how they were whipping him into shape and how he was stronger and faster than hed ever been they were turning him into the best kind of killer they knew how to manufacture part of flora hated thatshe didnt want him conscripted at all but if he had to wear the greengray uniform shouldnt he be a fit welltrained soldier wouldnt that give him the best chance of coming home in one piece she wished she hadnt thought of it that way she wished she didnt have to think of it that way as a congresswoman as a presidents widow her wishes usually came true not the ones that had to do with joshua not any more he had wishes of his own and the will to thwart her he had them and he used them and she had to pray his enthusiastic patriotism didnt get him killed the next morning someone blew himself up while flora was on her way in to the battered hall where congress met in philadelphia the blast was only a couple of blocks away and made the taxis window rattle gottenyu she exclaimed was that what im afraid it was i think so maam the driver was close to sixty and one of the hands he put on the wheel was a twopronged hook those crazy bastards dont know when to quit you dont even know who it was flora said do i need to he returned whoeverd strap on explosives and push the buttons gotta be nuts right youd hope so but flora wasnt so sure apparently rational coldblooded groups were starting to use people bombs for a very basic reason they worked nothing else disrupted life the way they did every time you got on a bus you looked at all the other passengers wondering if you could spot the one about to martyr himselfor herselffor the sake of a cause and those other people were looking at you wondering if you were that one a mormon unhappy with the truce terms a confederate agent whod got close to somebody jake featherston wanted dead before pushing the button somebody with a personal grievance and access to explosives a genuine nut she wouldnt know till she heard over the wireless or read the answer in the paper she tipped the driver heavily when he dropped her off thank you maam but you dont have to do that he said i didnt do it because i had to i did it because i wanted to she told him he touched the hook to the patentleather brim of his cap mighty kind of you he said and drove off kind flora doubted it shed given him extra money not least because cabs like his saved her from worrying about the other passengers on a bus that was less egalitarian than it should have been but she couldnt make herself feel very guilty about it she didnt want to get blown up and that was that she had to show her id to get into the building before she could get past the entrance hall a burly guard checked her purse and briefcase and a policewoman patted her down by the womans smirk she enjoyed it the way a man might have flora didnt know what could be done about that either nothing probably she hurried to the room where the joint committee on the conduct of the war was meeting several senators and congressmen were already there morning flora one of them said we pounded the uh crud out of atlanta last night if half of what they say on the wireless is true good flora replied about half of what they said on the wireless usually was true you all right the congressman asked you look a little poorly foster stearns was a graniteribbed democrat from new hampshire a reactionary a class enemy and a good fellow one of the things flora had found in congress was that the people on the other side of the aisle didnt have horns and a tail they were just people no worse and no better than socialists and as sincere about what they believed ive been better flora said i heard a people bombim pretty sure thats what it wasgo off when i was coming in oh everybody exclaimed foster stearns pulled out a chair and made her sit down somebodyshe didnt see whogave her a paper cup she took a big swig thinking it was water it turned out to be straight gin and almost went down the wrong pipe she managed to swallow before she had to cough she wasnt used to straight gin right after breakfastor any other time but the swig seemed to help she was less upset afterwards than she had been before more committee members came in they knew about the bomb too took out quite a few folks the miserable son of a bitch one of them said and then excuse me flora its all right flora answered thats not half what i think of him are we all here shall we get started a senator and a congressman asked the same thing at the same time along with everybody else flora looked around the conference room robert taft wasnt there and that meant something was wrong they should have convened five minutes earlier at nine on the dot he was always on time as reliable as the sunrise somebody call his apartment flora said somebody went outside to do that and came back a couple of minutes later his wife says he left fortyfive minutes ago he was walking intrying to lose ten pounds more than one committee member chuckled remembering his rotund father flora knew where taft livedmuch closer to congressional hall than she did and she could make a pretty good guess about how he would have come here when she did she gasped in dismay i hope im wrong she said but what is it congressman stearns asked then he must have drawn his own mental map for he went pale as milk sweet jesus christ you dont think the people bomber got him i dont know she answered but he would have been in about the right place at about the wrong time and the mormons and the confederates both hate him like rat poison the canadians too come to that wed better find out foster stearns and three other committee members said that or something very much like it stearns added we dont even have to adjourn because we never convened come on they all hurried toward the entrance has senator taft come in flora asked the butch policewoman not by this way she answered and he would have flora and the rest of the committee members looked at one another their consternation growing somebody said maybe wed better start calling hospitals philadelphia methodist is closest to where the bomb went off isnt it thats right foster stearns said while flora was still forming the picture in her mind he nodded to the policewoman wheres the nearest telephone we can use down that hallway sir on the lefthand side she pointed she was more polite to him than she had been to flora with a wave of thanks stearns trotted off along with the other committee members flora followed him maybe there would be more than one telephone so they could call several hospitals at once and even if there werent they would hear the news as soon as he got it he was already talking when flora came up you do have casualties there he asked how many have any gone to other hospitals too to the other representatives and senators he said at least a couple of dozen its a bad one he spoke into the handset again is senator taft therehe is how is he this is congressman stearns im on a committee with him he waited someone spoke into his ear flora knew the answer right awayhe looked as if the person on the other end of the line had punched him in the stomach thank you miss he hung up the telephone like a man moving in the grip of a bad dream hes gone isnt he flora said he is stearns nodded dazedly massive internal injuries she said they did everything they could but he spread his hands do they know who the bomber was two or three people asked the same question now stearns shook his head only pieces left the woman at the hospital said it was a man maybe what hes got in his pockets will tell them moreor maybe it wont something flashed through floras mind a story shed read to joshua back when he cared about stories and not springfields pocketses she muttered but the memory wouldnt take any more shape than that whoever did it he hurt us when he did robert was a good friend to his friends and a bad enemy to his enemies he was a stiffnecked old grouch she heard one of her fellow socialists whisper to another that was also true no one whod ever had much to do with robert taft would or could deny it taft had no patience for people who didnt measure up to his own stern notions of rectitude despite wide political differences he and flora had got on well for years beyond any doubt that said something about her they made odd friends the austere ohio aristocrat and the new york garment workers daughter odd but good and now they didnt ill have to go to the funeral she thought she had a black dress that was getting too much wear these days part of that was the wars fault part her own for reaching her fifties no matter how often you told them not to people kept dying on you i think congressman stearns said wed better go back and let some unhappy army officers know were adjourning going on the way taft wanted would have meant convening the committee and raking those bungling officers over the coals flora was sure of that she was just as sure she had no more heart for it than her colleagues did two of the officersa brigadier general and a colonelwere in the conference room when the committee members returned good god the colonel exclaimed when he heard the news he was a son of a bitcheverybody knew thatbut he was our son of a bitch and everybody knew that too his words more pungently echoed floras she kept feeling at the hole losing robert taft left in her spirit it seemed as real and as painful as the hole from a lost tooth in her mouth the dentist gave her codeine after doing his worst to her there was no codeine for a hole in the spirit it would have to hurt till time turned it from an open bleeding wound to a scar before she even knew she was doing it she started to cry so much already lost in this war and she thought about joshuas latest letter shed lost so muchand she still had so much to lose jefferson pinkard thought humble texas was mighty well named it lay twenty miles north of houston and was about the size of snyderthree or four thousand people for a while after the turn of the century humble might have been proud they struck oil there and a lot of people got rich then the mad inflation after the great war wiped out everybodys money rich and poor alike and after that the wells started running dry some of them still pumped but they werent making anybody rich these days lumber from the pine woods around the town helped business keep going humble would just about do jeff decided hed looked at a lot of small towns in southeastern texas and this one seemed best suited to his purposes a railroad ran through it building a spur off the main line would be easy local sheriffs and mexican soldiers had already cleaned most of the negroes out of the area if he had to build a new camp here he could do that hed rather have stayed in snyder but that wouldnt fly much longer who would have thought the united states cared enough about negroes to try to keep the confederates from getting rid of them what business of the damnyankees was it if they wanted to let their blacks live they could do that but they didnt like them well enough to let more from the csa come over their border jeff could see advantages to starting over he could do things the right way from the beginning the bathhouses that werent would go up as an organic part of the camp not as addons he could build a proper crematorium here get rid of the bodies once and for all instead of dumping them into trenches yes it could work it would disrupt routine though to a camp commandant routine was a precious thing routine meant the camp was operating the way it was supposed to when routine broke down that was when you had trouble of course if you looked at it another way routine at camp determination had already broken down damnyankee bombing raids and the us eleventh armys drive toward snyder had ruined it how could you run a proper camp when you werent sure how much population you needed to reduce from one day to the next how could you when you didnt know whether soldiers in greengray would start shelling you soon that hadnt happened yet but jeff knew it could when he talked to the mayor of humble about running up a camp outside of town that worthy said youll use local lumber wont you youll use local labor well sure jeff answered as much as i can anyways sounds good general the mayor said eyeing the wreathed stars on either side of the collar on jeffs uniform pinkard didnt explain about freedom party rankslife was too short the mayor went on once you get this place built reckon youll want to keep some local boys on as guards and some of the older fellas who maybe got hurt the last time around or maybe arent up to marching twentyfive miles a day the mayor himself with a big belly a bald head and a bushy white mustache fell into that last group ill do what i can jeff said if theyve got what it takes ill use em the mayor beamed he thought pinkard had made a promise jeff beamed too he knew damn well he hadnt the mayor stuck out his pudgy hand sounds like we got ourselves a deal he said i hope so jeff said shaking on it still have to clear things with richmond too you understand if you dont understand that you dont understand anything but the mayor did well sure general thats how things work nowadays isnt it he said you want to use my telephone he seemed proud to have one on his desk i sure as hell do pinkard answered he slid the telephone over to his side of the desk but didnt pick up the handset or dial the longdistance operator till the mayor ate humble pie and scurried out of his own office then jeff listened to the inevitable clicks and pops on the line as his call went through and then he listened to the voice of ferdinand koenigs secretary which was sultry enough to fit into any mans wet dream oh yes sir she purred im sure hell speak to you hold on please i thank you kindly it wasnt even that jeff was a week and several hundred miles away from his wife edith could have been standing beside him and he would have been extra polite to a woman with a voice like that koenig here the attorney general of the csa by contrast sounded like a raspy old bullfrog but he had jake featherstons ear so he didnt need to be sexy you find what you were looking for pinkard reckon i did sir im in a little town called humble up north of houston got a railroad line and a spur to a new campd be easy to build mayors damn near wetting his pants he wants it in his back yard so bad humble you say hang on let me look at a map there was a pause while koenig rustled papers jeff listened to him do it he came back on the line all righti found it yeah that looks pretty good yankee bombersd have a devil of a time getting there from anywhere wouldnt they if they wouldnt sir we are really and truly fucked pinkard replied a cold silence followed then the attorney general said you want to watch your mouth ive said that before havent i yeah i reckon you have jeff wasnt eager to kowtow to a voice on the line from richmond no matter how important that voices owner was but wasnt i telling you the truth he used jake featherstons catchphrase with sour relish things dont look so good right now do they maybe not but well lick the damnyankees yet you just see if we dont ferd koenig sounded absolutely confident hope like hell youre right sir jeff meant that can we talk about this humble place some more the biggest advantage he saw to closing down camp determination was purely personal it would let him get his family the hell out of snyder without looking as if they were running away theyd come through every yankee bombing raid so far but how long could they stay lucky long enough he hoped he wondered if koenig felt like raking him over the coals some more but the attorney general backed off yeah lets do that he said reckon itll suit all right then next question is how do we get it built i used niggers to run up camp determination but i dont figure thatd work this time around can i get me a team of army engineers or are they all busy over in tennessee and georgia that jeff could mention the armys being busy in georgia said how badly things were going ferd koenig didnt hesitate youll have em he promised population reduction is a priority by god well take care of this and in jig time too you get ready to finish what youve got going on at camp determination and well run up the camp by humble plansll be about the same as the ones you used before right yes sir except well want the bathhouses built in instead of tacked on if you know what i mean pinkard said and id like a crematorium alongside too more ground in use around herenot so much room for dozers to scrape out the big old trenches wed need dont worry about that ferd koenig said weve got em in place at a couple of other camps designs already taken care of so all weve got to do is run up another one that sounds good i thought so but i wasnt sure jeff said let me write it down so i make sure i have it straight koenig did then read it back that about cover things jeff thought before he answered if hed forgotten something getting it fixed after the engineers left wouldnt be so easy but he couldnt think of anythingand then he did mayor here wants to make sure you hire locals for some of the work oh surewe always take care of shit like that gotta keep those boys happy too the attorney general said indulgently you get ready to move cause this onell go up fastern hell we dont want to pull the engineers off the line any longer than we have to ill handle that sir jeff said you can count on it if i couldnt somebody elsed be there freedom koenig hung up the mayor was plainly worrying about his telephone bill when jeff called him back in jeff wondered if the man had ever called anywhere as far away as virginia he would have bet against it but the mayors face lit up when jeff said well ferd koenig reckons humble will suit us as well as i do some army engineersll come in to run up the camp and then by god then well get down to business thats mighty fine newsmighty fine the mayor said uhyou do recall id like some of our people from around these parts to help do the work ferd says the engineersll take care of that pinkard told him his repeated use of the attorney generals nickname seemed to impress the mayor even more than the nearpromise good news damn good news the mayor reached into his desk and pulled out a bottle and a couple of glasses we ought to have us a drink to celebrate i sure dont mind jeff said the mayors whiskey turned out to be rotgut but jeff didnt flabble it wasnt as if he hadnt drunk rotgut before one drink led to several and to his staying over in humble a night longer than hed intended the mayor offered to get him a girl for the evening but he turned that down he was more practical than virtuous any woman the mayor got him would be a pro and with a pro you never could tell what you were bringing home to your wife that wouldnt be so good especially not with a baby on the way pretty soon he set out across texas for snyder the next morning as usual the sheer size of the state flabbergasted him the drive in the old birmingham felt more like crossing a country even real cities like dallas and fort worth seemed dwarfed by the immensity all around them bomb damage seemed diminished and spread out too he knew the usa had hit both towns hard the year before but he saw only a few battered firescarred buildings west of fort worth woods grew scarcer and the prairie stretched as far as the eye could see every so often jefferson pinkard began to spot shotup motorcars by the side of the road some were merely pocked with bullet holes a couple had bloodstains marring the paint of one door or another a hasty grave was dug beside one of those and some were charred wrecks autos where a bullet had gone through the engine or the gasoline vapors in a mostly empty fuel tank pinkard kept a wary eye on the sky the birmingham had nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide if us fighters or fighterbombers swooped down maybe he could get out and hide in a ditch while they shot up the auto that was his best hope anyhow when he stopped for gas in a little town called cisco the woman who pumped it said reckon youre either mighty brave or mighty damn dumb comin so far in broad daylight i can go faster jeff said yeah but you can end up dead faster too she replied your funeralif you get one jeff remembered the grave next to the motorcar he remembered the bloodstains hed seen too and he stayed in cisco for a roastbeef sandwich and a couple of bottles of beer and waited till twilight deepened to get going again maybe he wasted a few hours maybe he saved his own life he never knew one way or the other crawling along with headlights masked down to slits he didnt get into snyder till not long before dawn he drove with special care in town because craters scarred so many streets you could crash down into one before you saw it but he made it home and found he still had a home to come back to sorry to bother you hon he told edith well be able to clear out go somewhere safer before real long thank you jesus she said and squeezed him tight despite her swollen belly cassius was proud of his new boots they fit him perfectly and the mexican soldier whod worn them before didnt need them any more somebodynapoleonsaid an army marched on its stomach food mattered all right but so did your feet the shoes in which cassius got out of augusta were falling apart so he was glad to get such fine replacements lucky bastard gracchus said his feet were very large and very wide cassius were of ordinary size like the rest of him hed never thought of that as luck before but maybe it was well get you some boss he saidas much of a title as the guerrilla leader would take have to slit em gracchus said morosely the shoes he wore now were slit on either side to make room for his uncooperative feet what that lacked in style it more than made up for in comfort gracchus eyed cassius thoughtfully you know how to drive wish i did cassius shook his head folks never had an auto or nothin though how come want to steal me a pickup truck from somewheres mount a machine gun in the back gracchus said some of the other bands been doin it i hear tell raise all kinds of hell that way aint as good as havin our own barrel but its about as good as a bunch o niggers can hope for about as good as a bunch o niggers can hope for eleven words that spoke volumes about how things were in the confederate states of america crouched in pine woods hoping the whites and mexicans wouldnt put airplanes overhead to hunt for the band and hoping the trees would screen the fires and guerrillas if they did cassius had his own wormseye view of what those words meant he also had his own reasons for wanting to hit back at the freedom party and everyone who stood with it everyone in the csa who wasnt black or as close as made no difference dont know how to drive he said but you bet i do me some fancy shootin if you put me in the back o that truck gracchus chuckled every nigger in the band i talk about this with say the same thing a couple o the gals they say they give me what you aint even got if only i put em back dere cassius hadnt dared approach the handful of women who marched and fought along with gracchus men they were tougher than he was and he knew it the word intimidated probably would have sprung to his fathers mind it didnt occur to cassius he just knew that those gals scared hell out of him where you gonna get a pickup if he thought about the truck he didnt have to think about the women off a farm i reckon gracchus answered damn ofays mostly keepin em locked up tight nowadays though they know what we kin do if we git our hands on one locks didnt usually stop gracchus when he set his mind on whatever lay behind them his scouts didnt need long to find a farm with a pickup truck that would do the farm had a telephone line so the whites there could call for help if guerrillas attacked them gracchus only smiled when he noted that among the tools his irregulars carried were several wire cutters dey kin call all dey please he said it dont go through aint that a shame the guerrillas grinned white teeth shining from dark faces despite those grins they spent a couple of days sizing up the farm before they made their move if the whites brought in riflemen or a machine gun of their own under cover of night they could give raiders a wicked surprise gracchus couldnt afford to get surprised that way after the telephone line was cut he pitched a rock through a farmhouse window to get the attention of the people inside when curses said somebody was awake in there he shouted throw out the keys to your truck an we goes away we dont hurt nobody we jus takes the truck an goes over my dead body the man inside yelled in a lower voice he went on sal call the militia cant get the operator sal said in despairing tones las chance ofay gracchus shouted we kin hotwire the truck if we gotta but we gonna have to shoot you to make sure you dont start shootin your ownself when we takes it away a rifle shot split the night the bullet didnt miss gracchus by much but it missed the guerrillas knew what to do some of them started banging away to make the people inside keep their heads down others cassius among them ran toward the farmhouse he wished he had a helmet to go with his boots but a helmet wouldnt stop a rifle round either the defenders had several firearms if they raised enough of a ruckus someone at a nearby farm might telephone the authorities or go out to get help the guerrillas had to win quickly take the truck with luck kill the whites and disappear before superior force arrived ill shift them fuckers a negro called break me a window an see if i dont cassius was close enough to a window to smash it with the butt of his tredegar had one of the farm family waited on the other side of the glass he would have caught a bullet or a shotgun blast with his teeth that crossed his mind only later he did know enough to get away fast once the stock hit the window a few seconds later a featherston fizz sailed in through the opening hed made he heard it shatter on the floor inside that would spread blazing gasoline in a nice big puddle burn you goddamn ofays he yelled burn in your house an burn in hell flames lit that room from the inside they showed a white man standing in the doorway to see if he could do anything about the fire cassius snapped a shot at him he wasnt the only guerrilla who fired at the white man either the fellow went down either hit or smart enough not to offer a target like that again another featherston fizz flew into the farmhouse cassius liked the idea of roasting whites with a weapon named for the founder of the freedom party hed run into a phrase in a book one timehoist with your own petard he didnt know what a petard was though his father likely would have but he got the sense of it anyhow those fizzes were petarding the devil out of the family in there they stayed in the burning building as long as they could they stayed a lot longer than cassius would have wanted to then they all charged out the back door at once shooting as they came had they made it to the woods they might have escaped but they didnt in the light of the fire behind them they made easy targets an old man in a nightshirt killed a woman with him before he went down another woman hardly more than a girl blew off her own head with a shotgun they had to fear what the negroes would have done with themto themhad they taken them alive and they had reason to fear that revenge came in all kinds of flavors if you could get some with your dungarees around your ankleswell why not it was nothing whites hadnt done to blacks through the centuries of slavery cassius own mother couldnt have been above half negro by blood he himself was lighter than a lot of guerrillas in gracchus band he wasnt light enough to pass for white thoughnot even close in the csa that was as black as you had to be to get reckoned a negro as black as you had to be these days to get shipped off to a camp and have your population reduced lets get outa here gracchus shouted the ofays they see the fire fo sure we oughta stay shoot the bastards when they come somebody said you dumb fuckin nigger you reckon dey think a fire in the middle o the night go an happen all by itself gracchus said scornfully they don jus bring the fire engines they bring the armored cars an the machine guns toobet your ass they do i say get movin i mean get movin no one argued any more cassius did ask we got us the pickup oh hell yes gracchus answered leonidas done drove it off five minutes ago all right by me cassius said i was busy five minutes ago lots of us was the guerrilla leader allowed aint busy now though so git cassius got part of him regretted missing the chance to ambush the whites whod come to the farm familys rescue but he knew gracchus was right who would ambush whom wasnt obvious best not to tempt fate somewhere up in the northwestern part of georgia the stars and stripes already flew in place of the stars and bars sooner or later the yankees would break out into the rest of the state cassius could see that coming all the black guerrillas could if they could stay alive and keep harrying the confederates till the us army arrived if we can do that we win the war cassius thought then he wondered whether winning the war would be worth it what did he have to go back to in augusta nothing his family was gone his apartment not worth living in the rest of the guerrillas were no better off theyd already lost no matter how the war went boss he said as the guerrillas loped away what you want gracchus asked suppose the united states lick jake motherfuckin featherston suppose were still breathin when that happens what the hell we do then dont know about you but i got me a big old bunch of ofays i wants to pay back the guerrilla leader answered reckon thatll keep me busy a while cassius nodded sure enough we can do that for a while but what kind of life we gonna have what kind of country this gonna be cant kill all the damn whiteswouldnt be nobody left then gotta live with em some kinda way but how how we go on knowin what they done to us fuck i dunno i aint never worried about it aint had time to worry about itbeen too worried about stayin alive gracchus said lookin down the roadyou dont want to think too goddamn much you hear what im sayin spend all your time thinkin bout tomorrow you aint gonna live to git there that made some sense but cassius said we aint old or nothin we make it through this goddamn war we got a lot o time ahead of us maybe we go on up to the usa they aint so hard on niggers there thats a factthey aint gracchus said but heres another factthey dont like niggers much neither if they did they woulda let more of us git away when the freedom party first took over but they didnt they closed their border so we had to stay in the csa an take whatever featherstons fuckers done dished out yankees like us bettern they like confederate sojers but it dont go no furthern that he didnt just make some sense therehe made much too much whatre we supposed to do then cassius wanted to wail the question instead it came out as more of a panting grunt it was the sort of thing he would have asked his father when he and scipio werent quarreling his father would have had a good thoughtful answer for it gracchus just shrugged and said we gots to stay alive we gots to hit the ofays till the wars done an go on hittin em afterwards past thathell i dont know nothin past that find out when i gits there if i gits that far the way things were maybe that was a good thoughtful answer if you were someplace where you couldnt make plans didnt trying only waste your time for now what was there besides fighting and taking whatever vengeance you could cassius trotted on he couldnt see anything besides that now himself xviii every time an officer lieutenantcolonel jerry dover didnt know came to the supply dump his stomach started knotting up he kept wondering if someone from intelligence would take him off and do horrible things to him because of melanie leigh every time it didnt happen dover relaxeda little he saw plenty of unfamiliar officers too enough to keep his stomach sour enough to keep him gulping bicarbonate of soda lots of that came to the front given what soldiers ate they needed it some of the new officers he dealt with came from outfits just arrived in northwestern georgia to try to stem the yankee tide others were men in new slots the officers they replaced now being wounded or dead one day a brigadier general showed up and asked you fought in the line in the last war didnt you yes sir dover answered i was only a noncom then though i was a first lieutenant myself said the officer with the wreathed stars weve both got more mileage on us than we used to i have a regimental command slot opencolonel mccandless just stopped some shrapnel with his face and hell be on the shelf for weeks if you want it its yours sir ill take it if you order me to dover answered but i dont think id be better than ordinary in that slot as a supply officer im pretty goddamn good if somebody ordinary replaces me here that might hurt the war effort worse than if you have some different ordinary officer take charge of your regiment the brigadier general studied him wondering if im yellow dover thought the officers eyes found the ribbon for the purple heart above dovers left breast pocket howd you get that he asked a scratch on my arm not worth talking about dover answered maybe the general would have decided he was a liar and a blowhard if he came up with some fancy story of a wound suffered in heroic circumstances his offhand dismissal seemed to satisfy the man stay where you are then dover the brigadier general said youre doing well herei know that and its one of the reasons i thought about you for a combat post but you have a point this work is important to the war effort too and it needs to be done right ill find somebody else for the regiment after the general left dover lit a cigarette he had to stir the butts in the glass ashtray on his cheap desk to make room for it one of the sergeants who helped keep the depot going stuck his head into the tent and asked what was that all about sir like any sergeant worth his stripes he assumed he had the right to know dover saw no reason not to tell him about what youd figure petehe thought about moving me up to the front but he decided i can do more here christ i hope so pete said youre really good at this shit i dont even want to think about how much trouble id have breaking in some new asshole and some of those clowns just never do get whats going on nice to know im a comfortable old asshole dover said and pete laughed dover tossed the sergeant the pack of raleighs thanks pete said even smokes are getting hard to come by the way the damnyankees keep tearing things up between here and atlanta that never happened the last time around did it i dont think so dover answered i dont remember running short anyway he looked north and west his personal worries werent the only ones he had you think we can stop the yankees if they try to break out again reckon wed better pete said dryly they start heading for atlanta we better start trying to see how much theyll let us keep if we quit that was about how dover saw it too careful how you talk he told pete not for the first time lots of people flabbling about defeatism these days yeah well nobodyd be defeatist if we werent getting fucking defeated the sergeant said which was nothing but the truth id almost like to see atlanta fall to tell you the truth just so i could laugh while some of the quartermaster corps fat cats there got it in the neck those cocksuckers have done more to lose us the war than any three yankee generals you can think of you expect me to argue youre preaching to the choir dover said now they use the bad roads and the tornup train tracks for excuses not to send us what we need did i hear right that you told one of the shitheads down there you were gonna send jake featherston a wire about how lousy they were pete asked i said it yeah dover admitted dont know that id do it dont know that it would do any good if i did you ought to by god theyve been getting fat and living soft off army goods since the war started pete said if featherston cant rein em in nobody on gods green earth can i reckon maybe nobody could jerry dover was inclined to believe that which was another reason he hadnt sent the telegram before he could say so airraid sirens started howling somebody clanged on a shell casing with a hammer too which was the emergency substitute for the sirens head for shelter dover said he heard us airplane engines overhead even before he got out of the tent the dugout into which he and pete scrambled was as fancy as any hed known in the great war it had all the comforts of homeif your home happened to be getting bombed maybe they arent after us pete said heres hoping dover agreed northwestern georgia had plenty of targets then explosions started shaking the ground much too close the supply dump was one of those targets something on the ground blew upa roar different from the ones bombs made jerry dover swore he hoped the secondary explosion didnt take too much with it he was as careful with ordnance as he knew how to be he didnt store much of it in any one place and he did build earth revetments around each lot that minimized damage but couldnt stop it another secondary explosion proved as much as if proof were needed dover swore some more a couple of other soldiers in the bombproof laughed as much from nerves as for any other reason a lucky hit and the bombproof might not be it might turn into a tomb sometimes the bastards get lucky thats all pete said i dont want them to get lucky goddammit dover said what if theyre starting the big push now the guys at the front will need everything we can send em and if the damnyankees break through well be the guys at the front pete said that made dover wish he hadnt already used up so much good profanity then instead of cussing he started to laugh himself which made pete send him a fishy stare he still thought it was funny here hed gone and turned down a combat command but he was liable to get one whether he wanted it or not a big explosion sent dirt trickling down between the planks on the shelters roof i hope to god that was one of their bombers crashing pete said me too dover said why dont they go away and bother somebody else he knew why perfectly well that didnt keep him from wishing anyway the bombers stayed overhead for more than two hours that had to mean several waves of them were pounding confederate positions now that the united states had airstrips down in southern tennessee they were only a short hop away and they were making the most of it too after no bombs had fallen for fifteen minutes or so dover said well lets see whats left upstairs he hoped something would be he also hoped he wouldnt come out when a new wave of enemy bombers appeared overhead thatd be just my luck wouldnt it he thought sourly the passage out from the bombproofs outer door had a dogleg to keep blast from getting in it also had several shovels stashed near that outer door in case the men inside needed to dig their way out but jerry dover could see daylight when he got the door open he could see daylight yes he could also see smoke and smell it smoke from burning rubber and explosives and wood and paint and several other things his eyes stung he coughed again and again behind him pete said how bad is it he was coughing too dover wished he were wearing a gas mask he hoped the yankees hadnt blown up any gas shells or he might really need one i dont think its good he answered getting out of the trench was easy a near miss had built a nice convenient ramp if that one had burst a hundred feet to the leftno you didnt have to fight at the front to see combat these days he and pete and the other soldiers hurried up to ground level and looked around fuck pete said softly which summed things up pretty well enemy air strikes had pounded jerry dovers supply dumps before that was part of the cost of doing business in a war he didnt think one of his depots had ever taken a beating like this before though eight or ten fires raged yes one of them was an enemy bombers pyrehe could see the airplanes tail sticking up but the damnyankees had done a lot more damage here than theyd taken doing it hoses were already playing on some of the worst blazes dover felt proud of his men they knew what they had to do and they did it and in doing it they took chances frontline soldiers never had to worry about of course the men at the front had worries of their own pete cocked his head to one side listening firings picked upfuck me if it hasnt dover listened too he said the worst thing he could think of yeah i think youre right theyre trying to break out pete found something bad to say too sure sounds that way dover allowed think they can do it sir any time pete used an officers title he needed reassurance right now dover longed for reassurance too hope to hell they cant a telephone rang he would have bet the bombardment had blown up the instrument or broken the lines that made it work but no he ran over to it and admitted he was there and alive dover youve got to send me everything fast as you can he recognized the voice of the brigadier general whod offered him a regiment theyre coming at me with everything theyve got if you have a divisions worth of dehydrated infantry pour water on em quick and get em up here in spite of everything dover smiled but he had to say sir i dont know what the hell weve got right this second they just bombed hell out of the dump too the generals opinion of that violated all the commandments with the possible exception of the one against graven images were doing all we can dammit but how can we hang on if we dont have enough bullets and shells he said ill get you what i have sir dover slammed down the handset and yelled orders he had to interrupt himself when the telephone rang again dover here he said rockets antibarrel rockets another harried officer screamed in his ear damnyankee armors tearing holes in my lines theyve got these goddamn flail barrels to clear mines and theyre going through us like a dose of salts if we dont stop em quick we are dead meat you hear me fucking dead meat dover didnt know what a flail barrel was he didnt know how many antibarrel rockets had escaped the yankee bombs he didnt even know who was yelling at him he managed to find that out he rapidly figured out one other thing too the united states were pushing hard here if they did break throughif they break through weve lost the damn war for sure dover thought he dashed off to do what he could to stop them signs with skulls and crossbones on them warned the world a minefield lay ahead lieutenant michael pound was pretty sure the signs and the field were genuine when the confederates bluffed they usually slanted the bones and the word mines these stood straight he was a hard charger but he didnt want to tear across that field and blow a track or maybe get the bottom blasted out of his barrel and he didnt have to here comes a flail he said happily ducking down into the turret to relay the news to his gunner and loader and to get on the wireless to the other machines in his platoon hed had to make himself remember to do that when he first became an officer now he did it automatically sergeant mel scullard grinned those bastards sure are funnylooking he said well i wont argue with you pound told the gunner but who gives a damn they do the job and thats what counts some engineer must have been smoking funny cigarettes when he came up with the flail barrel he mounted a rotor drum on a couple of horizontal steel bars out in front of the barrels chassis the barrels engine powered the contraption lengths of heavy chain came off the drum as it rotated the chains spanked the ground ahead of the oncoming machine they hit hard enough to touch off mines before the barrel itself got to them and other barrels could follow the path the flail cleared naturally the confederates did everything they could to blow up flail barrels before they got very far but after the pounding us artillery and aircraft had given the defenders here they couldnt do as much as they wanted to the confederate army remained brave resourceful and resilient it wasnt so responsive as it had been earlier in the war though you could knock it back on its heels and stun it if you hit it hard enough and the usa had done that here follow the flail pound commanded and his driver did they all wanted to get past the minefield as fast as they could the pine woods ahead werent cleared yet that meant they were bound to have confederate soldiersand all too likely confederate barrelslurking in them the other machines in pounds platoon followed him as he followed the flail barrel every commander rode with his head and shoulders out of the cupola the better to see trouble he was proud of them he hadnt ordered them to do it he wouldnt have given an order like that they got out there on their own fires in the woods sent up smudges of smoke there werent enough of them to drive out the lurkers however much pound wished there were if they had an antibarrel cannon waiting they did sensibly they fired at the flail barrel first if they knocked it out all the machines behind it would expose themselves to danger among the mines their ap round scored a direct hiton the flail the gadget fell to ruins but the barrel kept going now it was as vulnerable as any of the others front pound sang outhed seen the muzzle flash to his relief mel scullard sang out identified which meant hed seen it too to the loader he added he with a thrum of hydraulics the turret traversed to the left as it steadied pound ordered the barrel to stop to give the gunner a better shot if the gun in the woods was drawing a bead on him at the same timewell that was the chance you took several cannon spoke at once the antibarrel gun and at least four barrels main armaments an ap round dug a furrow in the dirt a few feet to the right of pounds machine he was surprised it didnt touch off a mine or two the other shells all burst close to the same place in the woods gun it pound yelled to the driver if they hadnt knocked out the gun or wounded the crew more murderous projectiles would come flying out of there stay behind the flail barrel he added a split second later how come the driver asked hes not gonna do any more flailing well no pound said and let it go at that some people werent very bright and you couldnt do anything about it the lead barrels flail might have taken a knockout but it could still show where at least one mine laythe hard way pound wished he hadnt thought thatit might have been a jinx a few seconds later the flail barrel did hit a mine it slewed sideways and stopped its right track blown off it didnt catch fire but it was hideously vulnerable out there the commander traversed his turret till it faced the woods putting as much armor as he could between himself and the enemy past that he had to wait for a recovery vehicle and hope losing the flail barrel left pound in the lead he could have done without the honor but he had it like it or not he got on the wireless to the other barrels in his platoon stay behind me if i make it through you will too and even if i dont you wont have far to go so you may make it anyhow he could see the signs at the far edge of the minefield only a couple of hundred yards to gomaybe a hundred yardsmaybe fiftyit would be a shame to run over one now with the end of the field so close made it he said a great whoop of relief as if all his troubles were over no matter how much he savored the moment he knew better the confederates had a strongpoint up ahead on some high ground called snodgrass hill theyd put a lot of guns up there most of which could fire ap ammo hitting a moving barrel with an artillery piece wasnt easy but horrible things happened when gunners did not even the latest us barrel had a prayer of surviving a tungstentipped mm round pound drove past a couple of burntout hulks that showed as much one of them had the turret blown off and was lying upside down ten feet away from the chassis that wasnt the kind of thing a barrel commander wanted to see much more welcome were the fighterbombers working over snodgrass hill they hit the confederates again and again bombing and strafing two or three of them went down but the fire coming from the hill decreased dramatically couldnt have done that in the last war pound said no sir sergeant scullard agreed but their goddamn foot soldiers wouldnt have been carrying stovepipes then either he sprayed some bushes up ahead with a long burst from the coaxial machine gun if any confederates with antibarrel rockets crouched there they didnt get the chance to fire them machine guns at the base of snodgrass hill held up us infantry barrels painted greengray knocked out the machinegun nests one by one antibarrel cannon farther up the hill knocked out some us barrels michael pound got on the wireless and screamed for artillery support being only a lowly platoon commander he didnt have a set that let him talk directly with the gun bunnies he yelled loud enough to make the soldier he did talk to say keep your hair on pal ill get the word through honest to pete youd better pound said otherwise if they find you mysteriously strangled with telephone wire theyll know just who to suspect on that encouraging note he switched off he couldnt have been the only barrelman yelling for he the barrage didnt land on snodgrass hill fast enough to suit him but it would have had to go in yesterday to do that land it did the lower slopes of the hill went up in smoke and shrapnel and poison gas watching all that come down on the confederates anybody would have thought nothing could stay alive under it pound knew better featherstons fuckers had trenches and they had gas masks and they had balls as soon as things eased off even a little bit theyd pop up and start serving all the guns that werent knocked off their wheels he didnt want that to happenit was the last thing he did want he had no idea if he was the highestranking barrel officer down near the bottom of snodgrass hill he didnt care either he sent his platoon an order barrels didnt hear every day charge a moment later he added and bring everybody else with you if you can lets get them before they get us he stood up in the cupola to wave all the us barrels forward the commanders in his other machines were doing the same thing a short round from his own side burst much too close to his barrel shell fragments whined past his head he turned the wave into an obscene gesture aimed at the artillery hed wanted so badly only a few minutes before you were just as dead if your buddies got you as you were if the bad guys put one between your eyes with a few more barrels of their own the confederates probably could have broken up the charge before it got rolling but they didnt have enough and one of the us barrels killed the first cs machine that showed itself the infantrymen in butternut with stovepipes mostly stayed down in their holes they wanted to live just like anybody else and the charge pounded on before long pound ducked down and closed the cupola hatch by then rounds didnt have to fall short to be dangerous he was brave enough but not suicidal he thought of himself as a coldly practical man whether that kind of man would have led a charge up the heavily defended hill was a question he never worried about both his barrels bow machine gun and the one beside the main armament chattered brass casings clanked down onto the floor of the fighting compartment this is kind of fun you knowlike a pinball arcade sergeant scullard said they pop up here you shoot em then they come up somewhere else so you gotta knock those guys down too i can tell you one difference pound said dryly yeah whats that sir scullard didnt even need to look at what he was doing to feed a new belt of cartridges into the coaxial machine gun in the arcade they dont shoot back pound answered machinegun bullets and shell fragments clattered off the barrels thick steel skin god knows weve been through worse you arent wrong pound agreed they were almost to the top of snodgrass hill now and resistance was thinning out too much had landed on the confederates too fast they were groggy like a boxer whod taken too many rights in the ring the ref would have stopped the fight before the loser got badly hurt hurting the other side was the point of the exercise here pounds barrel rolled over the tube of an overturned even if the confederates drove the usa off this hill theyd never use that gun againor if they tried the first round would blow up inside it wouldnt that be a shame pound thought he looked around for more enemy soldiers to shoot or guns to wreck and he didnt see any he wasnt quite at the crest of the hillwhy give somebody on the far side a clean shot more airplanes appeared he needed a moment to realize they were confederates asskickers with rockets slung under their wings when the dive bombers salvoed them they looked like lances of fire slashing across the sky they tore into the us forces on snodgrass hill like lances of fire too and pound couldnt do a thing about it hed seen a few barrels with acaliber machine gun mounted in front of the commanders cupola to serve as an antiaircraft weapon he didnt have one but he was thinking hed get one as soon as he could the asskickers sped off to the south they couldnt linger or us fighters would hack them down theyd done damage no doubt about it but they hadnt driven us forces off of snodgrass hill they didnt have a chance of doing that not by themselves and no confederate ground counterattack materialized the strongpoint seemed to be the center of the cs position here and it had just fallen clarence potter knew the wintry pleasure of being right the confederates had hit the united states as hard as they could and the usa didnt quite fall over now the united sates were hitting back and they had the csa on the ropes the confederates problem was that theyd kept trying to land haymakers when they should have been doing their damnedest not to get hit he thought of everything his country had squandered on aggressive counterattacks that it should have kept under cover or in reserve if that wasnt enough to drive a man to drink he didnt know what would be if chattanooga had held they still might have had a chance chattanooga was the cork in the bottle us paratroopers had yanked the cork now the damnyankees could spill out into the heart of the confederacy into country that hadnt seen yankee invaders even in the war of secession and the enemy knew it too it didnt do any more to expect us generals to stay half a step behind their opposite numbers in butternut the united states banged through the improvised cs lines in northwestern georgiaoh not with the greatest of ease but not with the kind of effort that ruined them either they could bang some more whenever and wherever they chose to meanwhile general patton was trying to piece together another line this one of necessity was longer than the one centered on snodgrass hill it was also weaker fewer men and barrels were doing their damnedest to cover more ground their damnedest potter feared wouldnt be good enough his own brigade was stationed near calhoun georgia defending the line of the oostanaula and coosawattee rivers he wished the rivers were as wide as their names were long but even if they were how much difference would it make the yankees had crossed the ohio and the cumberland they would be able to deal with obstacles like these right now they werent trying very hard their artillery and his fired at each other across the rivers not a half hour went by when his brigade didnt take at least one casualty replacements trickled in more slowly he would have bet the commander of the us outfit to the north didnt have that worry his stomach started to knot up when general patton paid him a call he feared he knew what patton would want and he was right how soon do you think your brigade can be ready to strike a blow for freedom potter interrupted turning the party slogan into a jeer patton turned red you still dont have the proper attitude potter thats a matter of opinion sir potter replied i dont think we can win the war any more not on the battlefield he thought about u and professor fitzbelmont if the confederacy still had hope it lay there did patton know about uranium bombs potter hoped not he went on seems to me what we ought to do now is try not to lose it on the battlefield youre a defeatist ill report you to the president patton snarled such a threat would have chilled the blood of ninetynine percent of the officers in the confederate army potter yawned in pattons face go ahead he knows how i feel patton stared at him then why doesnt he throw you in irons the way you deserve because he knows i think with my head not with my heart or my balls potter answered its really a useful technique you ought to try it one of these dayssir you can go too far general patton warned watch yourself sir you can do whatever you please to me and i really dont care im clarence potter and im here to tell you the truth potter appropriated president featherstons phrase with malicious glee patton gaped at him smiling a chilly smile potter went on we cant afford the headknocking style youve been using what will it take to make you see that the damnyankees in atlanta in savannah on the ocean in mobile on the gulf of mexico from where i sit youre greasing the skids to get them there how dare you say such a thing to me patton thundered how dare you ill have you courtmartialed and drummed out of the army so help me god i will good luck potter said ive got a stonewall in my pocket that says you cant do it he took out the goldpiece and tossed it up and down worse thing thatll happen is that the presidentll overrule the court and order me back to richmond my bet is hell overrule the court and keep me right here his calm voice must have held conviction patton stood there breathing hard his cheeks a mottled and furious red then suddenly he lashed out and slapped potter in the face while potter was grabbingsuccessfullyfor his glasses patton ground out all right you son of a bitch will you meet me on the field of honor tomorrow morning have you honor one of us will go down in history as a casualty of war and the other will be able to continue the campaign as he thinks best he was dead serious he was also deadly serious his hands hovering near the fancy pistols he wore on each hip he looked readymore than readyto plug potter on the spot replacing his spectacles on his nose potter said as challenged party i believe i have the choice of weapons sir patton actually bowed did he imagine himself a knight in shining armor hadnt he got that idiocy knocked out of him during the great war evidently not for he was courtesy itself as he replied that is correct sir pistols swords rifles at long range if you prefer a contest of skilli am entirely at your disposal in that regard id like to choose horse turds at five paces to show you what a fool you are potter said do not make a mockery of this general i will not abide it patton warned i have challenged you have accepted the weapons must be lethal i just said id like to i didnt say i would potter answered lethal is it all right sir ill give you lethal weapons and see how you like it by the carnivorous smile on pattons face he expected to like it very much then potter said i choose flamethrowers at ten paces general pattons jaw dropped some of the high color left his face you are joking he got out with some effort not me potter said isnt that lethal enough to suit you well both be burnt meat in nothing flat well sir you wanted a duel i goddamn well gave you one do you still want it for a horrible moment he thought patton would say yes his superior might be furious enough to immolate himself if he could take the man he hated with him but patton though his lips drew back from his teeth in a furious grimace shook his head nobody whod ever seen what a flamethrower could do wanted one to do it to him back in gaslight days a moth would sometimes fly into the flame of a lamp that was about what jellied gasoline did to a man then to potters amazement george patton started to laugh by god general you have more spunk than i gave you credit for he admires me potter thought more bemused yet i made myself into a bigger jackass than he did and he admires me for it some of the austrohungarian alienists who were probing the shape of mans psyche would probably have had some interesting things to say about that wearily potter said the united states are the enemy sir youre not and im not either theyre the ones weve got to lickand the ones weve got to keep from licking us well said very well said in a final surreal touch patton bowed again please accept my apologies for the slap and the insult while i was provoked i see now that i was hasty ill let it go but potter had enough of the old code in himand enough prideto go on resenting what patton had done aiming a flamethrower at him would have been a treat it would unfortunately have been a last treat patton perhaps still unnerved made what was for him an astonishing choice he condescended to ask since you seem unhappy with my plans for engaging the yankees general what would you do instead fight for time potter answered at once thinking again of professor fitzbelmont and u how far were he and his crew from building a bomb that could give the csa a fighting chance again and how far were their us counterparts from building a bomb that would end all the confederacys chances you will perhaps understand a campaign needs more detailed goals and objectives than that patton could have sounded snotty in fact he did that was part of his nature but he didnt sound anywhere near as snotty as he might have and potter gave him reluctant credit for it yes sir potter said if you ask me our goal is to keep the yankees out of atlanta we cant afford to lose it partly because of all the factories and partly because its such an important rail junction transit between the east coast and everything from alabama on west goes to hell if atlanta falls and that goes a long way toward losing the war for us objectives would have to do with containing the us advance as close to the georgiatennessee border as we can and driving it back patton said potter shrugged if we can at this stage of things but mostly i want to make the us forces come at us i want to use the defenders advantage for everything its worth i want the united states to have casualty lists three four five times as long as ours theyre bigger than we are but they cant afford that kind of thing forever if they bleed enough maybe theyll get sick of banging their heads against a brick wall and give us a peace we can live with and if we drop uranium bombs on them a year after that itd damn well serve them right he thought would they hit us first i dont know i didnt used to think so now though we may have given them too many reasons not to let us have another chance in your opinion then we cannot hope to win the war on the ground patton spoke like a judge passing sentence potter didnt care sir theyre in georgia doesnt that speak for itself theyre cleaning up the pockets of resistance west of their thrust through kentucky and tennessee too and we havent been able to keep them from doing that between richmond and philadelphia weve stayed even with them in the air everywhere else here for instance you know the answer as well as i do we havent matched their latest barrel yet either were ahead of them in rockets patton said yes sir potter said those will hurt them those have hurt them theyll make us lose slower do you really think they can make us win maybe if we put a u bomb in the nose of one but how much does one of those damn things weigh when will we have a rocket that can get it off the ground in time for this war youd have to be a wildeyed optimist to believe anything like that yours is a counsel of despair patton said i dont want to throw my brigade away charging their guns potter said i want to make them throw their brigades away charging my guns i dont think thats despair where we are now i think its common sense when i give you orders i expect you to obey them when i get orders i expect them to be ones im better off obeying they glared at each other neither had convinced the otherpotter knew that swearing under his breath patton stormed out of potters tent potter wondered what he would do if patton commanded him to go over the river line and attack the enemy ill refuse he decided let him do what he wants after that itll keep the brigade in being a while longer anyhow the orders arrived two hours later potters men were to hold in place patton laid on a counterattack farther west potter sighed patton had grasped the letter not the spirit he didnt know what he could do about that well actually he did know he couldnt do a damn thing guns blazing the counterattack went in it drove us forces back a couple of miles then ran out of steam potter wished hed expected anything different the josephus daniels rode the waves in the north atlanticrode them like a rollercoaster car going up and down ever taller ever steeper bumps george enos took the motion in stride literally as he had no trouble making his way around the destroyer escort despite the roughening seas though not a big warship the josephus daniels made a platform ever so much more stable than the fishing boats that bobbed on the ocean like little corks in a bathtuband sometimes sank as if going down the drain he wasnt worried the josephus daniels would sinknot on her own anyhow she might have help from british french or confederate submersibles though at least she was out of range of british landbased airplanes george had gone through too many attacks from the air both here and in the tropical pacific ever to want to help try to fight off another one were still floating the sailors boasted most of them were kids theyd helped rescue men whose ships had gone to the bottom but theyd never been sunk themselves they were cocky because of it it hadnt happened to them so they were sure it couldnt with the townsend at the bottom of the gulf of california george knew better the water there was shallow maybe one day somebody would salvage her for scrap metal unless someone did shed never see the surface again neither would the men whod died aboard her or who hadnt been able to get off before she went down sam carsten knew better too the captain sometimes talked about how hed been on the remembrance when the japanese sank her that made george wonder if hed seen the skipper in the sandwich islands it seemed logical but he didnt think so the memory if it was a memory felt older than his stint there when he thought of the skipper he thought of boston and not of boston the way it was now either not the boston hed occasionally come back to since joining the navy when he thought of sam carsten he thought of his home town a long time ago back in the days when he was a kid sunshine flashing off the gilded dome of the state house seen from across boston common when that came back to him his mouth fell open in amazement he felt like a man whod just scratched an itch hed thought he would never be able to reach son of a bitch he said softly son of a bitch then he wanted to tell the skipper about it that would have been next to impossible on a battlewagon or an airplane carrier for an able seaman to get an audience with the captain of a ship like that was like getting an audience with god it shouldnt have been that hard on the josephus daniels sam carsten was only a twostriper and a mustang to boot he should have hadhe probably did havea soft spot for the men from whose ranks hed risen he wasnt the problem his exec was lieutenant myron zwilling seemed convinced god himself needed to stand in line to see the skipper as for a mere ratingwell in zwillings mind the question hardly arose but there were ways around the executive officer the skipper was a gunnery fanatic he lavished most of his attention on the two fourinch guns that gave the josephus daniels what little longrange bite she had but he didnt forget the mm mounts either picking a time when carsten seemed a bit less rushed than usual george said ask you something sir whats on your mind enos the captain of a bigger ship wouldnt have known all his men by name but sam carsten did youve been in boston a good many times i expect george said thats a facti told you so once anybody whos been in the navy as long as i have he says he hasnt been in boston a lot hes a damn liar carsten replied yes sir do you remember one time when you were out on the boston common and you went under a tree to get out of the sun george said there was a family having a picnic under therea woman and a boy and a girl this would have beenoh some time around the start of the twenties i was ten eleven maybe twelve does that ring any kind of bell sir sam carstens face went far away as he thought back no he said but then wait a minute maybe damned if it doesnt somebody said something about the ericsson because of what had happened to the destroyer at the end of the great war any navy man who heard about it was likely to remember and when the skipper remembered that it brought everything flooding back to george i did he said i told you my father was on her there was a girl along with you yeah carsten said slowly she was younger than you i think my sister mary jane george said carsten shook his head in slow wonder well if that doesnt prove its a small world ill be damned if i know what would i wanted to get under that tree so i wouldnt burn and your mother was nice enough to let me share it he was almost as fair as a ghost george had seen him blotched with zincoxide ointment several times and it wasnt much paler than his skin no he wouldnt have liked summer sun in boston not one bit andmy mother was a nice person george said nicelooking too i remember that the skipper said would he have tried to pick her up if hed met her without her children had he tried anyhow in some way that went over the kids heads if so hed had no luck he eyed george you say was im sorry if shes not living any more shes not that brought memories back too ones george would sooner have left submerged she took up with the writer who did the book about how she went and shot the confederate submersible skipper bastard drank they would fight and make up you know except the last time they didnt he shot her and then he shot himself jesus the skipper said im sorry that must have been hell it waspretty bad sir george said if he wanted to blow his own brains out fine but why did he have to go and do that to her too carsten set a hand on his shoulder you look for answers to stuff like that you go crazy he did it because he went around the bend what else can you say if he didnt go around the bend he wouldnt have done anything like that i guess so that wasnt much different from the conclusion george had reached himself it made for cold comfort noit made for no comfort at all what he wanted was revenge and he couldnt have it ernie robbed him of it when he turned the gun on himself sure as hell you were right about one thingi did look familiar sam carsten tried to steer him away from his gloom i wouldnt have known you in a million years but you were just a kid then damned if i dont recall that day on the common though how about that he walked down the deck shaking his head so you werent just blowing stack gas when you said you ran into the old man once upon a time petty officer third class jorgenson said he still had charge of the mm mount how about that yeah how about that george agreed i thought so but i couldnt pin it down till now the crew for the gun spent as much time working together as they could because of casualties just about everyone was in a new slot till they figured out how to do what they had little practice doing they would be less efficient than the other gun crews that could endanger the ship because the skipper was a fiend for good gunnery he encouraged them and kept their usual bosses from loading extra duty on them carsten wanted them to spend as much time at the gun as they could they steadily got better fremont dalby would have had some pungent things to say about their performance jorgenson did have pungent things to say about it but they improved the josephus daniels went back to patrolling east of newfoundland the men whod been in her for a while told stories of earlier adventures on that duty if a quarter of what they said was true shed had some lively times the limeys worked harder at smuggling arms into canada than the usa did at smuggling them into ireland canada and newfoundland had a much longer coast than the smaller british isle which gave the enemy more chances to slip through navy department doctrine was that stopping the arms smuggling would snuff out the canadian rebellion the sailors didnt believe it what the fucking canucks cant find any guns of their own my ass jorgenson said when the talk got around to the patrol klaxons hooted that killed a bull session george and jorgenson raced toward the bow they got to their gun in a dead heat the rest of the crew wasnt more than a couple of steps behind them whats going on asked the new shelljerker a big blond kid named ekberg beats me jorgenson answered maybe its a drill he was even bigger than ekberg and almost as fair though neither of them matched the skipper now hear this the pa system crackled to life lieutenant zwillings harsh voice got no sweeter blaring from the speakers yranging gear has picked up an unidentified aircraft approaching from the south exercise caution before opening fire as it may be friendly repeat exercise caution before opening fire as it may be friendly but do not endanger the ship george swore and he wasnt the only one the exec wanted to have his cake and eat it too dont shoot the airplane down but dont let it make an attack run either how was that supposed to work a minute or so later the pa came on again this is the captain sam carsten said the ship comes first if we have to fish some flyboys out of the drink afterwards well do that were trying to find out whos in the airplane but no luck so far if we open up on the wireless we tell everybody in the north atlantic where were at and we dont want to do that see the skipper tells us whats what jorgenson said the exec just bullshits lieutenant cooley he was all right ekberg said this guy thoughyou can keep him damn airplane ought to be one of ours jorgenson said dont see how the limeys couldve snuck a carrier this far west without us knowing he paused course sometimes they fly fighters off their merchantmen one of those assholes carrying a bomb could be real bad news confederate seaplane george suggested jorgenson frowned right at the end of their range they couldnt get home again unless they refuel somewhere the frown turned into a scowl they might do that though maybe the limeys have a station or two on the newfoundland coast we cant keep an eye on everything so yeah maybe whatever it is well find out pretty damn quick he swept the southern sky with a gun commanders binoculars somebody farther astern spotted the airplane first and let out a yell george had a shell in the breech of each gun in the mount he was ready to open up as soon as jorgenson gave the word the gun chief swung the twin mms to bear on the target it is a seaplane he said still peering through the field glasses george felt smart for about fifteen seconds then jorgenson went on its one of ours thats a curtiss sure as shit stand easy boyswere all right dont shoot repeatdo not shoot lieutenant zwilling blared a few seconds later the airplane has been positively identified as nonhostile george needed a moment to translate that into english then he realized the exec said the same thing as jorgenson though not so clearly the seaplane buzzed past the eagle and crossed swords plainly visible on its sides it waggled its wings at the josephus daniels and flew on toward the north nice not to need to fight for a change george said and none of the other sailors at the mount told him he was wrong when a bath meant a quick dip in a creek jonathan moss did what anybody else would he mostly did without sometimes he got too smelly and buggy to stand himself and went in for a little while he came out with his teeth chatteringfall was in the air even in georgia jesus i miss hot water he said yeah no kidding nick cantarella had just taken a brief bath too were both skinny bastards these days you know moss ran a hand along his ribs you mean this isnt a xylophone funny funny like a crutch and youve got more meat on your bones than i do cantarella said not much moss said you started out built like a soda straw and i didnt thats the only difference they both got back into the ragged dungarees and collarless work shirts that would have been the uniform of black guerrillas in the csa had the guerrillas enjoyed anything so fancy as a uniform in one way the only difference between them and the rest of spartacus band was their lighter skin in another you ofays spartacus called he used the word as casually as a white confederate would have used niggers most of the time it meant the confederate whites the guerrillas were fighting but it could mean any white at all too what is it boss jonathan moss asked the band didnt run on anything like military discipline but spartacus fancied his title of respect how come the united states done lost the war of secession you lick them damn confederates then nobody have to worry bout em since moss and cantarella looked at each other any schoolchild in either country knew the answer to that or at least the short version but spartacus and the rest of the blacks with him were never schoolchildren the confederate states always did everything they could to discourage negroes from getting any kind of education they didnt want them to be anything more than beasts of burden with thumbs shall i do the honors or would you rather cantarella asked i can unless youre hot to trot moss said cantarella waved him forward be my guest well the first thing that happened was the confederates had a good general in virginia and we had a lousy one moss said mcclellan was never a match for robert e leenot even close and abe lincoln didnt get rid of mcclellan and put in somebody who knew what he was doing we blame lincoln for a lot and it starts right there he wanted to be good to niggers though spartacus said ofays down here dont reckon so they dont secede in the first place that was probably true from the us viewpoint it was one more thing for which to blame lincoln if someone sensible like douglas had won the electionin that case there wouldnt have been a war of secession in the first place it gets worse moss said lincoln couldnt do anything when england and france recognized the csa after lee beat mcclellan up in pennsylvania neither could anybody else in the united states what difference recognizing the confederate states make spartacus said they there whether they recognized or not after the limeys and frogs recognized them they broke our blockade moss said they had better navies than ours then they shipped the confederates whatever they needed and got cotton back and they could blockade us ports if we didnt make peace with the csa they could and they did nick cantarella put in they ganged up on us again twenty years later after the confederates bought chihuahua and sonora from mexico moss said when we lost the second mexican war thats what made us decide to line up with germany that way we had awhat would you call it nick a counterweight cantarella said there you go moss nodded with germany on our side we had a counterweight to england and france and thats how things have been for the last sixty years how come yall dont let niggers in the usa when things is tough fo us down here spartacus might not know much about what had happened a long time ago but he had that piece of recent history straight chances were every negro in the csa did moss and cantarella eyed each other again they both knew the reason they both feared it would be unpalatable to the negroes around them and they both feared the guerrillas would recognize a lie sighing moss told the truth a lot of whites in the usa dont like negroes much better than whites here do a low hum ran through the guerrillas it was moss judged with more than a little surprise a hum of approval leastways you dont put no sugar on a spoonful o shit was how spartacus put it i dont care if them yankee ofays likes us or not another guerrilla said aint never had no ofays like us dont hardly know what id do ifn they did long as they aint tryin to murder us thatll do fine several other negroes nodded one of them said wish them damnyankeesd come farther down into georgia amen two or three negroes spoke together as if responding to a preacher one of them added thatd be about the onliest thing that could save the niggers down here that or the second coming one dont hold your breath spartacus said dryly well hell i know jesus aint comin the guerrilla said but the damnyankees they might theyre moving again were moving again nick cantarella said i dont think the confederates can stop us from breaking out of our bridgehead south of chattanooga and once were loose in north georgia yeah again the response might almost have come in church they gonna get here soon enough to do us any good spartacus answered his own question with a shrug we gots to las long enough to find out dats all one way the guerrillas survived was by never staying in one place very long mexican soldiers and white militiamen hunted the negroesnot all the time but too often not staying around to be found was simple common sense of course moving had dangers of its own you could walk into trouble as well as away from it but spartacus point man apuleius was as good as anybody jonathan moss ever saw he was as good as anybody cantarella ever saw too put that little soandso in our uniform and he could sneak a division of barrels right on into richmond cantarella said wouldnt be surprised moss agreed or he could anyway if we let negroes join the army yeah well thats horseshit too cantarella said you know smokes can fight and i know smokes can fight and if phillys too goddamn dumb to know smokes can fight then fuck philly you know what im sayin apuleius held up the band outside an abandoned sharecropper village he didnt think it was abandoned somebody in dere he told spartacus after crawling back through the forgotten overgrown vegetable plots around the place how you know spartacus asked looks quiet enough aint no smoke or nothin not now the point man said but sure enough was some not long ago an when i git close i smell me some people aint had no baths in a hell of a long time he kept himself cleaner than most of the other guerrillas moss had thought that was because he was unusually fastidious and had even wondered if he was a fairy now he saw good sense lay behind it if apuleius didnt smell himself he had a better chance of sniffing out other people you reckon they ofays or mexicans spartacus asked likely ofays apuleius answered they stink worse the mexicans they washes when they gits the chance how we gonna smoke em out spartacus suddenly grinned a predatory grin reckon you kin wiggle back close enough to chuck a grenade into the middle o things i kin try the point man didnt sound thrilled but he didnt say no well why dont you wait a bit spartacus said let us set up the machine gun at the edge o the brush then we be ready to give them ofays a proper howdoyoudo the twoman machinegun crew positioned their precious weapon the rest of the guerrillas riflemen all took cover where they could moss hoped the bush he crouched behind wasnt poison oak apuleius worked his way forward again moss presumed he did anyhow were the point man visible to him he would have been visible to whoever was inside the village too moss didnt see the grenade fly either he sure heard it when it went off and all of a sudden that village didnt seem abandoned any more militiamen some in gray uniforms others with clothes no fancier than the guerrillas wore boiled out of the tumbledown shacks that hadnt been anything much when they were in good repair and looked even more sorrowful now the white men were cussing and clutching their weapons and pointing every which way some of those flying fingers aimed at apuleius but others flew in the opposite direction now spartacus said along with the rest of the riflemen in the band moss started shooting at the youths mutilated men and oldtimers who made up the local militia the machine gun spat death at the village death had visited it beforewhere were the sharecroppers who once lived there where were their wives and children gone to camps most of them if they were like most of the negroes in georgia as soon as the gunfire gave him cover apuleius tossed another grenade into the village this one made the militiamen yell and scream even more than they were already doing the kids the ones whod never seen real fighting before suffered worse than the veterans men whod come under fire knew they needed to get down and get behind something when bullets started flying the youngsters stayed upright much too longand paid for it fish in a barrel nick cantarella said happily sprawled behind a bush not far from the one that hid moss a bullet snapped past between them fish dont shoot back moss said one of the militiamen had got his hands on a fancy cs automatic rifle he sprayed bullets back at the guerrillas almost as fiercely as the machine gun fired at his side a couple of negroes howled when they were hit but the noise they made was as nothing beside that from the militiamen caught in the ambush when spartacus ordered a withdrawal the machine gun gave covering fire the militiamen didnt seem to have any stomach for coming after them anyhow were moss one of them he wouldnt have either not after the way they got shot up keep movin spartacus called they be all over the place round these parts now he was sure to be right though moss wasnt sure how many militiamen and mexican soldiers the local authorities could scrape together litter bearers carried one of the wounded men the other shot through the right arm was able to walkand to swear with remarkable fluency moss looked around for apuleius he didnt see the point man but that proved nothing apuleius might need to wait till dark before making his getaway and hed caught up with the band before odds were he could do it again would any of it matter could they hang on till the us army came down here or put the confederates out of business moss had no idea with his scheme for stealing an airplane as dead as too many of the men whod helped him try he could only hope bad one doc eddie called as he brought the casualty into the aid station leonard odoull knew the medic was right even before he saw the casualty when you smelled something that reminded you of a pork roast left too long in the oventhen it was a bad one all right vince donofrio wrinkled his nose christ i hate burns he said me too odoull said but i sure dont hate em near as much as the poor bastard whos got one the wounded man came out of a barrel that much was plain from what was left of his coverall one leg was charred and he was howling like a wolf has he had morphine odoull asked three shots doc eddie answered odoull bit his lip sometimes even the best painkiller was fighting out of its weight eddie went on etherll put him out yeah odoull turned to sergeant donofrio get him under vince right donofrio said tightly the mans hands were burned too and so was his face though not so badly he tried to fight when donofrio put the ether cone over his mouth and nose as gently as eddie could he held the wounded mans arms till they went limp his screams faded then too how much can you do for him doc eddie asked me not much i just want to get rid of the tissue thatd go gangrenous if i left it then the specialists take over that tannicacid treatment they give em donofrio asked thats right odoull said tans their hide scars it fast so they dont weep fluid out through the burns they get better results with it than with anything they used to do tans their hide donofrio shuddered must hurt like hell while the poor guys going through it i bet it does yeah odoull said but if youve got burns like that you already hurt like hell you heard this guy before you knocked him out how many syrettes of morphine did you say he had in him eddie three the medic answered i hear these guys with the burns a lot of em turn into junkies cause they need so much dope to get em through it while its bad ive heard the same thing donofrio said yeah so have i odoull said you cant blame em though if they didnt have the drugs a lot of them would kill themselves there just isnt pain much worse than a bad burn he methodically went on debriding flesh that would never heal the smell made him hungry and nauseous at the same time that was one more reason to hate burns what happened to the rest of the barrel crew he asked dont know for sure eddie said all i know is hes the only one we brought back maybe the other guys all got out and didnt get hurt heres hoping heres hoping odoull agreed his eyes met sergeant donofrios over their masks they both shook their heads much more likely that the other four men in the crew never made it out at all much more likely that they burned to death what kind of memories were now dimmed inside this fellows head would he hear his buddies shrieks for the rest of his life too bad theres no morphine for the soul odoull thought the burned soldier was still mercifully unconscious when the corpsmen took him off for more treatment farther back of the line odoull shed his mask so did vince donofrio that was a tough one donofrio said burns are about as bad as it gets odoull agreed im going outside for a cigarette you want one after a case like that what i want is a good stiff drink i guess a buttll have to do donofrio was another one who didnt drink when he might have to deal with patients soon odoull approved though he wouldnt have said anything as long as the medic didnt show up smashed he pulled out a pack of raleighs gave one to donofrio and lit another for himself after the first drag he said getting away from the smell in there is good too bet your ass donofrio said thats another thing smoke is good for he inhaled held it and then blew out a bluegray cloud even after that he made a face you know what it reminded me of like theres spare ribs in the oven and the telephone rings you know and its the gals sister and she gets to yakking and doesnt look at the clock till she smells stuff burningand then its too damn late that sounds about right odoull said i wonder why they call them spare ribs i bet the pig didnt think so donofrio laughed good one doc i bet i steal it you better not odoull said so seriously that the medic looked surprised he went on youll cut into my royalties if you do royalties donofrio snorted you want royalties go to mexico or france or england sure tell an irishman to go to england for the king odoull said you know how to win friends dont you in a poker game right donofrio could be even loopier than granny mcdougald poker game odoull shook his head he couldnt get the wounded barrelman out of his thoughts that poor son of a bitch sure had the cards stacked against him yeah the medic scowled too one good thinghis face came through pretty good he wont have to go through life like that guy in the bookthe phantom of the catacombs thats what the name of it was you ever see the movie they made from it scared the crap outa me when i was a kid i was grown up by then but i know what you mean odoull said they ought to do a talking version now they have for a lot of the old silents but not that onenot yet anyway who do you suppose theyd get to play the phantom donofrio asked you could put anybody in one of the other parts but the phantom everybody who saw the movie would be comparing him to lon chaney not everybody odoull said the silent versions more than twenty years old now most people younger than you never saw it they would have stopped showing it as soon as talking came along when was the last time you saw a silent movie been a while donofrio admitted after a little thought you dont even worry or wonder about crap like that but it disappears when you arent looking like kaiser bill mustaches you know now its just a few stubborn old farts who wear em but my old man sure had one in the last war everybody did hell i think even my mother did odoull laughed you said iti didnt my mothers a nice lady donofrio said she heard me going on about her like that she wouldnt beat me upmuch a greengray truck pulled up you guys get ready to take your aid station forward the driver said fronts moving up again youre too far behind the line he sounded as if he came from kansas or nebraska all the same odoull said i dont know you from a hole in the ground give me the password confederates in yankee clothing remained a nuisance odoull hoped us soldiers with drawls were also making the enemy sweat ohsequoyah the truck driver couldnt sing worth a damn but that was the opening for a hot new broadway show and the days password he pointed at odoull now give me the countersign or ill figure youre one of featherstons fuckers in disguise fair was fair away we go odoull said dutifully the driver nodded odoull turned to donofrio time to pack up and leave our home sweet home leave my asswe take it with us donofrio said and then with a shrug what the hell its not like we never did it before id rather go forward than back odoull said and the medic nodded as donofrio said theyd had practice knocking down the aid station and it was designed to fit inside the rear compartment of a deuceandahalf military engineering extended to things besides rifles and barrels making aid stations go into the trucks that had to move them fit the bill and the people whod put things together knew what they were doing even the operating table folded up for a smooth fit lets roll the driver said roll they did down past dalton georgia toward resaca odoull and donofrio rode in the cab with the driver eddie and the other corpsmen who gathered casualties stayed in the back of the truck several bodies hung in the dalton town square he shot at soldiers said the placard tied around the neck of one of them the others bore similarly cheery messages they love us down here donofrio said eyeing the bodies who gives a damn if they love us the driver said long as they know they better not screw with us thats all that counts oderint dum metuant an ancient roman playwright had put that into three words let them hate as long as they fear english was a less compact language than latin odoull didnt suppose he could expect a truck driver to match a poets concision wars wreckage littered the landscape burntout barrels from both sides crashed airplanes smashed houses and barns hastily dug graves with helmettopped rifles taking the place of headstones odoull nodded to himself the aid station had got too far behind the front smelling death again reminded him what war was like brakes squealed when the driver stopped smallarms fire came from up ahead this about right the man asked should do odoull answered vince donofrios head bobbed up and down they got out and started setting up what theyd taken down not long before the corpsmen wrestled with canvas and ropes and tent pegs as soon as they had the tent up odoull and donofrio put in the operating table and medical supplies before long the doctor and senior medic were ready for business again eddie and his pals headed up toward the front to see what kind of business they could bring back hope we dont see them for a while odoull said thatd be nice wouldnt it donofrio cocked his head to one side listening to the gunfire up ahead you really think all that shits flying around and nobodys getting hurt no odoull admitted but youre right it would be nice they had a respite of most of an hour that was about how long the corpsmen would have needed to walk up to the fighting find someone wounded and give him emergency first aid and then lug him back to the relocated aid station the first wounded man came back cussing a blue streak a bandage swathed his left hand another one soaked up blood from his left buttock same fucking bullet clipped off a finger and a half and got me in the ass he growled couldve been worse donofrio said couldve been your other hand up yours jack the wounded man told him im a lefty oh for a moment the medic looked as foolish as he sounded sorry how was i supposed to know you coulda kept your goddamn mouth shut lets get you on the table odoull said ill do what i can for your hand and ill see if i can dig out the bullet hot damn so i get to turn the other cheek huh the soldier said odoull winced donofrio reached for the mask attached to the ether cylinder with nothing but relief putting this guy under would shut him up anyway xix rain poured down from a leaden sky off in the distance lightning flashed irving morrell counted hippopotamusesor was it hippopotami whichever he counted twelve of them before the dull boom shook his barrel the stroke was more than two miles away but the rain dammit was here there and everywhere the barrel squelched forward through mud that was starting to look like tomato soup us armor all over northern georgia was squelchingexcept in the places where it was flatout stuck the low ceiling grounded fighterbombers even regular artillery was less accurate in godawful weather like this and shell bursts spent themselves in the mud instead of spreading as they did most of the time dammit we need to keep rolling morrell muttered but how hed broken out of the bridgehead south of chattanooga no way in hell the confederates could drive us forces back into the bottle and pound down the cork but morrell didnt think small he wanted atlanta he wanted it so bad he could taste it he wanted to see jake featherston try to fight a war with the stars and stripes flying over the chief confederate junction between east and west and he thought he could take atlantaas long as his men kept moving kept pushing didnt let up on the bastards in butternut didnt give them a chance to regroup reorganize catch their breath october wasnt listening to him the summer had been drier than usual fall seemed to be making up for it all at once unfair morrell said the enemy couldnt stop him the enemy had a devil of a time even slowing him down why was the weather doing the confederacys dirty work for it dirty work it was plowing through this gunk the command barrel kicked up a bow wave like a destroyer at flank speed but seawater was clean not mixed with mud anyone this bow wave splashed would turn the color of rustif he hadnt already from trying to make his own way through the muck more lightning flashed after a dozen or so hippos thunder boomed the rain came down harder than ever swearing under his breath morrell ducked down into the turret and closed the hatch behind him thank you sir the new gunner said clark ashton had an infectious grin wondered if id have to start bailing there not that wet morrell said though it didnt miss by much frenchy bergeron had shoulder straps with gold bars on them now and a platoon somewhere around here so did michael pound if he hadnt got hurt since morrell saw him last my gunnersa substitute for ocs morrell thought with a wry grin no forty days and forty nights ashton said sure coming down like it if you see a big boat with giraffes and elephants and a guy with a beard you better watch out the ark came down on mount ararat morrell said thats in armenia not georgia the turks and the russians have to worry about it not us thank god isnt there a georgia right next to armenia ashton asked maybe weve floated over from this one to that one maybe youve floated clean out of your skull morrell said the gunner took a seated bow which wasnt easy in the crowded turret morrell rolled his eyes that only made ashton bow again word coming in on the command circuits made morrell do worse than roll his eyes unit after unit reported that it couldnt go forward artillery was bogging down too far behind the line to give any kind of worthwhile support armored cars couldnt leave the roads to scout their tires made them more prone to getting stuck in the mud than barrels or armored personnel carriers even infantry units were having heavy goingand soldiers hated nothing worse than flooded trenches and foxholes at last morrell decided struggling to go forward would cost more than it was worth he ordered all frontline units to hold in place to give the artillery and logistics train a chance to catch up he wanted to be ready to reopen the attack when the rains let upif they ever did you dont think well sink in the mud if we stop here sir ashton asked morrell muttered under his breath that didnt just strike him as possible it struck him as likely he ordered the driver forward till they came to a paved road that also had its drawbacks the barrel was too exposed to make him happy but the curtain of rain drumming down hid the machine almost as well as a smoke screen and he didnt want to have to summon an armored recovery vehicle to rescue him if he did bog down his reputation would be a long time recovering from something like that here we are ashton said the middle of nowhere isnt it lovely this time of year this isnt the middle of nowhere morrell said the gunner raised an eyebrow as if to say he was too wellbred to argue but it sure looked that way to him it isnt morrell insisted where we are right now this has to be the southern end of nowhere down a little farther youve got atlanta and atlantas definitely somewhere clark ashton thought for a bit then nodded somewhere we cant get to right now he said well no thanks for reminding me morrell said when this barrel rolls into atlanta the wars just a long spit from being over ashton listened to the rain pounding on the barrels metal skin seems to me gods got the long spit right now morrell grunted seems that way to me too and i wish to hell it didnt he patted the front pocket of his coveralls and i wish i could have a cigarette good luck sir the gunner said morrells chuckle was distinctly halfhearted he wasnt about to light up inside the turret barrelmen did that every once in a while but you had to be really desperate for a butt to take the chance he would have growled like an angry bear if ashton or the loader smoked in here which meant he couldnt do it himself normally he would have just stood up in the cupola if he wanted a nicotine buzz with water coming down in buckets that wouldnt work either wont kill me to go without he said mournfully and patted that front pocket again how long do you think itll be before we can start advancing again ashton asked laughing morrell said what is it about gunners you guys cant stand not to know about anything can you i dont know about anybody else but i sure cant ashton said tell you what morrell said talk to god if you can make the sun come out and dry up the mud well roll till somebody doeswe wont if god listened to me sir i wouldnt be in a turret with youno offense id be in bed with a blondeor a brunette or a redhead im not a fussy guy any kind of girl would do blonde the loader said if youre gonna ask dont be shy for chrissake with big jugs too he gestured there you go ashton said thatd work for me he glanced over at morrell what about you sir one of these days i wouldnt mind leave to go back to kansas morrell said thats where my wife and daughter are yes sir the gunner said but youre here now and theres plenty of broads around and some of emll put out even if youre a damnyankee i dont need it that bad morrell said agnes isnt fooling around on me back there and i dont feel right about cheating on her ashton and the loader looked at each other he could read their minds though they said not a word poor old guy they had to be thinking if he had more get up and go in him hed nail some of these confederate bitches any which way maybe they were right morrell hoped not but he recognized the possibility a man in his twenties was a hardon with legs a man in his fifties damn well wasnt and never looked or acted more idiotic than when he pretended he was his earphones crackled with a new report sir our forward scouts say theres a confederate buildup centered on map square red have you called artillery in on it morrell asked maneuvering the map so he could see where the devil red was folding and unfolding the damn thing inside the turret reminded him of a crowded flat with laundry drying on lines strung across the front room the square lay south and east of resaca not too far from where he was himself yes sir said the voice on the wireless doesnt seem to be enough to break em up sure could use a spoiling attack well i believe you morrell said havent got a whole lot to spoil with though and this damn rain how much trouble can they cause if they break through there the voice asked morrell looked at the map again he did some more muttering if everything went precisely wrong the confederates could retake resaca that would complicate his life it would mean atlanta wouldnt fall any time soon and it would put him in hot water with the war department where you were only as good as what you did yesterday how big a buildup is it he asked if it was brigade strength maybe even division strength he would put in a spoiling attack he wouldnt just put it in eitherhed lead it himself he knew he couldnt put his hands on anywhere near a divisions worth of men and materiel but he didnt care the confederates wouldnt be so sure of that when barrels came at them out of a curtain of rain wouldnt they think twice before they tried attacking he thought sothey couldnt afford to get too intrepid on the other hand they couldnt afford not to get too intrepid either how did you judge he knew how he judged if they were there in corps strength hed have to receive an attack instead of delivering one that was where he drew the line between aggressiveness and stupidity sir best estimate is division strength said the man at the other end of the wireless connection heighho morrell said lets go he thumbed the transmit button well well see if we can knock em back on their heels out then he started calling the armored and infantry in the neighborhood he wondered if their cos would groan and fuss and flabble and say they couldnt possibly move in this downpour nobody did they wanted to hit the confederates weve been thumping em like a big bass drum from pittsburgh down to here an infantry colonel said lets do it some more clark ashton beamed at him when the command barrel squelched forward frenchy told me to expect action when i rode with you he said he wasnt blowing smoke was he we arent here to give those butternut bastards a big kiss morrell answered were here to blow em to hell and gone and i aim to his scratch force pushed in the confederate pickets with the greatest of ease featherstons men didnt seem to dream that anybody could bring off an attack in weather like this some of them panicked when they found they were wrong barrels loomed up out through the rain morrell called out targets clark ashton hit one after another maybe frenchy bergeron had told him hed better be a good gunner if he was going to get along with his new commander or maybe even the powers that be feared what irving morrell would say and do if they saddled him with a gunner who didnt know his trade the confederates fell back morrell started laughing fit to bust the rain that had helped the csa was helping him instead now the enemy couldnt tell how small his force really was the way the us barrels and soldiers pushed forward they had plenty of weight behind them theyd have to be nuts to push like that if they didnt featherstons men sure they were sane fell back irving morrell just as sure he wasnt laughed and laughed carefully conned by a pilot who knew his way through the minefields the josephus daniels came into new york harbor sailors stood at the rail admiring the tall buildings and boasting of the havoc they would wreak when they got liberty sam carsten remembered leaves of his own when he was a rating from boston all the way to honolulu he fondly recalled the ladywell womanhed visited just before he first met george enos jr and wasnt that a kick in the head funny the kid remembered it after all these years actually enos was no kid any morehe had to be past thirty and how many miles have you got sam asked himself some questions were better left unanswered as usual the pilot knew his business a good thing too since in his line of work your first mistake was much too likely to be your last blowing a ship halfway to the moon would get you talked about and not kindly even if you lived through it we have the first liberty party ready sam asked myron zwilling as the ship approached its assigned quay yes sir the executive officer answered all men with good disciplinary records thats fine for the first party sam said but i want everybody to be able to go ashore unless we get called back to sea sooner than i expect right now yes sir zwilling repeated but he didnt sound happy about it some of them dont deserve the privilege though oh come on sam said nobodys knifed anybody nobodys slugged anybody nobodys got caught cooking hooch there was some illicit alcohol aboard the josephus daniels thered been some aboard every ship in which carsten ever served as long as the chiefs kept things within reasonable bounds as long as nobody showed up at his battle station too toasted to do his job the skipper was inclined to look the other way no ones been caught no by the way the exec pursed his lips he was inclined to act like a revenuer in the hills of west virginia only sams manifest unwillingness to let him held him back but im morally convinced theres a still on this ship and id like to get rid of it as soon as possible well see sam said meanwhile though well do it the way i said aye aye sir zwilling couldnt disobey an obviously legal order no matter how much he wanted to happy sailors poured ashore after the destroyer escort tied up sam went ashore too not to roister but to consult with his superiors we keep getting good reports about you carsten said a captain not much younger than he was sir i deny everything sam said straightfaced the officers in the conference room chuckled one of them sent up smoke signals on his pipe the captain whod spoken before said hows the new executive officer shaping hes brave and hes diligent sir sam believed in getting the good out ahead of anything else but there was more to say and he said it heskind of a stickler for rules and regulations isnt he does that interfere with how well he does his job the captain asked no sir but i had a happier ship with pat cooley in that slot sam answered would you say hes disqualified from command no sir sam left it right there he tried to anyhow the captain asked would you be happy serving under him sam had to answer that one truthfully no matter how little he wanted to no sir he repeated one of the officers who hadnt said anything wrote a note in a little book whose pages were held together by a spiral wire sam hoped he hadnt just murdered lieutenant zwillings career why not the captain asked hell do everything by the book sam replied we need the book its a good thing weve got it but you need to know when to throw it out too he waited to see if they would contradict him when they didnt he went on im afraid he doesnt the officer with the notebook wrote in it again thanks for being frank with us he said sir im not happy about it sam said within his limits hes a solid officer hes plenty bravei already said that hes conscientious he works hardnobody on the ship works harder thats what the exec is for said the captain who did most of the talking well yes sir but over and above that sam said he sticks his nose in everywheresometimes probably when people wish he wouldnt even when somebody who does that is right all the time ratings resent it when he isnt that only makes things worse youre saying lieutenant zwilling sometimes intervenes mistakenly the captain asked he wasnt twisting sams words but he was interpreting them harshly its not too bad sir carsten said its not too good either or you wouldnt be talking about it the captain returned will you tell me im wrong no sir sam said once more lieutenant zwilling wouldnt love himhe knew that but he didnt love his new exec either pat cooley had spoiled him anything else about your ship that we ought to know the captain asked nothing you dont already know about the class sir sam answered shes not fast enough to run from a fight and she doesnt have the guns to win one that made the officer taking notes smile didnt you outfight one of the limeys merchant cruisers he said yes sir but only cause they couldnt shoot straight sam said if theyd hit us a couple of times it would have been all overthe wrong way destroyer escorts do a fine job in the roles for which theyre designed the captain who did most of the talking said primly yes sir carsten agreed for escorting convoys for going after submarinesno problems there but the josephus daniels has done a lot of things shes not designed for too if she keeps doing them her luckll run out one day i know its a busy war im not complainingbut you asked most people would say everything was fine and let it go the captain remarked theyd be afraid of messing up their careers if they popped off sam laughed what have i got to worry about sir im never going to command a cruiser let alone anything bigger either i stay on my ship till the wars over or i get a real destroyer the difference isnt worth flabbling about so i guess i can tell the truth if i feel like it yond carsten has a hard and mustang look the notetaking officer said such men are dangerous that rang a bell in sams mind he had to reach way back to figure out why julius caesar he exclaimed we did that in english the semester before i chucked school and chucked my fathers farm and joined the navy if you still remember you either had a really good teacher or a really bad one the officer said which was it miss brewster was good sam answered i can still quote the start of the canterbury tales too but this isnt a literature class no the other officer saidwistfully but youve told us what we need to know why dont you go enjoy new york city if you cant have a good time here chances are youve got no pulse thank you sir ill do that carsten got to his feet and saluted the captain whod done most of the talking returned the gesture sam left before the assembled officers changed their minds a young lieutenant commander was waiting to go before them next saluting him as he went sam hurried out he flagged a cab where to skipper the driver asked he almost dropped his teethshe was a woman a brassy blonde somewhere around fortyfive but why not if she was pushing a hack a man could do something more closely connected to the war why dont you take me to a show he said something with singing and dancing and pretty girls in it he didnt want to go to a burlesque house and watch strippers well actually he did but he didnt want to run into sailors from his ship when he did it being the skipper had a few drawbacks so he let the lady cab driver take him to broadway instead that was a longer ride and a classier destination than hed had in mind but what the hell the winter garden was a big fancy theater joses hayride the marquee said thisll do it sam asked as he paid the driver pal if this doesnt do it youre dead she answered unconsciously echoing the officer with the notebook quite a few army and navy men were buying tickets which seemed encouraging they cost a fivespot which was either encouraging or appalling depending on how you looked at things a pretty usherette guided sam to his seat he liked the musicwoody butler was one of his favorites the comic had his trademark greasepaint glasses marked on his face he spent most of his time leering at the female lead so did sam the cab driver hadnt been kidding daisy june lee had a beautiful face legs to die for and a balcony that outdid anything in romeo and juliet by the howls and whistles from the audience she was wreaking havoc on every man there sam gave forth with his share and then some she didnt show as much of herself as a stripper would have but what she did show was more worth watching it wasnt one of woody butlers best scores but it was better than most of what the competition put out besides when daisy june lee was on stage the orchestra could have been playing kazoos and bazookas for all sam cared and even when she wasnt the comic with the paintedon spectacles kept him laughing he joined the standing ovation when the show ended when daisy june lee took her bows he hoped she would explode out of her tight top she bowed extra low too as if challenging the laws of gravity that made the applause even louder and more frantic the top of course stayed in place she grinned out at the servicemen she knew what they wanted then the comic came out and made as if to unbutton his shirt he looked wounded unto death when the crowd laughed instead of cheering that only made people laugh louder which made him look more wounded yet sam hated to leave even if he knew perfectly well that daisy june lee was bound to have a boyfriendand even if she didnt she wouldnt give a damn about an overage twostriper a mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven foranother fragment from his lit class ran through his head he waved down another cab in front of the winter garden this driver was a man a man with a hook doing duty for his left hand the one that stayed on the wheel he drove well enough sam tipped him better than he had the woman whod taken him to the theater everything all right he asked lieutenant zwilling when he came aboard the josephus daniels yes sir the exec said youre back sooner than i expected sam shrugged i had a good time except when i was talking about you im afraid you want to see a gal youll never forget go watch joses hayride at the winter garden maybe i will sir by the way zwilling spoke he didnt mean it what did he do for fun anything poor bastard sam thought zwilling probably got his kicks telling other people what to do if that wasnt a deadend street sam had never seen one flora blackford turned on the wireless in the kitchen and waited for it to warm up as the coffee started to perk and she used a spatula to turn the eggs frying in a pan the eggs got done about the time the wireless came on a few seconds later two slices of toast popped up the coffee running behind schedule didnt get dark enough to suit her till shed almost finished breakfast she almost didnt recognize the patriotic song coming out of the wireless the singer and her band didnt seem well matched she was more than good enough in a conventional way the band by contrast did things with syncopation and harmonies nobody else in the usa would have imagined flora paused with a bite of fried egg halfway to her mouth is that she wondered the song ended that was kate smith with god bless the stars and stripes the announcer said backing her is the famous colored combo satchmo and the rhythm aces thought so flora said and got up to pour herself a cup of coffee satchmo and his musicians do bless the stars and stripes the announcer continued laying on the propaganda with a trowel they know too well the bars in the stars and bars stand for the imprisonment of their people well be back with the news on the hour following these important messages please stay tuned those messages were important only to the advertisers who paid for them a soap company a cosmetics company a prominent brand of fountain pens and a cigarette maker that said its products came from the finest tobacco available she didnt know how many letters shed had from constituents in the armed forces complaining about the cigarettes that came with their rations she couldnt do anything about those complaints however much she wanted to us tobacco simply didnt measure up to what the confederates grew and now the news the announcer said once his station finally ran out of commercials us forces report significant advances in northern georgia and western tennessee despite the rainy weather that has slowed operations in recent days the newscaster said our bombers punished atlanta and birmingham in heavy raids on industrial areas damage to both cities is reported to be extensive good flora murmured though she wondered how true the reports were if clouds covered the targets the bombers would drop their loads anywhere they could if the bombs came down on houses instead of factorieswell who lived in the houses people who worked in the factories any which way bombardment hurt the cs war effort farther north our bombers also pounded richmond the newscaster said our losses were light little by little we continue to beat down the enemys air defenses confederate strikes against washington and its environs produced only slight damage no enemy bombers appeared over philadelphia last night as far as flora knew that was true she hadnt heard any sirens they were loud and insistent enough to make sleeping through them almost impossible shed done it once or twice but no more than once or twice significant advances have also taken place in northern arkansas in sequoyah and in western texas where confederate resistance seems to be crumbling the newsman said flora hoped that wasnt intended only to keep listeners happy with good news from a front far enough away that they couldnt easily check up on it the us eleventh army was driving on camp determination now if it fell us propagandists really would have something to crow about and if it fell wouldnt that also mean the freedom party would have a harder time killing off negroes in the csa in an amphibious assault us marines recaptured wake island west of the sandwich islands the newsman said there was no fighting the empire of japan having withdrawn its forces before the marines landed japan no longer holds any us possessions and about time too flora thought that conflict would probably peter out now the way it had a generation earlier one of these days there would have to be a reckoning with japanbut not yet fighting through the fortified islands of the western pacific to reach the enemys homeland was a distinctly unappetizing prospect had japan been able to seize the sandwich islands the usa would have had a devil of a time getting them back the us west coast would have become vulnerable to japanese air raids flora remembered the japanese strike on los angeles during the pacific war the strike that nailed the lid down on the coffin of her husbands reelection hopes japan and the csa could have worked together to cause more trouble in the eastern pacific these days but that wouldnt happen now in foreign news the broadcaster continued the kaisers forces have inflicted a heavy defeat on the russian army east of kiev and it now appears certain that the capital of ukraine will remain in german hands the tsars wireless broadcasts speak of renewing the offensive as the russians find the chanceas close to an admission of failure as we are likely to hear from them floras smile was wry one rule held true in this war everybody lied some countries lied more than othersthe confederate states france and austriahungary came to mind but everyone was guilty of what churchill called terminological inexactitude now and again you couldnt stretch things too far otherwise theyd break and the truth would bite you but you could let your own people down easy and persuade the other side you still had plenty of fight leftwhether you did or not heavy german bombing raids on petrograd minsk and smolensk damaged russian factories and railroad yards in those cities the newsman said and the germans have promised to aid the nationalist uprising in finland and say they will recognize the finnish provisional government as if to counter that german move the tsar is appealing to the russians little brothers in the balkanshis termto rebel against austriahungary whose government he terms unnatural and detested by god in vienna the kingemperor charles was quoted as saying that if god ever hated any regime it was surely russias takes one to know one flora thought yeah and you know em all the schoolyard taunts carried more weight when backed up by millions of men and all the munitions two industrialized countries could turn out in western europe germany claims to have begun the liberation of belgium from british occupation prime minister churchill says this is utter rubbish and claims the british army is merely readjusting its lines time will tell german wireless has warned that if the war continues much longer england france and russia face what the broadcaster termed unprecedented destruction the french governments response is too crude to repeat over the air flora wondered whether the french knew as much as they thought they did germany had split the uranium atom before the united states did the kaiser could call on an impressive array of nuclear physicists the united states were getting close to a uranium bomb wasnt it likely the germans were closer yet how close were the confederate states that was floras biggest worry all she knew was what she heard from franklin roosevelt and the assistant secretary of war knew less than he wished he did flora shook her head roosevelt admitted to knowing less than he wished he did it wasnt the same thing when the newsman started talking about the weather and the football scores flora turned off the set she drank another cup of coffee did the dishes called a cab and went downstairs to wait for it it showed up in about ten minutes which was par for the course the driver held the door open for her congressional hall please flora said as she got in yes maam the man had gray hair and walked with a limp flora couldnt remember the last time shed seen a healthy young man who wasnt in uniform her own son was a healthy young manand now he was in uniform too maybe the csas uranium bomb wasnt her biggest worry after all the cabby knew the shortest way through the maze of bomb damage that still tied up philadelphia in the third autumn of the war flora gave him a big tip for making good time thanks a bunch maam he tipped his cap thank you she said and got out her id to show to the guards at the entrance go on in congresswoman one of them saidbut only after he carefully examined it when would these painstaking inspections relax at the end of the war ever the soldier went on one of the ladies will finish checking you in front of a blast barricade a uniformed woman went through floras handbag and briefcase and patted her down then she said go ahead thank you flora said resignedly she doubted the new security measures would end with the war too many splinter groups would still have causes and people ready to die for them she navigated the maze of drab corridors to her office a good thing no birds flew these hallways she was often tempted to leave a trail of bread crumbs and she couldnt be the only person who was her secretary looked up from the typewriter good morning congresswoman good morning bertha flora let herself into her inner office and closed the door behind her she telephoned franklin roosevelt hes in a meeting congresswoman roosevelts secretary said he should be back in about an hour have him call me when he can please flora had plenty to do while she waited the paperwork never went away and the elves never took care of it when she went home at night and the telephone rang four or five times before it was the assistant secretary of war hello flora roosevelt said whats up today i wondered if you noticed the news item where the germans warned england and france and russia about unprecedented destruction flora said does that mean theyre getting close i missed it roosevelt answered after a thoughtful pause i hope someone close to the project heard it i hope so but i dont know so ill pass it along in case youre wondering we havent heard a word from the germans about this yet i didnt think we had flora said if uranium bombs worked the way the people with slide rules thought they would the postwar world would have two kinds of country in it the ones with those bombs which would be powers and the rest whichwouldnt that reminds meany new word about how the confederates are doing nope i wish there were but there isnt franklin roosevelt said their number one man in this area hasnt gone anywhere hes still right where he was before the war but theyre still working on it well we sure think so they know we arewe found that out they wouldnt just ignore it themselves no they wouldnt i wish they would but no flora said unhappily are they working on it there then the assistant secretary of war paused again dont know he said at last we havent been able to prove it not even close but maybe some people ought to pay a call on them there if they really are its a backwater place not a lot of targets so nobodys gone after it much not a lot of obvious targets i should say we can probably spare some personnel to find out even if the answer is no we remind more confederates that they never should have started this war in the first place yes flora wondered what her question would end up doing to a backwater place somewhere in the csa some people whod passed a quiet war would suddenly discover that hell had decided to picnic on their front lawn she shrugged if that helped keep joshua safe she didnt care cincinnatus driver liked the idea of being in georgia georgia was without a doubt the deep south in kentucky hed been right across the border from the usa foreign ideas easily wafted south people said louisville and covington were the least confederate cities in the csa tennessee reminded him of kentucky though it seemedmore steeped in the stars and bars perhaps but georgiageorgia was something else it was a sign that the united states were really getting somewhere in this war and it was a scary place for a negro in the service of the usa to be ofays here aint gonna catch me he told a couple of the other truck drivers as they ate supper in a halfwrecked house on the outskirts of jasper georgia in the hill country north of atlanta i got one bullet i save for me if im ever in that kind o trouble quick and clean is bettern the other way i guess i can see that hal williamson said white folks around here dont like you one whole hell of a lot do they white folks around here dont like anything thats got anything to do with the usa bruce donovan said before cincinnatus could get mad he added but they especially dont like colored folksthats plain enough yeahours or their own williamson said that made cincinnatus want to start clobbering white georgians with his caneor else to put a clip in his gun and start shooting them he didnt think us authorities would arrest him if he did odds were theyd just take the gun away from him and send him home that had temptations of its own but he thought he did more to hurt the csa by hauling supplies than he would by murdering a few confederate civilians williamson lit a duke then held out the pack to cincinnatus and donovan after he lit up he said stories the negroes tellman theyll curl your hair do jesus cincinnatus said his hair was already as curly as it could be hed seen the same thing in kentucky and tennessee and now georgia us soldiers were a magnet for the surviving negroes in the confederate states they mostly came in by night they hid during the day so white confederates couldnt finish the job of capturing them and sending them to camps or killing them on the spot they were ragged and filthy and skinny some of them starvationskinny they couldnt tell stories about the camps farther south and west except to say that people who went in didnt come out but they could talk about years on the dodge scrounging and stealing and hiding a few talked about whites who protected them for a while those stories relieved cincinnatus hed known some decent whites in covington and didnt want to think the freedom party had turned all white men in the confederate states into devils donovan tossed his ration can into a dark corner of the room the clank it made alarmed all the drivers you never could tell who was lurking in the dark maybe it was a negro looking for a new lease on life from the us invaders or maybe it was a sniper a bypassed soldier in butternut or a civilian with a hunting rifle and a grudge against damnyankees what the hell to cincinnatus relief that half challenge came in unmistakable us accents its just us sorry donovan said also in tones that could only have been forged north of the masondixon line well watch it get your dumb ass shot off if you do shit like that very much for all the soldier knew he was cussing out a general he didnt care donovan sighed he knew hed been careless too he needed a couple of minutes to get back to the subject at hand when he did speak again it was much more quietly some of the colored gals who come in theyre damn goodlooking how come youre so surprised cincinnatus asked a certain edge in his voice he musta figured theyd look like you hal williamson said dryly which deflated him and set them all laughing how many negro women had bruce donovan seen in person before he started driving a truck through the confederate states any cincinnatus had no way of knowing maybe not if he came from a small town in the midwest or the mountains he might have gone his whole life without running into anybody who wasnt the same color he was then donovan and williamson shared a glance that excluded cincinnatus he didnt call them on it but he knew what it meant some of the colored women coming to the us lines were pathetically anxious to make sure the soldiers in greengray didnt turn them back they had ways to persuade that black men didnt several thunderous bulletins about fraternization and vd had already come down from on high when you had to order something more than once it was a sign people werent listening to you soldiers would screw if they got the chance who wouldnt and confederate blacks were more likely to carry the clap and syphilis than whites who would have bothered treating them back in the days before the war even up in covington cincinnatus knew he might easily have got himself a dose if he hadnt married young plenty of guys he knew had what the hell are we going to do with this country once we get done stomping it flat williamson asked as if his fellow drivers had an answer that eluded the president of the united states and the congress in philadelphia everybody white who stays alivell hate our guts all that means is another war as soon as these assholes get back on their feet sure worked that way last time around cincinnatus said anybody sticks his head up and causes trouble we got to kill him simple as that donovan made it sound simple anyhow how does that make us any better than jake featherston williamson asked ill tell you how cincinnatus did have an answer for that if youre black here you dont gotta stick your head up freedom party dont care they want to kill you any which way long as we leave folks who dont cause trouble alone were miles ahead of them bastards miles and miles williamson grunted well youre right about that he pulled out the pack of cigarettes again looked at it and shook his head nah thisll keep i want to grab some shuteye is what i really want to do yeah cincinnatus and donovan both sounded eager cincinnatus always sounded eager for sleep these days he was working harder than he would have in civilian life and he wasnt as young as he had been once upon a time his back wouldnt like sleeping on the floor wrapped in a blanket with a rolledup jacket doing duty for a pillow the rest of him didnt care at all he sank into slumber like a submersible slipping below the surface of the sea and he dove deep it was still dark when he woke for a muzzy moment he thought another thunderstorm was pummeling northern georgia then he realized this was manmade thunder muzzle flashes flickered on the walls of the battered house where he slept the artillery roared and roared and roared again gun bunnies are working overtime hal williamson sounded as drunk with sleep as cincinnatus felt hope they blast the shit outa whatever theyre aimin at cincinnatus waited for some comment from donovan all he heard was a snore he would have thought this barrage loud enough to wake the dead evidently not a few minutes later he was asleep again himself you could get used to damn near anything were the fellow who shook him awake at sunup in the army he would have been a top sergeant the man had a leg gone below the knee and was a couple of years older than cincinnatus so he was a civilian too but he sure as hell acted like a top kick come on you lazy bums he yelled you think the goddamn wars gonna wait for you to get your beauty rest have a heart ray cincinnatus groaneda forlorn hope if ever there was one but hot coffee and real fried eggs resigned him to being conscious what the ration cans called scrambled eggs werent worth eating even if the ham that came with them wasnt too bad where we going williamson asked as he refilled his tin coffee mug southeast also like a good top sergeant ray had all the answers soon as we break out of these fucking chickenshit mountains get out into the flat country the confederates can kiss their sorry ass goodbye they cant stop us now weather can sometimes but they cant we get down into the flat country they wont even slow us down maybe he was right maybe he was wrong it sounded good to cincinnatus any which way the latest depot was only a few hundred yards off he drove his truck over to it soldiers filled the back with heavy wooden crates of artillery ammunition he liked that if they needed more shells farther forward things were going the way they were supposed to he didnt know exactly where the truck convoy was heading all he had to know was that he was going the same way as the truck in front of him he shook his head no one more thing if they got bushwhacked he knew he had to fight back he had plenty of ammo for the piece on the seat beside him but the convoy got through thered been more bushwhacking farther north here the confederates still seemed startled to see yankee invaders cincinnatus feared that wouldnt last long if the confederates could raise hell behind us lines in kentucky and tennessee they could do it here too the gun bunnies were happy to see them even though summer was gone and the day was cool a lot of artillerymen stayed stripped to the waist keep this shit coming buddy said a blond kid with a skullandcrossbones on his left upper arm well blow the whole damn csa to hell and gone sounds good to me cincinnatus answered yeah i bet the youngster said if you could push a button and smash up the country youd do it like that i bet he snapped his fingers you was in my shoes wouldnt you finding a white man who understood what a negro might be feeling always surprised cincinnatus then the gun bunny winked at him bet you can keep a secret he said cincinnatus made a noncommittal noise the artilleryman went on one of my greatgreatgrandfathers was about the color you are maybe were cousins way the hell down the line maybe we are cincinnatus kept his voice neutral as he asked so youre passin then the fellow with the tattoo couldnt have more than onesixteenth negro blood in him less probably since cincinnatus had some white blood in him if the gun bunny hadnt said he was part colored cincinnatus never would have guessed yeah im passing its easier youve got to know that none of my girlfriends ever knewthats for damn sure and besides if the government thought i was a nigger they never would have let me join the army and you know what i want to kick jake featherstons ass just as much as you do more power to you then cincinnatus told him would the artillerymans kids when he had them ever find out they were part negro and would it be good or bad if they didnt some of each probablymost things worked out like that after a moment cincinnatus added i got me a couple of halfchinese grandbabies in des moines how about that countrys turning into a regular zoo the kid grinned cincinnatus grinned back they reached out at the same time and shook hands driving away from the front cincinnatus wondered how many people with a thin streak of negro blood were passing for white in the csa as many as could get away with it he was sure of that acting white instead of black made things easier and more convenient in the united states down here it was a matter of life and death he rolled past a burntout confederate barrel in a field us technicians were salvaging what they could from the machine four hastily dug graves lay nearby cincinnatus nodded to himself death wasnt coming just to negroes in the csa whites were getting their share too good he muttered and drove on jake featherston stared at the situation maps pinned to the wall of his underground office he swore under his breath despite everything george patton could do the abscess in northwestern georgia was bursting and damnyankees were spreading all over the landscape how the hell was the country supposed to hang on to atlanta how the hell was it supposed to go on with the war if it couldnt he swore again he knew the answer to that uranium bombs somehow the confederacy had to stand the gaff till they were ready and to hope like anything the usa didnt get them first got to hang in featherston said softly got to hang on got to a moment later lulu poked her head into the office professor fitzbelmont is here to see you mr president she said and sniffed slightly she didnt know why the tweedy physics professor was so important to the confederate states jake didnt think she did anyhow whenever he put something about the uraniumbomb project in writing he took care of it himself bypassing her security for this couldnt be too tight he wouldnt have let his own shadow know about u if he could have helped it all he said now was thanks send him in henderson v fitzbelmont closed the door behind him he nodded to jake mr president he said and then belatedly uhfreedom freedom jake didnt get angry at the forced way the professor brought out the slogan as he would have with most people he waved him to a chair and asked how are you sir im alive fitzbelmont said wearily as he sat down im alive and im not hurt ive always tried to be a rational man i dont have much use for the idea of miracles things are what they are thats all but if anyone wants to say its a miracle that im here now i wont argue with him i heard lexington got hit hard featherston said sympathetically from all the reports he had lexington had got one nights worth of what richmond took several times a week you see what its like when you come here now youve been through it yourself seeing its one thing going through it the professor shook his head in stunned disbelief how does anybody go through that and stay sane its like anything else professorthe first time it happens its the worst thing in the world but when it happens twenty fifty a hundred times its just something youve got to deal with and go on jake said if they bomb lexington fifty times there wont be anything left henderson fitzbelmont said horror in his eyes theres not a whole lot left now towns been lucky up till now jake remarked off in the blue ridge mountains without much industry to draw enemy bombers lexington had largely escaped the war the president of the csa leaned forward he could think of only one reason bombers would visit lexington how much damage did they do to the project well sir the works werent badly hurt a lot of bombs hit around them but not very many on them fitzbelmont answered thats good news jake meant it from the bottom of his heart the sooner the csa got uranium bombs the betterit couldnt be too soon fitzbelmont raised a warning hand its not so simple mr president i wish it were we lost several men who specialized in enriching the uranium we have and extracting element ninetyfour from itjovium were calling that wait a minute ninetyfour uraniums ninetytwo right what happened to ninetythree jake featherston could no more become a nuclear physicist than a clam could fly but he had a devil of a memory for details element ninetythreesaturnium were calling it right nowdoesnt have an isotope that yields a useful fission product fitzbelmont answered it wont go boom jake featherston translated academese into english it wont go boom the professor looked pained but he nodded and martin collins delancey and dean knew more about isolating jovium than anybody else and the raid killed three of them and left delanceywell maimed he grimaced i saw him afterwards its not pretty jake had seen a great many horrors in his life henderson fitzbelmont probably hadnt he looked a little too young to have fought in the great war chances were he didnt go in for street fighting either how long will he be out featherston asked i dont know yet sir hes lost a leg and a hand fitzbelmont answered he wont be back sooni can tell you that damn jake said fitzbelmont wasnt kidding when he said delanceyd got maimed all right then who are your next best people in lexington who can you bring in from somewhere else the work has to go on even if you take casualties thats part of what wars all about i understand that but physicists are harder to replace than riflemen professor fitzbelmont said stiffly so there featherston thought the professor went on just about everyone in the confederacy who could help is already in lexington there werent very many nuclear physicists here to begin with we might be able to bring in a few men from tulane they wont begin to fill the shoes of the people we lost though the ones i mentioned were only the most important damn featherston said again so that means the yankees sure as hell know where were working on the bomb henderson v fitzbelmont blinked behind his spectacles jake spelled it out for him why the fuck else would they plaster lexington your uranium works is the only thing going on there that matters to the war howunfortunate fitzbelmont muttered tell me about it featherston pointed to the situation map the countrys in trouble professor if anybodys got a chance to save it youre the man whatever you need well give you what i need most is time if you hadnt sent me packing when i first came to you fitzbelmont had nerve to remind jake of his mistakes the president of the csa sighed heavily ask me for something ive got dammit yeah i was wrong there you happy not many people ever heard me say that and you better believe it but i thought you were selling me snake oil can you blame me it sounded too fantastic to be true still does but i reckon it is yes sir it is the united states think so too fitzbelmont said which made jake wince the physicist went on if the yankees hit us once in lexington arent they likely to do it again we may take more damage the next time around ive already pulled four antiaircraft batteries away from richmond and sent em west jake said ive pulled two wings of night fighters too well get hit harder here but we can live with that we cant live without you i didnt want to do anything special about lexington before if we had all kinds of defenses around a noaccount little college town the united statesd be bound to wonder why well now the damnyankees know why so well do everything we can to hold em back thank you mr president fitzbelmont hesitated then asked his question what do you think the odds are not as good as i wish they were featherston wanted to lie but feared the usa would show he was lying in short order we can make hitting lexington expensive for them i know that for a fact i cant promise well keep everything off you how much time would you lose if you packed up and went somewhere else a good deal several weeks anyhowmaybe months henderson v fitzbelmont eyed the map to which jake had pointed besides where would we go that was a much better question than the president wished it were with airstrips in southern tennessee the united states could strike most of the confederate heartland miami houston habana those look like about your three best choices by the expression on fitzbelmonts face he liked none of them neither did jake featherston but he didnt like leaving the facility where it was either the devil and the deep blue sea he thought yet the devil lurked in the deep blue sea us submersibles prowled the confederate coast if they sank a ship with the uranium project aboard they sank the csa too how much of your work can you move underground he asked thatll give the damnyankees a harder time anyhow it will also involve delay but professor fitzbelmont looked thoughtful with reinforced concrete above it perhaps you need concrete ill give you concrete till its coming out your ass jake said and well give the yankees something new to think about pretty soon too may i ask what the professor was starting to get the hang of security normally jake wouldnt have said boo but he needed something to buck up fitzbelmonts spiritsand his own he made the rules he could break them yeah he said weve got us a project down in huntsville too pretty soonany day now matter of factwell be able to fire rockets with a ton of tnt in the nose a couple of hundred miles into yankeeland lets see em try and stop those by god that would help i can see as much how accurate are they they can hit a city they cant hit a city block jake stabbed a finger out at professor fitzbelmont how heavy will your uranium bomb be put one of those in a rocket and itd be the perfect weapon near enough calculations are still theoretical the best estimate is on the close order of ten tons fitzbelmont answered shit jake said feelingly need bigger rockets or smaller bombs which do you reckon i could get first since we dont have any bomb at all yet getting larger rockets would seem easier the professor said makes sense the president of the csa agreed ill tell the boys in huntsville to get on it and pronto damnyankees havent sniffed them out yet so they can work without having the sky fall on em he muttered under his breath only a matter of time probably spies everywhere everywhere i tell you he made himself brighten it wasnt easy wouldnt that be something though a rocket big enough to throw a uranium bomb all the way to san francisco and seattle that would beremarkable fitzbelmont said of course a just peace would be even better i offered the united states a just peace two years ago featherston said angrily his definition of just boiled down to just what i want they wouldnt take it the bastards i figured wed better grind it out of em then on account of they sure aimed to grind it out of us henderson v fitzbelmont started to say something it probably would have been something like look how things are now would they be worse if youd made a softer proposal had he said any such thing jake would have blown up in his face the physicist wasnt so good with people but he saw that all right we are going to win this sucker win it you hear jake growled we are going to lick the yankees right out of their boots lick em by god lick em so they stay licked so we never have to worry about em again it will happen and youll help make it happen thats how its gonna be got it fitzbelmont said the only thing anybody with an ounce of sense would have said yes mr president maybe he meant it maybe he didnt but he said it and he would produce for jake featherston and for the confederate states of america he would produce and the confederate states would win jake looked at the unfortunate situation map then deliberately turned away from the unfortunate situation it portrayed no matter what was going on in northern georgia the confederate states would win the house jefferson pinkard rented in humble texas was one of the finest two or three in town edith and willie and frank liked it fine of course they would have liked a tent in the woods outside of humble almost as well anything that got them away from the yankee air raids on snyder would have looked like paradise on earth to them getting away from snyder looked pretty damn good to jeff too and camp humble looked even better ferd koenig had wanted to call it something fancy camp devastation or maybe camp destruction jeff talked him out of it look he said in a long angry telephone call any nigger who hears hes goin to camp destruction hell know hes got nothin to lose hell be more dangerous than a goddamn rattlesnake theres such a thing as asking for trouble and giving a camp a name like thatwell its the picture in the book he got his way the attorney general grumbled and harumphed but the attorney general was way the hell off in richmond he wouldnt have to live with the consequences of a name like that nohed just blame jeff for the riots and dead guards that sprang from it camp humble nowwhat could sound more harmless and what could be more deadly this camp was done right everything jeff had learned the hard way at camp determination went into camp humble from the start the bathhouses had a bigger capacity than his old ones he had more trucks to help them along and he had a big fancy crematorium set up right at the edge of the camp no more mass graves no sir when camp humble reduced its negro population it would reduce the coons right down to nothing leaves no evidence behind he thought he couldnt do anything about the mass graves outside of snyder now that camp determination was empty and blown to hell and gone he doubted that the confederates would bother trying to hold on to snyder and the territory nearby they needed soldiers even more farther east those graves handed the united states a propaganda victory on a silver platter well too bad they could yell all they wanted it wouldnt make a dimes worth of difference in who won the war he sighed back when he ran up camp determination hed figured it was in a damn good spot so had everybody set above him in the csa that only went to show people werent always as smart as they thought they were yes snyder texas was out at the ass end of the confederacy the damnyankees could reach it anyhow the older smaller camps farther east were still going great guns and now camp humble was too negroes who came in here got dealt with in jig time all the improvements jeff had designed into the new camp paid off camp humble also had a yranging station massive antiaircraft batteries all around it and a fighter wing assigned to help protect it us bombers could get here even if they had to come a long way to do it they wouldnt meet a friendly reception if they tried so far they hadnt tried maybe they didnt know where the new camp was if they didnt they would soon enough you couldnt keep a place this size secret very long but making air raids expensive might be enough to keep them away jeff muttered under his breath over by spencer the csa hadnt been able to make yankee air raids expensive enough the usa battered down cs air defenses and went right on battering till us warplanes dominated the skies that couldnt happen herenot so far inside cs territory pinkard hoped like hell it couldnt anyhow if us airplanes started owning the sky over houston and humble the confederate states were in deep he muttered again by the news filtering out of georgia the confederate states were in deep anyhow that there was news out of georgiano matter how the party and the government tried to keep it quiettold how very deep his country was in a train whistle blew off in the distance jeff kept the window to his office open a little way so he could hear those three blasts whenever they came he intended to go on doing that unless it was snowing outside or something as usual he wanted to know what would happen before it did he still prowled through camp humble with a submachine gun looking for trouble spots before they showed up and when he heard those three toots from the train whistle he still erupted from the office and headed for the unloading point like a jackbooted force of nature guards in gray uniforms hustled to take their places where the spur from the line through humble stopped at the camp some of them led big mean snarling dogscoon hounds they laughingly called them though the german shepherds were nothing like the beasts that went after fourlegged coons come on jeff shouted move your lazy asses anybody who got in position after he did was in trouble and everybody knew it some of the guards the men from the confederate veterans brigades moved slower than their younger counterparts he could put the old farts in the stockade or ship them home but that was about it he could send younger guards straight to the front if they fucked off hed done it too though only twice the train whistled again jeff pinkard was anything but an imaginative man but he couldnt help thinking how mournful that sound was and yetwho would mourn the negroes who went into the bathhouses and the trucks and the crematorium nobody white in the csa that was for damn sure here it came smoke puffing from the stack sparks flew as steel wheels ground against steel rails the engineer knew just what he was doing he stopped the locomotive alongside the flagpole that was his mark and waved to jeff as pinkard waved back the fellow in the tall cap inside the engine took a pint of whiskey out of his coat and swigged from it then he gave a throatcutting gesture and then a thumbsup if he hadnt added the thumbsup jeff would have reported him for drinking on duty and for political unreliability as things were the camp commandant just grinned out out out the guards screamed as they unlocked the crowded cars get moving you stinking rasty niggers form two lines men on the left women and brats on the right when the negroes stumbled out of the cars the guards reinforced the orders with cuffs and kicks a dog leaped forward and bit a woman her shrill scream made the blacks move faster to keep the same thing from happening to them into the camp they went those who could move other negroestrustiescarried and dragged those who couldnt move straight to the trucks the story was that they were going to a clinic some distance from the camp in fact the trucks would go far enough to make sure they were dead then bring them back to the crematorium more trusties these always under the watchful eyes of guards would load the corpses into the fire and that would be that before long the trusties would get it in the neckin the nape of the neck to be preciseand go up in smoke themselves they didnt know that yet they thought they were saving their worthless black hides by going along with the guards but jeff and the others in gray uniforms had plenty of negroes to choose from blacks were flooding into camp humble faster than even this magnificent facility could get rid of them guards and trusties went through the train together pulling out corpses and the live negroes who were either too far gone to come out on their own or were playing dead the bodies went straight to the crematorium the shammers went straight to the trucks one of them saw the wreathed stars on jeffs collar and stretched out his hands in appeal i didnt do nothin suh he said plainly sensing that nothing good was likely to happen to him trusties holding him tight and guards aiming automatic weapons at him gave pretty fair hints you broke a rule jeff said stonily they said come out and you damn well didnt theres a punishment barracks next to the clinic by now he brought out the soothing lies with the greatest of ease you spend some time in there youll learn to behave yourself when you get back here the negro went on squawking but these werent the bad kind of squawks as long as he thought he would be coming back he was willing to go where the trusties were taking himnot eager maybe but willing he would have kicked up all kinds of trouble had he thought he was heading for his last truck ride before long the crematorium went to work the trusties took jewelry and dental gold from the corpses and gave them to the guards keeping any of that stuff sent a trusty into the flames alive so far the guards hadnt caught any of them sticking rings up their ass or anything sooner or later it was bound to happen some people would try to steal no matter what smoke belched from the stacks jeff swore softly the smoke smelled like greasy burnt meat the outfit that ran up the crematorium had sworn on a stack of bibles that the smoke would be clean that youd never know in a million years they were burning bodies lying bastards pinkard muttered yeah some people tried to steal all right no matter what they werent all black either he wrinkled his nose against the stink sometimes halfcharred bits of flesh came flying out of the stacks sucked up along with the hot gases there was a lot more soot than the manufacturers promised too pulling out a notebook jeff scribbled in it before long hed send richmond a nasty letter with luck he could put the companys ass in a sling he did some more muttering he hoped the people back in richmond werent too busy with the war to come down on some not so petty grifters whod grabbed a fat contract by promising more than they could deliver he wondered if he ought to see where he could put mass graves in case the crematorium just didnt work out that would be harder around here than it was around snyder this country was more thickly settled and the ground here was a lot swampier than it was farther west the stink from graves might be even worse than what the crematorium turned out all those bodies might pollute the ground water and start epidemics too he supposed hed have to talk to a doc about that so goddamn many things to worry about but camp humble was up and running even if it had a few rough spots camp determination was nothing but a memory jeff could go home to edith and his stepsons every night proud of what hed accomplished and pretty soon he would have a baby of his own wouldnt that be something one of the guards came up to him sir whats up cromartie jeff tried to know everybodys name cromartie looked shamefaced sir ive got the clap he blurted troop leader mauch said i had to tell you or hed tear off my dick and stuff it up my well he said i had to let you know you fucking idiot jeff said which was exactly cromarties trouble did you catch it here reckon so sir i sure didnt have it before all right get your sorry ass over to the doc hell have some pills for you im gonna gig you three days pay and word of this will go on your record miserably cromartie nodded even more miserably he shuffled away jeff laughed but only quietlyno fool worse than a horny fool the laughter didnt last no matter how well camp humble ran he wished he were still several hundred miles farther west that would have meant the confederacy was winning the war xx abner dowling walked the mayor of snyder texas through what was left of camp determination the mayor was a plump middleaged fellow named jethro gwynn he walked with a limp and a stick hed fought for the csa in the great war you say you didnt know what was going on here dowling growled thats a fact sir gwynn answered all the barbed wire and everythingthey kept people out you know he sounded earnest and persuasive dowling didnt believe him for a minute neither did major angelo toricelli well what did you think was going on when all those trains stopped here people got off those trains thousands and thousands and thousands of them got off nobody ever got on didnt that kind of make you wonder no sir gwynn said blandly all them trains went through snyder sealed up tight couldnt prove by me they had people in em what are we going to do with this lying son of a bitch sir dowlings adjutant demanded here now you got no cause to talk about me like that jethro gwynn said whatever went on here it was none of my damn business and i didnt ask no questions major toricellis hand dropped to his pistol for three cents cash id blow your lying brains out its more than youre worth too nobody who lives in town paid much attention to this place the mayor of snyder insisted it was just here thats all that was too much for general dowling all right mr gwynn he said youre going to come for a little ride with me where are we going gwynn asked sudden apprehension in his voice dont worryits not far dowling answered and even if it were youd be smart to come along i bet if i looked in my pocket i could find three cents for major toricelli his hands folded into fists he wanted to beat the snot out of this texan the kind of urge he hadnt had since his west point days get moving you think youre unhappy now that the united states are here you give me any trouble and youll find out you dont know jack shit about unhappynot yet you dont anyway but you will he must have been persuasive without another word jethro gwynn walked back to the command car that had brought him out from snyder the driver and the other two soldiers waiting in the vehicle glared at him dowling didnt think hed need to give them three cents if the mayor got even a little out of line he could have an unfortunate accident for free take us to that field clancy dowling told the driver you know the one im talking about oh yes sir i sure do clancy said the motor was still running the driver put the command car in gear it rolled along a wellpaved highwaya remarkably wellpaved highway seeing that it ended in the middle of nowhere the wind was blowing from the field dowlings nose wrinkled so did jethro gwynns maybe we dont need to go any further the mayor of snyder said shut up major toricelli said his voice hard and flat i think well keep going dowling said were almost there anyhow eh clancy he gave gwynn a sour stare clancy and i have been here before have you mr mayor no gwynn said christ no i wonder why not dowling said jethro gwynn didnt answer nothing was the best thing he could have said but it wasnt nearly good enough the command car passed through a barbedwire gate a barrel might have flattened to the driver dowling added stop by the closest trenchthe open one yes sir clancy said and he did well lets get out of here and have a look around shall we dowling descended from the command car he waited for the mayor to join him plainly the mayor didnt want to just as plainly the savage expressions the us soldiers wore told him he had no choice looking as glum as a man possibly could he got down too major toricelli followed him come over here god damn you toricelli shoved him toward that trench which hadnt been covered over like the rest take a good look then tell me you didnt know what the hell camp determination was up to please jethro gwynn said but nobody wanted to listen to him feet dragging in the dirt he scuffled his way forward even in october curtains of flies buzzed above the trench crows and ravens and vultures flew away as the men approached but they didnt go far the rations were too good for them to want to leave the stench was overpowering unbelievable it seemed thick enough to make the air resistive to motion dowling knew it would cling to his uniform his skin his hair he also knew he would have to bathe several times to get rid of it go on he said harshly take a good look gwynn gulped how many negroesmen women childrenlay in this trench all bloated and stinking and flyblown and pecked by scavenger birds thousands surely the trench was long and deep and about twothirds full had the confederates not pulled out of camp determination and blown the place up they would have filled the trench with corpses and then scraped out another trench closer to the entrance and started in on that one too theyd set this up very efficiently well dowling said what do you think mr gwynn how do you like it i had no idea the mayor of snyder gasped and then he leaned forward and threw up he was neat about it he missed his shoes wheezing coughing spitting he went on honest to god i didnt you lying sack of shit dowling pointed to the closed trench beyond this open one and then to the next closed trench and then to the next and the next what did you think they were doing here running a hospital i didnt ask any questions gwynn said i didnt want to know that sounds a little more like the truth anywaynot much but a little major toricelli said not enough dowling said nowhere close to enough come on lets go back to the command car can we head back to town the mayor asked eagerly not yet charlie dowling said after they got in he told clancy go on all the way up to the first trench yes sir the driver said again jethro gwynn didnt want to get out this time major toricelli gave him a shove we had to look at this asshole he said you damn well can too bulldozers had scraped off the dirt from part of the first trench the bodies in there were a couple of years old they were mostly bones with rotting clothes and bits of skin and hair here and there halloween in hell might have looked like this theyve been doing it ever since this camp opened up for the last two years or so how many bodies are here all told do you think dowling said and you have the brass to try and tell me you didnt know what was going on god what a shitty excuse for a liar you are what a shitty excuse for a human being toricelli said gwynn puked again he didnt try denying things any more though maybe that was progress and do you know what the best part is major toricelli said once your smokes here were dead the guards had people who went into their mouths with pliers or whatever the hell and yanked out all their gold fillings waste not want not i guess gwynn looked revolted in a new and different way youre making that up nobody would do such a thing its the gods truth mr gwynn abner dowling held up his right hand as if taking an oath so help me we had graves registration people put on gas masks and look at the bodies up close they didnt find any dental gold nonenot a crown not a filling not a bridge nothing what they did find was lots of dead colored people with teeth yanked out or teeth broken to get the gold from them and how do you like that had gwynn looked any greener dowling would have been tempted to mow him the mayor of snyder said i swear on my mothers name general and by our lord jesus christ i never knew nothin about that nothin pulling teeth thatsjust sick he bent over and retched some more this time he had nothing in his stomach to bring up the dry heaves were nasty dowling watched without sympathy till gwynns spasm finally ended so you really did know they were killing off negroes at the camp then he said well i had a pretty good notion they were jethro gwynn admitted in a ragged whisper i didnt ask any questions though none of my business i reckoned you passed by on the other side of the road like the priest in the good book dowling said in a voice like iron by then gwynn was in no shape to quarrel i guess maybe i did ive got one more question for you then ill take you back to town dowling said why dont you like grubbing gold out of negroes mouths once theyre dead they dont need it any more then isnt killing em whats really wrong you know i never looked at it that way the mayor of snyder said seriously i mean theyre just a pack of rebels and troublemakers but this he gulped its different when you see it with your own eyes you liked the idea you didnt want to know what it meant thats all or have you got the nerve to tell me im wrong dowling asked no thats a fact a true fact gwynn said you think about gettin rid of niggers and you think hell countryd be better off without em you dont reckon theyrepeople or anything well what the hell are they then dowling demanded when jethro gwynn didnt answer the question he did it himself theyre dead thats what and i bet the worst of em has a better hope of heaven than you do mr gwynn come on damn you he shoved the mayor of snyder toward the command car gwynn didnt say anything as clancy drove him back to town the us soldier let him off in front of his realestate agency the mayor fled inside and slammed the door behind him as if that would keep dowling and his men from coming back having shown jethro gwynn what camp determination was all about dowling grabbed snyders leading and only banker two attorneys an accountant and a doctor with a happyfor him anyhowafterthought he also grabbed their wives he took them out to the camp together in a deuceandahalf they all denied theyd had any idea what it was doing i thought you might say that he told them the truck driver drove them to the mass graves they turned pale even before the stink started filling the back of the truck all but one of them vomited at the first trench two women fainted so did one of the lawyers the doctor passed out when he heard about taking dental gold from the corpses we ought to bring the whole town through here sir major toricelli said on the way back to snyder by god im tempted dowling said maybe i will his own headquarters were well upwind from the mass grave he bathed and bathed that night and still smelled or thought he smelled the stench of death clinging to him his telephone rang early the next morning the accountant in snyder had shot his wife and three children then turned the pistol on himself another call came in a few minutes later the bankers wife had swallowed rat poison then the telephone rang again mayor gwynn had hanged himself from the chandelier in his realestate office maybe theyve got consciences after all if you kick em hard enough dowling said not altogether without satisfaction who would have imagined that sergeant armstrong grimes hadnt been in the big fight since the confederates came north into ohio he liked fighting on enemy turf much better he liked facing the real enemy much better too utah canadait wasnt that they werent dangerous places his leg still pained him in wet weather like they were having now no the point was that hed got shot in a fight that didnt matter a fight that said nothing about who would win the war lieutenant bassler pointed to a wooded hill in front of hollysprings georgia a nowhere town that never would have mattered to anyone more than five miles away if it didnt lie on a road leading south toward atlanta the confederates are dug in there he said were going to be part of the force that takes the high ground away from them yes sir armstrong said cautiouslyconfederate snipers were loose in front of the hillhe peered forward after ducking down again he added dont hardly see em theyre probably just waiting for us there under the trees afraid youre right the company commander said nothing we can do about it though i hope they pound the crap out of the place before they send us in armstrong said will we have a lot of armor support he assumed theyd have some which wouldnt have been a sure bet in the sideshows where hed fought before they say we will bassler told him maybe theyre blowing smoke up my ass but i dont think so softeningup is supposed to start tomorrow at we go in two hours later yes sir armstrong repeated he probably wouldnt have slept late tomorrow anyhow but now he knew damn well he wouldnt he took the news back to his squad the men greeted it with the enthusiasm hed expected hot shit squidface said featherstons fuckers get another chance to blow my dick off just what ive been waiting foryeah you bet i wish one of these confederate broads would blow my dick off woody said the other soldiers laughed then they went back to studying the hill they might not be strategists but theyd learned tactics the hard way cal henderson summed it up taking that place out is liable to be expensive as shit if theyre laying for us under those pines air bursts lots of air bursts squidface said armstrong found himself nodding you could fuse a shell so it went off as soon as it touched anything at alla branch for instance air bursts like that slashed the ground below with fragments unless you were in a bunker dug into a trench wall youd catch hell grab as many zs as you can now armstrong said artillery opens the show at five tomorrow morning we go in a couple of hours later no he didnt get much sleep himself having nerves was sillyhe couldnt do anything about whatever would happen soonbut he did all the same because he was awake at least as much as he was asleep through the night he heard barrels rattling up to the start line under cover of darkness lieutenant bassler had got that right anyhow the bombardment started at five on the dot star shells lit up the hill bright as day highaltitude bombers droned overhead dropped loads of death and kept on going theyd blast atlanta or some other cs town then fly north and land after dawn let them see what they were doing confederate artillery woke up in a hurry quite a few shells fell on the us front line but none dangerously close to armstrongs squad the men huddled in their foxholes and waited for the brass whistles and the shouts that would send them forward it was getting light when us fighterbombers zoomed in to put the finishing touches on the preliminaries armstrong was glad to see them they could hit targets the highaltitude airplanes were too likely to miss boy whitey yelled theyre beating the holy bejesus out of that place arent they heres hoping armstrong said several soldiers nodded at that they were like the guys hed fought beside in utah theyd been through the mill they knew it was no damn good and wouldnt get any better and they kept going anyway he didnt have anybody just out of the reppledepple in his squad though the company carried several replacements he took another look at that hill by the time they got to the top of it he feared the squad would need some new men he hoped to hell it wouldnt need a new sergeant engines roaring us barrels clattered forward lieutenant basslers whistle shrilled lets go the company commander shouted keep your heads down dont bunch up and ill see you when we get there he made a good leader for a frontline outfit he always sounded confident and he didnt send his men anywhere he wouldnt go himself armstrong feared they were going into a meat grinder now sometimes that came with the job he didnt like it but he couldnt help it mortar bombs started falling as soon as the us barrels and soldiers began to advance screams followed some of the bursts medics scooped up the wounded and carried them back to the rear other bursts sounded curiously subdued they didnt throw many fragments armstrong knew what that meant swearing he shouted theyre heaving gas at us and put on his mask one more annoyance one more inconvenience in a war that seemed full of nothing else but a bullet cracked past him about bellybutton high he was flat on his belly in the muddy grass before he knew how hed got therereflexes really did take over in time of danger a moment later he got up and started running again dodging like a star halfback in a professional league another bullet missed him by not nearly enough he hit the dirt again this time he spotted the muzzle flash there he yelled pointing toward a foxhole just in front of the edge of the trees with several us soldiers shooting in his direction the confederate took his life in his hands whenever he popped up to fire the men in greengray worked their way closer to the foxhole one of them shouted for him to give up he answered with a burst from his automatic rifle a shriek said he wounded someone but two grenades flew into the hole after that he didnt fire any more other confederates farther back did armstrong was glad when he got in among the trees himself he had plenty of cover then from upright trunks and from those the us bombardment had knocked over not least because of all the havoc the shells and bombs had wreaked the woods smelled powerfully of pine the fresh clean spicy scent made an odd backdrop for the brutal firefight that went on under the trees armstrong ran past a young confederate he thought was surely deadthe man had stopped a couple of fragments with his belly and another with his chest but the soldier in butternut groaned and moved and almost scared armstrong out of a years growth crouching beside him armstrong asked how bad is it im done yankee the enemy soldier answered gasping against the pain blood ran from his mouth and nose you want morphine armstrong said ill give you some already got it the kid had to be younger than armstrong himself and armstrong was only twenty after another gasp the confederate said dont help much armstrong believed him nothing would help much not with those wounds that led to another question shall i finish you or yell for the medics im done told you that the soldier took as deep a breath as he could get it over with no blame on you ill thank you for it all right then one quick round did the trick armstrong hoped somebody on either side would do the job for him if he ever needed it as bad as this kid did he hurried on leaving the corpse where it lay the confederates had several machinegun nests with interlocking fields of fire on the forward slope you couldnt approach one without exposing yourself to fire from another the shelling and bombing hadnt hurt them they were made of cement not sandbags a soldier with a flamethrower tried to deal with one of them but a bullet to the fuel tank drenched him in the fire he hoped to shoot that was a bad way to go the stench of burnt meat made armstrongs stomach heave then two barrels ground close enough to shell a confederate bunker after three or four hits the guns inside stopped shooting back careful armstrong yelled when us soldiers started moving forward again they might be playing possum they werent but lieutenant bassler thumped him on the back for worrying about it the barrels methodically smashed three more machinegun nests then one of them hit a mine and threw a track while a confederate with a stovepipe rocket set the other one on fire one last concrete emplacement went on hurling death at the men in greengray two us soldiers with captured confederate automatic rifles sprayed bullets back the machine guns focused on them which was what the men with the automatic rifles had in mind while they kept the confederates inside the emplacement busy another soldier with a flamethrower crept toward it a jet of golden fire spat from the nozzle of his infernal device it shot through the narrow concrete slit that let the machine guns traverse armstrong heard screams from inside they didnt last long he got another whiff of that charredpork smell as he loped past the machinegun nest it was dead now and so were the men inside it up till then the confederates resisted fiercely after the last bunker fell the spirit seemed to go out of the soldiers in butternut instead of dying in place or falling back to fight again from another position more and more of them tried to surrender some succeeded and went to the rear with hands high and with broad grins of relief on their faces others ran into us soldiers in a vengeful mood or just without the time or manpower to bother with prisoners armstrong trotted past a confederate soldier out in the open who looked to have got shot while trying to give up that was too bad if he ever found himself in a mess like this he hoped the men on the other side would let him yield but not a damn thing in war came with a moneyback guarantee he made it to the top of the hill before he quite realized he was there a couple of mortar teams were launching bombs at hollysprings to announce that the hill had changed hands a lieutenant from another company in the regiment was yelling for men to go on and take the town after the fight on the hill nobody looked thrilled about rushing into another big one right away you made it sarge there was squidface smoking a duke some confederate wouldnt need any more he held out the pack to armstrong without being asked thanks armstrong took one and leaned close to get it started he sucked in smoke then blew it out it eased the worst of his nerves anyhow yeah im still here looked like they started to lose it a little bit once we took out their machine guns uhhuh i thought so too squidface said dont hardly see that with these butternut bastards say what you want about em they fight hard maybe they see the writing on the wall armstrong said wouldnt that be something he tried to imagine jake featherston giving up the picture didnt want to form neither did one of the united states accepting anything less than unconditional surrender and full occupation of the confederacy artillery shells screamed in from the south armstrong hit the dirt and started digging sure as hell the confederates hadnt quit yet cassius relaxed in a hut that had once belonged to a sharecropper the roof leaked the mattress was ancient and musty he didnt much care right this minute nobody seemed to be hunting gracchus guerrilla band with the damnyankees pounding toward atlanta central georgia had more urgent things to worry about than a few blacks with stolen guns not being dogged wherever he went felt wonderful to cassius gracchus by contrast was insulted they reckons we dont count fo nothin the guerrilla leader grumbled gots to show em we does ought to lay up for a while first that wasnt cassius it was a scarred veteran named pyrrhus rest and relax while we can gracchus shook his head they shippin all kinds o shit up toward the noth we hit some o dat make it harder fo featherston to fight the yankees we get hit make it harder for us to fight anybody pyrrhus said you dont got the nerve you kin stay where yous at gracchus told him the older negro refused to rise to the bait got me plenty o nerve an everybody knows it got me some sense too an you sure aint showin none only way we live through this is if the yankees come cassius said yankees stay away sooner or later the militia an the mexicans hunt us down an kill us if we can help the usa we oughta do it hear dat gracchus said this is one smart nigger you dont want to listen to me listen to him you reckon he smart on account of he say the same thing you do that aint reason enough pyrrhus answered united statesre comin whether we do anything or not you reckon they get down into georgia on account o what niggers done wish it was so but it aint likely gracchus scowled at him so did cassius it wasnt likely at all another negro said sure enough wouldnt mind a little restup anyways at that gracchus looked almost ready to explode cassius caught the guerrilla leaders eye and shook his head ever so slightly if gracchus blew up now he could split the band where would they come by new recruits to make either half big enough to be dangerous if that happened negroes were thin on the ground in rural georgia these days to cassius relief gracchus got the message or enough of it to keep from losing his temper he went on glowering at the men whod thwarted him but at least he had the sense to see he was thwarted for the time being we lay up he said reluctantly we lay up fo now anyways but if we sees a chance we takes it fair enough pyrrhus said some of the other black guerrillas nodded all seeming relieved the quarrel wouldnt explode in their faces they didnt live off the fat of the land the land had little fat to live off white farmers had armed guards some had squads of mexican soldiers garrisoned on their land the henhouses and barns might have been bank vaults before too long the guerrillas would have to raid to eat birdlime and nets brought in songbirds cassius had never imagined eating robins and doves but they werent bad at all my granddaddy he used to talk about all the passenger pigeons when he was a pickaninny gracchus said way he told it you could eat them birds fo weeks at a time where they at now pyrrhus asked sure dont see em around none po birds got their fuckin population reduced gracchus answered might as well be niggers two nights later a negro sneaked out of madison georgia the town closest to the tumbledown sharecropping village with word that a truck convoy had stopped there for the night and would go on to the northwest in the morning you aint goin back gracchus said you comin wid us you lyin you dyin give me a gun i want a shot at the ofays my ownself the negro replied i gives you a gun gracchus said i gives you one after we gits away you kin shoot the ofays then you dont trust me none said the town negro whose name was jeroboam bet your ass i dont gracchus said i dont know you from a cowflop aint got no reason to trust youyet but you give me one we git on fine jeroboam knew the road that led to the front like a lot of rural roads it was badly potholed moneyd gone into guns and barrels and murder camps and main highways not the roads that meandered between them one of those potholes let the guerrillas plant explosives without digging under the roadbed from the side which would have taken longer and been much too conspicuous once done gracchus placed his men in the high grass and bushes to either side of the road southeast of the bomb the csa had too much to do to bother clearing weeds either with any luck at all the white confederates would pay for their neglect jeroboam lay in the bushes only a couple of strides from gracchus he was bound and gagged nothing he did or said would warn the men in the approaching truck convoyif there was an approaching truck convoy he hadnt squawked when gracchus told him what they were going to do cassius hoped that argued he was truthful if it didnt it argued that he was a good actor with autumn here fewer bugs bothered cassius than would have a few months earlier he scratched anyway he knew he was lousy the only thing he had to kill lice was kerosene a cure almost worse than the problem hed always been clean his mother was neat his father downright fastidious now they were almost surely dead and he had nasty little bugs crawling over his scalp heads up somebody called cassius flattened himself into the grass why did people say that when they meant duck down he supposed it came from football or some other game then catching the low rumble of approaching trucks he stopped worrying about things that didnt matter how much protection did they have with them if four or five armored cars and halftracks were in the convoy the plan was to blow up the lead vehicle and then just slip away getting into an expensive skirmish was the last thing gracchus wanted closercloserthe machine in front was a truck it was in fact a captured us truckblockier than cs modelswith a coat of butternut paint slapped on over the original greengray gracchus had the plunger whose wires led to the explosives in the roadway he jerked down on it at just the right moment the truck went up in a fireball that engulfed the one behind it which was following too close the other trucks in the convoy slammed on the brakes as soon as they did cassius and the rest of the black guerrillas started shooting hed never fired a rifle till he joined gracchus band he sure knew what to do with one now he fired again and again working the bolt on the tredegar and slapping in a fresh clip when the one he was using ran dry the rifle butt slammed against his shoulder again and again hed be sore tomorrowassuming he was still alive the drivers had rifles and submachine guns of their own and started shooting back and then cassius heard an unmistakable machine gun banging away and ice walked through him that sure sounded as if it came from a weapon most likely to be mounted on an armored vehicle he hoped the guerrillas had some featherston fizzes but getting close enough to throw one could prove more dangerous to the man with it than to his intended target and then he heard something else a deep rumble from the northwest rising swiftly to multiple screams in the air yankee fighterbombers had spotted the convoy with the burning trucks corking its way forward the airplanes gleefully swooped down for the kill cassius had imagined hell on earth with the confederate military playing a star role in the roaster now he saw it truck after truck smashed by bombs or by machinegun and cannon fire gouts of flame erupted from the road the trucks couldnt run couldnt hide couldnt even shoot back the men inside them died where they sator if they tried to run for cover the black guerrillas shot them only one thing was wrong with the fire and brimstone visited upon the convoysome of it slopped over onto gracchus band not all the bombs hit right on the road neither did all the shells and bullets chances were the us pilots didnt even know the negroes were there if they knew they didnt give a damn their mission was to smash up enemy transport they did that up brown everything else was just a detail to them it was a detail it was liable to get cassius killed he hugged the ground while bullets smashed down much too close and blast tried to pick him up and throw him away somebody close by screamed no no no after a little while he realized he was making those noises the us warplanes couldnt have lingered more than ten minutes they came they saw they destroyed and the truck convoy was much more thoroughly wrecked than either gracchus or jeroboam could have imagined shitfire gracchus cried in a mix of awe and outrage aint even nothin left fo us to steal hell you say pyrrhus answered and paused to shoot a dazed and bloodied confederate truck driver who staggered toward him as the white man fell the guerrilla went on almost got myself squashed by a big old crate of rationslanded in these bushes here well thats somethin gracchus sounded as if he didnt know how much it was cassius didnt either you could eat confederate rations and you wouldnt be hungry afterwards past that he had nothing good to say for them hed heard even confederate soldiers traded cigarettes or coffee with the enemy to get food better than their own mother a dreadfully wounded confederate screamed motherrr cassius drew a bead on him and shot him through the head why you go an do dat a negro asked shoulda let the damn ofay suffer id shoot a dog cassius said yeah but a dog he wouldnt shoot you the other rebel said after a moment cassius decided he had a point instead of admitting it he changed the subject calling out to gracchus you gonna let that jeroboam loose reckon i better the guerrilla leader said he wasnt lyin thats fo damn sure an we ought to write a nice thankyou to them yankees they done a lot of work fo us he laughed reckon they done mo work than we coulda did our ownselves he wasnt wrong wonder how many of us those us pilots hit cassius said and laughed at himself he was sure he was the only rebel in the bandmaybe in the statewho would have said those pilots to the other negroes it would have been them pilots like it or not cassius was his fathers son the guerrillas had lost one man dead and two more wounded neither seriously watch what happen to them trucks an do jesus i dont hardly mind gettin shot one of the injured men said the dead guerrilla had stopped a mm cannon shell with his chest chances were he wouldnt have agreed carrying the rations and other small bits of loot the black rebels made their getaway behind them the shattered convoy sent up great dark plumes of smoke before long whites would come out from madison to see what had happenednot that they could be in much doubtand do what they could for anyone left alive cassius smiled as he trotted away god hadnt come down from the heavens to give the guerrillas a hand but the next best thing had jorge rodriguez wondered how long he could go on he wondered how long the confederate states could go on too if the damnyankees kept pounding on them the way they had been it wouldnt be much longer autumn or no autumn rain or no rain the united states were driving on atlanta and jorge didnt see how the confederacy could stop them he didnt worry about it all that much either he worried about staying alive with everything the damnyankees were throwing at his regiment that was plenty all by itself kennesaw mountain was heavily wooded country us artillery was firing shells fused for air bursts if you didnt have a good foxhole the fragments knifing down from above would cut you to ribbons jorge did he was proud of the hole which hed dug himself he could fire from it when enemy soldiers drew near but it also had a small shelter strengthened with boardswhat they would have called a bombproof in the great warscraped out under the forward lip when the shelling got bad hed duck under there and stay fairly safe right this minute there was a lull he could get out of his hole ease himself behind a tree smoke a cigarette he could yes as long as he stayed wary as a cat at a coonhound convention things had a way of picking up with no warning if you didnt dive back into your hole in a hurry youd be a casualty stay alert men captain malcolm boyd called theyre liable to throw paratroops at us like they did in tennessee if the united states tried an air drop here they had to be crazy it looked that way to jorge anyhow too many paratroops would get stuck in trees and die before they could start fighting weve got to hang on to marietta no matter what too the company commander added we dont hang on to marietta how the hell can we hold atlanta there he made more sense to jorge marietta was the cork in the bottleprobably the last cork in the bottle in front of atlanta if it fell atlanta almost had to and if atlanta fell the confederate states were in a hell of a lot of trouble so everybody said anyhow jorge knew things everybody said werent always right but this one felt too likely to laugh off he wished he wouldnt have heard so many things like weve got to hang on to chattanooga no matter what the confederates couldnt hang on to chattanooga now they were paying for losing it an automatic rifle rattled up ahead when jorge first went into the army that would have meant the man with the rifle wore butternut no more not necessarily the yankees had captured a lot of cs automatic weapons on their long drive south theyd captured the ammo the rifles used tooor maybe they were making their own jorge didnt know about that he did know he had to wait and hear more before he could be sure who was out there sure as hell the bangs that followed came from us springfields in the csa nobody but home guards and mexican soldiers used boltaction rifles these days the damnyankees were still a long step behind when it came to small arms some confederate soldiers wondered what the enemy was doing in georgia if that was so to jorge the answer looked clear enough yes yankee soldiers carried springfields but whole great swarms of yankee soldiers carried them us artillery matched anything the confederacy turned out so did us airplanes and the united states had more of them than the confederate states did as for barrelsjorge didnt want to think about barrels the usas new monsters outclassed everything the csa made he peered down the forward slope of kennesaw mountain he couldnt see the enemy troops but he had a pretty good idea where the gunfire was coming from the damnyankees were probing in front of his regiment trying to find a way through he could have done without the compliment if that was what it was the automatic rifle chattered again right aboutthere jorge judged if the fellow who carried it kept coming forward hed probably show himself somewhere near those two pines and a couple of minutes later he didnot for very long but long enough jorge fired a short burst from his own automatic rifle the us soldier threw up his hands and toppled jorge didnt think hed get up again he looked around for a new target easier to think of what hed just done as hitting a target if he thought of that figure in greengray as a soldier as a man then he had to think about everything shooting his fellow soldier his fellow man might mean but a target was only a target you could shoot at a target for fun if you felt like it almost as much to the point targets didnt shoot back jorge wondered if another us soldier would try to retrieve the automatic rifle if a man in greengray did it would be his last mistake but the rifle lay where it fell the damnyankees seemed confident they could drive the confederates back and then retrieve it jorge had to hope they were wrong he waited for the next artillery barrage or armored assault or gas attack or air raid or whatever the enemy had in mind instead a us officer waved a white flag from behind a tree and shouted can i come forward firing on both sides died away sergeant blackledge shouted back yeah come ahead what do you want the yankee emerged still holding the flag of truce as he approached the confederate lines he answered want to try to talk you people into surrendering thats what you keep fighting well squash you flat yeah now tell me another one blackledge jeered you want to win one on the cheap thats all not this time said the man in greengray well take some of your guys behind our lines show you what weve got i dont believe you can stop us or even slow us down very much youll do what the sergeant sounded as if he couldnt believe his ears jorge didnt blame him the damnyankees had never said anything like that not where he could hear it hed never heard of anything like it either calmly the us officer repeated himself he went on will you take me back this is what theyd call a limitedtime offer on the wireless if you dont take me up on it pretty damn quick youll find out whether im lying or not oh yeahbetter believe you will if he was acting he could go out on the road the confidence that filled his voice seemed frighteningly convincing maybe sergeant blackledge thought the same thing because he said come on up damn you im gonna put a blindfold on you before you go back of the line though you wont do any spying under flag of truce have it your way the yankee said like i told you you can look at what weve got he walked forward the sergeant put a rag over his eyes and led him back toward cs officers nobody on either side fired a few us soldiers came out and swapped rations for smokes and coffee jorge just sat tight and waited after about twenty minutes the blindfolded us officer returned three worriedlooking confederates in his wake he took off the rag and nodded to sergeant blackledge ceasefire will last till these gentlemen come back he said after that its up to them we wont open up unless your guys do the noncom replied away they went the one man in greengray and the three in butternut jorge was sure the confederates would see only what their enemies wanted to show them that was liable to be plenty he waited he smoked he climbed out of his hole to take a leak he didnt want to be a pow one of his brothers already languished in a camp he didnt want to get killed either an hour and a half later the cs officers returned their us guide stopped between the lines you can still change your minds he said this is your last chance but you can youll spare your men a lot of grief were obliged to defend this position major a confederate colonel said we will do so to the best of our ability youll be sorry the yankee said your men will be sorrier i cant answer for what will happen to them when we cut loose we have to take the chance sir the confederate replied we have our duty as you have yours with our country in danger our personal safety is of small concern that sounds very pretty youll find out what it means youre sure the us officer waited no one said anything more the major shrugged and returned to his own lines one of the confederates used a field telephone to tell their headquarters what theyd done all three of them stayed on the front line jorge admired that they could have retreated to safety instead they were sticking it out somewhere between five and ten minutes went by then the united states opened up with everything theyd shown the confederate officers and more besides jorge didnt think hed ever gone through a bombardment like this fighterbombers stooped on the cs line and added their weight of hellfire to the mix he heard shrieks through the thunder of exploding ordnance jorge carried a rosary in his pocket and fingered the beads to thank god and the virgin that his own shrieks werent among them wise in the yankees ways he popped up from his hole the instant the barrage lifted sure as the devil soldiers in greengray scrambled forward he shot one of them another alert confederate nailed a different one the rest hit the dirt or ducked behind trees but they werent giving up that would have been too much to ask for they kept on coming they just didnt think it would be a walkover any more more shells and some mortar bombs started dropping on the confederates shouts and curses off to the left warned that enemy troops had reached and were probably piercing the line there a moment later enfilading fire made the probability a sure thing back sergeant blackledge yelled jorge might have known nothing the usa fired at the confederates could hurt him theyll cut us off if we stay the sergeants right captain boyd added perhaps relieved blackledge spoke up before he had to we need to save ourselves jorge didnt want to get out of his hole any more than a mouse wanted to come out into the middle of the floor bullets and flying fragments did dreadful things to soft tender flesh but hed get captured or killed if he stayed here out he came and ran up the north slope of kennesaw mountain toward one of the two crests a bullet slammed into a tree trunk just to his left a big shell burst behind himat least a sixincher none of the fragments tore into him but blasta st bernard puppy the size of a buildingpicked him up and shook him and dropped him on his face he scrambled up again knowing he was lucky to be able to blast could kill all by itself had that shell come down a little closer best not to think of such things he ducked behind another tree to see how close the damnyankees were two or three were too damn close for comfort he fired at them they went down though he didnt think hed hit them but he would have done the same thing in their boots why take chances when you were winning way to go rodriguez sergeant blackledge said from behind another tree he seemed to be everywhere at once make em earn it by god they wont come on like their pants are on fire now the bastards sure sarge jorge hadnt thought of anything more than saving his own skin he still wasnt sure he could do that the us major hadnt been kidding the united states put a rock in their fist before they hit kennesaw mountain more shells came down he huddled in what wasnt enough shelter madre de dios when he got scared into spanish things were pretty bad what can we do try and stay alive as usual blackledge was relentlessly pragmatic try and find some place where we can make a stand slow the shitheels down try and hit back when they give us the chance sooner or later they willi hope he swore plainly wishing he hadnt tacked on the last two words mariettas gonna fall isnt it jorge asked the sergeant didnt answer for a second jorge thought he didnt hear then he realized the noncom didnt want to say yes if marietta fell atlanta was in deep trouble if atlanta fell the confederate states were in deep trouble and marietta would fall which meant purple martins perched in the shattered trees in the park square at the center of marietta the birds were flying south for the winter they didnt care that the trees had taken a beating there were still plenty of bugs in the air all the artillery in the world couldnt kill bugs chester martin in greengray didnt care that the trees were burned and scarred either as far as he was concerned the confederate states were getting what was coming to them and he hoped he was going south for the winter atlanta wasnt that far away how much did the enemy have between here and there enough he didnt think so a man with a white mustache hung from a lamppost a sign around his neck said i shot at us soldiers hed been there a couple of days and was starting to swell and stink chester hardly looked at him maybe hed do a little good maybe he wouldnt confederate bushwhackers and diehards and holdouts and redass civilians kept on harrying the occupiers all the way back to the ohio river hostages kept dying because of it which side would run out of will first remained unclear the trees in the park werent all that had been shattered in marietta the confederates fought hard to hold it not many houses were whole glassless windows might have been the eye sockets of skulls scorch marks scored clapboard chunks of walls and chunks of roofs bitten by shellfire gave the skyline jagged edges and mariettas people seemed as ravaged as the town they were skinny and dirty many of them with bandages or simply rags wrapped around wounds they stared at the us troops trudging south through their rubblestrewn streets with eyes that smoldered nobody said anything much though as chester had seen in other confederate towns his buddies were quick to resent insults a man with a rifle in enemy country could make his resentment felt a scrawny woman whose hair flew every which way cocked a hip in a pose meant to be alluring sleep with me she called jesus said one of the soldiers in chesters squad ive been hard up before but not that hard up yeah chester nodded i think shes a little bit cracked maybe more than a little bit an old man whose left sleeve hung empty scowled at him chester nodded back more politely than not he understood honest hate and could respect it he wondered if the respect he showed might change the confederates mind it didnt not by the look on the mans face chester didnt suppose he should have been surprised a burntout cs barrel sat inside the ruins of a brick house the last few feet of the barrels gun poked out through a window the gun tube sagged visibly eyeing it chester said mustve been a hell of a fire yeah well it couldnt happen to a nicer bunch of guys said the soldier who didnt want the scrawny woman chester grunted he didnt love confederate barrelmen what us soldier did those enemies were too good at killing his pals but he didnt like to think of them cooking like beef roasts in a fire so hot it warped solid steel that was a bad way to go for anybody on either side he wanted the enemy barrel crew dead sure charred to black hideousness maybe not come on step it up lieutenant lavochkin yelled we arent camping here were just passing through heading for atlanta chester looked forward to fighting for atlanta the way he looked forward to a filling without novocaine atlanta was a big city bigger than chattanooga the united states couldnt take it by surprise the way they had with the tennessee town if us forces tried smashing straight into it wouldnt the confederates do unto them as the usa had done to the confederacy in pittsburgh fighting one house at a time was the easiest way chester knew to become a casualty maybe the brass had a better plan he hoped like hell they did but if so nobodyd bothered passing the word down to an overage retread first sergeant a kid wearing what looked like his big brothers dungarees said get out of my country you damnyankee shut up you lousy brat or ill paddle your ass chester gestured with his rifle scram first last and only warning to his relief the kid beat it you didnt want to think a nineyearold could be a people bomb but hed heard some ugly stories boys and girls didnt fully understand what flicking that switch meant which made them more likely to do it and soldiers sometimes didnt suspect children till too late hell of a war chester muttered some of his men liberated three chickens to go with their rations they didnt have time to do anything but roast poorly plucked chicken pieces over a fire the smell of singeing feathers took chester back half a lifetime hed done the same thing in the great war then as now a drumstick went a long way toward making your belly stop growling he was smoking a cigarette afterwards when a grenade burst not far away somebody screamed a burst of fire from a submachine gun was followed by another shriek fuck said a soldier named leroy who was more often called the duke never a dull moment chester agreed were licking these bastards but they sure havent quit as if to prove it the confederates threw in a counterattack the next day armor spearheaded it not barrels but what seemed more like selfpropelled guns on tracked chassis they werent mounted in turrets but pointed straight ahead that meant the enemy driver had to line up his machine on a target instead of just traversing the turret the attack bogged down south of marietta a regiment of us barrels made the cs barrelbusters say uncle chester examined a wrecked machine with a professionals curiosity whats the point of these sir he asked captain rhodes a us antibarrel round had smashed through the side armor he didnt want to think about what the crew looked like you could probably bury them in a jam tin these things have to be cheaper to build than barrels and quicker to build too the company commander answered if youve got to have as much firepower as you can get and if you need it yesterday theyre a lot better than nothing i guess chester said ugly damn thing isnt it now that you mention it yesespecially if youre on the wrong end of it rhodes said get used to it sergeant you can bet your ass youll see more of them he was bound to be right and if they were cheap and easy to makewhat do you want to bet we start cranking em out too captain rhodes looked startled but then he nodded wouldnt be surprised anything they can do we can do too were lucky weve kept our lead in barrels as long as we have maybe the confederates were too busy with these things to pay as much attention to those as they should have breaks my heart martin said dryly the company commander laughedbut not for long be ready for a push of our own soon as we can move more shit forward when the confederates hit us they use stuff up faster than they can resupply might as well kick em while theyre down mm chester weighed that then nodded yeah i bet youre right sir ill get the men ready you think were going into atlanta christ i hope not rhodes blurted which was about what chester was thinking himself rhodes went on we do try to go straight in there a lot of usll come out in a box looks like that to me too so what do we do instead chester asked just bomb it flat or maybe try and flank em out my guess is we go that way captain rhodes pointed east we do that we cut the direct train and truck routes between richmond and atlanta yeah the confederates can get around it but we put ourselves in a good position for hitting the lines and the roads coming up from the south id sure rather do that than charge in with my head down me too chester said fervently amen in fact you think the brass has the smarts to see it like you do well well find out rhodes replied with a dry chuckle but he didnt seem too downcast start of this campaigning season we were chucking the confederates out of ohio now theyre trying to get us out of georgia i think maybe general morrell knows what hes doing heres hoping chester said which made the company commander laugh out loud the us push went in three days later the confederates had done what they could to build a line south of marietta and it held for most of a day but once us armor cracked it the enemy didnt have much behind it then confederates fired what had to be half the rockets in the world at the advancing men in greengray they were scaryhell they were terrifying they caused casualties not a few of them but without enough men in butternut on the ground to hold it the rockets couldnt stop the us forces and the main axis of the us attack aimed not at atlanta but at lawrenceville almost due east of marietta captain rhodes looked uncommonly smug chester martin didnt say boo how could he the captain had earned the right heavy bombers and fighterbombers stayed overhead all the time tearing up the countryside south of the us advance and keeping the confederates in and around atlanta from striking at the us flank lots and lots of artillery fire came down on the enemy too chester approved of every single shell and wished there were more every time us forces crossed a railroad line demolition teams tore hell out of it every time us forces crossed a paved road that ran north and south engineers dynamited bridges and blew craters in the roadway even if the confederates rallied and drove back the men in greengray they wouldnt move much into or out of atlanta any time soon for the first time confederate prisoners seemed to lose heart thanks for not shootin me one of them said as he went to the rear with his hands high reckon were whipped any which way see what featherstons freedom got you chester said well were rid of most of our niggers anyways so thats good the pow said but hell yank youre rightwe coulda done that without gettin in another war with yall you started it chester said well finish it freedom party guards by contrast still believed theyd win wait till the secret weapons get you said a man in camouflage overalls youll be sorry then yeah the bogeymanll get you if you dont watch out chester jeered the captured confederate glared at him under the guns of half a dozen soldiers in greengray he couldnt do more not if he wanted to keep breathing take him away chester said let him try his line of bullshit on the intelligence boys it aint bullshit the freedom party guardsman said youll find out and youll be sorry when you do too yeah sure buddy chester said two men took the pow off to the rear the crap they come up with another us soldier said lighting up a habana hed taken from a prisoner he sounded like he believed it too people used to believe the world was flat chester said the soldier laughed and nodded but the guardsman had sounded mighty sure of himself and chester remembered all the rockets the confederates seemed to have pulled from nowhere he was a little more worried than he let onnot a lot but a little flora blackford hurried into the house chamber shed got the summons to the joint session of congress only a little while before other representatives and senators were grumbling at having to change plans to get here on time she understood why the president wouldnt ask for a joint session much in advance that would give the confederatesand maybe other enemiesmore time to come up with something unpleasant the speaker of the house rapped loudly for order when he got something close to quiet he said ladies and gentlemen i have the distinct honor and high privilege of introducing the president of the united states charles w la follette applause rang through the hall charlie la follette took his place behind the lectern he was tall and ruddy and handsome with a splendid shock of white hair the cartoonists loved hed been president for almost a year and a half now but still didnt seem to have stepped out from under al smiths shadow maybe today was the day ladies and gentlemen of the congress my fellow americans has blessed our arms with victory he said when the year began we were driving invaders from western pennsylvania now pennsylvania and ohio have been liberated and our armies stand not far from atlanta the hub of the confederate states of america more applause washed over him loud and fierce he grinned and held up a hand we have also driven deep into texas and seen with our own eyes the horror the confederates have visited on their negro population the murder factory called camp determination at least will perpetrate those horrors no more this time the applause was more tentative though flora clapped till her palms hurt pictures of those enormous mass gravesthe words hardly did them justicehad been in all the weeklies for a while even so the furor was less than shed hoped for people either didnt care or didnt want to believe what they were seeing was true everywhere confederate forces are in retreat the president said even jake featherston must see that he cannot hope to win the war he started two and a half years ago this being so i call on him to surrender unconditionally and spare his country the bloodshed further resistance would cause though they do not deserve them i promise him and his leading henchmen their lives we will take them into exile on a small island and will guard them there so they can no longer trouble north america and blight its hopes confederate soldiers will be disarmed and sent home all confederates white and colored will be guaranteed life liberty and property think well president featherston if you reject this call both you and your country will regret it we will leave wireless frequency kilocycles unjammed for your reply for the next fortyeight hours you will be sorry if you say no he stepped away from the microphones on the lectern putting notes back into an inside pocket of his jacket as he did flora applauded again so did most of the other members of congress if the war ended nowif it ends now joshua wont get hurt she thought that alone gave her plenty of reason to hope hope or not though she feared featherston would ignore the call the hall emptied as fast as it had filled now no one had a great big target to aim at flora hurried to her office she tuned the wireless set there to she didnt know how long the president of the csa would take to answer but she wanted to hear him when he did he needed less than two hours here is a statement by president featherston of the confederate states of america an announcer said im jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth that familiar rasping hatefilled voice snarled out of the wireless set and the truth is people of the usa and president la follette we arent about to surrender weve got no reason to were going to win this war and youll be laughing out of the other side of your mouth pretty damn quick philadelphia will get the message in just a few minutes philadelphia will get it twice matter of fact you wait you watch and you listen then you figure out who ought to be doing the surrendering so long for now youll hear more from me soon flora said something that would have shocked her secretary it amounted to the nerve of the man he couldnt have bombers that close to philadelphia us yranging gear would have picked them up and there was bound to be a heavy combat air patrol above the de facto capital of the usa bomberseven captured us bombers or cs warplanes painted in us colorsmight not get through but jake featherston had sounded devilishly sure of himself terrorists inside the city people bombers waiting to press their buttons floras mouth tightened she knew those were both possibilities could featherston be so sure theyd do their job on short notice maybe that was why he hadnt answered right after president la follettes speech or a loud explosion rattled floras teeth and put ripples in the coffee in her halffull cup long experience told her that was a oneton bomb going off not nearly far enough away no airraid sirens howled it hadnt fallen from an enemy bomber flora was sure of that maybe three minutes later another blast echoed through philadelphia this one a little farther from her office vey iz mir she exclaimed she didnt know what featherston and his minions had done but no denying hed kept his promise after about a quarter of an hour he came back on the wireless im jake featherston and im here to say i told you the truth he crowed he must have waited till he got word his plan whatever it was had worked see how you like it philadelphia plenty more where those came from and well spread em around too surrender nuts we just started fighting if anyone in philadelphia knew what the confederates had done franklin roosevelt was likely to be the man what point to having connections if you didnt use them flora dialed his number hoping shed get through she did hello flora roosevelt still sounded chipper as far as she could tell he always did but he went on cant talk long busy as the devil after a fire at an atheists convention right now heh flora said uneasily you must know why im calling though what did the confederates just do to us well it looks like a rocket the assistant secretary of war answered two rockets i should say rockets you mean they had them set up somewhere outside of town and fired them off when featherston told them to no i dont think thats what happened not from the first look weve had at whats left of them franklin roosevelt kept that jaunty air but he sounded serious too and he wasted no time explaining why our best guess is they shot them up here from virginia from virginia gevalt flora said thats got to bewhat a couple of hundred miles i didnt know you could make rockets fly that far unfortunately i cant but jake featherston can damn his black heart roosevelt said what can we do to stop them flora asked at this end nothing they get here too fast he said if theyve got bases or launchers or whatever you call them maybe we can bomb those i hope so anyway but i dont know that for a fact you understand how much damage did they do flora found one bad question after another one blew a big hole in a vacant lot the other one hit in front of an apartment building now roosevelt was thoroughly grim quite a few casualties but it would have been worse at night with more people at home and fewer out working do they aim them at philadelphia or do they aim them say at the corner of chestnut and broad yes all kinds of nasty questions to ask right now your guess is as good as mine if i had to bet id say they just aim them at philadelphia a rocket cant be that accuratecan it but thats only a wildass guessexcuse the technical term in spite of everything flora smiled thanks franklin i needed that what are we going to do if we cant stop these rockets and we cant even warn against them how do we go on as best we can roosevelt answered stick a rabbits foot in your purse if you dont already have one remember that every time the confederates build one of these they dont build something else and some will be duds and some will go boom without doing much damage as much as anything else theyre trying to scare us theyre pretty good at it arent they flora said roosevelt laughed merrily as if she were joking what he hadnt said was that some of the rockets would blow houses and apartments and factories to kingdom come then something even worse than that occurred to her can they load anything besides ordinary explosives onto thesethings you mean like gas i think explosives would hurt us more roosevelt said flora had no doubt he was being dense on purpose gas maybe she said or other things she didnt want to say too much on the telephone obviously neither did he not right away he answered ive already talked with some people they need a bigger rocket or a smaller thing so thats all right for a while anyhow for a while how long is a while i have no idea if its not till we finish licking them it doesnt matter and now ive got to go other people to talk to stay safe how flora asked but she was talking to a dead line sighing she hung up too she heard no more bangs out of the blue that was something maybe featherston had only two ready and more would have to wait a while again though how long was a while not nearly so long as the confederates would need to load a uranium bomb on a rocketflora was all too sure of that her secretary looked into the inner office were those booms the confederates or the mormons congresswoman mr roosevelt says they were the confederates bertha flora answered bertha nodded figured youd be talking to him how did they sneak the bombs in cant we stop stuff like that were the rockets secret the war department would probably like to keep them that way but it would be like trying to classify the sunrise like it or not everybody would know about them before long flora told bertha what shed heard all the way up from virginia how do they do that bertha said if we knew wed do it too flora said dryly i bet like anything were trying to figure it out though oh boy bertha didnt sound impressed for which flora could hardly blame her whats to keep us all from getting murdered in our beds without even any warning nothing flora thought were going to take atlanta pretty soon if we smash the confederate states to pieces they wont be able to go on with the war oh boy her secretary repeated how long will that take i dont know not too long i hope please god let it be before they send joshua into action i havent asked you for much but give me that theyll be shooting off these skyrocket things all the time till then bertha asked not if we can bomb the places where they shoot them from flora said hmp bertha made a noise redolent of skepticism did anybody know what a nasty war this would be before they went and started it does anybody ever what are we going to do bertha asked what can we do were stuck in it weve got to win flora said bertha didnt say no but she didnt say yes either
