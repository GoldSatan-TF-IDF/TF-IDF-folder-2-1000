jack higgins the judas gate washington dc the oval office the washington day in august had been almost subtropical but by late evening an unexpected shower had cooled things the hayadams hotel was only a short walk from the white house and outside the bar two men sat at a small table on the terrace a canopy protecting them against the rain the elder had an authoritative moustache and thick hair touched with silver and wore a dark blue suit and guards tie he was general charles ferguson commander of the british prime ministers private hit squad which was an unfortunate necessity in the era of international terrorism his companion major harry miller was fortyseven just under six feet with grey eyes a shrapnel scar on one cheek and a calm and confident manner a member of parliament he served the prime minister as a general troubleshooter and bore the rank of undersecretary of state he had proved he could handle anything from the politicians at the united nations to the hell of afghanistan just now he was saying to ferguson are you sure the president will be seeing us ferguson nodded blake was quite certain the president said hed make sure to clear time for us sean dillon stepped out on to the terrace glass in hand and joined them his fair hair tousled and his shirt and velvet cord suit black as usual so there you are before ferguson could reply blake johnson appeared from the bar and found them he wore a light trenchcoat draped over his shoulders to protect a tweed country suit he was fiftynine his black hair flecked with grey as a boy hed lied about his age and when hed stepped out of the plane to start his first tour of vietnam hed been only eighteen now a longtime veteran of the secret service he was personal security adviser to the new president as he had been for several presidents before him we thought wed been stood up dillon told him and shook hands nonsense ferguson said its good of him to make time for us your report on afghanistan certainly interested him besides hes wanted to meet you for some time now with all the new blood running around i think thats very decent of the man dillon said i thought wed have been kicked out of the door along with the special relationship ferguson said to blake take no notice of him lets get going for those who didnt want to make a fuss the best way into the white house was through the east entrance which was where clancy smith a large fit black secret service man assigned to the president waited patiently he had met them all over the years great to see you general he told ferguson so youre still speaking to us clancy dillon asked dillon shut up ferguson told him again im only trying to make sure theres a welcome for brits these days i seem to remember there was a previous occasion when they burned the place down clancy roared with laughter dillon you never change he doesnt does he ferguson said bitterly but lets get moving if youd be kind enough to lead the way which clancy did escorting them through many corridors until he finally paused at a door gentlemen the oval office he opened the door and led the way in the president was in his shirtsleeves working his way through a mound of paperwork the president and blake were sitting on one side of the large coffee table with dillon ferguson and miller on the other there was coffee available on a sideboard and they had all helped themselves at the presidents invitation ferguson sipped some of his coffee trying times mr president afghanistan troubles me greatly the casualties mount relentlessly yet we cant just abandon them the president said i agree ferguson told him the president glanced at blake what were those vietnam statistics again at its worst four hundred dead a week and four times as many wounded blake told him two thousand casualties a week miller shook his head it wasnt sustainable which was why we got out the president said but what the hell do we do now we have a large international army excellent military personnel backed up by air support and missiles it should be no contest and yet harry miller put in theres precedent mr president during the eighteenforties at the height of its empire britain sent an army of sixteen and a half thousand into afghanistan to take kabul only one man returned with his life a regimental doctor ive always believed the afghans were sending a message by allowing him to live my god the president said softly i never heard that story to afghans family comes first and then the tribe miller told him but they will always fight together to defend afghanistan itself against an invader and thats us dillon put in and they dont like it and now even young men of afghan extraction who were born in britain end up joining the fight the president turned to ferguson thats what was in your report tell me more ferguson said are you familiar with major giles roper a member of my staff in london we havent met but i know of him once a great bombdisposal expert until an explosion put him in a wheelchair yes well hes since become the king of cyberspace theres nothing he cant make his computers doand sometimes that means he can listen in to battlefield chat in afghanistan the people flying with the taliban come from such a wide number of countries that english has sometimes become the language of communication miller said its interesting to hear the voices yorkshire accents many from birmingham welsh scots thats incredible the president said but true young britishborn muslims are being recruited by doctrinaire preachers who not only encourage them to go but also offer plane tickets and a training camp all courtesy of al qaeda who then introduce them to the taliban miller added its an awfully big adventure when youre eighteen or so just like joining the army dillon murmured ferguson glanced at him but the president carried on you know there are many good people who advocate we withdraw and continue this as a longrange war air strikes cruise missiles drones blake said ferguson replied with respect too often that can result in an indiscriminate attack on civilian targets terrorism can only be countered by a resolute antiterrorism campaign that pulls no punches i take your point the president nodded but lets ask an expert he turned to dillon ive been informed of your past mr dillon you must have an opinion share it with us general ferguson is right the successful revolutionary blends with the people which is why with these british muslim imports american and british forces in afghanistan cant be certain who is the enemy which we counter by joining with afghan army units ourselves ferguson said but theres another aspect that concerns me more and that is the president asked theres an incredible new sophistication by the taliban concerning improvised explosive devices not only in the bombmaking itself but their usage they are becoming far too good the only conclusion must be that they are being coached by experts the president frowned what are you implying the cubans or the russians something like that good god no ferguson said those days are long gone for the cubans and the russians wouldnt touch afghanistan if it was the last place on earth they couldnt crack that nut with an army of a hundred thousand men dillon moved in bombs arent just bombs they are tactical weapons used to achieve maximum results you must make sure that an ambush is not just an ambush but a total disaster for the enemy and to achieve that you need instruction from an expert what are you saying let me tell you a story ferguson said its from thirty years ago when i was a major in the grenadier guards on my third tour in ulster seconded to staff at headquarters in belfast im not wasting your time believe me then proceed general the president told him and ferguson began august the twentyseventh nineteen seventynine ferguson took a deep breath as if pulling himself together ill never forget that date because it was one of the worst days in my life i was in the incident room at the grand central in belfast when we received some truly dreadful news which was the president enquired the queens cousin lord louis mountbatten liked to enjoy his family holidays in ireland despite the obvious security risks that year a radiocontrolled bomb blew his thirtyfoot fishing boat apart killing mountbatten his grandson his daughters motherinlaw and a young boat boy dear god the president said i remember reading about it god had nothing to do with it but the provisional ira did the media went berserk at the incident room we were besieged calls from all over the world then later that same day just when i thought it was beginning to calm down it got worse warrenpoint two trucks loaded with paratroopers were on their way to a market town called newry when a huge roadside bomb hidden in a farm trailer was activated by a radio signal six paratroopers were killed and others wounded the survivors took refuge in the ruins of a lodge at a place called narrow water they radioed in for help and came under sniper fire a wessex helicopter carrying soldiers from the queens own highlanders landed close by as they disembarked another large bomb exploded killing twelve soldiers including their commanding officer and wounding others the presidents horror was plain thats appalling i use it in my lectures at sandhurst as an example of a classic guerrilla ambush brilliantly executed miller told him ferguson said it was probably the worst incident in terms of casualties in the whole of the troubles eighteen men dead and more than twenty wounded so where are you going with this the president asked miller took a map from his briefcase and unfolded it afghanistan helmand province see the road running up to the mountains in the north the small village of mirbat and the deep lake beside it the village is in ruins the people have moved on a convoy loaded with technicians and electronic equipment needed to get through to the dam at the head of the valley to repair the hydroelectric system that the taliban had damaged two sixwheel mastiff armoured patrol vehicles led the way besides the drivers there were twelve rangers when they got to mirbat they found it deserted got out to explore and a massive roadside bomb killed six of them instantly and wounded others the president said what next the remaining rangers came under sniper fire from across the lake a chinook helicopter with an instant response medical team happened to be close by brits as a matter of fact they reached mirbat in fifteen minutes and landed as the medics jumped out a second roadside bomb was activated and the helicopter fireballed miller shrugged the firing stopped the taliban cleared off in all there were twenty personnel involved the entire chinook team were slaughtered and ten rangers two rangers survived along with the driver sixteen dead the president said grimly ferguson said shocking isnt it even more so to listen to listen to you mean this is one of the things your major roper picked up with the british voices yes voices calling to each other in the fog of battle the death of men the triumph of the victor ferguson told him the taliban force could have been as many as thirty the experts estimate about fifteen were british he removed a cassette from his pocket the president took it and said clancy would you put this on we might as well hear the worst the material had been enhanced and edited some of the voices were speaking pushtu and there was an occasional call in arabic but english prevailed and the different regional accents were clear for a while there was a lot of crosstalk and then someone cut in with real authority shamrock here cut all this stupid chatter and assume your positions mastiffs are on the way the soldiers in them are american rangers theyre good so wait for the bomb to explode before firing anyone who jumps the gun gets a bullet through the kneecap from me afterwards there was a certain amount of wild laughter and then an american voice cut in calling convoy ranger one coming into mirbat now looks pretty quiet to me but well see shortly afterwards the first explosion was followed by gunfire voices calling excitedly screams the sound of aks firing then a sudden silence miller said major ropers cut straight to the chinook arriving the pause ended there was the noise of the chinook coming in and then the second explosion deafening in its intensity followed by further gunfire and then the voice again loud and clear shamrock here cease firing youve done well you bastards what a spectacular warrenpoint all over again and it worked big time osama will be delighted now lets get out of here before the heavy brigade arrives you can rest in peace now sean night bless there was suddenly only the machine whirring clancy said is that it it sure as hell was enough the president said his face sombre why havent i heard of this before blake it only happened nine days ago mr president you were in mexico for two days then that courtesy call in panama and then the libyan business thats what im elected for this is bad yes but major general ferguson thought you should hear this personally this has been the first opportunity youre right of course the president took a deep breath were grateful to you general now this leader of the pack this shamrock what do you know about him ferguson said our voice experts say hes educated likely the product of a top public school and a trained soldier id say so ferguson said which means the british army dillon said and he has irish roots of some sort how can you be certain the president asked the code name hes chosen shamrock what could be more irish than that then there was his joy over the success of the mirbat ambush and his comparing it to the warrenpoint spectacular of so many years ago also his threat to shoot anyone who misbehaved through the kneecapthats a ritual punishment in the ira since time immemorial finally this restinpeace prayer to someone called sean surely thats a common enough name in ireland it certainly is dillon smiled a good irish name which in northern ireland would label you as a catholic instantly ill have to take your word for it mr dillon most enlightening the president stood up gentlemen im very grateful and youve given me a lot to think about general i know the white house has owed you and your people a debt on many previous occasions keep blake informed of your progress and let me know if there is anything i can do were grateful for you finding a moment to see us ferguson told him we live in trying times but well pull through im sure of it god willing the president shook hands with the three of them dillon last and said you really believe you can hunt this man this shamrock down dont you mr dillon absolutely mr president the president smiled you are a remarkable man my friend dont let me down my oath on it sir he held the presidents hand a moment longer then turned and followed the others as blake ushered them out late the next morning fergusons gulfstream his regular raf pilots lacey and parry at the controls rose to thirty thousand feet climbing high over the atlantic after a while parry looked into the cabin theres some problematic weather in the midatlantic a question of how heavy the winds are id have said perfectly acceptable if theyre flying up your backside dillon told him right as usual dillon which means our flight time will be cut to about six hours if were lucky anyone like anything to eat or drink thank you no flight lieutenant ferguson told him and parry withdrew miller said you certainly impressed the president sean i only told the man what i thought hed want to hear rash promises as usual ferguson put in shamrock could be anybody theres no such thing dillon told him everyone is a somebody and i intend to find him one way or another in fact im so certain ill have a drink on it not me ferguson told him and unfolded the quilt beside his seat im going to take a nap ill have to see the prime minister tomorrow if you want to make yourself useful harry call in to roper and tell him what happened he switched off his light and pulled up the quilt at the holland park safe house in london major giles roper sat in a track suit in his wheelchair his shoulderlength hair tied with a ribbon pulling it back from his bombravaged face as he listened to harry miller describe the visit to the white house roper lit a cigarette and poured a whisky as he listened good old sean no one could ever accuse him of lacking confidence have you come up with anything else miller asked i cant say that i have and ive gone over the audio tapes again and again what you all listened to is still what ive got so what happens now im not sure the rumours of britishborn muslims fighting for the taliban are now confirmed what the government can do about it is another matter not very much i imagine the government is wary about stirring things up with the muslim population so well all go to hell in a handcart together harry miller told him but first what do we do about shamrock thats a different matter dillon put in from the plane and quite simple we find him quickly shoot him and pass him over to the disposal men ah if only life were that easy roper said we know a lot about him already the clues are there dillon said he obviously has military experience so what are you going to do go to the army list and pore over thousands of names going back ten twenty or even thirty years what would you be looking for youre right but i wont be doing that ive a strong feeling that going back to the scene of the crime might be the way to mirbat roper was aghast dont be a bloody fool sean if the taliban got you theyd feed you to the dogs im sure they would but i was thinking of warrenpoint i have a feeling that there might be some answer for me there i was born in county down myself you know at collyban no more than a dozen miles from the area fergusons voice was muffled by the quilt as he said you are not going anywhere near county down and thats an order so shut up and stop disturbing me i hear and obey oh great one dillon switched off the telephone sorry harry ferguson said call roper back and tell him to contact daniel holley in algiers or wherever he is get him to share all our information with holley id value his opinion on the matter dillon was astounded you mean the daniel holley who tried to put us all out of business permanently who nearly succeeded in blowing you up in your limousine and arranged for hit men to have a try at harry and blake johnson whose shoulder still aches on a rainy day from the bullet he took yes well he didnt succeed he came bloody close he also saved your good friend monica starling from certain death dont forget that sean and as far as both the americans and ourselves are concerned hes clean now hes too useful not to be especially since hes become full partner with hamid malik in that shipping company theyre respected throughout the mediterranean you know theyre also arms dealers dillon said not any more ferguson told him well only occasionally in any case holleys been given algerian nationality and a diplomatic passport by their foreign minister he can come and go anywhere these days its the way the world turns dillon next thing you know hell be staying at the dorchester having tea and scones i had a drink with him there two months ago ferguson said wearily in his suite with roper i dont tell you everything dillon he retreated under the quilt and dillon feeling strangely helpless turned to miller did you know anything about this not a thing the major said but really sean i dont care as you know protestant terrorists raped and murdered his young cousin so he executed all four of them and took refuge from the law by joining the ira i dont hold it against himany more than i hold your past against you okay dillon said you dont have to make a production out of it i was just getting adjusted to the idea go to sleep he picked up the telephone and made the call to roper who had just brought up the county down border on one of his screens when dillon called roper took it on speaker sean me boy i expected to hear from you your hear and obey to ferguson didnt fool me for a minute so i was just about to look at things again to see if id missed anything forget about me the situation has changed dramatically okay tell me the worst dillon did and when he was finished roper laughed my god sean you almost sound indignant youve got to admit that holley could have finished us all off well he didnt and he saved monica from a certain and unpleasant death the love of your life seanat least thats the impression we all get dillon said damn you for being right i guess i just felt left out of things thats understandable where holley is concerned though ferguson wanted to handle everything with care with that diplomatic passport from the algerian foreign minister the whole wide worlds opened up for him again ferguson wants to take advantage of that it makes sense dillon said grudgingly and youll never feel lonely again as far as we are concerned after all hes ira just like you you have a way with the words roper its a hell of a world we live in these days roper said not so easy to see the difference between the good guys and bad any more oh i think i can manage to do that well enough dillon said but ill leave you to hunt daniel holley down it was quiet then as roper sat there in the computer room on his own just the glow of the screens around him he sat in his stateoftheart wheelchair suddenly feeling tired and weary and badly damagedwhich he was past everything there ever was but that would never do he poured himself another whisky reached for his codex mobile and went in search of daniel holley p aris a lgiers daniel holley was running alongside the seine darkness beginning to take over the heat of the day lingering ominously as if a storm was brewing hed purchased a furnished barge a few months earlier convenient for business trips for both him and his partner hamid malik he wore a black track suit looked younger than fortynine his hair still brown of medium height fit and well he had the permanent slight smile of a man who found life a little absurd most of the time the irish in him as his mother used to say the other half was from the city of his birth leeds which meant pure yorkshire his mobile sounded and he took it out it was a codex of advanced design only available to fergusons people which his previous masters at russian military intelligence the gru had stolen hello roper he said what a surprise what can i do for you he paused leaning on a convenient wall tell me where you are for a start paris and running beside the seine its been a lovely day but rain threatens but you didnt call for a weather report no to be brief ferguson dillon and harry miller have just been meeting with the president in washington they were discussing the talibans use of britishborn muslims in their armyand there seems to be an irish dimension emerging is there by god holleys voice was serious the yorkshire accent more pronounced the general would like your opinion after all you were trained at one of those camps yourself in the middle of the algerian desert all those years ago and paid for by colonel gaddafi so was sean dillon a good point youve got extra credentials though youre joint owner of one of the biggest shipping firms out of algiers with algerian nationality andthanks to that diplomatic passport from their foreign ministeryou get waved through security at airports all over the world its even better when i fly privately holley told him i get diplomatic immunity im so happy for you roper teased so ferguson has asked me to send you the full details of the meeting at the oval office i think youll find it pretty grim will you look of course i will you daft bastard i wouldnt miss it youve got my email address from when we met at the dorchester do the others know about that yet by the way theyve just been told on the gulfstream at thirtyfive thousand feet over the atlantic miller was completely pragmatic about it dillon was mortified more than anything else he doesnt like being kept in the dark well thats just too bloody bad send that material and ill read it when i get back to the barge i must go now ive got a business transaction waiting straightforward i hope when i say albanian what would you think god help you my friend watch your back holley put his codex in his pocket thoroughly stimulated by the entire conversation heady stuff as it started to rain he ran through the gathering darkness towards notre dame floodlit incomparably beautiful in the night and came to quai de montebello illuminated by lamps where barges were moored together he boarded his own by a roped gangplank and went below the barges previous owner had been a wellknown fashion designer and it was extremely comfortable panelled state room with comfortable sofas shelves of books a television a long table in the centre a small alcove at one end held the computer the kitchen was opposite small but with everything he needed the sleeping quarters and shower room were at the end of a passage in the bow of the barge the computerlinked phone system was flashing so he took a halffull bottle of champagne from the fridge poured a glass pressed a replay button and quickly found himself talking to hamid malik at the villa in algiers i was worried malik said whats happening not much the meeting with ali kupu is on eleven oclock about fifteen minutes from here so late malik sighed i dont know daniel do we really have to deal with people like ali kupu still these albanians are pigs bastards of the first order completely untrustworthy most of them would sell their sisters on the streets a great many do holley said since we spoke i had another message from him he wanted to change our meeting to havar can you believe that but thats in kosovo close to the bulgarian border you couldnt even consider it of course not especially when you remember what happened the last time i did business there holley had been betrayed to the russians and ended up with a life sentence at the lubyanka prison it was only by luck that vladimir putin searching for someone to make mischief against general ferguson and his people in london had heard about him and pulled him out of his cell but in the end everythings turned out for the best my friend malik said business couldnt be better your rather violent past is no longer held against you you are not only a millionaire businessman but a respected diplomat dont spoil it this ali kupu is scum the arms deal he wants is maybe two hundred thousand dollars petty cash who needs it its an easy one holley told him trust me a gangster malik said he deals in drugs violent prostitution pah but this has nothing to do with any of that hes told me the material is for muslim village defence forces in kosovo they arent being protected by the central government any longer and thats a known fact aks rpgs plus ammunitionwe can meet the order at the marseilles warehouse ship it out by air this week and were done on condition he pays in advance absolutely cash on the nail or he doesnt get the goods dont worry but i do youre like a son to me finish it quickly and get out of there you have the falcon there dont you thank god i agreed when you suggested we buy it for the firm its parked at charles de gaulle airport waiting for me ill leave tonight but i might call in at london before i return home any particular reason holley hesitated but decided not to mention the other business oh i fancy a couple of days at the dorchester after meeting with someone like the albanian maybe ill walk up to shepherd market visit your cousin selim i envy you id enjoy that myself i could send the falcon nonsense so expensive were making millions leave me to mind the store allah be with you the connection went silent it was just past nine oclock still time to have a quick look at the computer to see if roper had sent the material he poured another glass of champagne sat down and scanned the first page it took him twenty minutes to go right through it all very briefly and far too quickly but it was enough my god he said softly what have we got here and what in the hell is to be done about it and then a strange thing happened he was aware of an energy a cold hard excitement he hadnt known in years he called roper and got him at once did you get the material roper asked you can tell ferguson i want to be part of whatever operation youre putting together ill be in london tomorrow he said and hung up at holland park roper sat there in silence good god he said softly what a turnup for the books he debated whether to put the news directly through to the gulfstream but decided against it such good news could keep he brought warrenpoint up on the screen and started to go through everything again holley had a quick shower thinking of what lay ahead kupu was a dangerously violent man who had killed many times but he was not stupid business was business and he needed what holley could provide it wasnt logical that he would do anything but behave himself but nothing in this life was certain and holley slipped on a nylonandtitanium bulletproof vest next to his skin it was guaranteed to stop a round at pointblank range and had done so on several occasions in his violent career he dressed in a fresh track suit and sneakers there was no point in wearing an ankleholster kupus goon abu would certainly check on that a walther in his pocket so easy to discover would keep him happy for his personal safety he could rely on an old reliable and he took it out of the wardrobe a crumpled burberry rain hat inside a spring clip held a snubnosed colt and its cartridges were hollow point one of those in the right place was all it took so he found a light raincoat slipped the walther in a pocket carefully arranged the hat on his head found an umbrella and left the unexpected and heavy rain had emptied the pavements especially at the side of the seine around him were quiet buildings dark at that time of night narrow streets leading down to the river the faint sounds of traffic in the distance holley hurried on without meeting a soul and eventually reached his destination in the gloom there was something sinister about it dark and threatening there were two old street lamps on the jetty itself another in the yard at the end where there was a huge warehouse door in the door was the usual small access entrance for workmen and he opened it and stepped inside the door banging he saw several rows of old workbenches some machinery a couple of vans at the far end and a wide exit door open lights above it so the heavy rain glistened like silver as it fell to the left was an office partly glassed in so you could see inside ali kupu was sitting behind a cluttered desk and appeared to be fondling a young woman who was standing obediently beside him ah it is you mr holley enter my friend his english was surprisingly good but then as a youth kupu had worked in soho for two years until hed finally been expelled as an illegal immigrant he was an overweight unshaven coarse animal with a shaven head come in come in holley moved forward passed the first van and was not in the least surprised when the rear door opened and abu scrambled out behind him he was enormous with a face like stone hair down to his shoulders he wore a black suit you know what to do he said holley obliged leaned on the van and the walther was discovered my but you are getting to be a big boy holley said as he straightened you should enter the mr universe competition this year muscles gleaming under all that oil youd like that wouldnt you no mr holley what id really like is to tear off your headand i will do exactly that the first chance i get he moved into the office ahead of holley and put the walther on the table then stood at the back of the room kupu was very drunk and yet reached for an open bottle of vodka and swallowed deeply from it you shouldnt anger abu like that hes a very violent man when he gets angry and does terrible things doesnt he he said to the woman who looked terrified she wore a raincoat over a light black dress and clutched a handbag im sure he does holley walked to a chair at one side of the door sat down took off his burberry rain hat and put it on his lap this is liri kupu encircled her waist one of my best girls empty your handbag and lets see how well youve done tonight the rain she said as she fumbled business wasnt good she emptied the handbag of not very much kupu glanced at it then took a gladstone bag from under the desk opened it and swept in liris earnings excuses mr holley its all i get he slapped her face then said to abu search her next door see if shes hiding anything no please she begged kupu as abu grabbed her arm opened the far door and shoved her through stupid bitch they are all the same i give them employment look after their interests and how do they repay me he swallowed more vodka but to business you can supply what i need im a serious man i desire only to help my muslim brothers who are being butchered every day in kosovo very commendable and i have good references he patted the side of his nose drunkenly aq eh is that a fact holley said there were muffled cries from the next room but kupu ignored them you dont believe me do you he reached for the vodka bottle swallowing again my fathers brother my uncle mahmud is an art dealer based in tirana he specializes in rare holy books and manuscripts he travels all over europe knows people at the highest level i act as his contact man in paris he tells me everything for example what if i told you that prime minister putin intends to make a visit to chechnya this weekend all very hushhush the sort of thing you only hear about afterwards holley said and why would he be doing that a meeting requested by a very highlevel muslim holy man a famous mullah now in his nineties ibrahim somebody he leaned forward but heres the thing my friend this holy man this ibrahim he intends to become a martyr this weekend he will be carrying religious scrolls which of course security men would not dare to search a profound insult and inside the scrollssemtex you wouldnt need much to do the job at close quarters the prime minister would be blown to hell with everyone around him what a moment kupu roared and the door to the other room opened and liri staggered out trying to cover her torn dress with the raincoat and still clutching her handbag she stood there crying bitterly look at you kupu said disgusting who in the hell would want you go on get out but ive no money for a cab she wailed then you can walk in the rain better than a shower wash the stink off you at which point holley having had enough said no need for that liri im leaving myself ill be going by cab and ill drop you off suddenly kupu didnt seem as drunk as he had been what is this about you leaving i dont like the way you do business really then obviously you need to pay a visit to the next room where abu will indicate what is expected of you i dont think it will take long for you to get the point as holley stood up he produced the colt extended his arm and shot ali kupu twice in the heart knocking him back over the chair liri gave a strangled cry then leaned over to look abu seemed stunned and uncertain what to do liri recovered a little and turned to holley hes dead thats what i meant him to be can you drive yes take one of the vans and get out of here and you can also take the gladstone bag with you as far as im concerned will you be okay fine ive got a passport ill be out of paris first thing in the morning god bless you ill never forget you id rather you did he picked up the walther put the colt in his pocket and pulled on his rain hat liri was already disappearing into the night at the wheel of a van abu said what happens now you pick up the body carry him out to the jetty like a good boy and we dump him into the seine and if i refuse for starters ill have to shoot you in the right kneecap he produced the colt from his pocket hollow point cartridges abu youll never be able to stand up on the podium again you bastard abu told him went round the desk picked up ali kupu as if he were a rag doll and walked towards the other end of the warehouse holley followed it was raining harder than ever and abu paused looking down through the lights to the seine notre dame floating in the dark way up to the right now what straight to the end of the jetty and drop him in go on get on with it the big man walked through the lights holding the body in both hands paused at the end for a long moment then dropped the corpse in it surfaced for a moment then drifted away into the darkness abu turned and faced holley she wont get away with it that bitch or you the albanian mafia will hunt you both down thanks for reminding me since you are the only witness it leaves me with little choice there was sudden alarm on abus face and he put a hand out no lets discuss this but holleys hand was already swinging up the silenced colt coughed once the bullet hitting abu between the eyes and he lurched back over the end of the jetty into the water holley returned to the warehouse opened the small door by which hed entered and retrieved the umbrella hed left there he started to walk back to the barge thinking about it the albanian mafia was the bane of paris the deaths of abu and ali kupu wouldnt disturb the paris police in the slightest he would have to take a chance that liri would forget all about him but then she would value her own anonymity always with him a woman in trouble was one thing he could never turn away from in a way hed been a fool but there it was but what kupu had said about aqal qaeda was it just the idle boast of a drunkard or was there genuinely something to it whateverif there really was a plot to assassinate vladimir putin it would create chaos and that was bad for everybody it left him with only one choice and he quickened his pace and hurried back to the barge colonel josef lermov of the gru had been appointed londons head of station by putin himself and was the man whod taken daniel holley out of the lubyanka prison and told him to deal with ferguson and his people once and for all a business which had not really worked out as intended he answered the phone in london astonished at who was calling him good god daniel i cant believe it where are you josef london putin made me head of station here so he forgave you for your failure your failure too daniel but yes i am forgiven and i think you are also ive followed your success with a certain pride the algerians regard you highly malik is truly proud of you as if you were his son so hes been talking to malik and malik hasnt told me holley stored the information away thats nice so what can i do for you certain information has come my way concerning a possible attempt on vladimir putins life are you serious i can only put the facts before you and you must judge for yourself when he was finished there was total silence as if lermov was taking it all in so holley said okay the ravings of a drunken lunatic i know lermov cut in his voice hoarse the prime minister visits chechnya tomorrow afternoon and a meeting like the one you describe has been arranged between him and a mullah named ibrahim nadim the security on it has been massive not massive enough it seems holley said ill call the prime minister immediately but daniel im curious youre leaping to his defence why actually i admire many things about him even if we dont always see eye to eye hes taken the russian federation by the scruff of the neck and made it feel proud againhes a genuine patriot but mostly i simply dont think its a good idea to assassinate him neither do i thank you daniel im going now sitting there nursing a drink holley had a sudden urge to call roper and he did so finding him wide awake how did your business appointment turn out roper asked what the hell why shouldnt i tell you holley said the ramifications in a way touch the world i may just have saved vladimir putin from assassination roper took it surprisingly calmly tell me more which daniel did the first thing roper said was what am i going to do with you youre getting worse than dillon youve been shooting people again if ever two people deserved it those two did but isnt it incredible that the apparent boastings of a drunken fool turned out to be true because somebody talked somebody at the very heart of russian intelligence told the wrong person everyone in the business over there will be working flat out to find out who of course there is the mention kupu made about his uncle in tirana theyll hunt him down like a dog holley said i wouldnt like to think what theyre going to do to him to make him talk but the source of the leak is the thing its got to be at the highest level holley persisted and yet someone willing to deal with al qaeda and someone interested in getting rid of putin roper said a palace revolution god help whoever it is with putin on their case now to other matters the afghan business theres talk of training camps in northern pakistan but traditionally most of the good ones are in libya and algeria both dillon and i were trained in the same place though at different times shabwa deep in the algerian desert check up on it for me ill get right on it roper told him ill be there midmorning looking forward to it which only left hamid malik who would undoubtedly be sitting in his villa with its magical views of the great harbour of algiers biting his nails about the outcome of the kupu business better to get it over with praise be to allah to hear your voice malik told him ive been genuinely worried about this business daniel it didnt sit right with me you were right about kupu a bastard of the first order he even had connections with al qaeda no surely this cannot be there was a wariness in his voice now a touch of fear but then that was a common reaction of many arabs when a mention of al qaeda was made dont worry ali kupu is now feeding what fish there are in the seine accompanied by his revolting muscle man one abu allah preserve me malik was truly shocked you did this who else they were going to do worse to me tell me what happened i need to know in case of repercussions there wont be any two members of the albanian mafia turn up in the seineit happens all the time the paris police will say good riddance and move on but al qaeda what has that got to do with anything a great deal as it happens he told malik everything and when he was finished the algerian said you never do things by halves daniel where will it all end this time with lermov and his people rooting out those assassins did you know hes gru station head in london now he told me putin has forgiven him me too fine words but after this youll deserve a medal ill settle for never having to eat at the lubyanka again are you happy now malik shrugged i should be i suppose but even the slightest hint of anything to do with al qaeda freezes the heart yes the very name frightens the hell out of people holley agreed do you think they might be recruiting for afghanistan malik said quickly i wouldnt have thought so the taliban are perfectly capable of recruiting for themselves im talking about something different there are many britishborn muslims fighting out there malik laughed daniel one hears stories but this is nonsense pure myth im afraid not old friend ive seen the evidence heard recordings of radio communications in the heat of battle workingclass accents from many of the great cities in the uk i dont believe it ive heard it malik in fact ferguson dillon and miller have just had a meeting with the president in washington to work out what to do about it malik was stunned all right supposing it is true what can anyone do to prevent it if young british muslims decide to take a holiday in pakistan to visit the old folk then end up in a training camp in waziristan who can stop them its impossible well ferguson and his people are at least going to make an effort and ive offered to help malik was truly shocked but why you daniel this is not your business you could be asking for big trouble i have a grasp of the muslim world that few christians do i speak arabic and as a young volunteer in the ira i was trained in terrorism at shabwa i wonder if shabwa is still in business and omar hamza the camp commander what a bastard he was he would be seventy or more if he is still alive shabwa closed down some years ago though the ira no longer used it and as things changed for the german groups and eta and the like there was little need for the facility malik said the thought of young british muslims using it though why on earth would they want to come to algeria for their training you could have said that about the young irishmen too holley told him anyway im out of here off to london are you going to see ferguson yes i want to hear what he intends to do i feel very strongly about this matter if there is anything i can do i will malik gave in so be it the blessing of allah go with you do take care daniel dont i always it was very quiet sitting there in the darkness the long white curtains ballooning like sails at the window and malik went out to find a full moon and the terrace flooded with light the vista in the night of the harbour below was astonishingly beautiful he loved this city always had just as he loved daniel holley but trouble and daniel seemed to belong together naturally and malik was filled with a grim foreboding what now he asked softly leaning on the balustrade what next l ondo n n orthern i reland the gulfstream landed at farley field late that night fergusons daimler was waiting as well as the mercedes provided by the cabinet office for miller well get together later ferguson said ive got to get cracking and prepare that report for the prime minister his daimler moved away and miller said well take you to holland park sean his driver arthur fox was behind the wheel care to join me for a late dinner there no i need to get to dover street and sort this sack of mail that arthur has brought me fergusons not the only one with problems ive got the cabinet office on my back mentioning his sister he added i had a text from monica while you were asleep shes enjoying being visiting professor at harvard so much shes agreed to an extension she didnt tell me maybe shes going off you you mad irish bogtrotter and pigs might fly dillon told him tell her congratulations and ill be in touch now weve got an hour before we get to london so start on your mail and let me sleep two hours later the malik shipping plane landed at london city airport and taxied to the private facilitydaniel holley had decided to leave paris earlier than he had planned his diplomatic passport sped him through and fortyfive minutes later he was at the dorchester where he found concetto marietta the guest liaison manager waiting to escort him to one of the park suites he slept for a few hours and then he called roper when can we meet id love to see what your famous holland park safe house looks like from the inside fergusons seeing the prime minister this morning and miller probably feels he should show his face in the house but im here sos dillon whos upstairs asleep come along whenever you want well have lunch i might just do that i want to stop off and see a friend first but then ill come over ill see you when i see you holley walked up to shepherd market past the restaurants and the shops then paused at a door with the name selim malik painted in gold above it admired the egyptian handpainted temple effigies displayed on either side of the frame then pressed a button the door opened and selim was there exactly the same as the last time daniel had seen him small and happy with dark curling hair turning silver olive face fringe beard and good humour in his eyes he wore a ruffled shirt velvet jacket and trousers as always he was crying as he embraced daniel its so good to see you my cousin hamid phoned me to say i might expect you but still i am overcome this is a champagne moment selim malik produced a bottle of krug and poured each of them a glass saying its so wonderful the way everything has turned out youve outfoxed them all even the great putin hamid has told me of how you sorted those albanian bastards out and the al qaeda plot on putin he gripped holleys arm he will be your friend for life now i didnt do it for gain daniel told him i did it because what they were planning was wrong you are a saint selim got up but you must take great care people who say bin laden is dead are stupid what he is what he stands for will never die this doesnt mean i admire him i fear him but what i have said is true im afraid you have a point daniel agreed selim went into the other room and returned with a gladstone bag ive been keeping this in my strong room its exactly what you had last time there was an ankleholster a silenced colt and a couple of boxes of hollowpoint cartridges a silenced walther ammunition a razorsharp flick knife and a bulletproof vest this is wonderful daniel said but hang on to the knife and the vest i brought my own you must be prepared for any eventuality selim said if word of your involvement ever got out al qaeda would put you on its international hit list the blessings of allah would be on any man who disposed of you well lets hope they dont hear ive something else to ask you what do you know about britishborn muslims fighting for the taliban in afghanistan selim frowned where have you heard this some newspaper story i suppose not at all selim youre my friend last time we met we had to face bad men and great danger and you were brilliant so believe me when i say i know for a fact that many young british muslims are fighting in afghanistan the evidence has been presented to me let me tell you about it when holley was done selim was distressed what can i say i must believe what you tell me is true but a mystery man known only as shamrock leading taliban recruits in a successful battle with allied troops it still sounds incredible have you heard anything that would confirm it even a hint i dont know i have been to north pakistan and the border areas as an art dealer and of course there are many brits in that area contractors dealing with the pakistan army others offering their services as security experts many of them obviously exsoldiers i am sure there is a lot of illegal armsdealing with the taliban too but these are just guys out to make a buck this other business this shamrock he sighed wearily its so nonsensical that it must be true i shall ask around holley got up and picked up the gladstone bag id appreciate it im at the dorchester ill see myself out selim sat there thinking about it then reached for his mobile and started to ring round choosing a few old friends only people hed known in the art world for years people he felt he could trust military rule was the accepted way in algiers certainly to men such as hamid malik law and order was an essential requirement to the development of good business and this benefited the poor as well as the rich but even for a wealthy man it was sensible to cultivate people in the right places the man he was enjoying coffee with was certainly that colonel ali hakim a nononsense military policeman he and malik had been close friends over years of political upset and violence the kind that had made military rule so necessary in algiers in the first place what malik didnt realize however was that hakim had orders from the foreign ministry to cultivate him with the aim of keeping an eye on daniel holleys activities holleys access to the international scene was undoubtedly of advantage to the government but his past argued the need for a certain control as well which was where hakim came in malik poured the colonel another coffee and hakim said and how is daniel i was told he went to paris on your company plane he smiled gently forgive me but air traffic control passes such information to my office on a regular basis of course malik said and i understand he was tense and his hand shook as he poured another coffee hakim said you seem out of sorts is something worrying you malik said how long have we been friends i would say thirty years whats brought this on through years of unrest bloodshed revolution fundamentalist terror one government after anotherand yet here we are still just as much friends as when we were dodging bullets together back at the university if i cant trust you i cant trust anyone would you agree malik asked hakim said of course he put down his cup what is this old friend so malik told him everything the albanians and the business with putin afghanistan and shamrock when he was finished he said what do you think he had made the worst mistake of his life but colonel ali hakim delighted at such a treasure trove of information managed to look alarmed and worried at the same time this is grave news indeed we must proceed very carefully daniel will be seeing your cousin selim in london thats right he said he would value his opinion and this general charles ferguson i know of him of course he is a major player in the world of antiterrorism and covert operations so daniel intends to offer his services in this affair so he says but what do you think about british muslims operating with the taliban my friend thirty years in my line of work means that nothing surprises me any longer the muslim population of britain is substantial these days that a few misguided young men would be tempted to join in the battle for the prospect of glory would not surprise me but only a few i think he reached for his cap and swagger stick and got up i must go now try not to worry ill keep a close eye on things i promise you if anything of interest turns up ill report it to you it would be useful if you could do the same he went down the outside steps and walked away through the garden malik watched him go suddenly feeling very much better like many arabs ali hakim had grown tired of the uncertainty of arab politics the power usurped by one general after another and the autocracy of the men with their oil billions to back them up and then osama bin laden had appeared like an avenging angel instantly embraced by muslims all over the world colonel ali hakim among them in spite of nato and britain and america hakim still believed in what to him was the nobility of bin ladens message he had served al qaeda ever since he sat in his police land rover on a bluff looking out to sea an encrypted mobile in his left hand it had a tape device as well and he switched on to record and dictated everything malik had said he felt no guilt this was too important he ended by punching his personal recognition button and hitting send hakim dealt with a man known as the preacher the individual responsible for all londonbased operations who had been placed in charge by osama bin laden himself thanks to modern technology the preacher remained anonymous and untraceable though he knew the identity of everyone with whom he dealt but this did not apply to ali hakim uncomfortable with entrusting a mystery man with his life hakim had sought expert help from wali sofit a computer expert of genius who unfortunately for him was serving fifteen years imprisonment for transferring many thousands of dollars to various bank accounts in algiers presented with hakims special problem and even more special mobile phone plus the promise of future leniency sofit had gone to work hakim had told him he believed the preacher to be a major criminal of some sort sofit had been somewhat surprised to come up with the name of a professor hassan shah based in london but was delighted to be transferred to a soft job in the prison administration offices as a reward for his skill ali hakim waited in the land rover until a reply came back your information of crucial importance it will be dealt with as a matter of the highest priority hakim switched off so that was that he felt sorry for his old friend malik and hed always liked holley but the cause he served was more important than individuals he switched on his engine and drove down into the city towards the police headquarters the man known as the preacher hassan shah continued to sit on the bench outside the london school of economics where he had taken hakims call a pleasantlooking man of medium height he was wearing a khaki summer suit a faded denim shirt and tinted rayban sunglasses with steel rims his black hair was too long forty years of age an academic and a working barrister when he wished it with no wife or girlfriend which made some people talk he lived alone in the pleasant edwardian villa where hed been born in bell street west hampstead his parents had departed for pakistan years ago his father having retired as a surgeon he was thinking of them now because of hakims recording thinking of pakistan and the visit he had made on a holiday when he was sixteen when hed been taken to a youth camp and osama bin laden himself had appeared the speech he had made had shaped shahs life shah was a practising muslim but in a quiet way nothing flamboyant his rapid rise both as an academic and a barrister had to a certain extent been because he was a muslim the foreign office had sent him to bosnia to investigate war crimes and then pleased with his work had sent him again and again to iraq many times and kosovo hed been noticed no question of that and his success in court on a few difficult cases had led to the position he held now professor in international law at the london school of economics but hed been noticed elsewhere also the approaches cleverly disguised simple requests for legal opinions relating to islamic matters eventually he discovered that in effect hed been working for al qaeda without knowing itand then hed realized he didnt mind in fact that he welcomed the idea really an opportunity to serve the cause was what hed been looking for all his life his own experience of the law the courts the legal system the behaviours of the kind of people involvedtheyd all taught him a great deal about human nature he knew what made people tick how to handle them and most important of all what made people afraid to run the london operation for al qaeda required brains and organizing ability when it came to necessary violence he only had to make a call to bring in whoever was best for the job an inner circle of twenty stood ready to act the beauty of it was that not one of them knew hassanthey connected by encrypted mobiles only shah remained just a voice on the phone the preacher yes it all worked extremely well lets see what we can do about this he murmured softly and he made a call selim lancy was the result of a mixed marriage his father a sailor had insisted he be baptized samuel then gone back to sea never to return so his mother had made it selim the muslim equivalent and raised him in the faith he never tried to pretend he wasnt muslim and was particularly handy with his fists when he joined the army para where he endured three hard years in iraq and afghanistan rising to the rank of corporal his service ended with one bullet through his left side and another in the right thigh he passed through the rehabilitation centre where doctors put him together very nicely but the army decided that enough was enough and he was discharged he returned home and moved in with his mother who was still fit and well at first then started to attend the mosque again he was surprised at the respect everyone gave him and then realized whywhen overtures were made suggesting that as a good muslim he could serve al qaeda well the idea appealed to him just for the hell of it for the truth was he was anything but a good muslim he made a living as a hired driver now sitting behind the wheel of a silver mercedes handsome enough in a dark blue suit and regimental tie he was eating a chicken sandwich when his special mobile sounded where are you shah asked oh its you boss im at the back of harrods waiting for a customer im sitting behind the wheel of my new cara secondhand mercedes my compensation money from the army finally came through well thats nice for you shah told him i havent heard from you for a while is this a business call you could say that i want you to check on a man called selim malik hes an art dealer with a place in shepherd market whats he done he could be showing an unhealthy interest in rumours of british muslims serving with the taliban in afghanistan theyre not bleeding rumours theyre facts boss i should know i probably killed a few of them over there that isnt the point i want to know if hes actively investigating these stories check with other muslims in the market see what you can find out no rough stuff hes precious cargo whys that boss he knows things and hes got a friend named daniel holley whos a killer of the first order he may look malik up if he does you must let me know at once ive found a security photo of holley youll find it on line now lancy thumbed away at his mobile and holley appeared he doesnt look much to me boss dont go by looks idiot holleys a nihilist thats someone who believes nothing has any value and so he kills without a second of regret that includes you ill bear it in mind when do you want this a couple of days do what you can shah hung up now he thought what to do about shamrock hed been shocked to hear the name from hakim he checked his watch the stupid bastard was still up there at thirty thousand feet for at least another couple of hours better to wait and try to contact him at the talbot office he got up from the bench and walked quickly across the campus towards the university buildings at that same moment shamrock was sitting in the firstclass compartment of a british airways jumbojet flight from cairo his name was justin talbot he was fortyfive and looked younger favoured dark cropped hair and a slight stubble to the chin the fashion of the moment he wore jeans a light opennecked khaki shirt and a dark blue linen jacket his face was heavily tanned as if hed been out in the sun a lot which he had and had an aristocratic look to it members of the cabin crew had earlier noted that his english had a public school edge to it and he spoke with a cynical good humour that theyd found as intriguing as the fact that he was described on the passenger list as major talbot one of the girls approached and said it always gets boring with so few passengers not much to do nobodys got any money at the moment youre lucky to have any passengers she smiled i suppose youre right well be landing in an hour or so youll be glad to stretch your legs i bet its a long trip cairo to london actually i started in peshawar yesterday stopped off in cairo on business then joined you pakistan i hear its bad on the northwest frontier these days are you in the army major not any more twentyodd years was enough grenadier guards i did a certain amount in northern ireland both gulf wars bosnia and kosovo then two tours in afghanistan i was lucky to get out of that in one piece when i was shot in the right shoulder he smiled i decided that was it and took my papers he didnt mention the military cross hed earned in afghanistan and the years with the sas and the army air corps the young woman nodded seriously youve done your bit if you ask me what do you do now i work for the family firm talbot international we sell trucks to the pakistan army jeeps secondhand armoured cars and helicopters he smiled have i disappointed you she shook her head the other side of war she hesitated do you miss it the dark side i mean lets say theres nothing quite like it theres no drug that could possibly match the force the energy of the killing time in which youre immersing yourself war itself is the ultimate drug she looked a bit shocked well business must be booming with the war spilling over from afghanistan can i get you a drink large vodka would be good with iced tonic water and a twist of lemon she was back in three minutes and handed it to him enjoy he drank half of the drink straightaway and sat there suddenly yawning since lahore yesterday morning hed only had four hours sleep he finished the drink put the glass down tilted his seat back a hell of a trip and afghanistan had been particularly rough but bloody marvellous the buzz of action never failed to thrill him it was what hed missed when he left the army you could make millions out of the sale of secondhand military equipment in northern pakistanbut there was a lot more money to be made from dealing in illegal arms even respectable firms were at it and nobody was more respectable than talbot international its chairman general sir hedley chase presented the face of integrity itself at the small but elegant office in curzon street the real business took place in islamabad where dozens of firms jostled one another for advantage it had been only a step from selling illegal arms to providing training in their use hed enjoyed every moment of that in the mountains over the border in afghanistan and then it had been only logical to take the next stepfrom training the taliban to leading them in battle hed immediately been seized by the old thrill and he felt no guilt at all the surprise had been when al qaeda had discovered what he was up to and not only approved but insisted he continue the strange thing was that there had been a thrill to that too it wasnt as if he needed the money it was all part of a wonderful lunatic madness anyway right now he needed rest and recreation it would be nice to see his mother again he hadnt kept in touch much this time it was better to use mobile and satellite phones sparingly these days unless they were totally encrypted and encoded too many people failed to realize that every conversation you made was out there somewhere and capable of being retrieved he wondered if his mother had made one of her rare visits to the family estate talbot place in county down her own mother mary ellen had died the previous year but his grandfather colonel henry to the servants was still alive at ninetyfive soldier lawyer politician member of parliament at stormont and a grand master in the orange lodge colonel henry was a resolute defender of the protestant cause who had loathed roman catholicsfenians as he called themall his life now in his dotage he was surrounded by workers and house servants who were mainly catholic thanks to mary ellen a protestant herself who had employed them for years justin talbots mother despised the man talbot yawned again and decided that if his mother had gone to ulster he would fly across himself possibly in one of the firms planes he could use a break he closed his eyes and drifted off at that moment his mother jean talbot was crossing a hillside high above carlingford lough the irish sea way beyond a seventyoneyearold woman slim and fit and young for her age in both looks and energy as the irish saying went was wearing an australian drovers coat heavy boots a cap of donegal tweed and carrying a walking stick the house dog nell a black flatcoat retriever was about her business running hither and thither jean reached her destination a stone bothy with a bench outside she sat down took out a packet of cigarettes and lit one the sun shone the sky was blue and the morning wind had dropped to a dead calm this was an amazing place with an incredible backdrop the mourne mountains far down below was the village of kilmartin and talbot place the splendid old georgian house that had been the family home for two hundred and fifty years the house in which she had been born she stubbed out her cigarette carefully stood up whistled to nell and turned it was good to be back and yet as always she already felt restless and ill at ease as usual her father was the problem during the second world war with him away and her mother in charge she had been educated at a local catholic boarding school run by nuns who accepted daygirls and didnt mind a protestant or two she had never known her father and was terrified of the arrogant anticatholic bully who returned after the war and was outraged to find his daughter in the hands of nuns and bloody fenians all over the estate mary ellens quiet firmness defeated him as did the good humour of his tenants who smiled and touched their caps to colonel henry convinced as jean talbot realized as she grew up that he was a raving lunatic the nuns succeeded with her so well that she was accepted by st hughs college oxford to study fine art to her father busy with the law and politics at stormont it was all a waste of time but she had enough talent to then be accepted by the slade school of fine art university college london after oxford mary ellen hugged her in delight but her father said it was time she settled down and gave him an heir her answer was to get pregnant by a sculptor named justin monk a roman catholic separated from his wife whod refused him a divorce on religious grounds shortly after the birth hed been badly injured in a motorcycle accident jean was able to visit him once and show him the baby and promised to name it after him he died soon afterwards when henry talbot and mary ellen came to visit her in her london lodgings he had looked at justin in his cot and destroyed any hope his daughter might have had left for a future relationship with her father a bastard is that the best you can do at least hes a protestant i suppose thats something ive got things to do im meeting people at westminster ill leave you to your mother after he had gone mary ellen said is he a protestant justin begged me to have him baptized in the faith what could i do he was dying do you hate me for it my darling i love you for it it was the decent thing to do she embraced the baby but id make it our secret if i were you if they had even a hint of it on the estate it would be all over kilmartin all over county down jean had said and what about my son dont tell him either its a burden to tell a child and expect him to hold it secret one day in the future when you think its right you can tell him so what will you do now i intend to continue my work at the slade they feel that i have a gift for portraiture and i intend to concentrate on that excellent but youll need a home ill stay a bit in london and well find you a house in mayfair i think and well need a housekeeper and a nanny but what will he say hes left everything to me we can afford it dear i dont think youve ever appreciated how wealthy you and justin will be one of these days whether you like it or not talbot money is old moneyand youd be surprised how much property we own in the west end of london in fact now that i think of it theres a superb regency house on marley court off curzon street very convenient for park lane and hyde park lets take a look marley court it was and her beloved son had grown up there and gone to school as a dayboy at st paulsshe couldnt bear the thought of sending him away his visits to talbot place were frequent of course particularly during the long summers for his grandmother adored him and his grandfather grudgingly admitted he was a fine rider he was also popular with the estate workers and the locals but their respect for mary ellen ensured that anyway through the long hard brutal days of the troubles talbot place had remained inviolate because of her it was remarkable when you considered that most catholics in the area were nationalists and the provisional ira was so powerful that the countryside from warrenpoint as far as crossmaglen in county armagh was designated bandit country by the british army talbot place could have been burnt to the ground not a stick nor stone left standing and certain extreme elements would have done exactly that but local opinion stayed their hand half the village was employed on the estate and mary ellen and the boy were inviolatewhich also meant that colonel henrys life was spared as well though it wasnt deserved many people would say there had been a problem in august when her son was fifteen when the british army had suffered its worst defeat in the troubles that terrible ambush only a few miles away at narrow water near warrenpoint that many of the local men were ira did not surprise her it meant that some of her workers would be too but she had been shocked to hear that a nineteenyearold stable boy named sean kelly son of jack kelly publican of the kilmartin arms and a great friend of her sons had been killed in an exchange of fire with wounded soldiers at narrow water justin had been at talbot place for the summer holidays and she had joined him for a couple of weeks before returning to london for the start of the autumn term at school he had been terribly upset at the death of his friend there was no question of them attending the funeral even mary ellen admitted that the deaths of all those highlanders made it impossible and yet justin had gone of his own accord had stood at sean kellys graveside had been hugged and thanked by all the kellys and admitted to the clan the priest father michael cassidy had also blessed him for it the confrontation at talbot place had been terrible such was colonel henrys rage hed slapped justin across the face called him a damn traitor and jean had pulled her father off and called him a bully and a bigot justin had shouted at him called him a prod bastard and said he would join the ira if he only could every servant in the house had heard it jean talbot and her son left for london within the hour there was a long break for a while eventually mary ellen smoothed things over but jean visited rarely after that her gradual success with her painting the fact that shed been commissioned to do a portrait of the queen mother meant nothing to her father with justin it was different he was after all the heir and when he chose sandhurst royal military academy instead of university and embarked on an army career the colonel had been delighted justin made one thing clear though after finishing at sandhurst and joining the grenadier guards hed visited the kilmartin arms and given his oath to jack kelly that he would never fight against them in ulster in any event there was enough happening elsewhere to keep him occupied jean knew that hed flown for the army air corps helicopters and light aircraft all over the world she also knew that hed served with the sas but only becausemany years earlier when hed been spending a weeks leave with her in mayfaira dispatch rider had delivered an envelope a recall to duty at once justin had told her and had gone off to pack leaving the letter on the desk in the study shed read it of course and discovered for the first time that he was serving with sas she hadnt mentioned it there was no point as he hadnt told her not that it mattered now all that was over afghanistan had seen to it and he had survived covered with glory wounded and decorated and alive which was something to be thankful for these days the business trips to pakistan and the northwest frontier were only something to do he needed action of some sort it was his nature and shed long since come to terms with the fact that women were something he could never take seriously so here she was back at the place again because of a call from hannah kelly the housekeeper to tell her colonel henryd had another bad turn and that was something you couldnt ignore where a ninetyfiveyearold man was concerned shed flown over at once seen him with dr larry ryan and there was little comfort from him one of these days the bad turn would carry colonel henry off and perhaps that would be in his own best interests but not this time so she faced the prospect of a miserable day or so with a halfmad old man in his dotage shouting one insult after another at the servants in language out of the gutter sitting in his wheelchair in that conservatory that was like a miniature jungle a decanter of cognac and a glass on the cane table beside him she looked at her watch and saw with a start that shed been sitting there a long time she rose dreading the return to the house and then like a miracle her mobile sounded as she started down the track to the house and nell barked frantically its me justin told her ive just got off the plane at heathrow tried you in london and got your message how is he still with us and even more dreadful than usual how was your trip wonderful theres so much going on up there on the border loads of companies vying with one another the war inflates everything its like a bad movie youre lucky to get a hotel bed ive got to call in at the office meet with sir hedley and inform him how things went she was disappointed i was so hoping to see you so you shall ill drive out to frensham weve got four planes parked there i think ill use the beech baron i havent flown in that she said a new acquisition twin engine can carry six and it takes off and lands on grass so ill be able to land at drumgoole aero club no need to feel down mum ill be with you later in the afternoon all i can say is thank god darling see you soon he switched off leaving her there on the track suddenly unbelievably happy after dropping dillon off at holland park miller had continued on to dover street and got some sleep since his wifes murder the previous year in a bomb attack aimed at miller himself he had lived alone managing with just a daily housekeeper a jamaican widow named lily pond who saw miller as a tragic figure who needed mothering miller was in his study working on the stack of mail when his codex sounded and ferguson said the prime ministers decided he wants you with me can i ask why i dont know harry i suppose he wants your opinion as well as mine you are known in the house as the prime ministers rottweiler so get your arse down here doublequick twenty minutes miller said and called arthur to get the car he found ferguson sitting outside the pms study in conversation with cabinet secretary henry frankel a good friend to miller in bad times youre looking fit harry he shook hands so youve been visiting the great man himself in washington if you say so henry miller answered i know the general thinks im a terrible gossip but its not true love lets face it all the worlds secrets flow through here yes well save them for your memoirs ferguson told him do we go in now of course now that harrys arrived frankel crossed the corridor and opened the door ive examined all the material your major roper has put together the pm said and im not surprised the president was so disturbed we all are prime minister ferguson told him i believe it to be one of the gravest matters ive put before you for some time the prime minister was obviously concerned and turned to miller what do you think id say its a small number of people were talking about british muslims in afghanistan but its a pattern all over the world isnt it islamic extremism there is a muslim saying beauty is like a flag in the city the pm nodded the green flag of islam flying over downing street flying over a damn sight more than that ferguson said id say weve got to do something about it i agree the pm nodded but individual young muslim men buying a plane ticket to pakistan is one thing a system that facilitates this is quite another does such an organization exist thats what we need to find out the man who calls himself shamrock could be the key here find him and we may be able to discover the rest of course prime minister ferguson got up as did miller well get on with it the door opened and they left passing henry frankel who stood to one side and winked at miller both their limousines were waiting outside miller said where do we start then ferguson glanced at his watch it was noon exactly i could use a drink tell fox to deliver you to the garrick club the garrick miller was surprised i thought you were a member of the cavalry club of course but everybody likes the garrick all those actors and writers and so on it makes a difference from matters military ill see you in the bar justin talbot went straight to his mothers house at marley court to unpack and get a change of clothes he had just come out of the shower when his mobile sounded he answered and found himself speaking to the preacher good to hear from you talbot said i had an excellent trip you had a disastrous trip you stupid fool hassan told him talbot said what the hell i dont have to put up with you talking to me like that listen to the tape i received talbot then youll see why im angry talbot did and with some horror when it was finished he called the preacher back and shah answered at once what have you got to say it was in the heat of battle so i shot my mouth off regrettable and i apologize but i dont see how it hurts us you think not this general charles ferguson is a legend in the counterterrorism field he has been an absolute thorn in the flesh of al qaeda and so are the people who work for him dillon holley miller theyll all start nosing around if holley hadnt kept his business partner hamid malik informed of all his doings and malik hadnt confided in hakim wed never have known so whats the problem talbot asked if this holley guy tells his business partner about everything then we should be able to find out about what happens next shouldnt we you just dont get it do you all charles ferguson and this major roper had to go on was a muddled tape and then in you came with that absurdly dramatic code name shamrock announcing to the world what a spectacular warrenpoint all over again and it worked big time osama will be delighted talbot had made a mistake there and he knew it so i got a bit overenthusiastic and what was your touching dedication supposed to mean you can rest in peace now sean night bless talbot said thats got nothing to do with you everything has something to do with me answer me sean kelly was my friend a stable boy at talbot place he was only nineteen but he was a provo like all his family some of those wounded highlanders managed to fight back and sean took a bullet how heartwarming when you joined the army the troubles must have given you a problem didnt it knowing which side you were on i was never in ulster with the grenadier guards but you certainly were with twentytwo sas more than twenty covert operations wasnt it one in county tyrone where your unit ambushed and killed eight members of the pira i wonder how your friends in kilmartin would react if they knew you bastard justin talbot said action and passion thats what you like a bloody good scrap and you dont care who the opponent is of course youve never been certain which side you were on fenian or prod if only your mother had told you that you were catholic years ago you might have turned out different justin talbot struggled to control his rage that is nonsense what the hell are you saying your father was a catholic of course he was everyone knew that but im a protestant my grandfather is a presbyterian unionist who loathes catholics beyond anything else on this earth he enjoyed telling me throughout my childhood that i was a bastard but at least a protestant one and he was wrong you were baptized into the roman catholic faith on the fifth of august nineteen sixtyfour two weeks after your birth by father alan winkler of st mary the virgin church dun street mayfair talbot tried deep breathing to steady himself what are you saying is this true did anybody know i believe your grandmother did she was a remarkable woman to put up with your grandfather all those years and your mother takes after her youre hardly a fool you must have been aware that im a careful man i do my research justin all right talbot said wearily where is all this leading everything stays as it is since the peace process many old ira hands have sought employment in london what about them im sure your ira connections in kilmartin would be able to contact such people if necessary what for ferguson and his people are formidable foes it pays to be just as formidable an opposition what the hell are you talking about open warfare in the london streets no im saying we must be prepared the opposition knows your code name is shamrock they surmise you might be irish your leadership of the ambush seems to indicate you are a soldier of experience and because of the name warrenpoint it reinforces their opinion that you could be a military man we must stay vigilant thats what im saying if we receive the slightest hint from hakim or anyone else that theyre getting close to your identity then well have to deal with them shah took a breath all right thats enough for now what are your plans my mother is at talbot place im going to fly myself over to join her this afternoon the old man is poorly again im amazed he hasnt managed to fall downstairs by now perhaps he needs a nudge dont think i havent thought of it he dressed quickly in clothes suitable for flying jeans and an old jacket he had plenty of clothes at talbot place and so took only a flight bag with a few things in it before leaving though he phoned sir hedley chase at his house in kensington to tell him he intended to call chases job as chairman of talbot international might be a wellpaid sinecure but the old boy was sharp and took things seriously im just going out for lunch the general said at the garrick club got a taxi waiting why dont you join me justin talbot hesitated for he wanted to be on his way but there was that military thing that bound soldiers together and had done so since time immemorial a general was a general and you didnt say no a couple of hours wouldnt make any difference ill be with you as soon as i can sir hedley he said and was driving out of the garage in his mothers mini cooper five minutes later at the club sir hedley chase was greeted warmly by the porters on duty and he told them who his guest was going to be then helped by his stick he negotiated the stairs and went into the bar it wasnt particularly busy two men were sitting comfortably at a corner table drinking brandy and ginger ale and sir hedley realized with pleasure that he knew one of them what a perfectly splendid idea charles a horses neck ill have one too how long has it been a year two he asked three ferguson told him and said to his guest general sir hedley chase grenadier guards a captain when i was a subaltern very ard on me he was made a man of you sir hedley told him and this said ferguson is major harry miller intelligence corps member of parliament and undersecretary of state for what sir hedley enquired for the prime minister sir miller shook hands oh one of those are you ill have to be careful the queen gentlemen he toasted them what are you up to charles still a security wallah im at the pms bidding what about you bit of a sinecure really im chairman of talbot international were in the middle east and pakistan supply the army there with trucks helicopters armoured cars that sort of thing the gulf war and afghanistan must have boosted business miller said certainly has weve made millions and weaponry ferguson asked we decided as a matter of policy not to bother theres lots of oldfashioned communist rubbish available masses of aks rpgs stingers on the northwest frontier weapons like that are flogged in the bazaars like sweeties its dirty business lots of people do it even some respectable firms but we dont talbot international is familyowned the exchairman an old comrade of mine colonel henry talbot old ulster family protestant to the bone henry was an mp at stormont and they made him a grand master in the orange lodge i always said he was to the right of ian paisley and now retired the grandsons the managing director hes the one who really runs things major justin talbot grenadier guards youll be pleased to know got shot up on his last tour in afghanistan and felt it was time to go he goes where i cant i managed to make it to islamabad last year for discussions with the pakistan government but that was it im too old for that kind of thing its bloody rough these days all sorts of illegal arms traffic passing over the afghan border arms for the taliban ferguson asked who else sir hedley frowned have you got a particular interest in this miller answered the prime minister is concerned about reports that british muslims are serving with taliban forces sir hedley nodded ive seen the odd newspaper reports to that effect but i cant believe its in any great numbers i know one thing it would be treason he turned to miller wouldnt you agree yes i would but in the brave new world we live in itd be a nightmare for the government to prosecute he smiled crookedly but well have to cross that bridge when we come to it would you like another drink sir i think i would sir hedley said and added heres justin just coming in the door justin talbot had left his flight bag with the porter and had put on a tie he stood there smiling a slightly incongruous figure with the tie and the old flying jacket come in justin and join us ive just run into an old comrade major general charles ferguson and his friend major harry miller justin talbot was thunderstruck of all the people to meet the two men hed been most warned about the voice in his brain said dont panic smile your background is impeccable youre managing director of a firm worth hundreds of millions of pounds youre a war hero so he produced that easy charm and said to ferguson quite an honour general youre a legend in the regiment it had the desired effect for ferguson was only human but miller was not taken with him and wondered why the deliberate stroking of ferguson perhaps or the wonderboy appearance certainly the air of cynical good humour was used for effect and most people probably fell for it especially women youll have a drink with us sir hedley asked no can do im back from lahore and found out my mother has gone over to county down to see to her father whos apparently not too well im flying myself over so no alcohol for me indeed but wellmet anyway our friend major miller here is apparently an undersecretary of state although were not allowed to know what ministry sounds intriguing talbot said weve been having an interesting debate about the suggested presence of british muslims fighting for the taliban said sir hedley i see talbot said ferguson said theres a concern in government circles have you any opinion on the matter which was exactly the question talbot had been hoping for i certainly have its not a suggested presence its very real i have excellent connections with the pakistan army and they tell me many of the voices on the radio are definitely english have you heard them yourself miller asked yes on a few occasions when i was up near peshawar and very close to the afghan border sometimes you can pick up the sounds of battle on the other side in afghanistan itself can i ask what you were doing there miller went on we sell trucks used for army transportation and driven by civilian personnel part of our sales package guarantees maintenance a big operation ferguson told him yes it is if the government is concerned about anything up there i suppose they could always send somebody to take a look sir hedley broke in wed be happy to assist in any way maybe you and miller could go and have a looksee charles its certainly a thought ferguson said would you be there he asked talbot not if i can help it its the pits and ive had enough of afghanistan to last me a long time but i have excellent staff and id be happy to put them at your disposal just let me know i will indeed come on harry wed better move ferguson got up take care of yourself hedley old son lets not leave it so long nice to meet you major he shook talbots hand my regards to your grandfather i had some dealings with him when i was in belfast at the height of the troubles frankly he was a bit of a bastard talbot held on to his hand for a moment youre wrong general he was the bastard ferguson and miller went downstairs and called in their limousines what did you think asked ferguson of talbot i cant say i warmed to him perfectly understandable harry hes too goodlooking hes heir to a family fortune of eighthundred million pounds hes a war hero shall i carry on id rather you didnt miller said what now time for a council of war ill see you at holland park ferguson got in his daimler and was driven away an hour later they met in the computer room ferguson presiding with miller holley roper and their occasional colleagues harry and billy salter ferguson said im pleased to say that daniel holley has agreed to join us and offer his special services to the matter in hand harry salter glared at holley then said this is completely out of order this geezer arranged for someone to try and burn down my pub which is still standing ferguson told him were all in one piece including lady monica starling whose life he saved its like war harry yesterdays enemies are todays allies all sins are forgiven daniel has even passed on to our old friend colonel josef lermov information about a possible al qaeda assassination attempt on vladimir putin christ harry salter said whose side are you on holley you certainly spread yourself around he turned to ferguson okay then whats it all about roper said ive got quite a show for you listen and learn when it was over harry salter said what a bastard that shamrock guy calls himself british he should have his balls chopped off rather drastic but you have a point ferguson said anyone else billy salter said the business about these young muslims turning up in battle with the taliban yes its diabolical but ive got a feeling there probably is no organization as such behind this theyve all got relatives in pakistan they were born here theyve got a passport they can travel there any time they want so maybe some mullah at the local mosque whos a jihadist has given them an address thats probably the extent of it i agree with him dillon put in i think the important thing here is for us to find out who shamrock is youre right sean miller told him but we cant exactly go hunting for him in the depths of helmand province he isnt out there leading a life of daily hardship hes staging a spectacular as he calls it and then getting out of there who knows where he is i still say irelands the place to go dillon said visit the scene of the original crime ferguson opened his briefcase took out a book and put it on the table next to roper who picked it up and examined it from waterstones a history of the ira with a detailed account of the warrenpoint ambush of nineteen seventynine anybody can read about it sean it doesnt have to be somebody who was there and as ive already mentioned miller said ive used the warrenpoint disaster in my lectures at sandhurst for ten years hundreds and hundreds of officer cadets have heard that lecture lets move on ferguson said by chance major miller and i bumped into an old comrade of mine today general sir hedley chase chairman of talbot international he was with his managing director major justin talbot who was just back from pakistan i presume you know the firm daniel of course i do its one of the biggest in the business familyowned the chairman for years colonel henry talbot was involved in ulster politics and thats a polite way of putting it dillon said the kind of oldfashioned protestant politician whod have welcomed another potato famine just to reduce the catholic population to manageable proportions you appear to feel strongly on the matter sean ferguson said and why wouldnt i living only a few miles up the road at collyban for some years in my youth it was with my uncle on my mothers side mickeen oge flynn good man still has a garage there and i can assure you colonel henry talbot was one of the most hated men in county down the grand house he had where he lorded it over the catholic scum of kilmartin as he described them the only thing that kept someone from shooting him was his wife mary ellen mickeen oge used to say if ever a saint walked this earth it was her even if she was a protestant he certainly sounds a real old bastard harry salter said warrenpoint must have been a bitter pill for him to swallow ferguson said only a few miles away dillon said coldly enough of the ould sod and back to our problem we know there are british muslims in the taliban ranks we have recordings of them im with billy in thinking that most of them simply make their own way to pakistan and join up there i shouldnt imagine there is any organization as such information about where to join is probably available at any local mosque so what is your point ferguson demanded that the job comes down to one thing find shamrock the president asked me if i thought we could and i said yes he said dont let me down and with all due respect to you general i dont intend to ferguson turned to holley for twentyfive years behind the respectable front of malik shipping youve sold arms to anyone who could pay you must be one of the most experienced dealers in the business who would we get in touch with in our discussion with talbot and sir hedley we kept it general made no mention of shamrock they both felt that if the government was concerned about the situation they should send someone to take a look talbot said he had an excellent staff who would be willing to help they wouldnt be much help for what youre looking for holley said theyre far too respectable i could provide two or three names the kind of people who have their hands in everything but you really have to do it facetoface its the only way peshawar international may not be the biggest airport in the world but itll handle an raf gulfstream i should think harry miller said to him what a splendid idea ferguson turned to miller by heavens i could go with you ive excellent contacts with pakistan intelligence thats up to you said holley but be careful what you say pakistan intelligence is riddled with corruption and taliban sympathizers as for shamrock id keep that for the lowlifes whose names ill give you thanks for the warning daniel give roper the names of the dealers you suggest we meet in peshawar if you would i can do more than that they all have laptops ill give you their email addresses just remember these are ruthless men all out to make a buck they dont know what a scruple is id go armed at all times give me the names of this unsavoury lot roper said dak khan jose fernandez and jemal hamid ill give you their emails later billy salter said so while you and harry are over in pakistan what do we do try to behave yourselves ferguson told him and watch dillon for me we wont be away long holleys codex sounded he answered it and found josef lermov holley waved frantically at roper and mouthed speaker roper turned it on and lermovs voice boomed a little i thought id let you know that theres been a terrible accident in chechnya mullah ibrahim nadim met a bad end on a country road outside some small town with an unpronounceable name a car bomb killed him two bodyguards and his driver holley felt no remorse for the part he had played in the affair well he wanted paradise so at least he got that inshallah it was his time you know lermov said during the battle of algiers muslim girls threw away their traditional clothes cut their hair and wore makeup and pretty frocks to fool french paratroopers into believing they were europeans that way they were able to visit coffee shops and leave bombs under the seats yes i know that very ingenious holley said whats the point the point my dear daniel is that chechnyan muslim women appear to have adopted the same idea an unfortunate colonel in the grus planning cabinet apparently made the mistake of enjoying the charms of such a woman and how is he dead he shot her and then shot himself well there you are thats the way it goes holley told him prime minister putin has asked me to tell you he owes you one daniel holley laughed now that really does frighten me josef thank him for the kind thought but i think ill still lock my door at nights lermov hung up harry salter said a kind of admiration in his voice what a cool bastard you are my old son ill have to keep my eye on you well that will keep me safe if nothing else holley told him what happens now luncheon ferguson said is that all right with everybody not me roper said youve given me the rush job of all time ive got a million things to do you lot just get on with it so where shall we eat ferguson asked what about the al bustan in shepherd market holley said great lebanese food lets go ferguson said selim lancy had been keeping an eye on his namesake at his shop which was easy enough to do in the congested and narrow streets of the market there were also numerous cafes with tables outside and he was sitting at one observing the shop when the party from holland park arrived at the al bustan which was just on the corner it was a surfeit of riches for the preacher had followed up his photo of holley with further ones covering fergusons most important people and now here they were just dropped into his lap the waiters pushed tables close so they could sit together under an awning outside the restaurant and wine was ordered it was all very goodhumoured lancy sat down at a small table on the edge of things but not too close he didnt need to be close for the hearing enhancer he slipped into his right e eavesdrop he ordered wine himself and began reading his newspaper it was ferguson who gave it away by asking holley how long since you were last in peshawar daniel five months ago holley said flying visit i was only there three days long enough to complete business then get out you wouldnt want to linger and you shouldnt general a moment later ferguson had to answer his codex he listened for a few moments then said excellent he said to the others that was roper the pakistan embassy has agreed to our visit a military police colonel named ahmed atep will be our contact major parry and lacey have been alerted and are already on their way to farley to get the gulfstream ready and what about the dealers i suggested you meet holley asked ropers emailed them and said it was your personal request that they cooperate has he had replies yes from this dak khan and jose fernandez who both indicated that they would help in any way possible ferguson shrugged they probably think there might be money in it and jemal hamid apparently killed in a roadside ambush of a convoy close to the border some weeks ago on the pakistan side it would appear so holley shrugged thats the way it goes its a thoroughly dangerous adventure general when do you go ferguson glanced at his watch as soon as were done with lunch so lets order gentlemen lancy asked for his bill paid the waiter and walked away not only satisfied but excited his mercedes was parked in a nearby mews and he went and sat behind the wheel and reported in to the preacher professor hassan shah was in the garden of his house sitting at a table on the terrace marking a students thesis excellent he said when lancy was finished youve done brilliantly is there anything to report on malik ive had a word with a few of the brotherhood with shops in the area he was speaking of the army of god on the face of it a muslim charity he seems harmless enough then you can forget him from now on i want you to drive out to this airfield and confirm their departure youve got it boss ferguson said theyd be leaving in three hours so ill wait till nearer the time i dont want to stand out or anything just get it right after lunch holley stopped for a moment at the dorchester to collect a couple of things before going on with ferguson and miller to the airfield just as he was going back out through the door malik phoned him from algiers how are you i was speaking to cousin selim and hes worried about you no need holley said im taking it easy for the time being its ferguson and major miller who are putting themselves in harms way theyre going on a flying visit to peshawar to nose around but why just to get a feel for the situation i gave them names of people who might be able to help dak khan jose fernandez and jemal hamid and have they agreed to help it seems that jemal hamid was killed in a convoy ambush the other week but the other two have ferguson and miller will be looked after by a colonel ahmed atep does he mean anything to you no hes not familiar to me though its years since i was there wasnt he there when you visited five months ago no he must be new so what happens now malik asked i havent the slightest idea i just had a meeting with all of fergusons people i was able to put a face to everybody something i couldnt do before roper ferguson miller dillon and the two gangsters the salters gangsters malik said well thats what they used to be young billy is mi now and his uncle has millions in developments by the thames it pays better than robbing banks everything is a joke to you daniel its the only thing that got me through five years in the lubyanka prison my friend take care malik ill be in touch he hung up malik sighed deeply troubled by the direction in which the whole affair was going there was a step on the terrace and he turned to find colonel ali hakim there forgive the intrusion your gatekeeper let me into the garden i was passing and wondered how you are not good at all malik said i worry so much about daniel i just cant help it hakim managed a look of concern my dear old friend whats he been up to now farley field belonged to the ministry of defence and was restricted but the public car park next to it was not and was popular with planespotters due to the increase in military traffic lancy had out his binoculars along with the rest of them and found the gulfstream waiting to go the steps down two raf officers beside it he could recognize ferguson dillon and daniel holley standing together by a daimler limousine and then a mercedes appeared the man who got out was miller it was fivethirty he waited finally the gulfstream started across the runway and rose into the air he got back into the mercedes and called the preacher theyve just left excellent shah said lets hope they enjoy themselves youre going to do the business on them arent you boss i would think peshawar dangerous enough without my help shah told him lancy said what do i do now go back to making a living selim im sure the ladies adore your manly good looks youll find by the way that your bank account has been inflated by five thousand pounds i know your mothers cancer treatment means she cant work give her my blessing but remember you belong to osama to which there could be no answer and selim lancy switched off shaking his head what kind of geezer was he the preacher one minute he was the lord of life and death and the next he was the soul of kindness and charity lancy had punished people for him wounding to keep muslim wrongdoers in line and hed shot dead two muslim men from kosovo involved in a prostitution ring importing young girls death was all they deserved the preacher had said and lancy had obliged dumping the bodies in the thames it didnt bother him after all it was small beer after afghanistan on the other hand the business with his mother was a debt that should be repaid he sat there behind the wheel of the mercedes thinking about the situation ferguson and miller were out of the way which left dillon holley and the salters he smiled thanks to the information the preacher had supplied he knew all about the salters and their history intrigued him east end gangsters whod made good millionaires up there with the toffs he admired that and felt no animosity they were on the wrong side that was all there was a restaurant called harrys place and a pub the dark man in wapping it was where salter had started out his favourite place and he had a boat there called the linda jones tied up at the end of the jetty outside thats where any aggravation would hurt him most lancy smiled and took out his mobile like many young and unemployed muslim men kalid hasim made a bare living on the fringes of the drug trade as a delivery boy it was a great risk for a small return but hasim considered it only temporary for him boxing was the way out and he was punching the bag in his gym in camden when his mobile sounded hed put it with his towel on a bench its me number one man lancy said they had never met lancy was a voice on the phone since the first call when hed suggested that hasim and a couple of his friends might like to smash up a shop selling antimuslim literature promising five hundred pounds in the post hasim had taken a chance and had been delighted with the outcome hed repeated the exercise on many occasions so what have you got just listen he explained the situation just aggravation is what im after smash up a few motors in the car park and theres a boat tied up at the jetty sinking that would be good when do you want it done tonight but ive got to warn you the salters are real hard men so dont hang about in and out before they know whats going on theres a grand in it for you consider it done good lad lancy told him but remember that right hand youre leaving yourself wide open when you punch fuck off hasim told him not nice a decent young muslim talking like that and then he surprised hasim by speaking in arabic for the first time allah is great and osama is his prophet he switched off and drove away meanwhile the preacher was contacting his most important al qaeda asset in peshawar he got an instant response the day of wrath must come shah said establishing his credentials then only the believers will survive it is good to hear you preacher how can i help his asset answered not me but the cause of al qaeda you are to have two visitors they have just left london by gulfstream they are important because they are on british government business but they are a problem for us who are they a general charles ferguson and major harry miller they are there on a factfinding mission there is alarm in london over reports of young british muslims fighting for the taliban which is true yes but there is more to their trip there is evidence of a mercenary commander operating with the taliban who uses the code name shamrock have you heard anything of such a man not a whisper are you sure about this perhaps its only rumour no shamrock is one of al qaedas most important assets his identity must be protected at all costs as far as you are concerned he doesnt exist my information is that ferguson and miller have been promised the assistance of two men in peshawar their names are dak khan and jose fernandez i know these men well illegal arms dealers amongst other things i can put my hand on them at any time as regards the visitors from london do i frighten them or kill them both ferguson and miller have done great harm to al qaeda in the past i think it is time that their debts were paid no problem leave it with me osamas blessing on you shah hung up and the man at his desk at military police headquarters in peshawar colonel ahmed atep lit a cigarette and sat back smiling so life could get interesting the prospect pleased him very much n orthern i reland l ondon earlier in the day justin talbots flight had taken him over north wales and anglesey and now he was sweeping in towards the mourne mountains a wonderful sight on a perfect day it had been an excellent flight but he hadnt enjoyed it as much as usual his dealings with the preacher had been deeply disturbing it wasnt just the shock of discovering that his motherd had him baptized a catholic as a baby it was more that the preacher knew about his exploits with the sas which were supposedly top secret where in the hell had all that come from the power of these al qaeda people was frightening and he cursed the day hed ever got involved he wondered for a moment if he could buy his way out on his grandfathers death he would become fabulously rich and he was cynical enough by nature to believe that most people in life had their price particularly when you were talking in the millions but on the other hand islamists like al qaeda men who could kill and execute without a seconds hesitation had rigid moral and theological codes that westerners found it difficult to understand in the end money meant little to them he doubted that was his escape he turned parallel to the mourne mountains as they swept down to the sea and dropped on to the long grass runway of the aero club just outside the village of drumgoole there were three hangars five small aircraft parked on the grass a small terminal building with a cafe and a stub of a control tower above it in front of the terminal was a maroon shogun his mother leaning against it wearing sunglasses because of the glare watching as an overalled mechanic waved him in to park in the right place the clubs chief pilot phil regan was standing with her and they came towards him as he got out of the beech baron wonderful to see you darling she flung her arms round him and hugged him fiercely my god but youre brown good to see you justin regan shook hands if you wore the right clothes people could mistake you for a pathan its fierce sun up there on the northwest frontier talbot said ive never experienced anything like it the plane did well phil i hope im staying for a few days but give it a full engine check full everything so that its ready to go at a moments notice well see to that never fear regan turned to consult the mechanic jean said do you want to drive ive just clocked three hundred miles or more flying that plane so i think ill take a rain check fine by me they got in and she drove away following the coast road i was worried when i didnt hear from you on this trip i always thought thats what mobiles were for service can be difficult if youre in the wrong terrain its a hard unforgiving landscape out there its defeated everybody who invaded that bloody country even alexander the great but thats afghanistan i thought you never went over the pakistan border hed made a mistake and struggled to make it right borders meant nothing to alexander of course silly of me she concentrated on the road but glancing sideways at her face he knew that she didnt believe him just as she hadnt believed so much of his army life over the years secrets always secrets between them but also a love that was so deep it was never mentioned how is he he asked referring to his grandfather pretty bloody awful dr ryan said he really did think he might go this time thats why he phoned me to come dad insists sometimes on getting up with two sticks and lurching around and striking out at any servant within range this time he lost his balance and fell over and thats what brought on the attack weve got a local man with him now named tod murphy he spent years at the musgrave park hospital in belfast hes sixty a hard man and deaf as a post so your grandfathers rantings pass right over him hell just sit reading in the conservatory ignoring him until dad needs feeding or toileting or putting to bed and of course theres hannah kelly mentioning the housekeeper couldnt manage without her so i pay her a damn good salary and thanks to her i dont have to be over here on a regular basis she shook her head whats the solution it drives me mad thinking about it he dies i suppose talbot said he could stumble and fall at any time and break his bloody neck and do us all a favour you really hate him that much she asked he shrugged i was his protestant bastard for years so what did that make you how could you ever forgive him for that i know love she said such behaviour goes beyond any hope of forgiveness mind you what would life have been like if id been a catholic bastard imagine colonel henry talbots grandson what would the orange lodge have made of that because of the special bond that had always been between them she could tell he wasnt quite ready to face the house so she swerved to the side of the road by the sea wall switched off and got out she leaned on the wall took out her cigarettes and lit one and he joined her a narrow road dropped down to a hamlet called lorn seven small cottages if you counted them several fishing boats were drawn up on the narrow beach and there was a boathouse and jetty that belonged to the talbot estate a sport fisherman was tied up there gleaming white with a blue stripe it was called mary ellen justin said have you taken the boat out since youve been back or been flying with phil regan i thought youd be airborne all the time after you got your licence instead of replying to his question she said you know dont you august the fifth nineteen sixtyodd father alan winkler st mary the virgin church dun street mayfair a good address he was a nice old man very understanding he held my hand and prayed for me and you and your father and said that in the circumstances it was gods will that you should be baptized the persuasion of the truly good talbot said how could you resist that he kissed her gently on the forehead what a wonderful person you are i expect thats why i cant take girls seriously and never have theyre lucky if they can get a week out of me but you arent going to tell me how you suddenly know oh the secrets between us darling ive an idea that mary ellen knew am i right i had to tell her because i told her everything and she blessed me for it was your fathers dying wish as far as telling you she felt it should be left to the right moment im fortyfive mum if you remember a long time waiting we all have our secrets even from our loved ones and you think that applies to me more years ago than i care to remember you were spending a weeks leave at marley court when a dispatch rider delivered an order you read it told me youd been recalled for some special operation went upstairs to pack and left the order on the study table i know i shouldnt have but i read it and discovered my son was serving in twentysecond sas so you knew all those years and never told me i couldnt it was a betrayal you see and i couldnt live with you knowing that my punishment was that ive had to imagine supremely dangerous things happening to you every day so yes my darling boy i knew then every time just as i know now she stubbed out her cigarette ive tried to give up these things but im damned if i can lets move on you must be famished id like to call in and see jack kelly before we go up to the house he said if you dont mind that is she glanced at her watch a little early for the pub its only fourthirty im sorry mum he laughed looking like a young boy again for a fleeting moment i suppose i am putting off seeing colonel henry for as long as possible and i do have letters for jack from his extended family relatives we have working out there in pakistan of course love ill drop you off and get on up to the house and see how hannah kelly is coping they continued in silence for a while and finally he said ive been thinking about our secrets if it leaked out that id operated in the sas during my army service i think it would finish me here i agree but theyll never know from me answer me one question as your mother though did you actually take part in sas operations in ulster during the troubles he had so much to lie about particularly his present activities perhaps he could more easily avoid that by admitting a sort of truth yes i did and on many occasions she kept on driving calmly in view of the personal difficulties in your background our situation in kilmartin couldnt you have avoided it i understood that the ministry of defence allowed choice it was still left to the individual to make a personal decision he was getting into real trouble here its difficult when the regiments going to war for an individual to opt out i could see that with the grenadier guards jean said but you volunteered to join the sas am i right yes thats true so you knew what you were getting into covert operations subterfuge killing by stealth action by night you must have known that your enemy would be the ira she shook her head why did you do it he broke then because i loved it every glorious moment of it couldnt get enough some psychiatrists might say i was seeking death but if i was it was only to beat him at his own game i lived more in a day he broke off shaking his head nothing can describe it it was so real so damned exciting it was impossible to take ordinary life seriously ever again but afghanistan got you in the end i think not death looked down took one look and said oh its you again not today thank you she managed a laugh you fool anything else i dont think announcing to all and sundry that im a catholic is a sound thought the news that the heir to talbot place is a fenian would have some people dancing a jig for joy and many who wouldnt its your decision not mine jean talbot said ill go along with anything you want and well keep our fingers crossed but remember justin this is ireland where a secret is only a secret when one person knows it then god help us they had passed down the main street a few parked cars not many people about and there was the kilmartin arms and the church of the holy name to one side of it a low stone wall surrounding a wellfilled cemetery the church standing some distance back there was an oldfashioned lychgate a roofed entrance to the churchyard let me out here talbot said and his mother braked to a halt he got out taking his flight bag with him and examined the notice board church of the holy name father michael cassidy my god the old devil goes on forever how old is he seventyeight he could have had preferment years ago but he loves this place youve got the times for mass and the confessional dont tempt me but i will have a word with him and in friendship only the fact of my new religion stays out of it ill get moving then i shant be long he walked through the lychgate as she drove off and threaded his way through the gravestones to a horseshoe of cypress trees there was a monument there which bore the names on a bronze plaque of local men who had died while serving in the ira he didnt bother with that but walked through to a wellkept grave with a black granite headstone the inscription was in gold and read killed in action volunteer sean kelly age august it said other things too about a just cause and the ira love of country but justin talbot ignored them only the name and the age of someone he had truly loved meant anything to him he turned away close to weeping and found jack kelly standing some little distance away lighting his briar pipe he carried his sixtynine years well dark hair streaked with silver now a face that had weathered intelligence there also a quiet good humour he wore a tweed suit and an openneck shirt and there were good shoulders to him a man who could handle himself which wasnt surprising in someone whose life had been devoted to the ira good to see you back boy kelly said tim keeps in touch on his mobile i heard from him youd been disappearing over the border again to afghanistan tim molloy was his nephew one of many men in the kilmartin district who had eagerly accepted the recruitment to talbot international at good salaries tim for example was contract manager to the vehicle maintenance side of the business based in islamabad servicing civilian convoys to peshawar and beyond to the khyber pass itself it was an important and hazardous job the truth was that molloy and the kilmartin group used their privileged position to offload arms close to the border to dealers who took them over honed by years of experience with the ira molloys group of ten men all mainly in their middle years formed a tightly knit crew that kept themselves to themselves no one at talbot international headquarters had the slightest idea of what was going on except justin talbot tims a good man even on the worst of days talbot said but he hates me changing my clothes and slipping off over the border to have a look around and visit they had moved to a bench close to seans grave and were sitting kellys pipe had gone out and he lit it again he thinks youre a lunatic going over for a stroll in a place like that and disguised as a pathan hes convinced that sooner or later someones going to take a pot shot at you god bless tim but then he doesnt know what we do talbot said and a burden it is sometimes kelly looked sombre jack kelly was the nearest thing to a father justin talbot had known that was the truth of it and justin was well aware that in many ways he had stood in for sean and not only in jacks eyes but in those of his wife hannah also the word from molloy about talbots trips had worried the kellys and jack had raised the matter almost a year before it had been at a bad time or a good time depending how you looked at it but it was not long after al qaeda and the preacher had invaded talbots life so sitting in the study of talbot place with kelly just the two of them with whisky taken talbot had unburdened himself kelly had been shocked and angry what the hell were you playing at surely you must have seen that once you put your foot on such a road there could be no turning back i got tired of big business i missed what i had in the army excitement action passion put it any way you like it started simple then it got out of hand and shamrock whose bright idea was that mine talbot shrugged okay a bit stupid but i certainly wasnt going to say major talbot here are you receiving me you bloody fool kelly had said that helps a lot the thing is how do i get out of it youre the experts youve had thirtyfive years of fighting the british army you dont kelly said a certain despair on his face this is al qaeda were talking about youre too valuable to let go even if you could find this anonymous man the preacher and managed to kill him it wouldnt make the slightest difference you belong to them theyll never let you stop your mother knows nothing of this i hope certainly not thank god shed never be able to cope so i just keep going i dont see what else you can do but all that had been almost a year before and a lot had happened since then sitting there on the bench talbot brooded for a while at a loss for words it had certainly been a day for disclosure but of things it would not be a good idea to reveal to anyone else his service with the sas and his new catholic self were matters best left alone kelly said youve got something else on your mind havent you you might as well spill it talbot said okay i will it will take a while to cover everything but bear with me you thought i was in a mess but with the things ive done over there now its infinitely worse it took a long time in the telling almost an hour because he told kelly everything right up to ferguson and miller flying to pakistan so there it is talbot said i dont think ive missed anything what do you think that youre probably a lunatic you must be to dig yourself in so deep do any of the names mean anything to you they certainly do general charles ferguson was in and out of ulster throughout the troubles a thorn in our side and these two ira men are they genuine you can bet your life on it sean dillons a down man who became a top enforcer and then ended up in a serb prison some years ago ferguson saved him from a firing squad and the payment was that dillon had to join him and holley halfenglish his mother was a coogan from crossmaglen hes highly regarded by that family his cousin rosaleen was raped and murdered by four protestant scumbags he shot the lot of them he shook his head he and dillon are serious business yes but they dont know who i am im just a name not to the taliban who fight with you and dont tell me you wear a turban and pull your robes about and wrap a scarf around your face some of those men will have seen you no taliban i know would sell me out talbot told him if anyone did theyd hunt him down and feed him to the dogs he shrugged i dont know its a bugger one of your own making kelly said i suppose so maybe i have a death wish anyway i suppose id better get up to the place and see whats what i mustnt forget your mail though he opened his flight bag and took out a stack of letters held together by a rubber band kelly took it and said the ladies will welcome them they can all call up peshawar on their mobiles but everyone loves a letter the money is just pouring in for them some of them dont know what to do with it im sure theyll think of something hows hannah my mother tells me that the old bastard is worse than he ever was we all do our best im sorry for your mother justin arent we all but id better be off ill give you a lift no thanks i could do with the walk my legs are a bit stiff after the flight he smiled cheerfully as if he didnt have a care in the world ill see you later and he picked up his flight bag and walked away he had not gone very far was climbing over a stile when his mobile sounded it was the preacher have you arrived yes im just walking up to the house what is it just keeping you informed i thought youd like to know that ferguson and miller are now on their way to peshawar but dont worry i have a very reliable asset in peshawar he can be trusted to handle the matter anybody i know none of your business all you need to know is they may be going there but i doubt theyll be coming back have a good holiday you need the rest he switched off and talbot stood there thinking for a moment then continued walking briskly through the estate past the prized herd of jersey cows and a particularly fine herd of sheep he approached the rear courtyard came to the stables and looked in it was wellkept neat and tidy the stalls swept he didnt see a horse then there was a clatter of hooves outside and his mother appeared by the open door on a black gelding and dismounted she was wearing jeans and a sweater there you are she said is everything all right oh fine i saw jack and delivered the mail she started on the saddle and andy the stable boy came out of the kitchen and hurried across ill do that for you missus i was just having my tea good man talbot told him give him a rubdown he followed his mother across the yard the kitchen was huge and suitably oldfashioned hannah kelly sorting vegetables by the sink wiped her hands and came to kiss him god save us justin you look like an arab id rather not he told her its only tan with the ulster rain five times a week it will soon wear off a young girl named jane was peeling the potatoes and emily the cook was busy at the stove hello to everybody he said cheerfully why does it always smell so good in here he put an arm around his mothers waist come on lets get it over with they went out into the panelled dining room and through to what was called the great hall where an oldfashioned lift stood to one side of a huge staircase rising to a railed gallery above there was a study a library a drawing room and then in the centre a victorian glass doorway misting over with the heat jean talbot opened it and justin followed her in it was a victorian jungle and quite delightful if you liked that sort of thing green vines and bushes and exotic flowers everywhere mediumsized palm trees the sound of water from a whiteandblack tiled fountain it ended in a circular area with a statue of venus on a plinth colonel henry talbot sat in his wheelchair wearing a robe a white towel around his neck his grey hair was so sparse that with the sweat one could imagine he was bald a brandy decanter was on the ironwork table beside him and a glass that was a quarter full sitting at a cane table on the other side of the circle was murphy the nurse his head was shaven and he resembled a buddha in a way the face very calm very relaxed as he sat there in a white coat and read a book the heat was incredible and justin said how can anybody stand this murphy stood up is there anything i can do madam how is he she raised her voice so that he could hear he came forward a little calmer i think colonel henry turned his head and examined her who the fuck are you he demanded and glanced at justin and whos this its your grandson father she said the man resembled nothing so much as a ghoul with his hollow cheeks and rheumy eyes as he glared at justin his right hand clutching a blackthorn walking stick then something sparked in the eyes the bastard he cackled the protestant bastard please father she started to say and he tried to strike out at her with the blackthorn she managed to jump out of the way and murphy blocked the blow with his right arm thats it justin said im out of here im going to have a shower and change into something comfortable i sincerely hope that im not expected to eat with him because i wont ill have it in the kitchen he turned and walked out ninethirty on a weekday night wasnt the busiest time in most london pubs and the dark man on cable wharf by the thames at wapping was no exception harry salter still had a weakness for the place for it was where he had started out all those years ago when hed realized that more money could be made in business than crime and you didnt have to constantly run the chance of going down the steps at the old bailey for twenty years hed invited everybody round for drinks and supper doras hotpot if they were lucky and that included roper dillon would be bringing him in the back of the people carrier from holland park holley got a cab from the dorchester and arrived just after they did paid the driver off then walked to the edge of the wharf and looked across the thames as a riverboat passed by ablaze with lights he was standing in a place of dark shadows beyond the lights from the pub and was turning to go when he saw three young men in track suits jog down from the direction of wapping high street they moved apart one of them turning into the car park two of them running along the jetty to where salters boat the linda jones was tied up a few moments later the one from the car park emerged and went to join the others as they ran back to join him holley regarded them for a moment and then dismissed them and went into the dark man the salters sat in their usual corner booth with dillon and harrys two minders joe baxter and sam hall lounging at the bar roper sat facing them in his stateoftheart wheelchair in his favourite reefer coat his long hair framing the bombscarred face here he is harry said the guy who planned to have us burned down well it didnt work did it holley said i wont mention it again old son bygones are bygones as far as im concerned what will it be my yorkshire half says beer and my irish half says a bushmills whiskey good man ill join you in that dillon said outside kalid hasim was discussing the situation with his friends omar and sajid he said the boats locked up tight no way of going below thats where they have things called seacocks if you open them water rushes in and the boat will sink so what do we do omar asked well cut the ropes holding it close to the jetty ive got a good knife well shove it so that the current takes it out into the river then a quick runthrough the car park smashing every headlight and car window you can and just keep on running he took out a baseball bat that holley had missed in the dark the others did likewise sounds good to me sajid said it was then that hasim made a bad mistake he said first lets go inside i want to see how many customers there are so we know what were up against what about the bats omar asked well just leave them over there in the corner where that flower trellis is nobody will see holley noticed them as they entered the pub surveyed the room for a few minutes then left again he said something strange about those three what would that be roper said i noticed them when i arrived jogging down from the main road harry frowned what were they doing one ran through the car park the other two went along the jetty to the boat i couldnt see what they were up to there the other one joined them for a chat and i came in i dont like the sound of that harry salter said billy billy was on his feet in an instant and called to baxter and hall lets get moving he ran out of the door hasim had already sliced through the stern line of the linda jones and the stern itself was starting to swing out in the current omar had switched on the desk light under the awning which automatically put on two lights on the prow something hasim had not expected what the hell do you bleeders think youre doing billy salter called and baxter and hall started to run billy produced his walther and fired in the air the three young men turned in alarm and sajid cried lets get out of here but there was nowhere to run the jetty extended for perhaps fifty feet beyond the linda jones then stopped abruptly im nearly done here hasim told his friends get on board sajid and well shove off but this line was a hawser and much thicker and billy fired again the dull thud of the silenced walther sounding ill put you on sticks he took careful aim and hasim paused picked up his baseball bat and backed away come on then lets be having you it was a brave but futile gesture omar jumped into the water and started to swim into the darkness and sajid ran at baxter and hall flailing out at them with the baseball bat catching baxter on the shoulder hall blocked the blow aimed at him and wrenched the baseball bat from sajids hand behind them harry salter was approaching and dillon and holley stood in the doorway of the pub dillon said i think this could get nasty he half ran across to the jetty and approached the men baxter and hall had sajid between them and baxter was holding the baseball bat in the other hand give it here harry said i could do with one of those you okay joe it could be worse the young bastard didnt break anything well well soon fix that hold out his left arm sajid tried to struggle but it was no good baxter held him from behind hall extended the arm and the baseball bat descended sajid cried out in agony and harry said now i think youll find thats broken wapping high streets where you want to be st lukes hospital theyve got an excellent casualty department now get out of my sight dillon came up behind and sajid stumbled past him sobbing billy stood confronting hasim walther extended it made for a dramatic tableau the deck lights from the linda jones the darkness all around some vessel passing in the distance the river sounds dillon said do you think the other one will make it to the other side i doubt it i was the original river rat as a kid harry said i know the thames backwards big tide tonight fourknot current at least of course he could also get run down by a boat out there he grinned but im not concerned about him young punks getting up to a bit of aggravation is one thing but my nose tells me theres more to this than meets the eye he moved up beside billy and confronted hasim who crouched defiantly the baseball bat ready to swing whats your game go fuck yourself hasim snarled dont waste my time im harry salter everybody knows that i own half of wapping and you you maggot come along here and have a go at a boat ive spent thousands restoring that isnt your usual petty vandalism it was a personal attack on me so who put you up to it ive told you what you can do were wasting time here billy said let me put a shot in his right kneecap that should jog his memory hasim suddenly looked uncertain but lengthened his doublehanded grip on the baseball bat dillon pulled out his own walther and shot the bat out of hasims hand who jumped back in alarm as it bounced on the cobbles of the jetty rolling towards harry who picked it up examined the splintered end and stood there holding it take him he said hasim made a sudden move as if to attempt to run past baxter tripped him and he and hall pulled him up between them billy and dillon put their walthers away and stood watching harry said somebody put you up to this and i want to know who hasim spat at him harry took his handkerchief from his breast pocket and wiped his face very nice that isnt it ive had enough just hold out his right arm hasim went crazy struggling in the grip of the two men they punched him several times to bring him under control and stretched out his arm not that he screamed as the bat was raised im a boxer salter was astonished for a moment then smiled well thats good news because if you dont tell me what i want to hear ill break both your arms half sobbing hasim couldnt get it out quick enough he told them everything about his dealings with lancy when he was finished harry salter said and you expect me to believe thats the way this geezer operates a voice on the phone and payment by mail i swear its true hasim said i cant tell you anything else about him on my mothers life what does he sound like dillon put in cockney no doubt about that but i think hes muslim when he gave me this job he spoke in arabic for the first time it was when he was saying goodbye and what did he say dillon asked he said allah is great and osama is his prophet are you sure about that dillon added it should be mohammed is his prophet he said osama dillon and billy exchanged glances harry tossed the baseball bat into the river hasim said what happens now harry took out his wallet and extracted a fiftypound note and gave it to him take that and run after your mate he wont have got far give him a hand to the hospital its a good thing for you im in a friendly mood if i see you round here again ill kill you hasim took to his heels and ran into the darkness and the others returned to the dark man and joined roper and holley in the corner booth selim lancy who had observed everything from his mercedes parked nearby got out put his hearing enhancer in his right ear and followed he saw the others settling themselves back in the corner booth selim got a pint went and sat in the next booth which was unoccupied and opened an evening standard hed been carrying so what happened out there roper demanded it was billy who answered and it didnt take long the end of the story was what mattered most allah is great and osama is his prophet thats what he said could that mean al qaedas behind it harry asked id say definitely i think we all have to be on our guard from now on im frightened to death and im also starving harry salter said and called to dora what about our supper love bring on the hotpots lancy left shortly afterwards and called hasim from the car when he answered he said i was there sitting in a car outside the dark man i saw everything where are you now i just delivered sajid to st lukes hospital his arms so badly broken theyve admitted him and your other pal decided to go for a swim lancy shook his head why didnt salter break your arm how the hell would i know i think you blabbed my old son in fact i was listening to what they were saying in the pub and i know you did they know it was al qaeda that isnt true hasim was suddenly desperate i didnt say a word to salter youre a dead man sunshine lancy told him i know you but you dont know me think about it he switched off his mobile and drove away at talbot place dinner had been late because jean had insisted on jack and hannah kelly joining them well make an occasion of it she told justin she did just that herself wearing her hair up and finding an attractive dress in green silk by versace that she hadnt worn for some time with highheeled shoes she looked quietly attractive as she descended the stairs justin who had just gone down himself greeted her with a glass of krug holding one for himself you know what they say he smiled if youre tired of champagne youre tired of life he raised his glass to you mum you look absolutely smashing you dont look too bad yourself he wore a black singlebreasted suit white shirt and guards tie his dark hair cropped he still had slight stubble on his chin she touched it whats this did you run out of razor blades its the fashion at the moment i think its meant to make you look as if youve done things and been places but youve done both you idiot she shook her head honestly men are the end sometimes has jack arrived hes in the kitchen where hannah is running around like a dervish young jane has produced her waitress outfit black dress and white apron she looks quite charming and your grandfather have you seen him must i he immediately regretted it im so sorry callous of me when i think of how much youve put up with jack kelly appeared from the dining room looking slightly oldfashioned in a tweed country suit softcollared shirt and knitted tie you look grand girl he told jean and kissed her on the cheek an evening for compliments she smiled get him a drink and ill see how things are coming along in the kitchen talbot found kelly a bushmills whiskey in the study bar heres to you jack what you and hannah have done to support my mother is beyond price how is he well take a look quietly is my advice kelly told him one minute hes sitting there like a living dead man and then and often for some unknown reason he explodes into one of his worst moments screaming obscenities slashing out with the blackthorn stick god save us but he could kill somebody with one of his blows so i believe in the conservatory they walked softly along the path murphy saw them coming and nodded slightly colonel henry seemed somnolent his head had fallen to one side and it was shaking slightly is that enough for you kelly asked what do you think jack talbots face was bleak lets go and eat the meal was simple but sensational an onion soup with cheese that wouldnt have disgraced the best of paris restaurants lamb chops that were simply superb cabbage and bacon irishstyle and roast potatoes young jane in her waitress outfit acted the part to perfection serving wine as to the manner born left hand behind her back i cant remember when i last ate like that justin said as jane cleared the plates on to a serving trolley well its not over yet hannah told him weve got your special favourite since you were a boy emilys apple pie justin said at the same moment there was a disturbance in the great hall shouting and then the door burst open colonel henry stood there in his robe leaning on his stick looking quite different he seemed alert his head up and his voice was sharp and strong there was an energy to him so there you are he shouted whats all this behind my back behind him murphy moved in now then colonel he put a hand on the old mans shoulder henry turned and struck out at him with the blackthorn slashing him across the right arm murphy backed away and jean moved forward father this wont do she reached for him and when she was close enough he slapped her across the face how dare you touch me you bitch he moved back as justin took an angry stride towards him and who are you your grandson he whirled round with surprising energy collided with murphy knocking him to one side and crossed the great hall waving his stick and cackling justin had moved forward and jean and the kellys followed the old man got to the stairs reached for the rail hauled himself up three steps and paused turning his face was something out of a nightmare absolutely malevolent as he glared at justin i know you youre the protestant bastard for justin talbot it was enough and the pain and resentment of a lifetime at the hands of this man erupted in an anguished cry no grandfather im the catholic bastard the words seem to echo around the hall and hannah kelly cried out oh god in heaven colonel henry stared at justin stood there swaying his left hand on the banister what did you say justin spaced each word and said clearly im the catholic bastard colonel henry seemed to howl head back raised the blackthorn high and struck for justins head at the same time releasing his grip on the banister justin stepped to one side and his grandfather fell from the steps to the floor young emily screamed and everyone seemed to move at once it was murphy who reached him first he dropped to his knees to put him in the recovery position for there was bleeding from the nose the eyes werent closed but staring rigidly and it was no surprise when murphy feeling for a heartbeat looked up and shook his head hes gone jean talbot the kellys and young jane stood there in a kind of tableau jane crying justin said thats it then wed better call dr ryan there will be things to do jean said in a strangely calm voice ill see to that now she took a mobile from her handbag and walked back into the dining room and hannah and jane followed murphy had picked up colonel henrys shawl and now he covered him with it he turned to look at justin hes better out of it major talbot he said he was like a man possessed it wasnt his fault really justin said well i suppose its a point of view he turned to kelly are you all right jack is it true justin kelly asked it was my fathers dying wish so my mother had me baptized a catholic and kept quiet about it only mary ellen knew certainly not me ive only discovered it recently would you care for a drink i dont think so ill go and see to the ladies well i could he went to the study bar poured himself three fingers of whisky went and sat in a club chair and looked up at the painting of his grandfather as a grand master in the orange lodge mad as a hatter he said so what does that say about me and he swallowed the whisky straight down doctor larry ryan summoned to view the body had no hesitation in concluding that colonel henry talbot had died of a heart attack he had after all been the dead mans physician for some twelve years in the circumstances he had consulted the local coroner who had concluded that there was no need for an inquest which could only cause distress to what was after all the most important family in that part of the county with the coroners permission ryan phoned a funeral firm in newry to come and receive the body which tod murphy with his strength had carried reverently into the study and placed on the large sofa hannah kelly jean behind her appeared with fresh sheets and covered him jack kelly looked on accompanied by father michael cassidy who informed by kelly had immediately driven up from the presbytery he stood by the body murmuring a prayer and justin talbot appeared from the study a glass of whisky in his hand ah there you are father he said bad news or good news depending on your point of view spreads quickly im here to offer what solace i can the old man said if that means to me personally as a newly discovered member of your flock youre wasting your time the whole wide world can know im a catholic theres no shame in it and my mother meant well as far as im concerned nothings changed i havent suddenly discovered god or anything justin please his mother was distressed well lets face facts justin told her we can hardly bury him in the cemetery at holy name with the monument to the sons of the ira dominating the scene alcohol affected him in the strangest of ways and always had his version of drunkenness was quite different from other peoples he became icecold hard not reckless but calculating and instant violence was there just beneath the surface if he did not get his way but what is your alternative father cassidy asked justin turned to dr ryan theres a crematorium at castlerea isnt there larry with some sort of chapel yes thats true ryan said can i presume theyll do a protestant burial service as good as anywhere else of course but the crematorium service is meant to handle relatively few people just family and close friends ryan hesitated but went on there would be those who might not consider it appropriate in the case of such a prominent man you mean we should expect ulster unionist mps from stormont and the orange lodge marching behind the hearse complete with a drum and pipe band justin shook his head im head of the talbot family now and i want it over and done with the crematorium it is he turned to his mother does any of this give you a problem jean talbot seemed all hollow cheeks and infinite sadness you must do as you see fit justin im going upstairs for a while i suddenly feel rather tired he put an arm round her leave everything to me ive phoned gibson in belfast his old campaign manager hell notify the party so ulster television will get their hands on it and the bbc it will be a circus for a while but everything passes the front door bell sounded that should be the funeral people jack kelly said the last people i want to see jean said and hurried across the great hall to head upstairs no more than forty minutes or so later it was strangely calm the funeral people had departed with the body dr ryan had moved on and father cassidy had also left justin talbot was back in the study pouring another whisky at the bar when kelly appeared do you want that drink now justin asked why not hannahs just finishing in the kitchen she intends to stay your mother will need her ill walk back over the estate itll give me time to think theres a full moon he accepted his whisky big changes justin talbot nodded looking up at the painting of his grandfather over the fireplace that will have to go for starters maybe the orange lodge will find a place for it who knows kelly said let me see you off its been a hell of a day jack and he led him out at holland park roper had dozed off in his wheelchair for a good two hours he woke to find sergeant doyle looking concerned are you okay major aches and pains tony he checked the time no wonder two oclock in the morning mug of tea please he lit a forbidden cigarette and checked his screens for the overnight news and there it was the death of colonel henry talbot he hesitated then called ferguson on his codex who replied at once and sounded perfectly civil is it something important roper well be landing in an hour and a half two oclock in the morning here general and a news reports beginning to filter through which i thought might interest you colonel henry talbot died a few hours ago at talbot place in county down did he by jove what do you think will happen now my dear old chum general sir hadley chase will bow out gracefully as chairman of the company and justin talbot will become an extremely wealthy man eight hundred million i hear thanks for letting me know well talk later im sure before you say over and out theres also been an incident youll want to know about then tell me about it roper told him about what had happened at the dark man and when he was finished ferguson said damn sinister wouldnt you agree the hint of al qaeda certainly makes one think more than a hint ferguson said allah is great and osama is his prophet that would seem a clear indication to me i agree general though to many muslims it would be counted as blasphemy youve got a point all i can say is it would be sensible for us to conclude that we are being targeted and act accordingly well talk about it when i return but i want all of you to take care doyle brought the tea and roper sat there considering the matter eight hundred million it didnt bear thinking about so he dismissed it and went back to the news p akistan n orth w est f rontier p eshawar it was eightthirty in the morning as the gulfstream descended towards pakistan as holley had said peshawar international wasnt the biggest of airports but it did belong to the modern world the mountains of afghanistan and the northwest frontier made an impressive backdrop and unusually a railway crossing stood at the end of the main runway what about that miller said to ferguson as they peered out days of the raj i suppose ferguson suddenly felt nostalgic they landed and squadron leader lacey following instructions from the tower taxied to a corner of the airport where two chinook helicopters were parked the ground personnel who waved them in wore airforce overalls ferguson and miller got out of the gulfstream and lacey and parry joined them passing out the luggage a few yards away two army officers were engaged in conversation and turned to greet them one was a captain wearing a khaki summer uniform a line of medal ribbons above his left pocket carrying a swagger stick he was a handsome man possibly pathan although he was wearing a cap not a turban and the belt at his waist carried a holstered browning pistol general ferguson major miller he saluted a pleasure to meet you my name is abu salim military police im here to welcome you and take you to see my commanding officer colonel ahmed atep very civil of you captain ferguson shook hands salim turned to lacey and parry my colleague lieutenant hamid will see to your needs gentlemen there is a guesthouse close by which takes care of visiting pilots lacey turned to ferguson well get a full engine check and refuel sir well be ready to move on whenever you like very good ferguson turned to salim ready when you are captain customs immigration security salim picked up his bag good god no he smiled diplomatic privilege if you could manage your bag major miller he walked across the tarmac to a gate between hangars the two soldiers waiting patiently were military police sergeants in crisp khaki uniforms both bearded and wearing scarlet turbans i must say they look perfectly splendid ferguson said they certainly look imposing our own version of a british army redcap salim said its supposed to intimidate the tribesmen colonel atep insisted on trying it out sergeants said and nasser the two men saluted picked up the bags walked out of the gate into the parking area and approached an armoured vehicle there were three banks of seats a canvas roof rolled back to cover the rear two which was necessary because of the generalpurpose machine gun mounted on the front beside the driver it was painted in a wavy khaki pattern a sort of desert camouflage what is this ferguson asked a sultan armoured reconnaissance car it was miller who answered where did you get it the russians left more than a few lying around when they left afghanistan we got hold of what we could the armour is stronger than it looks it gives some sort of protection against improvised explosive devices a damn sight more than a jeep or a land rover gets the luggage was stacked at the back ferguson and miller took the rear seat the captain the second half turning towards them so they could talk said sat at the gun and nasser took the wheel and drove away nothing like i imagined peshawar ferguson observed far bigger it used to be about five hundred and fifty thousand people salim said but its more now lots of refugees from the tribal areas the congestion in the streets was incredible every kind of vehicle from ageing taxis to motor rickshaws mopeds and light motorcyles sometimes with two passengers on the pillion seat hanging on to each other and the driver thronged the road hundreds of people on bicycles weaved between market stalls mounting pavements where there was one the military and police presence was very visible salim said theres a war out there and not just over the border in afghanistan but in the tribal areas this is a military city now it has to be we cant say the barbarians are at the gates but real trouble waits out there if you and the americans lose to the taliban god help my country i think you have a point ferguson said the captain nodded military police headquarters coming up general the sultan swung in between sentries guarding a wide double gate drove towards an imposing threestoreyed building with a redtiled roof and a pillared front door that looked as if it might have been a relic of empire ferguson and miller got out and stood looking at it i know salim said it used to be quite impressive this way gentlemen colonel ahmed atep was sitting behind his desk examining some papers and managing to look busy when selim ushered them into the office he jumped to his feet came round the table and shook hands general ferguson major miller what an honour be seated please perhaps you would care for some tea a kind thought but after such a long flight the prospect of a shower and a good hotel have quite a pull ferguson said especially breakfast of course but sit down for a moment i shant keep you long first ive allocated captain abu salim to take care of you during your visit one of my finest young officers a sandhurst man salim managed a modest look and ferguson said so we have something in common he carried on this is only a flying visit colonel a day two at the most then well carry on to islamabad which wasnt true but atep appeared to accept it you wish to visit the afghan border area i believe certainly in london we hear all sorts of stories about armssmuggling obviously to the benefit of the taliban grossly exaggerated atep said we have had considerable success in stemming that flow and people miller queried passing over illegally to offer their services to the taliban we have evidence that british muslims are engaged in the fighting over there newspaper stories rumour if such individuals exist they will be very few ferguson decided to take a chance does the name shamrock mean anything to you atep managed to keep a straight face no should it he turned to salim what about you salim shook his head and answered no ive never heard the name before it seems we cant help atep said but i understand you wish to speak with two men called dak khan and jose fernandez thats right ferguson told him without elaborating colonel atep picked up a flimsy fernandez has been called to lahore his mother is a muslim and is ill cancer i understand ferguson said and dak khan captain salim will see to that for you just as he will also see you to your hotel he is yours to command general look on him as your military aide for the duration of your visit most kind colonel ferguson told him and turned then salim ushered them out they got into the sultan and salim said to sergeant nasser the palace as they drove out of the gate he said an old old hotel from the days of the raj for years it was called the indian palace but as local people always called it just the palace it was easy to make it official the manager is simply known as ali hamid to everyone it is on the edge of town by the river it sounds like just the thing ferguson said how long have you been in the army captain i did one year at university applied for the army at nineteen and was accepted at sandhurst i am twentyseven he half turned to miller we have met before major your lectures on counterterrorism were hugely appreciated by all of us that is good to know miller shook his hand the matter i raised with colonel atep the question of british muslims serving with the taliban colonel atep dismissed it as newspaper stories ferguson said and of little account i know its unfair to expect you to contradict your commanding officer in this case its easy salim said no disrespect to the colonel but we hear the reports often and the name shamrock miller asked you said it meant nothing to you and it doesnt apart from the fact that its the irish national emblem but at that moment they arrived at the entrance to a wonderful old colonialstyle building surrounded by a high wall they turned in through the arched entrance and drove along through an enchanting garden to a wide terrace where a double door stood open the man standing there waiting to greet them was large and imposing his irongrey hair was tied in a ponytail and his beard reached his chest he wore a black anklelength cotton kaftan they went up the steps and he salaamed his hand touching his forehead gentlemen i am ali hamid welcome my house is yours an hour later after being shown to their rooms unpacking showering and changing ferguson and miller went downstairs and were directed to a back terrace with a fine view over the river where they found no difficulty in ordering a full english breakfast abu salim came in as they were eating are you going to have something ferguson asked i already have while you were upstairs ive been talking to the orderly sergeant in my office to make sure he can cope while im dealing with you gentlemen the waiter approached and he ordered tea we were sidetracked after you asked me about shamrock so i was ferguson looked at miller what do you think hes a sandhurst man of course he is ferguson reached for the marmalade tell him harry salim took it all in listening intently and when miller was finished said a fantastic business but what do you expect to find here in peshawar not very much but i prefer to see for myself what a situation looks like instead of just thinking about it its eleven miles from here to the khyber pass over that border the war is real and earnest and shamrock exists and where does dak khan come in a colleague of mine in london tells me hes a thoroughly unsavoury arms dealer who operates in this area oh i know him well and he is more than unsavoury he would sell his sisters favours in a house of pleasure if there was money in it my friend has discussed our problems with khan whos willing to help were in your hands all right well go and see him may i assume that you are both armed absolutely ferguson told him good dak khans house was a mile further down the river a rambling old bungalow with a tiled roof the courtyard was large with a jeep and a mediumsized truck parked there four men in soiled and dusty clothes wearing turbans sat against the wall smoking they ignored salim and the others and when salim was close enough he kicked a man with a walleye get on your feet you dog he said in english where is your master no need for that captain a voice called from inside the open door i shall give him the whipping he deserves please come in dak khan was of medium height but squat he wore a soiled white shirt and a shabby fawn suit with a red cummerbund his hair was greasy his face brown and he had a thick black moustache which somehow looked false the room was surprisingly sparse an empty fireplace with a couch on either side a couple of coffee tables several cane chairs and a desk where khan now seated himself please be seated gentlemen and tell me how i may help you dont lets beat about the bush ferguson told him my friend daniel holley tells me that when it comes to whats going on over the border in afghanistan youre the expert true but whats in it for me ill pay well whats your price that depends on what it is you want to know shamrock ferguson said who is he and more to the point where is he do you know these things of course i do ferguson was so surprised that he paused and it was miller who said how much ten thousand pounds captain abu salim said what a creature you are dak khan dont listen to him general no let him speak ferguson said how do i know you would deliver i would come with you this i promise i dont believe you salim said you can accompany them bring your men he shrugged i can only do one more thing to prove myself as i doubt that you have ten thousand pounds in your wallet i will accept your word that you will pay me later ferguson looked at miller then salim what can i say except lets do it dak stood up then let us as you english say shake hands on it his palm felt limp and sweaty and ferguson withdrew his hand quickly so what happens now you come back for me in two hours i must put my affairs in order i will go with you then i promise ferguson nodded reluctantly and he and miller went out the four men had departed the jeep had gone dak khan came to the door and abu salim prodded him with his swagger stick let us down and ill put you out of business for good he went across to the sultan joined the others and was driven away dak khan spat in the dust and went back inside where he called colonel atep on his mobile theyve just visited me tell me what happened ferguson asked me if i knew shamrock and i told him i did which i dont in fact ive never heard of him so what do you intend ill take them to a house i know in the back country where i believe i can guarantee a hostile reception lets face it it happens all the time these days in the border area this is the most important task i have asked you to perform given to me by osamas personal representative in london the preacher so it is very very important that you succeed of course i know exactly what im doing there is only one problem captain abu salim and his two sergeants will certainly be in the line of fire is this acceptable as you say things happen all the time in the border area salim is a nothing he sees things entirely differently from you and me with osamas blessing on you your success is assured noon the sun high in the sky with a wind that stirred the sand on leaving the city they joined a convoy of civilian trucks many of them garishly decorated military or police vehicles constantly overtaking each of them on the short stretch up to the khyber pass some time before they got there under instructions from khan sergeant nasser turned off on to a wellworn track salim seated beside khan half turned to ferguson and miller federal law only applies on the main road and ten yards on either side elsewhere tribal laws apply dak khan said i call this the wilderness they passed a small village of four or five mud houses two robed men stood by a well watching them showing no emotion staring these people are very poor they have nothing so they would kill you if they had the chance never mind that salim said where are we going about eight miles more dak turned his head and added our destination is very close to the border it was a barren undulating plain drifting towards the mountains dust rose from the burnt parched land and ferguson holding a handkerchief to his mouth and coughing said god in heaven how can anyone live here khan was wearing a battered panama hat and a long cotton scarf around his neck which he occasionally pulled up to his nose it is the will of allah it is all they know general and we are here over to the left the ground lifted to a hillock on which stood a sizeable twostoreyed house that had been painted white at some time there was an extended wall of mud bricks around it and windows with wooden shutters partially open a man in blueandwhite robes stood in the yard beside a well a bucket in one hand and some goats beside him he looked turned quickly opened the front door and stepped inside the goats came out on to the hillock bleating and two or three roughlooking sheep appeared around the side of the house a line of stones on either side marked the track up to the house and beside the entrance from what passed as a road was a thorn tree burnt black by the sun a dead monument to a dead world as nasser turned the sultan into the track khan said stop here by the tree said stood up at the machine gun and charged it leaning on the frame looking up towards the house and dak khan took out his mobile and dialled a number he spoke in english its me everything is okay we want to come up to the house he listened and then turned hes afraid of the machine gun hes not certain of our good faith he paused listening again then said okay if thats the way you want it whats happening ferguson asked hes suspicious he wants you to stay here and me to go up to the house to establish my credentials he shrugged thats the only way hell do it otherwise he says you can go away ferguson turned to captain salim what do you think well as weve come this far lets humour the man he said to said swing the machine gun on its pivot to cover the house he opened the door and got out and khan followed him its all yours well cover you dak khan took off his panama wiped his face with the scarf and managed a smile im sure everything will be fine he started up the track and three of the goats came to meet him salim binoculars around his neck raised them and scanned the house the inside of the place is very dark no sign of any movement he paused yes i think theres someone there dak khan had reached the house paused and the door was opened as he stepped inside there was a brief flash of white and then the door closed again so now we wait ferguson said and miller opened the door on his side to get out as he did so a shot was fired a sharp and peculiar cracking sound that echoed in the desert heat it caught sergeant said in the side of the head his scarlet turban flying into the air as he was catapulted over the side of the sultan nassers reflex action was to open the door at his side and attempt to scramble out three very quick shots all making that same peculiar cracking sound hit him in his neck and back driving him down to collapse over the body of his comrade there were three more quick shots two smashing the windscreen flying glass cascading over abu salim as he crouched beneath the machine gun another deflected by armour plating there was blood on his face from several cuts and ferguson slipped out of the rear seat and joined miller crouching behind the sultan do you know what that thing is miller demanded another relic of the soviets in afghanistan a dragunov automatic sniper rifle absolutely deadly with a competent marksman what in hell do we do ferguson asked lets try this crouched right down salim reached up to the handle of the machine gun swung it round in the general direction of the house and gave it a long burst then he scrambled across and found the others there was another shot from the dragunov and as the echoes died away salim flattened himself against the ground and peered cautiously round the sultan to the house ferguson said what the hell is going on the dragunov fired again several times and was joined by another weapon a different sound an ak miller said id know that anywhere salim said help me drop the back flap i think youll find i have a surprise for them there was additional ammunition for the machine gun and flares of one kind and another but most important halfadozen rocketpropelled grenades youre familiar with this weapon major salim asked miller yes and i cant wait to try it out they crouched together aided by the fact that the canvas roof covered the backseat portion of the sultan salim helped him adjust the tube over his right shoulder miller straightened and fired the grenade exploded to the right of the front door there were flames and smoke billowed but there was also another burst from the dragunov my turn salim said chancing it he stood up took careful aim and the grenade went straight through the front door they went up the track cautiously and paused a few yards away the house was a total wreck half the roof gone and parts of it were still burning the first dead man they came to lying on his back was the man with the walleye from khans house and it was obvious that the other three were his companions although damaged so badly that no one could have recognized them the rest of the room had suffered badly but as they stood there there was a groaning sound from the very back by a door that led to the rear of the house legs were sticking out from under a mass of debris and when miller and salim cleared it they found dak khan he was soaked in blood obviously dying and yet he still spoke gasping a little when abu salim knelt to check him khan grabbed him by the front of his uniform its all that bastard ateps fault salim knelt on one knee why do you say that hes the one acting on orders from an al qaeda man in london someone called the preacher ferguson said does he know what hes saying it would seem so abu salim said and returned to dak khan youre certain of this he pressured me again and again to do his dirty work who can say no to al qaeda he was weakening and salim continued what about shamrock he exists atep told me also said general ferguson was being too nosy and needed dealing with he looked up at ferguson and miller he said youd done a great deal of harm to al qaeda so he definitely wanted us dead miller said oh yes and not only you two he glanced at abu salim i asked about you and your men getting in the line of fire he told me there was no problem he said you were a nothing he seemed to swallow and whispered he said with osamas blessing success was assured there was no death rattle he simply closed his eyes and died salim stood up and ferguson said what the hell happens now lets go back to the sultan and talk before we leave salim said we need to get our story straight do we charles ferguson said glancing at miller well that should be interesting indeed it was as back at the sultan salim called colonel atep on his mobile and reported in bad news sir that swine dak khan sold us out took us to a house up country where he insisted shamrock would be and we were attacked by four of his men seated at his desk ahmed atep managed to control himself what happened to general ferguson and major miller theyre fine colonel and except for being cut up a bit so am i i lost my two sergeants but we managed to kill khan and four villains in his employ and hes definitely dead im afraid so colonel but it does mean we avoid the fuss of a public trial which means that considering the importance of our guests it will be much easier to treat the whole unfortunate matter as if it had never happened with considerable relief colonel atep grasped at the straw excellent youve done well captain ill have a medical chinook with you in thirty minutes the mobile went silent youre a marvel captain ferguson said this means we can make our return this evening you handled the call to atep brilliantly thank you general excuse my presumption but i had got the impression you wanted to keep this whole shamrock business as lowkey as possible and so i told the colonel what i knew he wanted to hear under the circumstances im only sorry your journey has been in vain but it hasnt said miller we now know about that al qaeda man in london known as the preacher which could be useful ferguson smiled and glanced up at the noise of the approaching helicopter hows that for service there must have been one in the vicinity ahmed atep had come himself in the helicopter all affability and charm and concern the ambush by taliban which is what it swiftly became in the retelling reflected well on his command and he accompanied them to the military hospital where they were checked thoroughly abu salim needing twenty stitches the windscreen having done its worst after consultation with lacey it was decided that a suitable time to leave would be ten oclock colonel atep insisted on giving them a farewell dinner at the palace the news that they had been attacked in the border country had leaked as these things do and hamid had pulled out all the stops to give them the most extraordinary meal on the terrace ahmed atep was bonhomie itself the life and soul of the party while abu salim with his scarred face was much quieter the colonel patted him on the shoulder come my boy cheer up youre quite the hero theyll be impressed in islamabad who knows a promotion could be in the offing its kind of you to say so colonel i was only doing my duty salim said atep glanced at his watch ah you must be on your way youll forgive me for not seeing you off to the airport i have another appointment i trust your luggage is being taken care of ill see to it salim said excuse me he got up and went out and the bill was discreetly presented to the colonel who waved it away to be put on his account they all went out to the hall where salim waited and said their goodbyes colonel atep went down the steps to where his porsche was parked he waved got in and drove away he loves that car above all things salim said its his virility system he will drive it from here for exactly thirty minutes to that appointment at his favourite house of pleasure how interesting ferguson said isnt it abu salim smiled and now let me see you off it wasnt particularly busy and they walked through the concourse towards the private departure section for vips where they could see parry waiting talking to some security man in uniform there he is ferguson said well be on our way before you know it have a little champagne when we get on board harry eh thatll be nice the security mans mobile sounded he answered it and seemed to go rigid then turned at once to salim terrible news captain that was headquarters colonel ahmed atep has just been blown up in his car salim barely managed a frown with his scarred face tell them ill be there at once but first i must see our guests off the security man nodded then hurried away speaking into the mobile ferguson said to parry lead the way they passed outside and walked towards the gulfstream which waited steps down do carry on parry well only be a moment he and miller turned to face salim and ferguson looked at him gravely a terrible business captain car bombs are one of the curses of our age abu salim said a block of semtex a fifteenminute timer he shrugged no one is safe any more i suppose not youre a remarkable young man ferguson told him and went up the steps miller held out his hand and salim took it for a moment ive always remembered one thing in particular from your counterterrorism lectures at sandhurst major and what would that be that in the world of today the only rule is that there are no rules he walked away miller turned and went up the steps the door closed and a few minutes later the gulfstream moved away l ondo n n orthern i reland it was ten oclock in the morning when dillon and holley turned up at holland park and found roper in his usual place youre late for breakfast roper said weve already had it dillon said daniel and i had a night out first le caprice wonderful food finished in the bar at the dorchester with far too much champagne then retired upstairs where my friend being appallingly rich has booked one of those park suites with two bedrooms what about the hangovers we dont indulge in those im irish and daniel is halfirish and his other half is yorkshire the biggest beer drinkers in the world dillon grinned and as tony doyle entered said any chance of one of your big mugs of tea tony coming right up mr dillon daniel holley had pulled a chair forward sat down on it and started to scan the computer screens something caught his eye and he said whats this about talbot international colonel henry talbot passed on last night roper said itll mean justin talbot will want the chairmans seat for himself which makes sense the ultimate job for the man whos got everything if you dont mind roper lets have a look at him roper turned up a family history which was considerable stretching back to the talbots first appearance in northern ireland from wales in the late seventeenth century scroll through dillon said just show us glamour boy roper did as he was asked but said why do you call him that because hes too good to be true a photo came up of talbot receiving his military cross from the queen a dazzling smile on his face you cant argue with his service record roper pointed out both gulf wars bosnia and kosovo two tours in afghanistan badly wounded and decorated during the second dillon said no irish time what do you make of that could be he opted out of service there but it was still a matter of choice dillon told him somehow it doesnt fit the hero image i bet if you started digging online as only you can youd probably turn something up ill see what i can do a picture of jean talbot and justin appeared on the screen and holley said now theres a nicelooking lady jean talbot his mother ropers fingers moved heres her background clever lady holley said oxford and the slade and look at the results dillon pointed out she won the hollyfield award for her portrait of the queen mother visiting professor in fine art at london university he shook his head i didnt think colonel henry had it in him to produce someone like that id say her mother had more effect than he did roper said ah here we are twentyfirst of july nineteen sixtyfour delivered of a son named justin talbot no entry for name of father her privilege holley said not to name the father could be all sorts of reasons i wonder how colonel henry took it dillon said at least he got an heir bearing his name here we go theres more roper said she bought a house in marley court mayfair on the thirteenth of august that year he nodded so she was raising her son in london not ulster probably didnt want her beloved father anywhere near the boy dillon said well leave you to it and indulge in a workout in the gym followed by a sauna dont forget to turn over talbots dubious past information of the type that roper sought was impossible for most people to obtain but roper wasnt most people two hours of patient probing finally produced a result and it was a treasure trove he was sitting there when they returned you seem deep in thought dillon said ive a lot to think about justin talbot ive printed it out you can read it but i wonder whether i should put a match to it as bad as that dillon said roper pressed his buzzer for doyle a firstrate soldier just doing what they told him to do i suppose doyle appeared and he said toilet tony shower clean everything shirt and track suit right sir lets go doyle said its the jobs he handled on his own that i find astonishing roper said to dillon a oneman killing machine but youll see for yourself he switched on his wheelchair and cruised out doyle walking beside him dillon read it then poured himself a whisky while holley worked through it what do you think dillon asked holley handed the report back you and i have done as much were not soldiers of virtue sean we are soldiers of fortune a bad thing happened to me a long time ago and my response changed me forever and made me what i am i dont do it for money i have money he shrugged as long as its bad people im up against i dont care im certainly not going to condemn justin talbot for what hes done every ira member ive known told me he was fighting a war thats exactly what talbot was doing only it was for the other side dillon smiled reluctantly youre right damn you an ulster television news flash appeared on one of the screens and a reporter in a dark suit read the death of colonel henry talbot at his home in county down last night may seem by many to symbolize the end of an era of extreme politics for which there is no longer a place in northern ireland well thats telling them dillon said the reporter continued the funeral will be for family and friends only and followed by cremation the news moved on and dillon said no orange order no marching bands he shook his head just like the poet said daniel this is the way the world ends not with a bang but a whimper maybe the family didnt like all that kind of thing in the first place maybe justins just trying to make a fresh start you noticed they didnt give a where or when for the funeral youre right dillon said but i know where i can find out and where would that be holley asked my uncle on my mothers side mickeen oge flynn lives at collyban i grew up there after my mother passed on until my father took me to live in london when i was twelve mickeen is close to eighty now but still runs a small garage with one mechanic whos been with him for years a man named paddy orourke they sound like something out of an old abbey theatre play in dublin dont mock im off to the library for some peace and quiet where i can have a word with him flynns garage was on the edge of collyban and with its ancient pumps and concourse of cracked cement it was probably as ancient as mickeen oge himself a small tough old man in a tweed suit and cap he was badly needing a shave but there was nothing new in that the doors were up and the garage was surprisingly large with four different old motor cars inside mickeen was seated at a desk in his old glass office trying to sort a few bills when his phone went i dont know who it is but im on my own at the moment and cant do a thing would you listen you silly old bugger its your only nephew jesus sean can it be true where are you calling from london are you coming to see me not at the moment but im hoping you can help me at that moment the old recovery truck drove in paddy orourke at the wheel mickeen said a wee minute sean he called get on with the new tyres for the front wheels on father gradys car he returned sorry sean in what way colonel henry talbots just died i know last night it was ulster television has just said that the talbots are going to have a very private cremation ceremony for the family and friends but they didnt say where and when theyve been doing that since ninethirty to get the public used to the idea that the family dont want a fuss kilmartins behind them the talbots housekeeper is wife to jack kelly the old ira chief half the villagers work the estate and they know theyre all on a damn good thing justin talbot and the family must be glad of the support being protestants christ you know nothing sean justin talbots a good catholic its emerged that his mother had him baptized for his dying fathers sake and kept it from colonel henry the wrong side of the blanket that one dillon was astonished i would think that piece of news would have been enough to send old henry flying into the next world but you still havent told me where and when do you know of course i do i slipped down to the pub for a quick one half an hour ago ould henry will be into the oven at threethirty over at castlerea nobody would ever expect it so fast so itll be over and done with before they know it but somebodys leaked it dillon said only the locals and nobodys going to go ringing up a newspaper or anything im sure some people will turn up would you be thinking of going yourself well now that you mention it i could take a quick spin that way why dont you do just that and let me know what it was like ill be in touch so i will god bless you seaneen id love to come over to london and see you but im too old for the travelling so there it is he put the old phone back and went to check on how orourke another old man was getting on he had the priests car jacked up and had already replaced the first tyre was that sean you were talking to orourke said it was indeed all the way from london is he coming to see you or what and why would he be coming back to collyban the arse end of the world mickeen shrugged just checking im still alive well to get down to business theres a problem with the exhaust on father ogradys car do i take it into newry and get a replacement hell scream blue murder about the price hes away at the moment so theres no rush leave it up on the jack when youve finished the wheels and ill have a look at it later ive decided to go for a wee drive and see whats happening with the talbot funeral at the castlerea crematorium i didnt have my lunch orourke said so youll have a late one they keep the irish stew simmering all day long down at the green man just finish the tyres like i tell you while i search the cottage for a tie you cant go to a funeral without a tie and he walked out and left orourke there at talbot place justin waited in the study for his mother to join him he wore not only a black suit but the tie to go with it presenting a more sombre picture than he cared for but this was ireland and it was expected he was about to get himself a drink when the preacher phoned him i was wondering when i was going to hear from you talbot said as he opened a french window and went out on to the terrace i wont offer my condolences hassan shah said i doubt theyd be appreciated a time for rejoicing as far as im concerned talbot told him the future beckons there are infinite possibilities for us working together shah said there are infinite possibilities for talbot international to expand in world markets you have so much shah said and yet you want more nothing is enough talbot told him and switched off he swallowed a large vodka then went out into the great hall to find the kellys and tod murphy his mother dressed completely in black including a hat was just coming downstairs her makeup was perfect but her face was an ivory mask a wake was expected later and several village girls supervised by emily were setting up long tables at one end of the hall throwing convention to the winds justin talbot had insisted the coffin would be waiting for them at the crematorium but the funeral company had provided a driver and a black voltern which could accommodate them comfortably emily said to jean god bless you my dear everything will be ready by the time you return thank you jean said do you think many will come emily was shocked but of course theyll abide by your wishes over the funeral but theyll want to pay their respects afterwards a horn sounded outside justin talbot said id say thats for us he gave his mother his arm all right love lets get this over with paddy orourke sat at the end of the bar drinking his guinness except for two old men playing dominoes in the corner the pub was empty martin curry the landlord entered and put a plate of irish stew in front of him get your head round that paddy started glancing up at the bar clock twothirty only another hour to go and ould colonel henry burns in hell good riddance to him curry said wheres mickeen he was in early for a drink but he hasnt eaten he decided to take a run over to castlerea and see the talbot funeral now why would he do that when everyone knows the family dont want a fuss im not sure he was having a chat on the phone to his nephew sean in london from what i heard they were discussing the funeral and so on martin curry said by his nephew sean youre speaking of sean dillon well mickeens only got the one big for the provos in his day sean and big for the brits now curry said what were they talking about he poured another drink on the house the chapel at castlerea crematorium was supposed to be open to any member of the public who wished to enter but not that afternoon not with a visible provisional ira presence arranged by kelly several large and intimidating men in dark suits making it plain to the public that they werent welcome there was a pleasant memorial park surrounding the chapel and other buildings and here and there individuals were visiting their loved ones or delivering flowers mickeen pretended to be such a person and was at least able to observe the hearse waiting by the chapel door the voltern appeared with the party from talbot place and everyone got out and waited jack kelly produced a mobile and answered it for a minute or so glancing round then put it in his pocket moved to the men guarding the door and spoke to one of them the man turned and was obviously searching the memorial park and mickeen moved away one look had been enough to tell him who they were and for the first time it occurred to him that he might have been foolish to come the service in the chapel with the wellmeaning vicar and the piped music could not have been over too soon for justin who felt a certain release as they went out to find it raining jean and hannah were talking to the vicar and kelly pulled justin over sean dillon the one who works for ferguson was born in collyban he left for london at twelve but his uncle mickeen oge flynn owns the garage there so get on with it jack is there some problem his garage mechanic says he overheard mickeen having a telephone conversation from london with dillon from what he heard they were discussing the funeral and the fact that you wanted to keep it private mickeen said he knew it was today and that hed attend and did he as you can see there are a few people in the memorial park the two women had got into the car and sat waiting talbot said in a low dangerous voice cant you give me a straight answer did he come yes one of the men thinks he saw him talbot produced a silver hip flask opened it and swallowed vodka as he closed it he said charles ferguson is a major problem in my life and sean dillon seems to be his top enforcer so when he phones a relative who lives only seven miles from my own home and the said relative turns up as he has done i get highly suspicious tell my mother and hannah to carry on say well see them soon then what kelly asked get one of the men to give you his car and well take a quick trip to collyban just you and me at the garage mickeen found orourke brushing the floor ill finish father gradys car in the morning he said how were the service and the cremation it was like a provisional ira convention with jack kelly and a few of his men from kilmartin discouraging the public from going in the chapel it didnt seem healthy to stay around so i came away get off with you now and ill see you later for a drink ill do that paddy said and went out it was after five and mickeen stood there thinking about what had happened the presence of so many old ira hands had given him a shock people like that were still a power to be reckoned with paddy had left the priests car on the jack so with nothing better to do he switched on the inspection lamp eased his old bones down his back on the trolley and rolled underneath the car he was aware of footsteps approaching and stopped his inspection can i help you he had turned his head and seen two pairs of shoes and started to roll on the trolley but as his head appeared from underneath the car he stopped as a foot stamped beside it stop right where you are justin talbot told him mickeen stared up at him suddenly afraid do you know who i am yes mr talbot and you know me well enough jack kelly said and mickeen nodded why did you try to come to my grandfathers funeral talbot demanded sure and i thought it would be open to anyone and how did you know that it was happening when it was everyone in collyban knew mr talbot they were all talking about it in the green man somebody you thought you could trust must have blabbed and because he knew very well that was the logical explanation talbot become even more incensed and what about your nephew sean dillon i know youve spoken to him earlier what was that all about nothing at all mr talbot mickeen was desperate hes family he just called me from london to say hello youre lying talbot shouted theres more to it than that tell me damn you he kicked at mickeens face catching the edge of the trolley sending him swinging further under the car he almost fell over himself grabbed at the raised handle of the hydraulic jack releasing it and the car subsided mickeen cried out in agony and then there was only silence kelly shoved talbot out of the way reached for the handle and quickly raised the car he crouched picked up the inspection lamp and leaned in mickeens face was covered in blood there was torn flesh on the forehead and he detected bone it was a dreadful sight and he moved back youve done for him are you certain talbot said see for yourself would you think anyone could survive injuries like that ive seen men wounded in battle survive some terrible things and not just when im shamrock it would be simple to make sure if i had a pistol talbot was strangely calm now do you have one no i dont i assumed you always carried not any more kelly said only on certain occasions and today wasnt supposed to be one he checked mickeen again no i say hes dead he lowered the car again and talbot said why are you doing that so that when they find him theyll think it was an accident now lets get out of here they ran through the rain to the bmw and got in as kelly drove away talbot said calmly well thats taken care of that dillon wont be pleased about his uncle but the stupid old bastard had it coming he turned to look at kelly that strange cold smile on his face dont you agree and jack kelly not happy at all managed a nod yes i suppose youre right good then lets get back to the house as soon as possible theyll be wondering whats happened to us it was paddy orourke walking down to the pub who noticed that there were no lights on in either the house or the garage and went to investigate what he found when he raised the car again horrified him like kelly he assumed the worst but called the county air ambulance service which served remote country areas for some reason he didnt want to leave his old friend so didnt go seeking help just sat there holding mickeens cold and apparently lifeless hand after twenty minutes he heard the sound of the approaching helicopter he had switched on all the garage lights and went out and waved frantically and a chinook helicopter settled on the forecourt bringing out all the customers in the green man headed by martin curry the paramedics wasted no time examining mickeen then pulling a kind of turban over his head strapping him to a special stretcher and taking him inside the chinook as orourke watched they worked on the old man until he was festooned with tubes and bottles one of the paramedics shouted youre the one who found him give me your name and phone number the police will want to speak to you its a good thing you found him when you did i thought he was dead orourke shouted almost where are you taking him newry no the seaton hospital in belfast they have a great neurological unit only forty miles well have him there in no time he scrambled back inside the chinook lifted and was away the crowd moved back to the pub curry said what happened he was working under the car and the jack slipped or something and the car fell on him where did they say they were taking him orourke told him and curry said thats a great hospital theyll look after him anyway youve earned a drink this night paddy so join me in the pub the wake was in full swing and half the village seemed to be there enjoying the spread offered by emily and her helpers on the wellstocked tables and drink was taken of course as one would expect at an irish wake jean talbot was working her way through the tenants and she paused to greet her son where have you been i was worried something jack and i needed to sort out didnt we secrets again she knew instantly from his heightened colour and his glittering eyes whatever it is just calm down have a word with father cassidy i really think you should he was exasperated and sounded it if thats what you want young jane was passing with a tray of glasses of champagne he took two good girl he said and as he turned away emptied one glass in a quick swallow he looked around the room saw no sign of the priest the study door had been closed for privacy but he found cassidy in there sitting in a wingbacked chair leafing through a book too noisy for you out there talbot said as he closed the door im getting old the years are overtaking me how are you bearing up you and your mother as if a very great weight has been lifted from our shoulders justin tossed back his champagne cassidy glanced up at the empty wall above the fireplace i see you havent wasted any time in taking down your grandfathers portrait they have a weekly bonfire behind the stables i had considerable pleasure in consigning the portrait to the flames personally there was a certain amount of pain on cassidys face the man has passed on justin let go renounce this continuing hatred forgiveness is that what youre preaching today forget how i suffered father the way he treated my mother was abominable forgiveness is everything christ even forgave judas when he stepped in through the gate at the garden of gethsemane to betray him well as he hanged himself it didnt do him much good because he couldnt forgive himself cassidy said once he stepped through that gate the judas gate as it has become known there was no going back its the same for all of us when our actions betray our loved ones we also betray ourselves talbot took it badly are you suggesting this applies to me before father cassidy could reply the door opened and jack kelly looked in ah there you are justin could i have a word its important justin was so angry that he didnt even excuse himself and followed kelly through the crowd and out of the front door they stood in the porch rain falling whats the problem talbot asked ive heard from curry at collyban mickeen was found by his mechanic who called in the air ambulance service and the chinook flew in so what are you telling me they found a spark of life talbot grabbed him by his tie you said he was dead and well he might be theyre delivering him to the neurological unit at the seaton hospital in belfast plenty of people on the staff there are sympathetic to our cause well have no difficulty finding out whats going on if he gets to open his mouth im finished talbot said lets cross that bridge when we come to it kelly said in the state hes in he could die at any minute for the moment i want you to carry on as normal dont discuss this with anyone and that certainly means your mother did mickeen have any kin in collyban all gone abroad years ago so sean dillon could be his only relative id say so and i know what youre getting at hes bound to be informed one way or the other then ill have to be ready for him talbot said with a pistol under your pillow kelly shook his head youll need more than that with dillon anyway im off to make some calls to belfast ill talk to you later he hurried away through the rain and talbot turned and went back in a match flared in the depths of the great porch revealing jean talbot lighting the cigarette shed come out to enjoy earlier when shed been interrupted by the arrival of her son and kelly secrets always secrets as she inhaled the glow of the cigarette illuminated that porcelain face and dark eyes on the other hand there was a mystery man named sean dillon perhaps there were things she could find out about him she flicked her cigarette out into the rain and returned inside it was sixthirty at holland park evening dark closing in when dillon and holley called with the intention of taking roper down to dinner at the dorchester as they were discussing it he got a call from the gulfstream and put it on speaker were on our way back ferguson told him we left an hour ago farley informed me theyd received a return flight plan i thought youd be staying longer didnt you like it no roper it didnt like us which is why we left as soon as possible so shut up and listen to what happened as might be expected from an old military hand the report was brief but concise and clear leaving nothing out holley and dillon are with me roper said youve really been to war general you could say that weve left seven men dead one way or another have you any comment daniel colonel ahmed atep and abu salim werent there when i last visited i could believe many things about dak khan but the al qaeda connection is something new its a good thing captain abu salim was on your side roper told ferguson he certainly saw colonel atep off in spectacular fashion but that was the pathan in him a matter of honour and revenge for his two sergeants ferguson said so where does this leave us roper asked with further proof that shamrock exists and another codename an important person in london known as the preacher unfortunately if we insert that into the computer and demand an answer it will give us precisely nothing dillon cut in i wouldnt be too sure about that ferguson answered not when roper starts digging ive every faith in him most kind roper said well be seeing you in about nine hours or so thats it over and out roper shook his head what an amazing exploit something to celebrate holley told him are you up for the dorchester try and stop me roper glanced at the clock lets say about a quarter to eight ive got a few things to wrap up here at talbot place there were still villagers in the great hall many with drink taken but people were having such a good time that they didnt want to go justin leaned against the wall by the study door watching his mother holding court at the foot of the stairs so popular so loved by the people he told himself with a kind of envy but then she was mary ellen come back to life he was waiting for kelly and getting impatient it had been almost an hour since the man had gone to his car to get things moving in belfast but suddenly there he was entering through the front door and hurrying over to him ive got news he said lets go in the study they went in and justin closed the door and shot the bolt tell me ive been in touch with a friend brian carson who shared a cell with me in the maze prison hes a good man and owns a large construction company but his silent partners are a provo syndicate he only has to lift a phone to contact our sympathizers so mickeen was taken straight into intensive care where a scan diagnosed a fractured skull and possible brain damage he hasnt recovered consciousness and is scheduled for emergency neurosurgery is that it no theres more apparently he could die at any moment theres only a five per cent chance of him surviving the surgery so we just live with it and hope talbot said thats it justin but our source in the hospital is absolutely sound whatever happens well be informed as quickly as anybody talbot laughed harshly well lets hope the old bastard obliges us all by dying quickly well have a drink on it he started to move to the bar and his mobile sounded it was the preacher and talbot nodded to kelly a finger to his mouth and put his mobile on speaker i presume the funeral passed without incident the preacher said perfectly but this is ireland and people expect a wake talbot told him half the villagers are still here enjoying themselves im glad someone is happy the preacher said whats happened talbot asked ferguson and miller were enticed into a trip to the border area by an illegal gun runner named dak khan on the promise of meeting shamrock where an ambush was waiting i presume did something go wrong my information is sketchy apparently khan and his people were all disposed of could we have it in plain language khan and his people have ended up dead and ferguson and miller were responsible so it would appear well good for ferguson theres life in the old dog yet he is after all a grenadier all i can say is your asset needs changing hes obviously hopeless hes dead too hassan shah said a car bomb not ferguson that one justin talbot shook his head not his style im sure your man had plenty of enemies well at least that means you dont have to get rid of him yourself now al qaeda will punish his killers as they deserve and the same will happen to ferguson and his people i wouldnt be so cavalier talbot the fact that theyre persisting in the search for shamrock means that they are your problem too well ive had other things on my mind for the moment youll have to manage without me he switched off and kelly said youre not going to share the mickeen oge flynn problem with him then am i hell now lets have the drink he went to the bar and poured whiskey kelly took the glass offered i remember in the old days when i was on the army council charles ferguson was top of the list of people you didnt get involved with if you could avoid it now you know why justin emptied his glass its been a long day lets see if we can ease everyone out he pulled back the bolt and led the way into the great hall there was silence and then jean talbot moved in through the curtains seeking her son earlier and finding the study door bolted curiosity had sent her round to the terrace shed halted at the studys french windows partially covered by a halfdrawn curtain aware of the murmur of voices the window was never locked shed eased the handle and opened it just enough to hear everything that was being said and none of it made her happy and she had not the slightest idea what to do about it dillon roper and holley were about to set out to dinner when dillons mobile sounded switch it off for christs sake roper said but it was too late for dillon already answering heard the unmistakable ulster tones of a young woman saying would that be mr sean dillon of stable mews mayfair london he slipped back into the accent of his childhood it is indeed my love im calling from belfast mr dillon im sergeant eileen flanagan police service of northern ireland and what can i be doing for you an old gentleman called mickeen oge flynn has been admitted to seaton hospital and a search in his wallet has discovered a nextofkin card dillon was all attention mickeen is my uncle im his only relative has he had a heart attack or something no its nothing like that im not supposed to go into clinical details if you phone the hospital theyll be able to answer your questions for the love of god girl cant you tell me more is it serious all right but dont get me into trouble he was working under a motor car and it fell on him he was discovered by his mechanic one patrick orourke the air ambulance service brought him to the seaton hospital in belfast i understand it doesnt look good but really youll have to talk to the hospital about that i have patrick orourkes mobile phone number would you like it yes i would dillon went to ropers desk and found a pen and she dictated the number to him will you be coming she said definitely god bless you the others waited expectantly and he told them the worst he said to roper if you could get seaton hospital online and find me the right person to speak to id appreciate it ill get right on to it roper said you do intend to go over there as fast as i can so well need to check out flights from heathrow no you wont holley said ill fly you myself are you sure dillon said of course and im coming with you i was at queens university in belfast more years ago than i care to remember it will be interesting to go back dillon said to roper make sure were allowed to land at belfast city airport by the docks holley cut in and book us a suite at the europa he turned to dillon lets get going roper managed to get the flight classified as a ministry of defence priority so everything worked perfectly including the landing at belfast as a result it was only tenthirty when they reached the hospital and were directed to the neurological unit at that time of night it was fairly quiet the corridors empty except for the occasional nurse the reception area was on the third floor there were chairs a vending machine for drinks magazines and an ageing woman with grey hair behind the desk she smiled pleasantly as they approached we dont often get visitors this late so i suspect youll be the gentlemen from london for mr flynn we were told you were on your way dillon and holley isnt it ive issued you with identity tags please put them on its regulations how is my uncle dillon asked im not allowed to give out that information all i can say is that hes had major surgery and that mr frank jordan performed the operation himself hes a truly wonderful surgeon so your uncle is in good hands can we see him dillon asked meaning mickeen the surgeon oh yes hes come in especially at that moment the man himself came down the corridor he seemed about sixty with a wellused face and a shock of grey hair he wore the standard white coat a stethoscope sticking out of one pocket dillon stood and held out his hand sean dillon and my friend daniel holley im mickeens nephew lets sit down and talk jordan turned to the receptionist tea for three molly make it using your own kettle behind the desk there i hate that bloody machine certainly sir she said so how bad is it dillon asked as they sat im a plain man mr dillon and i always prefer to tell the truth or at least as i see it its as bad as it could be his left arm is broken it was obviously raised as the vehicle collapsed and theres a flesh wound on the right but those arent the problems its the head injuries he has skull fractures of the utmost severity and brain damage dillon said yes lacerations to a certain degree weve worked on him for four hours and put in a titanium plate in one area molly had produced the tea put the tray on a table beside them and poured dillon asked what kind of chance does he have a man of his age whos drunk a pint of whiskey every day of his life he could die five minutes from now but head trauma is a strange business patients can hang in there for weeks jordan was drinking his tea is that normal holley asked theres no such thing as normal in a case like this ive had many patients over the years who continue to sleep you mean they dont revive at all dillon asked its been known to last for months and when the patient comes to theyve been in dreamtime usually theyve completely lost their memory dillon nodded can we see him only through the door come with me the private room was at the very end of the corridor there was a square observation window in the door mickeen resembled a mummy with all his bandages he was festooned with bottles and tubes electronic machines bleeping away a man in a white coat sat in the corner reading a book whos he dillon asked the night nurse with such a serious matter mr flynn will continue to have one at his side in case of emergencies holley said theres nothing for you here sean lets go and book in at the hotel they paused before walking back to reception and jordan said i understand youre based in london so seeing him on a regular basis would be difficult theres not much you could do anyway though even if you came in every day dillon shook hands youre right but what if i moved him to london jordan paused i think hed be all right but that would require a private air ambulance itd cost many thousands of pounds holley said weve got that kind of money jordan frowned just who are you people dillon produced his mi warrant card you look a decent sort of man so im going to take a chance we work for a special security outfit on behalf of the prime minister and we have a private hospital called rosedene in holland park small but superbly equipped it takes care of people damaged in our line of work its run by a professor charles bellamy hes put me together a few times but i know him jordan said we were colleagues at guys hospital in london for years give me your card and ill have him contact you and make the arrangements you are sure mickeen can be moved oh yes in an air ambulance but as i say it will cost you he produced his card and said my private mobile number im used to being wakened at all hours so your people can call me any time all i need is the right authorization take care gentlemen jordan walked away a good man that one dillon said i agree now if you dont mind me bringing up mundane matters can i remind you we havent had any dinner at this time of night theyll call it supper dillon said as they arrived back in reception holley thanked the receptionist for the tea will you be wanting a taxi she asked we have one waiting come on sean and they walked down to the lift it was quiet again not a soul about molly took a mobile from her handbag and dialled a number and said to the man who answered is that you mr carson its molly weve just had two visitors from london to see flynn a sean dillon and a daniel holley did they see jordan brian carson asked theyve just left after a long chat i heard everything which she hadnt of course for the conversation concerning the possibility of transferring mickeen to london in the air ambulance had taken place outside his room at the other end of the corridor so what did the doctor have to say that theyd operated for four hours and theres brain damage its the kind of situation where if he died five minutes from now no one would be surprised on the other hand hes not just unconscious hes in a coma and he could stay like that for ages nobody knows how long but mr jordan said that when such people do awake theyve often lost their memory well dying would be better but the situation could be worse my friends will have to accept how things are they came in a private jet they must be big operators thats an understatement if i told you they were both provos in their day would it surprise you hell on wheels those two holy mother of god she said youve done well molly it will be noted goodnight to you justin talbot was sitting in a wingbacked chair on a dais in his mothers studio he wore an opennecked black shirt and black velvet cord trousers his arms folded hair tousled hed been there an hour while his mother worked on a new portrait she was standing at her easel only a few feet away in her paintstained smock a palette in one hand a brush in the other for gods sake how much longer its been an hour already its difficult love she said i cant get exactly the expression i want his mobile trembled in his breast pocket he answered it and kelly said are you alone just a minute justin got up ive got to answer this really justin she was annoyed the studio was above the east end of the stable there was an exit door that opened on to a metal platform and stairs down to the cobbled yard he closed the door behind him jean went to the sink in the corner and pretended to be cleaning brushes as she pushed the window open enough to hear him not that she learned much except that he was angry kelly having told him everything carson had to say said it could be worse come on jack justin said the little bugger might decide to wake up at any time so what do you suggest couldnt your people get someone to pull the plug on him that would take care of the whole damn business very risky lets just wait and see for the moment all right but nothingd better go wrong you hear me he switched off in exasperation jean was back at her portrait in an instant bad news darling no just a problem with the farm look cant we call it a day im tired he was angry and mutinous she laughed thats the expression im after its absolutely perfect just another halfhour darling dillon called roper and explained the situation to him i cant believe what im hearing he said when dillon was finished ferguson will have a fit he gave you explicit instructions not to go to ireland at the moment and that ambulance plane will cost a fortune it was a bloody emergency dillon said holley boomed in and ive already said ill pay for the damn thing so forget ferguson dillon said will you kindly take frank jordans mobile number call and make the arrangements next contact professor charles bellamy at rosedene make everything a matter of extreme urgency so that by the time ferguson arrives its a done deal all right ill get on to it but only because i cant wait to see fergusons reaction when he finds out presumably youre coming back in the morning well see for the moment all were interested in is some supper take care roper the twobedroom suite at the europa hotel had a dining room and dillon and holley ordered room service a lobster salad apiece new potatoes cabbage with bacon and drank icecold nonvintage krug champagne it was touching midnight when the waiter reappeared and cleared what time is fergusons gulfstream getting in holley asked i dont know and i dont care dillon said youve got to go back and face the old mans wrath some time holley told him but not just yet dillon yawned we could stay on for a day or so since were here roper will take care of everything for moving mickeen we could rent a car go for a drive to where my mother died giving birth to me in collyban i lived with mickeen as a child while my father was away working then he returned and took me away with him to london when i was twelve so you havent seen much of your uncle over the years two or three times by night when i was on the run during the troubles and i paid him a flying visit the other year on business for ferguson the truth is the old sods the only close relative ive got left i was surprised at the sense of loss i felt looking at him in that hospital bed so where is this leading paddy orourke his mechanic at the garage found him i wouldnt mind going to see him i could let him know how mickeen is youre talking nonsense sean that would only depress him whats really eating at you okay so i hadnt been in touch with mickeen since god knows when and i phoned him on a whim because i thought hed be able to tell me the time and place of the talbot funeral and he could so whats that got to do with anything i dont know except that somehow i feel responsible i dont see how you could be but if you feel like that give orourke a call and well drive down and see him how far fifty miles here or there ill get in touch with him in the morning are you carrying one of the advantages of diplomatic privilege holley pulled up his right trouser leg and showed the ankle holster with the colt no welldressed man should be without one i couldnt agree more dillon put his foot on a chair and showed an identical colt silenced with hollow points why settle for less that will always do the job but why are you asking collyban was always republican territory ira bandit country i used to be a hero to people there whod never even seen me and then ferguson came along and somehow i doubt theyd still be feeling the same once in never out thats been the motto of the ira since its inception hasnt it so screw them were still provos whether they like it or not daniel told him im away to bed at eight oclock the following morning they were working their way through breakfast in the cafe when roper called dillon ferguson got in just after three this morning he asked me if i had anything special to report and you said nothing i presume exactly i just hope i dont regret it anyway your mr frank jordan doesnt let the grass grow under his feet mickeen oge flynn will be picked up at nine and taken to belfast city airport to board the air ambulance for london rosedene is waiting for him excellent in fact jordan has decided to go along he said hed like to keep an eye on flynn and besides its costing so much he might as well get something out of it roper youve done wonders dillon said im truly grateful and hopefully so will be mickeen so what are your plans weve ordered a car and were driving down to collyban roper was concerned what in the hell are you up to sean id have thought it very unwise to visit anywhere in that area and dammit youre only fifteen miles from crossmaglen where holleys mother was born so hes as bad as you are whats this obsession with living dangerously oh roper itll be just a quiet day out in county down what could be nicer you worry too much and he switched off we have to put the cat amongst the pigeons holley said no that happens when ferguson wakes up and finds out what happened but well deal with that when the explosion takes place he found the piece of paper with orourkes number on it poured himself a second cup of tea and called him whos that orourkes voice was wary paddy me ould son dillon told him cheerfully its mickeens only nephew sean dillon orourke gasped jesus sean where are you in belfast paddy i flew in last night thinking mickeen was going to die on me four hours they operated on him the brain was damaged you see and him in a coma what do you mean orourke asked cautiously hes in a deep sleep and nobody knows if hell wake up anyway im having him transferred to london in an air ambulance theres a special hospital where ill be able to keep an eye on him and whens that nine oclock well thats fantastic i found him you know i dont know how to thank you save it till i see you paddy see me orourke said ive got a friend with me called daniel holley weve hired a car and were driving down you can show me where it happened and i can discuss what were going to do with the garage orourke was flabbergasted but you shouldnt come here to collyban sean theres plenty who wouldnt like it no knowing what they might do not to worry paddy i can look after myself well if youre sure what time would you be coming we should be there by eleven if youre not at the garage well look for you in the pub the green man orourke was horrified never in there sean its ira to the hilt and didnt i join as a volunteer at nineteen when my father was shot by brit paratroopers do you say i have no right to go in not me sean but others would well enough talk you know when to expect us he switched off and said to holley did i stir the hornets nest enough thats an understatement holley said lets get moving martin curry was working behind the bar at the green man washing glasses there was not a soul in the place when paddy orourke entered through the side door which was hardly surprising at nine oclock jesus paddy isnt it a bit early even for you will you give me a large one martin for pitys sake and me having the shock of my life and what would that be curry asked ive just had sean dillon on the mobile hes been to see mickeen in the hospital in belfast he says hes coming down to see me this morning to discuss whats going to happen to the garage curry was thunderstruck he must be mad he poured paddy a double whiskey drink that down and tell me exactly what he said jack kelly was sitting at his desk in the back office of the kilmartin arms doing his accounts when curry phoned he ended by telling jack ill have two or three of the boys in well sort the bastard out take it easy martin the old days are gone we have to be careful how we go christ are you going chicken on me after what weve been through together sean dillon is a disgrace to the village where he was born youre right martin hes a turncoat whos been serving the brits for years now taking orders from charles ferguson one of our biggest enemies in the old days but weve got to go carefully here i dont want to do anything that would bring in the police ive got the talbots to consider theyve only just seen off colonel henry for gods sake so what do i do if the bastard tries to come in the green man well handle it martin and ill be there to stand with you do as i say take it as a direct order from your old commander and the other business he told paddy about having mickeen flown out to london black news that but theres nothing to be done about it jean talbot and justin enjoyed breakfast together but her pleas for him to sit for her again fell on deaf ears he intended to go riding and that was that she retreated to her studio and got to work the weather outside was dark and oppressive and there was a hint of rain it had become incredibly stuffy in the studio overnight and she opened the exit door before starting work on the portrait again an hour went by and then she heard a car arrive she went to a window and saw jack kelly getting out of his old morris she was about to go out on the platform and speak to him when she saw justin galloping fast across the meadow only reining in his mount at the last moment so that it reared up and kicked out before settling he walked it in to the yard through the archway and dismounted youre a stupid boy still but then ive been telling you that for years youll kill yourself doing that one of these days justin is that so whats got into you this morning come into the stable the boys gone to the village so ive got to unsaddle myself is there a problem you could say that sean dillons coming curry told me hell be at collyban at eleven oclock to discuss flynns garage with him talbot was stunned so ill actually get the chance to meet him im damned if you will now get that horse inside we need to talk upstairs jean was moving fast hurrying across the studio opening another door because a few wooden steps gave access to a landing overlooking the stalls where justin was unsaddling tell me all about it he was saying to kelly it had started to rain when kelly was finished and justin went to the door peering out and thinking about it what a mess jack so whats to be done do we shoot the bastard for christs sake will you listen to me boy you do nothing because its got nothing to do with you so dillon works for ferguson as does daniel holley these days apparently theyve no idea youre shamrock as far as i know they havent even heard of the preacher dillon is here to sort out flynns garage with orourke what would justin talbot chairman of talbot international have to do with that you mean i shouldnt even meet him absolutely not and i want your word on it if you say so justin said wearily frankly its all getting a bit on top of me how long can we hope for mickeen to act the sleeping beauty in london from what jordan says a long long time even if he does wake up he could well not remember a thing about it its not good enough jack justins eyes glittered again his body crackling with energy ive got to find a solution to all this he grinned and slapped kelly on the back when i do youll be the first to know what it is but ill leave dillon and his friend to you kelly got in his morris and drove off the stable boy appeared and took charge of the horse justin went up to the studio but his mother wasnt there he stood looking at the portrait she was good he reflected too bloody good really as he had recently told her she didnt just go for appearance she got what was inside too she got the disturbed wildness in him which made him feel uncomfortable and he went back down the iron stairs to the yard at that moment the maroon shogun emerged from the garage his mother at the wheel she waved briefly but didnt stop he wondered where she was going not that it mattered he had enough on his mind with the whole damn situation the preacher ferguson shamrock he went through the house to the study to get a drink and think about it paddy orourke was not happy if the garage was closed down it would be a serious inconvenience for the villagers who would have to drive as far as kilmartin to find another so martin currys orders were plain if dillon made him a job offer which he probably would orourke was to take it then send him on his way which meant anywhere he liked to go as long as it wasnt the green man paddy sat on a stool just inside the garage the main door open smoked a cigarette between his finger and thumb and waited watched by two hard young men named dempsey and farrel from behind a halfdrawn window curtain where the fug are they farrel said and the silver bmw came down the hill and halted on the forecourt paddy stood up and dillon got out followed by holley who had been driving which one is dillon i wonder farrel said neither of them looks like much to me dempsey nodded lets see what happens its me paddy sean dillon smiled and grasped a reluctant hand i was twelve years old when i last saw you so how could you remember me orourke tried to smile its grand to see you and looking so well this is my good friend daniel holley he might sound english but his mother was from crossmaglen and thats not too far from here and thats a fact orourke said but before he could say anything else the shogun came down the hill swung in and parked beside the bmw christ jesus dempsey said its the lady from talbot place whats she doing here id better get curry on my mobile farrel said and did so straightaway what are they doing curry demanded she hasnt got out of her car yet just keep watching and ill call you back curry rang off then called jack kelly who answered at once ive got a problem curry said and told him what the hell is she playing at kelly demanded never mind ill be straight over curry called farrel stay with it but let me know the moment they start moving anywhere he switched off his mobile and turned to the seven or eight people in the bar drink up and move on i want you out of here in five minutes the three men turned to look at jean and she opened the glove compartment and took out a shortbarrelled smith amp wesson revolver one of a number of weapons colonel henry had kept around the house she slipped it in her trenchcoat pocket and got out of the shogun sorry if im intruding she said remember me paddy from kilmartin jean talbot colonel henrys daughter he looked slightly dazed and she took his hand i was so sorry to hear about what happened to mickeen thats kind of you he seemed to come to life this is sean dillon mickeens nephew over from london on hearing the bad news she turned and didnt offer her hand simply stood there with hands in her pockets looking him over sean dillon she frowned slightly a familiar name im sure ive heard it before and my friend daniel holley she smiled at holley so how is mickeen what can i say dillon shrugged slightly hes had a massive operation which has left him with a titanium plate in the head and hes comatose hes been flown to london by air ambulance so what happens here the garage you mean thats quite simple im offering paddy a full partnership to keep things going while we see how mickeen makes out suddenly orourke was smiling by god thats a fine offer sean and ill take it he spat on the palm of his hand held it out and dillon shook it jean said may i suggest we adjourn to the green man and seal the bargain with a drink paddys face fell well now there could be complications about that what complications dont be silly paddy she took dillons arm shall we go its entirely our pleasure mrs talbot they walked away holley and paddy following farrel called curry at once theyre on their way to the pub mr curry then move your arses and get down here fast use the back lane curry was coldly angry he reached under the bar and produced a sawnoff shotgun which he loaded and then replaced under the bar there was no solution there the woman was a wild card in this game she was untouchable the door opened and she led the way in just in front of dillon holley and orourke behind mr curry how nice to see you its been a while you may know mr dillon here he certainly does were of an age dillon said we were at the village school together how goes it martin his smile was mocking curry was struggling to keep control but before he could make any kind of reply the back door crashed open and dempsey and farrel entered whats happening farrel demanded were all having a drink to celebrate paddy being made partner at the garage jean said why dont you join us im damned if ill drink with these shites or you you protestant whore he said producing a pistol dillon kicked him under the right kneecap and as he doubled over raised his knee into the descending face and sent him back to trip over a chair and bounce off the wall blood oozing from a broken nose as he slid to the floor dropping his pistol curry reached under the bar producing the sawnoff shotgun holley picked up the glass jug of water on the bar threw it in his face and yanked the shotgun from him by the barrel he tossed it into the corner kicking dempsey in the face as he leaned down to pick up farrels pistol jean talbot took the smith amp wesson from her pocket and fired a shot into the ceiling now can everybody calm down the door opened and jack kelly stepped in he surveyed the scene dempsey and farrel crouched on the floor by the wall curry drying his face with a bar towel orourke looked terrified kelly said to dillon have you given paddy the job i dont know who you are but yes hes now a partner excellent im jack kelly estate manager at talbot place ah i mind that name from days when you were doing something else dillon said do you know my friend daniel holley we have mutual friends in crossmaglen if youre finished here jean ill see you home thats kind of you she turned to dillon and holley shall we go certainly dillon turned to curry its been a sincere sensation martin he ducked as curry threw a glass at him outside jean was getting into kellys morris hes just running me up to my car nice meeting you gentlemen its good to be able to put a face to the name they walked back up the street i feel bad about leaving paddy in there dillon said hell be all right holley grinned theyve got to get their petrol from somewhere yes hell survive but what a bloody place thank god my father got me out of it at twelve lets get going as holley drove dillon called roper whats the situation with ferguson hes not stirring yet so im leaving well enough alone have you been having fun dillon told him what had happened because roper had a talent approaching genius for making sense out of everything what do you think jean talbot quite a lady i liked the bit with the gun she probably went along to the garage because she wanted to meet you but i suspect she was also stirring things up the catholic and protestant thing is what she was raised on all her life she knew youd have trouble at the green man thats true maybe she just likes to live dangerously anyway whats the deal on mickeen at rosedene hes arrived and charles bellamy has everything in hand he and jordan fell into each others arms and are enjoying lunch together at rosedene as we speak so everybodys happy until ferguson surfaces god help us all then ive booked your flight plan for three hours from now at belfast city over and out dillon leaned back three hours to lift off say farewell to beautiful ulster if youre worried about ferguson i really meant it when i said id pay for the air ambulance holley told him after an initial roaring when he hears of it ferguson will calm down the department will pay its a matter of honour actually i dont see why they should mickeen isnt in the employ of the secret intelligence service he just had an accident its you whove used your position to cause things to happen helped by my promise to pay strictly speaking i doubt whether mickeen has any right to be in rosedene damn you and your logic but i suppose youre right okay ill just have to pay for it myself can you afford it to be honest i made a great deal of money back in nineteen ninetyone payment for a spectacular and we wont say what it was the moneys sat in a numbered account in switzerland ever since over eighteen years i believe its trebled you old bastard holley said is there no end to you so thats mickeen taken care of im going to have a nap dillon inclined his seat back and closed his eyes jack kelly sitting opposite justin in the study told him about the scene at the green man justin was angry what was my mother up to creating such mayhem in collyban she told me she simply wanted to express her sympathy to paddy orourke shes known flynn for years always buys petrol from his garage so she was there just by chance when dillon and holley turned up really it seems so and it was she who insisted they go to the green man to celebrate the deal unfortunately currys man objected to dillon and matters got out of hand unfortunate justin shrugged well if all thats true i suppose theres really nothing to worry about after all she hasnt the slightest idea who dillon and holley are i cant see how she could kelly said good then lets have a drink on it other things had been happening the previous evening too while dillon and holley were racing to make their flight to belfast after the death threat from number one man kalid hasim had felt extremely nervous his friend sajid was still in st lukes hospital with the broken arm omar who had swum into the darkness of the thames had vanished alone he felt very vulnerable but he was no coward and he soon got restless tired of staying in the furnished room he rented he ventured out at seventhirty in the evening and went to his usual gym for a training session a baseball bat in the long sports bag he carried just in case it wasnt particularly busy and there was no one to spar with so he just worked out for an hour then showered dressed and left unsure of where he was going to go there was a lamp shining down from a bracket about ten feet above the end of the narrow street the beam causing a reflection of his image in the shop window so that he was aware of the other image merging into his own a gun in its right hand i told you you were a dead man the voice said from behind him now keep walking and turn into the alley on the right the canals at the end very convenient that im sure youll agree just give me a break hasim half sobbed for effect as he said it then stumbled dropped the bag the baseball bat in his right hand and swung wildly against the mans left thigh number one man cursed and stumbled the silenced pistol discharging hasim dropped the baseball bat at the sound and ran out into the road blindly dodging through traffic he stopped in the safety of the far side pedestrians around and stepped into a doorway from where he could observe the alley when a figure emerged he gave himself away by carrying hasims sports bag in one hand he must have assumed hasim was running for his life hasim had not been able to get a good look at his assailant on the street but now he stepped back into the darkness of the doorway and watched him the lights on a silver mercedes down the street came on must be a remote control hasim found a pen in a pocket of his tracksuit and wrote the licence plate number across the palm of his hand the man drove away and hasim stood thinking there was no point going home that would be the equivalent of committing suicide he had twentyfive or thirty pounds in his pocket a limited future indeed whichever way you looked at it number one man was obviously serious about killing him and it only gave him one choice he waved down a cab got in and told the driver to take him to the dark man on cable wharf it was time to talk to the salters harry and billy salter were in the corner booth dora serving them with two plates of sandwiches ham and pickles she said and salad for the vegetarian teetotaller so kind dora billy reached for one harry said well look what the cats brought in hasim stood uncertainly just inside the door and joe baxter went and grabbed his arm shall i give him the heaveho boss just listen to me mr salter hasim pleaded why should i the guy i told you about whos just a voice on the phone the one youd never met billy said he just tried to shoot me there was complete silence then harry said now why would he do that after you gave me the money and told me to find my friend i took him to the hospital hes still there the man im talking about called me he said id shot my mouth off to you he added that you now knew it was connected to al qaeda and it was my fault and i was a dead man and hes had a go billy demanded hasim described exactly what had happened when hed left the gym in camden what a bastard salter said we cant have this lets have a look at your palm he examined it turned to billy and read off the licence plate number hasim had written there roper should take at least five minutes to trace this bleeder on his computer wouldnt you say absolutely billy was already on his mobile calling holland park he got up walking away as he talked to roper harry said you look half starved have a sandwich theres salad there i know you muslims dont go for ham actually im rather partial to it so if you dont mind hasim helped himself there are muslims and muslims youd better stay here for a bit while we sort this out dora said as she brought him a drink she ruffled his hair cant have a nice young lad like you running round in fear for his life god help us shell be adopting you next harry said but shes got a point go on have another sandwich build yourself up the licence plate number was the key that unlocked everything his names selim lancy billy said when he returned to the booth an interesting geezer his father was an english seaman his mothers muslim shes got cancer and shes a patient at st lukes at the moment just up the bleeding road harry said bit of a coincidence not really they live in an old house on tangier wharf thats no distance at all whats he do harry asked has he got any form not the kind you mean billy said a corporal in para couple of tours in afghanistan badly wounded discharged ropers even got the amount of compensation he received from the ministry of defence seventeen grand well i think we should do better than that for our gallant lads harry said that isnt going to keep him for the rest of his life is it hes bought a secondhand mercedes and is a licensed private chauffeur billy shrugged its a living i suppose more than a living id have thought harry said whats more glamorous than a war hero in a good suit driving a silver mercedes those posh birds that go shopping to harrods or bond street will lap him up i bet hes making a fortune which still leaves us with the al qaeda connection billy said and turned to hasim whod been listening intently whats that all about i honestly dont know hasim said he only mentioned the name al qaeda once like i told you when he sentenced me to death and then he frowned i think he takes his religion seriously in what way billy asked he paid me and my friends once to smash up a shop selling antimuslim literature then on another occasion to do the same to a place selling pornographic magazines did you do that often billy asked we torched an old shop somebody had bought with the intention of turning it into a massage parlour he told me over the phone that the people involved used young girls and that his boss thought it an offence against allah well i agree with him there harry said but who was this boss he mentioned i havent the slightest idea hasim said that was the only time he said such a thing harry turned to billy what do you make of this it fits with the al qaeda attitude billy told him they follow the teachings of the koran theyre moralists and these joints hasim and his pals turned over were purveyors of filth all very well my old son but the attack on the dark man was nothing to do with allah or the koran and everything to do with some personal vendetta against all of us harry said i agree billy told him then i suggest you do something about it like getting your arse over to tangier wharf grabbing lancy by the scruff of his neck and bringing him back here where i can put a few pertinent questions to him harry looked grim i mean muslim morality is one thing but hes got questions to answer take the boys as backup if you want billy nodded to baxter ill take joe as driver and hasim might be useful im just going to check my laptop roper was putting an identity photo through from army records harry said to hasim do you feel okay about this he sounds like a bad bastard yes i think he is hasim looked tired but shrugged and tried to smile its as allah wills mr salter i made a bad mistake getting involved with this man i will do anything to get rid of him billy returned wearing a dark singlebreasted raincoat he produced a silenced walther from the interior pocket checked it and replaced it he said to baxter you tooled up joe in the car baxter told him a selection thats it then billy put a hand on hasims shoulder lets get it done selim lancy had been visiting his mother in the oncology department at st lukes an operation for her skin cancer seemed to be working and theyd assured him the treatment had stopped the spread hed taken her flowers and sat with her for a while she was a kind and simple person who divided her time between keeping the old victorian flat on tangier wharf spotless and offering whatever services were required at the mosque she was overwhelmed by what seemed to her the luxury of her private room at the hospital and lancy had spent time assuring her that they could afford it except for pocket money hed always put everything into her deposit account including the largesse from the preacher a total in excess of fifty thousand pounds the dangerous game he had chosen to play carried the chance of instant death at any time so it was his way of making things as simple as possible by leaving her everything in advance when hed had enough he kissed her hand and said to her in arabic sleep well mother allah and all the angels protect you her eyes already closing she murmured something and he eased out turning from the busy right lane traffic of wapping high street into the gloom of tangier street was like a journey back in time the old warehouse buildings several storeys high rearing up into the night obviously waiting for the developer the streetlights were museum pieces many of them originally gas lamps from the look of them there was a strange brooding air to the place as if it was waiting for something to happen as joe baxter cut his engine and coasted down over the cobbles to the thames below what a bleeding place to live billy said youd only need the cameras to make a jack the ripper film it gives me the creeps hasim said im already imagining a bogey man waiting to jump out at me they coasted silently down to a victorian towerlike rookery about five storeys high the wharf below it creating a basin of deep water where ship and barge traffic had been able to ply their trade a gateway its gates long gone gave entrance to a courtyard and the only light came from a lamp bracketed over the main door a rotting sign said tangier wharf hart amp son general shipping christ billy said its like charles dickens is writing the script there was a modern sign at one side of the entrance advertising a development of apartments and offices the following year with unsurpassed river frontage i dont care what they do hasim said this place would still give me the creeps never mind that billy said the important thing is theres no sign of a silver mercedes in the courtyard so well go and suss out the situation joe just put the car across the street in that turning so that its out of sight baxter switched on for a moment and turned into the yard across the way then killed his engine again billy opened the glove compartment and took out a smith amp wesson revolver have you ever fired one of these never hasim said well youve been to the movies so you know what to do billy replaced the weapon in the glove compartment you know where it is if you need it stay here and keep your eyes open well check where he lives they moved across to the courtyard and baxter tried the front door which swung open there was a tenant listing beside the door most of the slots blank and billy read it quickly theyve all gone except for mrs lancy shes on the top floor and shes in the hospital isnt she baxter said she certainly is so lets get up there and see if we can arrange a surprise for her son when he returns home hasim sat there not enjoying himself at all the whole atmosphere of the place was threatening and sitting in the mercedes he felt claustrophobic so he took the smith amp wesson from the glove compartment opened the door got out and stood looking down at the river a boat passed lit up the sound of people and music echoing across the water and then the muzzle of a pistol was rammed into the side of his head and the smith amp wesson torn from his hand now then you young bastard selim lancy said lets have some answers what the hell is going on here dont try lying to me i know who salter is and i recognize the geezer with him from my visit to the dark man when you dropped me in it youve been doing it again come off it hasim said i didnt know your name never mind your address until they picked me up and how did they know where to find you salter had a look at my social security card when they turned me over that night at the dark man and how do they know about me salter said he had one of his men follow me a couple of times and he noticed you in the silver mercedes he thought it odd so they checked your licence plate number so what are they up to now the muzzle of the gun bored painfully into hasims right ear checking on your place to see if youre at home he said your mother was in the hospital the fact that they knew about his mother disturbed lancy and made him angry the bastards he said bringing my mother into it well well see if i can provide a nice surprise get moving across the courtyard and straight down the left side and round the back hasim did as he was told wondering what had gone wrong it was in fact very simple lancy parked in a yard on the high street by arrangement with a shopkeeper it was sheer chance that hed walked down tangier street just after baxters silent approach and had from the shadows witnessed what had gone on now he shoved hasim roughly ahead of him and paused the rear of the building dropped five storeys down into forty feet of water in the basin but at the side another ancient lamp illuminated an old goods lift the doors long since gone get in lancy said it still works so hang on at that rail we wouldnt want you to fall out would we hasim was desperate but there seemed no way out of his predicament they stopped and lancy shoved him out on a flat roof there were the remains of a low wall which in some places had crumbled already hasim could see only the dark waters of the basin far below the dim glow of a lamp a fast route to hell lancy said a good seventy feet so behave yourself or ill shove you over now put your hands on your head hasim did as he was told there was a stairhead with a door lancy got out his mobile and punched the right button and it was answered at once preacher is there a problem you could say that ive got billy salter and one of his goons trying to invade the flat at tangier wharf im hoping to ambush them but you never can tell how much does salter know that al qaeda is a problem for them and how could they know that i was trying to do you a favour and it backfired i havent got time to explain now but promise me one thing preacher if things go sour see to my mother for me all right i hear sounds now ive got to go he put a finger to his lips nodded to hasim and gently eased the door open a short flight of stairs dropped to the top landing and he could see the front door of the apartment a dim light above it there was the slightest of movements the old stairs creaking and he took aim and waited hasim pushed him with all his force screaming salter hes got a gun lancy cursed fired blindly three times down into the stairhead then turned to fire at hasim as he ran head down for the edge of the roof a bullet plucked at his sleeve and he leapt out into space and fell to the basin arms whirling lancy kicked the door shut as bullets ploughed through it then turned and ran to the lift jumped in and pressed the button it descended more rapidly than it had gone up a couple of bullets chased him ripping through the roof but he made it to the ground floor crossed the courtyard and ran up the steep slope towards wapping high street billy and baxter were right behind him ill get after him you see whats happened to the boy billy started to run as neither cigarettes nor alcohol featured in his life he was very fit and in spite of the steep slope and cobbled street was gaining on the other man fast lancy glanced back and realized he was being overtaken those afghanistan wounds not helping he put everything into that final spurt and ran straight out in front of a bus in wapping high street a woman screamed people cried out horns sounded as traffic was halted lancy lay on his back blood on his face and the driver got out of the bus distraught other people approached as a lone policeman whod been on foot patrol appealed for order and dropped down on his knees and went through the motions he shook his head and stood up spreading his arms to herd people back somebody said my god hes dead the bus driver wailed he ran straight in front of me turning in appeal to people around him and then there were the sounds of sirens approaching police and ambulance and billy turned away and went back down tangier street as he reached the wharf baxter came round the side of the building and started across the courtyard did he get away he asked ran headlong into traffic and got mown down by a bus billy said what about hasim ive been all over the roof baxter shook his head not a sign he was a brave young bastard warning us like he did but lancy did a lot of shooting up there must have knocked hasim over ive been looking round the side but he isnt there damn it to hell billy said im going to take a look waste of time billy there are seven floors on that building billy ignored him and walked along the wharf there were lights here and there but the basin was a dark pool and when he looked up at the height of the rookery it said it all in spite of that he called out at the top of his voice hasim where the bloody hell are you his voice echoed between the old buildings and he turned to walk away over here mr salter im trying to get up this ladder billy ran along the wharf baxter following him and they found hasim in the light of a single lamp halfway up an iron ladder baxter reached down managed to grasp his right wrist and heaved him up he was shaking with cold and billy took off his raincoat hasim tried to wave it away i think im bleeding id ruin it he tried to shoot me so i had to jump off the roof i cant believe it billy said its a miracle youre in one piece get this bloody coat on and well get out of it hes got away has he he was knocked down by a bus and killed up on the high street billy said as they walked to the car how the hell did you come to be up there with him hasim explained teeth chattering as he finished he said he was going to kill all of us no question but something else happened on the roof he called someone on his mobile he said he had you two trying to invade the flat he mentioned you by name he said that al qaeda was a problem for them which i figured meant you he called the guy he was talking to preacher and asked him to look after his mother if things went sour they were at the mercedes now and billy felt for the wound got out his handkerchief and bound it tightly he pushed hasim into the back of the car and sat beside baxter st lukes accident and emergency joe ill take over the car when we get there and you stay with hasim the story is that he fell in the river and hurt himself on the ladder when everythings okay well come up from the dark man and fetch you you mean me as well mr salter hasim said who else do i mean youre a bleeding hero sunshine after what you did tonight youre a made man harry salter will see to that harry was over the moon as billy sat in the corner booth and told him exactly what had happened sam hall and dora hanging on his every word they were still discussing it when joe baxter appeared having come down in a taxi with the news that hasim was being kept in the hospital for a day or two hypothermia he said and he needed a few stitches in his arm he was more worried about that than anything else said it would give him a problem boxing harry shook his head hes got guts that kid to do what he did have a word with chuck green billy hes opened another health club in wandsworth that makes seven weve got money in that get him to take hasim on keep an eye on him ill do that billy said but im going to take a run up to holland park and report in to roper ill see you later in west hampstead professor hassan shah sat at the desk in his ornate edwardian villa thinking about everything as calmly as he could lancys telephone call had set every alarm bell going lancy didnt do panic it wasnt in his nature he was a hardknocks paratrooper whod done his time in afghanistan and paid the price with his wounds more than that hed killed on shahs behalf without the slightest compunction he was a man who could handle anything and yet he hadnt been in touch since his call from tangier wharf so shah did the obvious and called him on his mobile after all he couldnt be traced if someone else answered it rang for a long time and he simply sat there listening he was about to give up when a woman answered grange street morgue hassan shah said calmly im so sorry i must have called the wrong number probably not sir this is the personal effects room where we store the belongings of those brought in dead to be claimed later of course could you give me the name of the individual you were trying to call shah took a huge breath to steady himself selim lancy she answered at once oh yes he was brought in quite recently knocked down by a bus in wapping high street and killed shah said it was a stupid remark but involuntary of course sir hes here waiting for a post mortem youre a relative she asked no i employed him on occasion could i have your name it may be of use if there are identification problems im so sorry but i suddenly feel very upset ill have to call you back he switched off and sat there the consequence of the business he was in was death sometimes of a few sometimes of many you had to harden your heart he had learned that a long time ago strange then that he felt genuine sadness in lancys case considering what had gone before it was obviously not an accident the salters had to be behind it them and ferguson ferguson had been a problem for too long but he seemed to live a charmed life it was rumoured he had even walked away from a car bomb perhaps after all the best solution was the oldfashioned way as used by the ira for years a silenced pistol loaded with hollow point cartridges the bullet in the back of the head one lonely night in the rain and dark or in the back in a crowd the target falling to the ground the assassin calmly walking away all it required was a man with nerves of steel and probably one who liked his work a man like lancy justin talbot certainly liked his work and was mad enough to take any chance in fact he was beginning to worry shah who for some time now had decided it was a good thing that talbot did not know his identity perhaps the temptation of putting a bullet in the back of shahs own head on a dark rainy night might have proved too great but all this would have to wait for suddenly the most important thing in his life was an old muslim woman in the cancer ward at st lukes hospital who did not know that her best beloved son had gone to paradise leaving her alone professor hassan shah had no idea how to break the news to her but it had to be done it was a matter of honour but at this time of night she would be asleep he would leave it till the morning there was another matter that needed taking care of also a matter of honour he made a call on his special mobile and spoke to the man who answered it hamid this is the preacher i have traffic for you starting now a photo and address will be in your laptop in five minutes deliver punishment at once with extreme prejudice osamas blessing on you there was a short pause and then the reply allah is great and osama is his prophet it was just past midnight billy salter had been with roper for the past hour getting filled in on the reason for dillons sudden trip to ulster and now he was driving down from wapping high street to the dark man there were lamps here and there three on the jetty that had the linda jones tied up to it a few scattered around the car park not that there were many vehicles around at that time of night with the pub closed since eleven doras implacable house rules there were lights on at the back of the building in the private quarters but otherwise it was quiet and remote with only the river noises to be heard he parked the red alfa romeo spider got out and stretched for he was exhausted hardly surprising after the events of the evening he stood by one of the lamps at the beginning of the jetty and inhaled that wonderful river smell that was the thames it was where hed grown up and it always made him feel better when he turned a man was standing there medium height with longish hair wearing a leather bomber jacket mr salter the voice was very soft who the hell are you billy demanded the wrath of osama his hand swung up there was the dull thud of a silenced weapon and two rounds hit billy around the heart the force of the blow was enormous sending him staggering on to his back he breathed deeply as he had been trained to do trying to stay conscious the man came forward to finish him and billys right hand found the silenced colt with hollow point cartridges in his ankle holster as the man leaned over billy shot him between the eyes billy sat up coughing and feeling sick then unbuttoned his coat ripped open his shirt and felt for the two rounds sticking in the nylonandtitanium vest he was wearing finally he got up and went to the body and examined it the face was covered in blood and the back of the skull was fragmented he got down on his knees and searched it but all he found were empty pockets there wasnt even a mobile he went and sat on a bench by the pub entrance and called roper who answered at once did you forget something ive got a disposal make it fast im outside the entrance to the dark man the geezer was waiting for me said he was the wrath of osama then shot me twice in the heart or thought he did he said my name i think it was a revenge thing i bet the bloody preacher sent him im calling it in now you go inside god damn it no billy said im sick of it he switched off his mobile went down to the jetty to the linda jones and sat on the stern seat waiting after a while a dark van appeared pulled in front of the pub and two men in black overalls got out produced a body bag eased the corpse into it and closed the door they would see to it that the inconvenient corpse turned to six pounds of grey ash within two hours billy walked down towards them and the door of the pub opened billy said to one of the men many thanks mr teague are you all right teague asked well the bastard did shoot me twice but thanks to the wilkinson sword company im still here thank god for that teague said well be on our way billy turned and found harry looking grim and dora in a dressing gown behind him harry salter said well at least we know where we are with this preacher fellow he means business and weve got to be ready for him harry i couldnt bloody care less billy said just lock all the doors so nobody can break in and let me go to bed ive had it the following morning harry miller appeared in the computer room hair wet from the shower and wearing a track suit it was just before noon and he was yawning i thought youd have slept longer roper said you dont exactly look your best ill pull round any word from ferguson not yet but when he does surface wait for the fireworks and why is that let me begin at the beginning night before last sean and daniel took themselves off to belfast miller was astonished but what the hell for so roper told him everything miller sat there mesmerized and when the story was finished said so mickeen oge has just been delivered to rosedene and dillon and holley are on their way back to belfast after creating mayhem at collyban which even managed to involve jean talbot exactly i talked to sean just this morning what will the brandnew chairman of talbot international have to say about his beloved mother and our gallant friends getting involved in a brawl in the worst kind of republican pub roper smiled its quite bizarre isnt it miller was grinning just couldnt help it i dont think thats the way ferguson will describe it thats quite a bit of event while we were gone and thats not all roper said and told him what had happened to billy miller listened intently so there it is roper said as he finished the existence of the preacher is confirmed and we now know with absolute certainty that al qaeda is out to get the lot of us the hit man no further news of him miller asked not a thing it was a totally clean job no identification no mobile phone the silenced walther he was using was treated with some resin so there are no fingerprints the kind of man willing to sacrifice himself like a suicide bomber miller said yes when billy asked him who he was he said he was the wrath of osama and then shot him roper grunted i feel so damn passive we have these two mystery figures the preacher and shamrock and were no closer to finding out who they are we can only respond when they make a move against us i want to make a move against them and we will miller said and stood up meanwhile i know one thing were all going to have to be bloody careful from now on and he went out a few minutes later ropers phone sounded and fergusons voice boomed out from cavendish place ah there you are roper im just enjoying my first decent cup of tea in two days why dont you bring me up to speed on whats happening everything general roper asked of course everything man get on with it so roper did ferguson was amazingly calm when roper finished he said anything to do with dillon these days is usually so beyond belief that it can only be true its the only bloody explanation i shall call in at rosedene on my way in and ill discuss mickeen oges situation with professor bellamy naturally well do everything we can and the air ambulance i must be practical there budgets are tight these days for all of us if daniel holley feels like taking care of it thats fine god knows he can afford it as for that other adventure in collyban it was damn reckless of dillon he knows perfectly well there are plenty of people there whod be delighted to put a bullet in his back ill speak to him of course but i dont think it will do much good is that it general no well have a council of war later on today when everyone is available this attempt on billys life worries me greatly its very difficult to deal with brutal simple attacks like that particularly when the assassin doesnt care whether he lives or dies from now on everyone wears his vest everyone goes armed and everyone must assume he could be drawn upon at any moment ferguson managed a laugh its not really very funny this war on terrorism is it over the years the preacher had evolved certain rules concerning assassination his asset as he called him had to be clean no mobile phone nothing that could identify him or the weapon he used nevertheless after the death sentence had been carried out the asset was supposed to phone in within three hours to tell him it was done the man he had given the salter job to had been successful on six previous occasions the fact that he had not been in touch now could only mean one thing shah had a faculty meeting later in the afternoon but with two hours to kill he felt for the first time that things were going wrong he was used to being in charge to everything running like clockwork and now something was out of joint and he didnt know what to do about it on impulse he called justin talbot shah knew nothing about the mickeen oge flynn affair or any of the subsequent events because talbot had chosen to leave him in ignorance of it all the way justin looked at it the comatose mickeen oge at rosedene had nothing to do with the preacher it was raining and talbot had been for a gallop in the downpour he was in the stable giving the stallion a rubdown when the preacher called justin stopped working and said how are things in her studio upstairs his mother had kept the door permanently ajar since she had first started eavesdropping and now stopped working to listen not too good shah said you remember billy salter of course justin lit a cigarette and sat on a bench hes become what the mafia would call a stone in my shoe hes been responsible for causing the death of a young man i valued highly what a shame perhaps its time to make an example of him i tried to do exactly that i gave the job to one of my best assets last night you mean you gave a hired killer instructions to shoot billy salter exactly a good man a true follower of osama justin had an insane desire to laugh dont tell me let me guess he didnt shoot billy salter billy salter shot him so it would appear have you any idea what youre dealing with with these two billy and his father in spite of his millions from legitimate developments harry salter is still a gangster and so is billy sean dillon and daniel holley both provos for christs sake harry miller a living legend of army intelligence ferguson well his record speaks for itself so whats your point read the art of war by sun tzu its two thousand years old but still true today make your enemy come looking for you choose your own field of battle and make it unfamiliar and difficult terrain take vietnam soldiers from the most sophisticated army in the world found themselves up to their bellies in jungle swamps chasing scrawny little peasants called viet cong remember who won point taken shah said but what are you suggesting get ferguson and his people into the jungle so to speak give them something to hunt for something they want badly and theyll come to you something like what shah asked id think that would be obvious shamrock is the man they want to get their hands on more than anyone else give them me shah was shocked what i understand daniel holley was put through an irasponsored training camp deep in the algerian desert at a place called shabwa his chief instructor was a man named omar hamza once a sergeant in the french foreign legion ive checked him out using contacts from my sas days the camp closed down for lack of business years ago and hamza moved on to run a trading post in the khufra marshes where is that on the algerian coast near cap djinet what you might call badlands marsh arabs in villages on small islands fishermen berber tribesmen its a haven for smugglers of every description and a home to thieves and cutthroats of every kind justin said quite cheerfully and where is this leading shah asked its very simple your colonel ali hakim has a friendly word with his friend malik and tells him hes heard rumours which he thinks might interest holley his mentor from shabwa omar hamza is up to his old tricks this time in the marshes and his informants speak of a mystery man hamza calls shamrock like certain other arab states the algerian government is not al qaedas best friend hakim could say he has been given secret instructions to take a police unit into the marshes to hunt omar down in a covert operation malik is certain to report this to daniel holley and i can almost guarantee you that the idea of a hunting party will appeal to ferguson very much whats the betting that hell offer holley expert assistance from dillon and some of the others on this venture into the marsh from which theyll never emerge shah said i thought the general idea was to kill the bastards right talbot said okay weve no idea how many people ferguson would send but id think three or four at least its essential not to delay on this you must speak to hakim as soon as possible so that he can get the ball rolling and you think this could work shah said i dont see why not especially since i intend to go and supervise the job myself shah was shocked but thats crazy how could you disguise yourself to marsh arabs and berbers id be just another white face i was in the algerian desert four years ago with a talbot international oil exploration team i was very impressed with the tuaregs noble and aristocratic bastards who wear dark blue robes and turbans and veils ordinary arabs shy away from them i took some of the robes home as a souvenir i knew id find a use for them one day so how would you get there theres an old world war two airforce base called fasa on the eastern end of the marshes its in ruins but the runway is still viable talbot international has a citation x at frensham with full tanks which can manage the flight to algiers and the return to england i might fly it myself but ill take another pilot along too to stand guard while im in the marshes with luck it wont take more than thirtysix hours and you insist on doing this im bored out of my skull and i want to see some action so i suggest you get things moving with ali hakim like yesterday unless you think hell say no impossible shah said he has taken the oath ill call him at once but ill give you his mobile number too just in case you need to get in touch at some stage justin returned to rubbing down the stallion whistling to himself softly above in the studio his mother still sat on a stool by the halfopen door trying to take it all in it had been only half of a conversation so it was difficult to make sense of but thered been enough to tell her that her son was getting into something very heavy indeed and yet she felt as she had before a strange kind of paralysis that prevented her from broaching the matter with him once again she backed off and went down the stairs into the stable he turned to her and smiled havent you finished that damn portrait yet soon she said i promise you im going to the kitchen to make some sandwiches come when youre ready she went out and he eased the stallion into its stall closed the gate and went after her dillon was having coffee with holley when got a call from roper so youve got out of dear old ulster in one piece why roper you sound unhappy about that is the general functioning and miller oh yes fergusons been very understanding about the whole mickeen oge business though he says hell be happy to have you pay for the air ambulance daniel thats very gracious of him dillon said just shut up and listen sean he knows about the trip to collyban and what happened to you and considers your behaviour illadvised and reckless thats nice of him yes but while you guys were busy last night in belfast things were happening here as well like what dillon was frowning now like an al qaeda hit man shooting billy outside the dark man if you can keep quiet for five minutes ill give you the details when he was finished holley said so we now know for certain that osama bin ladens man in london is called the preacher shamrock is one of his assets and al qaeda is hoping to shoot the lot of us at the first opportunity yes isnt life grand roper said ferguson is having a council of war this afternoon i think its time to start going after these guys hard at the same time colonel ali hakim was also on the phone to the preacher who explained exactly what he wanted hakim to do when he was finished hassan shah said are we clear of course actually it shouldnt be that difficult that old ruined air base at fasa is on the edge of the desert and about ten miles from the west side of the khufra marshes we keep two police launches there and there is a coastal village called dafur which also has an old runway from the days of the afrika korps its still used in emergencies do the police go into the marshes frequently not really its a place for bad people to hide in omar hamza is an old friend of mine he acts as a government supply agent to be frank i have a financial arrangement with him he will do as i say i assure you and that will include welcoming this shamrock it is essential that you do ferguson wants him badly and shamrock is the bait in the trap to make them come what about the ministry in algiers you can leave that to me and the police to crew the launches blackguards to a man the men ill use are thoroughly corrupt and they dont take prisoners excellent the preacher said speak to malik now time is of the essence he switched off hakim sat there for a moment then called malik at his villa when malik answered hakim said my dear friend how are you i was wondering if i could call round for a coffee of course you know im always glad to see you i have something i think you might be interested to hear they sat on the terrace drinking yemeni mocha coffee and hakim told him everything he thought malik needed to know things have got out of hand in the khufra this hamza used to be a good man but now hes a bad man who this individual is he calls shamrock i have no idea it was always a haven for scoundrels malik said yes well the days of the honest thief are over especially the way the drug traffic has increased our friend hamza has operated under several false names over the years and made a living running a trading post on diva island right in the centre of things we knew it was him and decided to let it go as long as he behaved himself but the cocaine and heroin smuggling cant be overlooked theres a fortune in that white powder disgraceful malik said it must be stopped oh i intend to do that ill go in with two launches and elite police and lay hands on hamza if its the last thing i do mind you it wont be easy but im oldfashioned my friend he stood up and put on his cap duty and honour if you are talking to daniel give him my best and if he needs assistance from me in any way you can give him my number daniel holley and dillon were deep in conversation when holleys mobile sounded malik said where are you can you talk ive something interesting to tell you what is it you were asking where omar hamza had got to ive discovered where those damn khufra marshes whats he doing there holley asked well ive just been talking to ali hakim and it goes like this when malik finished holley said thats very interesting malik very interesting indeed im glad you called the good colonel said i could give you his personal number if it would be useful and you wanted a word it certainly would holley said and inserted it into his own mobile as malik gave it to him thanks youve done me a real service when he hung up dillon said what was that all about holley gave him the gist of it in a few terse sentences and dillon said do you know this place the khufra marshes no ive never been the occasion just didnt arise well i have billy and i had a hell of a time there about three years ago chasing a guy who was involved with the murder of hannah bernstein fergusons personal assistant holley said what did you make of the place well the town was pretty wide open but the back country is wild and treacherous with water reeds twenty feet high the villagers and fishermen live pretty much as they have done for centuries a good place if you want to drop out of sight do you think ferguson would be interested in what maliks told me id say you can count on it dillon said if its all true its the only really positive lead weve got it cant be ignored but what would shamrock be doing there i can remember when it would have been the most natural thing in the world to come to algeria in search of revolutionary training camps dillon told him both of us did it that was then this is now holley said dillon nodded but if he is there even just passing through there must be some purpose to his visit and i intend to find out what as he stood up he said before facing ferguson id like to call in at rosedene and check on mickeen oge is that okay with you be my guest holley said well go straight there the moment they walked in to the lounge at rosedene the matron maggie duncan appeared and greeted them warmly how is he dillon asked much as expected sean but professor bellamy just looked in to see a few patients im sure hell be with you soon there is one thing you cant go into mickeens room without supervision hes all wired up as it were a very delicate balance you can go and have a look at him through the viewing window room nine down the corridor they stood together peering in at the dimly lit room mickeen was festooned with cables leading to electronic equipment tubes into his body from several bottles of fluid his sleeping face was very pale no colour there at all hes just like a waxwork holley said more like a corpse poor devil dillon shook his head a living death is pretty terrible when you think of it but if he doesnt know whats happened to him holley shrugged they say that some people waking up from this state have no idea of all the time passed thats right professor bellamy came up behind them this condition is one of the strangest known to medical science he could wake up at any moment or he could languish in the comatose state for months occasionally even longer than that so were keeping him alive with the help of modern electronics and drugs dillon said and he sighed heavily god help me i dont know whats right and whats wrong any more bellamy patted his shoulder at least hes here sean getting the very best of attention it could have been much worse anyway i must finish my rounds ill see you again by the way are you aware of what happened to billy salter last night youve been away of course yes and thank god for the vest dillon said it certainly saved his life but two fortyfivecalibre rounds delivered to the heart area at a range of ten or twelve feet has not left him in the best of conditions ive released him but he needs to take it easy for a while hes not fit to play any of your usual games sean bellamy took off his spectacles and rubbed an eye youre his friend and im appealing to you you can rely on me i promise professor excellent bellamy walked away shall we holley asked yes lets go and see the old sod and get it over with he followed holley across the hall and out of the front door a lgeri a t he k hufra m arshes holley drove and dillon called in to roper who cut in on him instantly and said i thought youd be coming straight here the generals been asking for you do we get blasted out of the water for being naughty boys i dont think so hes dark and sombre i cant remember seeing him in such a blackdog mood theres a kind of despair there because we arent making progress and the attempt on billys life last night greatly worried him so it should dillon said weve just been talking to bellamy at rosedene he released billy but hes not happy about his health i gave him my word that we wouldnt get billy involved in anything active for a while and i mean to keep it bellamys put him together again more than once he cant keep doing it how was mickeen comatose is the word theyre using and that sums it up but listen roper something seriously importants just turned up from malik in algiers im handing you over to daniel wholl fill you in when holley was finished dillon cut in what do you think it could give ferguson a shot in the arm its an interesting prospect to put it mildly roper said but we shouldnt discuss it without the general present id get here as fast as possible if i were you i imagine hell bring that council of war forward ferguson catching up on paperwork at his desk in cavendish place was galvanized by ropers call what incredible news im just finishing the peshawar report for the prime minister then ill come straight round have everybody there this might be some sort of breakthrough for us harry miller was already on the premises enjoying a workout in the gym which left the salters roper hesitated then thought well there was no harm in having billy in on the discussion as long as they didnt send him out into harms way he contacted billy and found him at the dark man told him ferguson had called a meeting and wanted everyone there billy sounded subdued whats he up to now thats for him to say but its important are you okay of course i am billy was irritated why wouldnt i be only asking roper said well see you then and he got to work researching omar hamza and the khufra marshes it was an hour later when ferguson arrived at holland park to find everyone waiting for him in the computer room he was full of energy and it showed i dont know how much you all know about why were here so lets start from scratch daniel just go through the conversation malik had with you which daniel did ending with an observation about hakim ive known ali hakim for years hes probably maliks best friend a military police colonel highly regarded in government circles a specialist in antiterrorism i dont need to tell you that algeria has problems with fundamentalists just like other countries in the middle east and the government dont like al qaeda it was harry salter who made the obvious point but what would shamrock be doing there in the khufra we dont know hakims informant simply mentioned a mystery westerner staying with omar hamza who called him shamrock ive had a thought on that point roper said there has been more than one bombing in algeria during the last three months by a jihadist group thought to be linked to al qaeda theyve tended to go for police barracks the most recent one caused eighteen deaths and fortyseven wounded perhaps shamrock has a link with all that thats just supposition again and it doesnt help in the slightest ferguson said to roper lets go to the source you have hakims personal mobile number get him now and put him on speaker everybody else keep quiet colonel ali hakim roper said in arabic i have major general charles ferguson for you a great pleasure hakim said in english i wont beat about the bush colonel ferguson told him weve heard about the conversation you had with hamid malik regarding omar hamza and mentioning the name of shamrock ah yes but im afraid i cant help you there that name has only just come to my attention as someone hamza is involved with apparently he could be british he certainly isnt arab i dont even know how far his involvement with hamza goes he is an unknown entity to me well not to me ferguson said tell me how would you go about your expedition into the khufra there is a small fishing village on the coast called dafur with a population of only seventy or eighty it has two good jetties that rommels people constructed in the war theres even a crumbling landing strip for aircraft which the coastguard can use in emergencies i have two large police launches and fifteen thugs in uniform who just love those who say no to them so they can knock them down i should imagine thats what youd need in a place like that but let me be completely frank with you shamrock is a very bad man and i want to lay my hands on him more than anything else in the world youd be doing me a great favour if you allowed me and my people to join in hakim did shock very convincingly but general this would be completely out of order would it make a difference if daniel holley were involved hes an algerian citizen thats true hakim said daniel is highly regarded but my arrangements are firm you mention a landing strip we could fly direct from the uk and land there holley waved at ferguson and gave him a thumbsup and mouthed falcon hakim said it would be most irregular not in a falcon owned by malik shipping and piloted by daniel holley hakim now did a good performance of accepting defeat i suppose in such circumstances it would be all right excellent ferguson said ill call you back roper cut the call whos going then ferguson said to holley how many does the falcon take two pilots in the cockpit six passengers we could all go ferguson said no we couldnt dillon told him we can cut out billy for starters billy was indignant who says so charles bellamy dillon told him he made me promise to make sure you stay out of things for a while the vest saved your life billy but two fortyfivecalibre rounds at short range to the heart takes time to get over and he warned you harry salter turned to billy you didnt tell me so what its no big deal billy told him harry looked at ferguson thats it hes out of it yes i understand the situation ferguson began but dillon cut in on him and youre out of it too youve been a great soldier charles but to use military terminology peshawar was a bridge too far any idea of you penetrating a pesthole like the khufra marshes is ridiculous think vietnam the average age of those yanks in the mekong delta was nineteen fergusons face was pale god damn you dillon yes im an arrogant bastard but ill have you know im still as good a man on the ground and in the air as anyone else here he appeared to be trying to get a grip on his emotions but that said youre right my role is here and yours is in algeria roper call hakim back and finalize the arrangements hassan shah was in west hampstead working at his computer when hakim contacted him it worked dillon holley and miller are leaving in four hours time to fly here theyre as good as dead just those three shah frowned id hoped for ferguson what about young salter who knows the death of these three alone will be an enormous coup it will cripple ferguson when will shamrock leave ill call him now to tell him the whole thing is a go and get back to you his call found justin talbot in the study having a drink and reading the times its on shah said dillon holley and miller are leaving in four hours theyve arranged with hakim to land on the old german runway at dafur to join him for a dawn invasion of the marshes it seems ferguson is not going i didnt think he would justin said and what about omar hamza he expects you and hakim will inform him when he knows youre on your way when will that be sooner than you think i got moving on my preparations yesterday i arranged for one of my pilots chuck alan to fly the citation x over yesterday evening its owned by a swiss company and untraceable its at belfast city now and chuck is standing by waiting for my call im already packed too so ill get straight off ill be in belfast in an hour but what about your mother shes gone into newry to get her hair done ill leave her a note pleading urgent business shes used to it good now take this down hakim gave me hamzas mobile number justin did ill get moving then may the blessing of allah go with you nonsense talbot said he gave up on me long ago he switched off went to the writing desk jotted a note to jean and left it in a prominent place then he dashed upstairs found his flying jacket and the bag hed packed went down to the front door and was in the mercedes and driving away just ten minutes before the maroon shogun turned into the drive he got his mobile out onehanded and called chuck alan hi old buddy he said im on my way so get moving alan said will do boss a little while later justins mother called she didnt argue simply said couldnt you have said goodbye sorry about that something urgent came up a company matter its a lastminute thing no it wasnt i took a call from frensham when you were out yesterday afternoon they were checking to see if everything had gone well with the citation at belfast you knew in advance you were going to make this trip come on love its no big deal secrets and lies justin so many of them i dont know where i am any more youre as careless as a young boy your conversations on that wretched mobile echo round the house or half of them do and thats enough to frighten me because so much of it seems to concern itself with death i even know where youre going now algeria i hear the name al qaeda mentioned many times as well as sean dillon and daniel holley the men i met in collyban i know what they are and im so so frightened maybe youve been listening when you shouldnt justin told her thats always very unwise because when you only get part of a story you dont get the truth oh go to hell justin she shouted at him and threw her mobile across the room hassan shah called hakim ive spoken to shamrock hell be airborne before they are hakim said you gave him hamzas number of course good ill have them alert me as soon as he lands hamza will be on a small island called diva in the centre of the marshes thats where the trading post is its about ten miles from fasa people use small boats to get around in there mostly with outboard motors im sure hamza will pick shamrock up himself amazing hassan shah said you and your men have no intention of invading the khufra to flush out the thieves and vagabond the only purpose of the entire operation is to kill dillon holley and miller but of course thats what you wanted wasnt it my units on patrol in the khufra learned a long time ago that it was better to leave well enough alone up here its like keeping animals in a zoo the people who are penned up in the marshes are the scum of the earth so we leave them to get on with it as long as they dont venture outside omar hamza rules with a rod of iron on my behalf i assume you take your share of the drug trade and so on a man must live preacher take care you never reveal such matters to osama he would not approve its a hard and disgusting world from a policemans point of view i do my best to protect good people and the weak but i am past apologies hakim sounded weary we will talk again when i confirm the arrivals at holland park dillon holley and miller went through the wardrobe room and settled on green fatigues with no camouflage markings and crumpled green jungle hats one outfit to wear another as a spare in the bottom of a dark green holdall with tshirts a toilet bag and military items their usual weapons the walther and the colt in the ankle holster were backed up by an ak each and some fragmentation grenades dillon went out carrying his holdall he put it down while he spoke to roper who said very dashing im not used to seeing you in uniform miller joined them and said thats because the provos never wore one now that wasnt fair roper mocked remember what president kennedy once said dillon shrugged anyone who expects fairness in this life is seriously misinformed i love that holley said as he joined them seriously misinformed it has a ring to it rolls off the tongue sergeant doyle came in im ready gentlemen no fond farewells from the boss dillon said ah well we who are about to die salute you oh get out dillon roper said ill start to cry thatll be the day dillon said and led the way out they reached farley field in forty minutes and discovered ferguson and the salters standing beside the daimler talking there you are ferguson said we thought youd got lost no thats what happens when we try to find algeria general dillon shook hands all round keep the faith well see you soon it would seriously inconvenience me if you didnt ferguson told him holley and miller got in and dillon paused keep an eye on mickeen oge for me billy you can count on it billy called as the door closed and dillon moved up to take his seat beside holley ferguson and the salters moved back to the daimler and stood watching as the engines fired and it started to move away what do you think harry salter asked i dont know a funny one this ferguson looked up as the falcon lifted all up to dillon i suppose well theres nothing new in that harry said the citation had taken off two hours before the falcon chuck alan a former us navy pilot with a dfc who had served in iraq and afghanistan was familiar with justin talbots vagaries but with the fabulous salary he was paid never complained cruising at thirtyfive thousand feet he put the citation on automatic pilot and went over their route should be easy he said well pass over the irish republic bay of biscay spanish mainland and across the sea to algeria and this khufra place presumably theres a decent landing facility you said wed speak about that justin produced a photo text hed obtained from the computer just there on the edge of the khufra marshes is a desolate old airfield the germans built in the second world war the buildings are ruins but the runway can still take traffic you didnt mention that chuck said is this an illegal drop no its part of a covert operation run by algerian military police which im assisting in i should return in twentyfour hours youll be safe by the plane im carrying a spare ak in my bag just for you thats a bit outdated alan said not at all its the perfect weapon for swamp country vietnam proved that you can bury one for years dig it up load it and it will fire instantly i dont know about this alan said maybe i wont be able to land if you cant i will but after iraq and afghanistan im willing to bet you a bonus of fifty thousand dollars that you can put this baby down at fasa chuck alan brightened considerably youre on good talbot told him just turn off the automatic pilot and lets see some real flying ill go and get some coffee which he did and also called the preacher thirtyfive thousand feet up cloudless blue sky and were on our way you should be a couple of hours ahead of our friends when you land not that it will make any difference to the final outcome justin said and switched off he had his coffee and a whiskey in it thinking of what lay ahead but his thoughts also turned to his mother he brooded for a while considering whether to call her but decided on jack kelly instead he found him in the estate office ive gone away in rather a hurry for a few days he said id like you to keep an eye on my mother ive seen her already and shes distraught hannah found her weeping in her bedroom we didnt exactly part on the best of terms what on earth are you up to the problem is it appears that shes taken to listening in to my phone conversations and since she can only hear half of them she seems to have come to the wrong conclusions about whats going on from what shes said to me id say shes got an excellent idea and its scaring her to death this algerian trip what the hell is it all about al qaeda business a way of sorting out the ferguson problem i came up with a good idea and the preacher approved what is it justin told him and when he was finished said quite clever though i say it myself what do you think that youre a raving bloody lunatic justin talbot youre colonel henrys grandson all right dont you dare say that to me justin flared up at once you do realize that the men you are going up against are extraordinary by any standards dillon and holley two of the most feared enforcers the provisional ira ever produced and major harry miller who did our movement more harm during the troubles than any other individual frankly its hakim and his fifteen crooked coppers id be worried about in that swamp the difference is ill be there waiting for them well id take care justin great care thats all i can say watch your back youll need to after he had gone justin opened the holdall which contained his tuareg clothing it would work the whole thing he told himself had to he checked and loaded the weapons putting an ak to one side for chuck and the other in a military rucksack together with a few assorted grenades and extra ammunition three fieldservice wound packs and some penicillin he returned to the cockpit and eased into the second seat everything okay chuck asked go have a coffee or whatever ill take over he sat there flying the plane normally he enjoyed it but not this time and he knew why it was what kelly had said a raving bloody lunatic youre colonel henrys grandson all right it was what hed been afraid of for most of his life it would take more than consigning his grandfathers portrait to the bonfire to make it go away the call came in while miller and dillon were in the cabin eating sandwiches miller took it and switched it on to speaker roper said check your laptop harry ive just sent yu a couple of better photos i managed to run down of ali hakim and hamza i know daniels familiar with them but they should be of use to you too thanks for that miller told him how is everybody billys gone to rosedene to see bellamy and harry insisted on going with him hes taken the situation very seriously i believe he thinks billy might die on him and ferguson dillon asked just after seeing you off he got a call from your pal good old henry frankel the cabinet secretary the pm wants one of those onepage reports that he can use during question time the worst problems facing the secret intelligence services at the moment blah blah blah naturally ferguson asked me to come up with a quick answer but i doubt its the kind of thing the pm wants to raise in the house of commons let me guess dillon said number one muslim fundamentalism two the rise of the russian federation and three the fact that since the peace process in ulster what was the pira has become a criminal organization thats bigger than the italian mafia got it all dillon hardly worth my writing it down the russians have sixtytwo thousand in the gru compared to that british military intelligence is a joke with the muslims al qaeda is only one of an exponentially growing number of extreme jihadist organizations and the provos miller said they blew up the centre of manchester and made a fortune out of rebuilding it at least thats what many people think its a funny old life well i dont think youll find it funny when you plunge into that wilderness at dawn tomorrow roper said take care he switched off and dillon said ill go and spell holley he went into the cockpit and holley came out got coffee from the kitchenette and joined miller theres something i meant to mention to you and sean whats that miller asked i learned arabic when i was in that training camp became pretty fluent hamza told me it was a good idea to keep quiet about it why did he say that because people give themselves away when they think you dont understand once i was given a job to handle a consignment of guns to county down and deliver fifty thousand pounds in a suitcase the fools in the boats crew discussed which way they would murder me in arabic of course what happened i shot a couple of them dead to encourage the others you might say it did the trick you speak a little arabic i understand military short course very basic and i know dillon speaks it very well ali hakim knows about my ability but he doesnt know about you two youd rather dillon and i keep quiet i think it would be a good idea so that we can hear them discussing how to murder us absolutely holley said one thing i learned during my five years in the lubyanka was how frequent it was that totally absurd and impossible things turned out to be true i take your point dillon and i dont speak arabic exactly holley said in perfect arabic so if you would pass me the sandwiches i would be very grateful sorry old man miller replied in english i dont understand a word youre saying in the heart of the marshes was the small island of diva hamzas house and trading post were substantial and built on firm land but with extensions all around wooden shacks supported by pilings driven into ground below the water there were seven or eight of those with boats ranging from canoes to inflatables with outboard motors tied up to them one old sport fisherman was painted dark green and hamza who wore a sailors peaked cap jeans and a reefer coat was sitting in the stern having a beer when his mobile buzzed omar hamza this is shamrock half an hour to go talbot spoke in english and hamza replied in the same youve come a long way lets hope you find its worth it hamza climbed a short ladder to the jetty above and ducked into a large dark room with rough tables chairs and a long wooden bar bottles of every description were crammed on the shelves and an open archway revealed a shop crammed with goods a drunk was sleeping in the corner mouth open while three arabs in soiled white smocks and battered straw hats played cards at one of the tables a young woman in black her head covered but her handsome olive face revealed came in from the store and spoke to him in excellent english was that him this shamrock you are expecting father so it would appear fatima ill go get him he sounded grim and shook his head youre not happy ive involved myself in this matter because of my position here and also because of you this is a favour for colonel hakim so i cant say no i want things to remain as they are nice and stable if the police ever decided to come down heavy on us and we were forced to move on it would be a tragedy at my age your mother may she rest in peace would have understood this and you think i dont hakim is all right and he likes me ever since his wife died i have known this you are too young for him one is never too young for an older man with money and social standing but we are wasting time i will go with you and take the wheel of stingray while you handle the pole the salt marshes were like a green miracle sprouting out of the desert saltwater channels flushing through great pale reeds up to fifteen feet high chuck alan had taxied the citation right up to the edge and stood there looking at it he picked up a stone and hurled it into the marsh and immediately birds of every description flew up creating pandemonium with their noise as they called to each other behind him justin talbot emerged from the cabin he wore the dark blue turban and face veil of a tuareg and a threequarterlength dark blue robe open to reveal a khaki shirt and trousers he had a belt round his waist carrying a holstered browning an ak slung over his left shoulder and held the military rucksack in his right hand he made a hugely dramatic figure chuck alan said jesus boss are you going to war or something it was extraordinary how justin seemed to fit into that landscape everything shimmering in the intense heat i think i hear an engine he said and was right there was a movement in the reeds and the boat emerged hamza in the prow clutching a long pole stingray came to a halt the front easing up on the sand justin looked up at the woman at the wheel high above she said something in arabic sorry no can do justin said english only im afraid comes with all those years of empire you see he was the english public school man to the life and hamza roared with laughter you sound just like a man i met in the french foreign legion many years ago hed been cashiered from an english guards regiment what rotten luck justin turned to chuck off you go old son ill be waiting boss alan went back to the plane and climbed into the cabin pulling the airstair door up behind him justin turned and said omar hamza thats me and this is my daughter fatima charming justin said nice to meet you she looked uncertain as if not knowing what to make of him and he climbed on board and moved to the stern where he put down his rucksack and the rifle he looked up at her at the top of the short ladder as she switched on the engine can i join you if you want as the engine started into life hamza climbed over the prow rail and shoved off they reversed pushing into the curtain of reeds and then turned and ploughed forward emerging into a waterway which was only as broad as the boat itself an amazing place how long have you lived here justin asked i was a child when we came twenty years ago my father had problems in the desert so we moved here he has the trading post so we have a good living but its hard my mother died last year there are many people here for whom it is the final stopping place its certainly striking and some of the flowers are incredible he said it also has snakes of many types in the water and the bite of some bring instant death not to mention the malaria and other diseases but you still stay why she shrugged because there is nowhere else to go the boat emerged into the lagoon revealing diva island and the trading post and the shacks on pilings they coasted in and a small boy caught the rope hamza tossed and tied it up fatima said ill take you in and show you where you will sleep he followed her up the ladder and into the trading post and hamza still on the boat was speaking to hakim well ive got him he was waiting by the plane dressed as a tuareg turban face veil the lot took me back to my days in the legion in the deep sahara just looking at them frightened people to death what news of the others i had a call from holley saying they should be landing in an hour so theyll spend the night with you at dafur and the police incursion in the launches will start at dawn wouldnt it be simpler to cut their throats while theyre sleeping no in the worlds eyes they must have died at the hands of the bandits who infest the khufra especially holley who on paper at least is an algerian of some importance malik will be desolate to lose him i understand he looks on him as a son well hell have to get over it i liked daniel a born killer and one of my finest pupils everyones time comes sooner or later so stop moaning tell fatima not to get close to this shamrock they take liberties these westerners no morals as you say hamza went into the trading post there was no sign of his daughter or justin and then she emerged from the rear sitting room went behind the bar and found a bottle of whisky and two glasses so he wants a drink hamza said hell have to remove the veil tuaregs arent supposed to drink its an offence against allah then youve been offending him all your life hes unpinned his veil at one side he is quite handsome actually fatima told him and grinned as you can see ive got you a glass too come she led the way into a back room that was quite spacious and carpeted with large stuffed cushions scattered around and a low arabstyle dining table there was a bed in one corner and another archway showed a further bedroom justin sprawled on a huge cushion smoking a cigarette the veil hanging down one side he looked astonishingly dramatic and was excited beyond belief the brief trip through the marshes had seen to that omar hamza and the whole atmosphere of the place was everything he had hoped for fatima was just a bonus she half filled a glass for him and for her father and when justin smiled there was an edge of wickedness that excited her to your bright eyes my dear he toasted her then half turned and said in excellent french to hamza and to you mon brave and good hunting as the falcon descended on its approach holley at the controls said since the runway is parallel to the shore im going to go straight in and have a look at the place first he went down to four hundred feet and roared in at dafur the river emerged from the marsh there was a surprisingly large stone jetty another legacy of the afrika korps and rommel with two large launches alongside men in uniform gazed up shading their eyes but nobody waved a cheerful bunch arent they dillon said miller leaning over between dillon and holley said so it would appear did you notice the machine gun mounted on each launch i certainly did dillon said it was a typical arab fishing village boats pulled up on the beach nets a range of flatroofed houses painted a grimy white most of them in various stages of decay poverty was very definitely evident and from the look of the twenty or so villagers in shabby clothes who had turned out to watch the plane come in it looked as if it was a daily companion the falcon swept round and landed turned taxied back to the village and stopped holley turned off the engines and hakim came forward followed by half a dozen policemen in khaki uniforms thats our man holley said i know dillon said i saw his photo i dont think much of his friends an ugly bunch they look as if the only thing they have on their minds is rape and pillage miller dropped the airstair door and holley went out first hakim embraced him and his men came to a halt watching the greetings of allah daniel my friend he said in arabic it has been too long to see you again colonel is always a pleasure holley kissed him lightly on each cheek and how is malik missing you as always naturally ive not informed him how far this business has gone hes a worrier where you are concerned much better to achieve a successful conclusion and then tell him i agree completely hakims men seemed to be surprised at holleys fluent exchange with hakim and were muttering amongst themselves holley now said but my friends major miller and mr dillon dont speak arabic you must excuse them hakim moved into english gentlemen a sincere welcome to algeria if my men can help you with your equipment in any way you only have to ask actually i could do with something to eat and maybe a drink dillon said but i suppose alcohol would be a difficulty not at all hakim said we can handle that allow me to escort you to my boat thats fine dillon said you carry on daniel i need harry to help me with the controls well catch up he turned back to the falcon and went through the airstair door into the cabin where miller found him in the cockpit whats going on just killing a little time dillon watched hakim and holley go several of the policemen were still hanging around the falcon looking it over and talking amongst themselves i just wanted us to get away from hakim and holley i dont like the look of that bunch of gorillas they look all bad to me and i wonder why that should be i admit they dont seem very prepossessing miller said which is a posh way of saying they look bloody awful dillon told him and as theyve now been told we dont speak arabic i think it might be interesting to hear what they say about us okay lets test the water i suggest we each take an ak loaded for bear as they say now youre talking dillon said and went and unpacked the holdalls when they emerged from the falcon and went down the steps dillon closed and locked the airstair door turned and smiled at the policemen hanging around then said to miller shall we go old man he turned to the men where is colonel hakim he spoke rather slowly as if to fools that is the british for you one of the policemen said stupid and arrogant nadim as if we were idiots what you say is true but be patient every dog has its day and that day has come as far as these two are concerned nadim who was a sergeant pointed in a direction and said to dillon hakim thanks very much dillon told him as he and miller started to walk another of the men said the aks theyve got are the fully automatic version a very dangerous weapon do not be afraid nadim said a knife in the dark can be just as effective and the small man carrying it doesnt look like much another said cut it out nadim told him remember what colonel hakim said these are dangerous men you must be very careful remember the proverb it is the cat which bides its time that catches most mice they moved away and hakim appeared on the jetty and waved so what do you make of that miller asked well it could just have been some muslims shooting their mouths off they dont like us much these days dillon i only speak a certain amount of arabic but what i could understand i didnt like you speak the language fluently so for gods sake you little irish bogtrotter tell me what you think well to put it inelegantly id say were in deep shite dillon said you are carrying armed to the teeth which includes my underwear if you count the vest excellent lets go and enjoy hakims hospitality and see what unfolds it intrigues me the thought that the police could turn out to be our problem dillon shook his head now why would that be it would put hakim on the other side a man whom daniel has known for years and respects a government man yes well life does have its little surprises dillon waved to hakim who was standing in the stern of the launch with holley join us for champagne hakim called you see we have everything then well go to the village cafe where they are preparing a meal its better than you would imagine an orderly in a white jacket came forward and offered a tray and dillon and miller accepted a glass each to the friendship of our two great countries hakim said and especially to daniel who more than anyone has built the bridges that unite us isnt that nice dillon said you have a way with the words colonel sergeant nadim came along the jetty and stood waiting hakim said excuse me a moment he went down the short gangway to speak to him dillon took the last glass from the tray the orderly went below and miller said you were saying how sensible it would be to keep quiet about being able to speak arabic holleys face betrayed nothing tell me the worst which dillon hurriedly did it all sounded pretty menacing to me holley frowned its not that i disbelieve you but hes been a friend for years lets just stay alert and prepare to cope with whatever comes up miller said hakim returned excuse my bad manners but i was just discussing your quarters with sergeant nadim youll be staying on the second boat evening star hell command the boat with six men he is very experienced in the ways of the khufra so hell lead our little invasion and i will follow half an hour later in fortuna general ferguson expressed a wish for you to take part in the action so i thought my plan would please you it certainly does miller said so you will leave at dawn four in the morning gentlemen but for now the cafe bleu awaits as they went over the side to the jetty dillon murmured i thought the french left this country years ago holley said just shut up sean you never know maybe youll get a surprise which they all did it was a house slightly larger than the others a terrace open to the sky and looking out to sea sergeant nadim and four men armed with small uzi machine guns stood guard menacing and watchful there was french wine chablis cold from a deep well where it had been hanging suspended by string there was a roast lamb to be carved mounds of rice peppers of various kinds and onions that had been cooked with the lamb afterwards drinking more wine hakim said i am sorry if the presence of guards has spoiled the meal but there are those out there in the marshes possibly even watching us now who would kill me without compunction there is no need to apologize life is the most precious thing we have dillon said one must be willing to do anything to preserve it sometimes however even the guards are not enough then what is my friend if we were sitting here as we are now and brigands from the khufra rushed in to overwhelm us what would you do dillon took a pineapple fragmentation grenade from his pocket pulled the pin and held the release bar tight i would point out that if i released the bar i might kill myself but also every person within a fifteenmetre radius the four men with nadim cried out and backed away hurriedly nadim stood firm and dillon smiled a brave man your sergeant but wed have died together he replaced the pin and put the grenade back in his pocket my friend you must be insane hakim was horrified ah well im from county down and they say were all a bit crazy there dillon turned to his friends ill need to get a few things from the plane harry if youll help me we can leave daniel to chat on for a while of course hakim said but i insist sergeant nadim and his men accompany you dillon said a good man the sergeant im sure hell take care of us perfectly there was a halfmoon and a slight breeze as dillon and miller walked ahead nadim and his men behind there was a purpose to your utterly mad act and now this miller said im right arent i of course you are but let me listen harry they walked in silence the murmur of conversation behind them and reached the falcon dillon found the key opened the airstair door and led the way in he reached for the weapons bag and opened it ill get an ak for holley hes going to need it why miller demanded one of the cops asked nadim why they couldnt cut our throats in bed while we were asleep on the launch nadim said it was necessary for us to die in action in the khufra he said hakim had told him it would look better anything else oh yes one of the other guys tried to argue and nadim told him he had taken the oath from colonel hakim you know what the oath was harry to put his life on the line to serve al qaeda and osama bin laden what do you think of that i learned a long time ago not to be surprised at anything in our line of work sean itll be terrible for holley when we tell him the man whos been his partners best friend since youth is what he is do you think theres any chance malik has gone the same way no i honestly dont for all sorts of reasons dillon said the most important thing here is that weve been sold a pup clearly the purpose of our being here isnt to try to get our hands on shamrock miller nodded the whole thing has been a ruse to get us here so we could be executed they were probably hoping that ferguson and billy would come along for the ride too so theres no shamrock waiting with hamza on diva island thats the crazy thing dillon told him it seems shamrock actually did come in on a plane shortly before we did he landed at some place called fasa on the other side of the khufra hamza and his daughter picked him up and hes with them now at diva hamza has been in touch with hakim and everyone is very puzzled and why would that be miller asked it seems he talks like a brit but is disguised as a tuareg wearing dark blue robes face veil the lot dillon smiled wolfishly wouldnt you say thats a trifle bizarre i could say a lot more than that miller said whats our next move to get back to the evening star and check in with holley whos going to get a bit of a shock if hakim is with him have your ak handy just in case dillon picked up the weapons bag lets get moving they left the falcon he locked the airstair door again and walked along the beach to the jetty nadim and his four men following hakims boat fortuna had five policemen lounging around it smoking and passing a jug of wine from hand to hand the second launch evening star was tied up at a point where the river was swallowed up in a wall of fifteenfoot reeds there was a small hut to one side a large door open to reveal a range of army cots two policemen lounged there smoking in slung hammocks nadim and his men joined them and as dillon and miller went on board holley and hakim appeared together walking along the beach from the cafe bleu ah there you are hakim called we thought wed lost you no chance dillon replied come and have a nightcap ive brought a bottle of whisky from the plane unless it would give you a problem not at all a delightful idea and over a long life i have discovered that one thing is absolutely for certain allah is merciful and understanding of the frailties of men excellent dillon said so come on board lets go below the midges are beginning to bite but of course hakim said amiably they went down to the saloon sat on the benches on either side of the table and dillon put four glasses down and poured he picked one up and toasted them to friendship to friendship hakim answered good im glad weve got that over with dillon took out the walther and put it on the table what would you say that is hakim laughed a walther ppk the new silenced version exactly dillon told him and the automatic ak which major miller is holding across his knees is also silenced a rare model he could open a porthole stick the barrel out and have a very fair chance of knocking off sergeant nadim and those six men before they knew what hit them im sure he could but why would he do such a thing holley said come on sean the grenade was bad enough but this is going a bit too far really dillon carried on in excellent arabic as you can see we havent been honest with you even major miller speaks some arabic your men have been loosetongued discussing in our hearing how they would murder the stupid englishmen of course they got that wrong as im irish holley turned to the colonel and said in arabic tell me this is not true dillon poured himself another whisky hes our man in algiers as far as al qaeda and the preacher are concerned nadim and his boys have all taken the oath at his hands they were talking about it as we were walking to the falcon hakims face had turned ghostly pale he was consumed with uncertainty about what was going to happen next dillon added it would seem obvious to me daniel that hes been using his friendship with your partner hamid malik to no good purpose this whole thing was an al qaeda sting a ruse to draw us all in for summary execution so no shamrock holley said oh yes he landed in a plane on the far side of the khufra shortly before we got in at a place called fasa hes with hamza on diva now a puzzle to everyone he speaks like a brit and is disguised as a tuareg you bloody sod holley said to hakim i should kill you myself dont lets be hasty dillon said he still has his uses he picked up the walther and cocked it if i shot you now nadim wouldnt hear a thing so be sensible who is the preacher the most powerful man in europe if i did know his name which i dont and told you there would be no place to hide hes the preacher a voice on the phone its impossible to trace the source of his calls theres no such thing as impossible dillon told him i thought that too and had experts try hakim tried to make it sound convincing they all failed you bastard holley said bitterly all maliks years of friendship meant nothing to you osama bin laden meant more there were tears in hakims eyes you must see this daniel he is the greatest hope for the arab world since the prophet himself strange holley said all i see are the neverending bombs the bodies in the streets okay lets move on from that and discuss whats going to happen dillon was still holding the cocked walther and smiled amiably at hakim i am prepared to kill you at any given moment your friends outside wont hear a thing the only way you stay alive is by doing exactly as youre told so what do you want well go on deck and you tell nadim youve changed your plans youve decided to take command here on evening star and he can follow in fortuna tell him to leave his six men as arranged it might puzzle him if you didnt tell him you want to handle the situation yourself say that you might go in earlier but stress that he keep half an hour behind you and what do you intend to do why push our way through to diva and get our hands on shamrock hakim frowned slightly dillon put the muzzle of the walther between hakims eyes this is your moment of truth i could kill you now and ill certainly kill you on deck if you dont do as i say once we start on that major miller will start spraying your men and you know how destructive the automatic version of the ak is only too well hakim said bitterly so lets get it over with when you speak to him make it in arabic dillon said that way i can hear exactly what hes saying about me without him realizing another thing he held out his hand your mobile phone hakim took it from his breast pocket put it on the table turned and went up the companionway dillon and miller following there were strange birds calling cicadas the voices of the marsh and the croaking of bullfrogs the men were playing cards beside a coal brazier two armed guards by the prow of the launch a small fire glowing nadim was watching and smoking and turned as they appeared and hakim called him over he told him exactly what dillon had told him to say you think this wise colonel exposing yourself in such a way these people need handling with care especially dillon i wish you would allow me to dispose of them for you what is to be gained by this farce concerning the man shamrock what is he here for it was not necessary he wants to have a hand in the killing hakim said so obey me in this make the change now and have one of the men bring me my night robe and toilet bag from the fortuna nadim glanced at dillon his expression giving nothing away then turned moved to the fire he outlined the change of plan then went into the hut he came out five minutes later with his peaked cap on carrying a holdall and walked to the fortuna at the far end of the jetty well wait for someone to bring those things you wanted dillon said have a cigarette it will calm your nerves hakim did as he was told and offered one to daniel who said never again i dont trust myself not to kill you now the policemen playing cards retreated inside and made ready for bed leaving just the two on guard an orderly came running along the jetty saluted hakim handed over the robe and toilet bag and retreated time to go below dillon said you lead the way hakim did as he was told in the saloon dillon took the toilet bag from him and emptied it while miller checked the robe did you really think i might have a spare in there hakim asked plenty of people do dillon said now go and get your head down for a while and behave yourself hakim went and settled himself in a bunk in one of the stern cabins and dillon and his friends had a drink and discussed the plans id like to see us move out at a different time than hakim arranged he said that was four oclock in the morning miller pointed out any earlier it would be dark would you think there was any kind of chance of slipping away without those six policemen dillon asked holley said we could dispose of the sentries easily enough theres that long pole on deck for punting the boat when in difficulty in the reeds so you could float the boat some distance away before turning the engine and that would be enough to wake the dead holley shook his head thats no good at all when we did the low approach in the plane there were a few other boats further upstream from here i think id better go for a walk and take hakim with me you two stay and keep the sentries happy ali hakim instructed to come for a stroll and smoke a cigarette did as he was told and holley found what he was looking for a hundred and fifty yards along a path beside the river a shack with the door padlocked and a small jetty just above the water there were two plastic orange inflatables with both outboard motors and oars each inflatable was capable of carrying five or six people holley had brought a lantern from the launch and examined them closely who owns these the coastguard service but they hardly ever come local people frequently use them illegally thats why you can smell the petrol ive travelled in them myself holley gave him the lantern check them out hakim did as i thought somebodys been using them both tanks are quite full its a pushbutton engine shall i show you ill take your word for it lets go back they sat at the table in the saloon and discussed it holley said that would be the way to do it as far as i can see it would be suicide to keep to hakims time omar hamza would blow us out of the water with these boats you can cut the engine and approach with oars just the two sentries to dispose of miller said no problem in that holley said and ive been thinking about the earlier start the skys clear and theres a lot of light from that halfmoon i say we go thats it then dillon said back to your bunk hakim i suggest we all get some shuteye three oclock it is earlier on diva justin hamza and fatima had been drinking coffee when hamza received a call this is sergeant nadim how is everything we are ready and waiting but i havent heard from hakim and his phone isnt answering i suppose he could be sleeping its certainly an early start perhaps earlier than you think he changed plans a couple of hours ago told me he was going to take command of our lead boat evening star and relegated me to fortuna why did he do that hamza asked ive no idea hes acting it up with our friends i think hes enjoying himself but thats playing with fire he even said he might want to go in even earlier than four oclock he must be mad it will be dark for one thing yes but getting lighter i thought id better speak to you as i know your strange friend is anxious to deal with them to a certain extent thats true wouldnt it be ironic if he got knocked off himself this dillon man is a maniac well that should make it interesting hamza said if shamrock gets his way there wont be much left for you and me ill see you in the morning what was that all about fatima asked hamza told them and justin yawned and said i suppose id better get a couple of hours sleep what about you omar gave up sleeping years ago in the legion they taught you how to do that i only doze was the legion everything they say and more muslims jews and christians and every colour under the sun and every race everyone was equal nothing like it anywhere else in the world youd have to go back two thousand years to the roman legions to find anything similar i guess i missed out on that one what about you grenadiers and sas a formidable combination you should do well in the morning ill see you then he went in his room and closed the door there was a kind of silence except for the marsh sounds and it hung heavy between fatima and justin she said calmly would you like to make love to me he gave her one of his dazzling smiles im not really in the market for that are you of the other persuasion sexually good heavens no i see so i am not attractive to you you are immensely attractive fatima its just that i wouldnt be good enough for you do you mean in bed thats only about one per cent of any relationship im not good enough for you or any woman im a bad man i spoil things and that includes relationships i have a very very wonderful mother and i spoil it for her too i think thats the saddest thing i ever heard fatima told him im inclined to agree with you she walked out and he sat there for a while then pulled his rucksack over produced his ak took it apart then put it together again effortlessly dillon came out of a catnap and found holley standing by the other bunk his face beneath the crumpled jungle hat already darkened come on sean ready to go he moved out dillon pulled on his hat grabbed his weapons bag and ak and followed him into the saloon where he found miller already geared up hakim was sitting waiting and holley was slinging his weapons bag across his body to the left he picked up his ak in his right hand dillon took some camouflage cream from a tin on the table and rubbed it on his face what about the sentries ive taken care of that holley told him shot them both hakim looked sick as dillon said thats all right then lets get out of here they left the launch very quietly everything still in the darkened shack and moved along the path of the marsh in line dillon leading the way hakim next then miller with holley at the rear when they reached the boats they examined them quickly i think we should take both dillon said holley and hakim in one because of that special relationship and miller and me in the other it means weve got backup ill buy that holley said well row for a couple of hundred yards before starting the engines and with luck they can coast along on a very low rumble and remember the mobile phone miller said itll be useful in this kind of terrain if you stray he said to hakim get the oars out then you bastard and show us what you can do the colonel did as he was told they led the way and dillon and miller followed the irishman at the oars the reeds were alive with life in the pale moonlight as they floated past wings beating and muted cries as they disturbed the birds after a while dillon said ive had enough of this so im shipping my oars and starting up his thumb on the button produced a gratifying growl which he turned down until it balanced out to a pleasant throbbing hakim achieved the same results and they nosed into a sort of small lagoon the reeds towering above them the halfmoon still glowing in a dark sky that was already clearing they floated there together where are we holley asked hakim how far to diva perhaps a mile hakim told him and pointed from here think twelve oclock as you look ahead and diva is ten oclock way behind them in the distance there was the sound of an engine its one of the launches hakim said and stood up there was the crack of a rifle quite close by and he was struck in the left side of his chest spun round and went into the water holley reached over and got him by the collar and half turned the boat towing hakim behind get out of it for gods sake and into the reeds as quickly as you can he called he crashed the boat through came to a halt switched off the engine and realized he was alone except for hakim in the water so often in life the most careful plans are disrupted for the simplest of reasons in this case it was due to a police officer named abu one of those sleeping in the shack awakened by a bad stomachache he had taken a torch and visited the outside latrine he had noticed the absence of the two sentries and on investigation had found one of them in the water between evening star and the jetty the further discovery that there was no one on the launch had sent him on the run to alert nadim the sergeants more thorough check had discovered the second sentry also in the water it seemed absurd to deduce from what had happened that ali hakim had been party to the murder of two of his own men and the only plausible explanation was that the others had been responsible as a quick search failed to discover hakims body nadim could only conclude that dillon and his friends had taken him with them but what for he called omar hamza on his mobile hamza listened to him and fatima and talbot awakened by the disturbance awaited an explanation hamza said into his phone god knows whats happened but i suggest you come into the marsh heavily armed ill stay put in the trading post and greet them with a machine gun if they turn up here get moving whats going on talbot asked hamza told him it doesnt make a lot of sense to me well it certainly does to me justin was actually smiling what bastards they are dillon and holley they know what were up to dont you see theyve got hakim with them whos probably shot his mouth off and hes leading them to me he was full of energy went back in the other room hooked up his veil slung his weapons bag across his chest and picked up his ak so what are you going to do hamza asked go hunting give them a nice surprise what about you ive got an old browning machine gun ill set it up on the jetty and await events fort zinderneuf ah youve read beau geste hamza smiled an englishman named wren wrote that book he actually served in the legion very interesting but that was then this is now these men who are coming are killers of the first water i know this my friend if only because i trained daniel holley myself i can only wish you luck he turned to fatima what about you i think ill go with him you know what youre doing he doesnt he thinks he knows everything this one but he doesnt know the marsh and he could get lost well take stingray youre worse than your mother was hamza shrugged as allah wills talbot followed her outside and looked down at the stingray is the sport fisherman the sensible boat to use id have thought an inflatable with an outboard the reeds are fifteen and sometimes twenty feet high so theyll conceal the upper deck but at the same time standing at that wheel i can peer over occasionally and see where we are and whats going on that makes perfect sense he dropped down to the deck and she followed ill be guided by you so lets get moving she cast off and went up the ladder to the wheel and talbot followed and stood beside her the ak cradled in his arms it started to rain as they drifted out she switched on the engine and kept it down to a low rumble there was the grey light of dawn now and a curtain of mist floated in when we have the heat of high summer and unexpected heavy rain it produces the mist she told him at least it makes it easier to play hide and seek he said they nosed into the reeds suddenly wildfowl lifted in a cloud some little distance away the birds angrily calling and fatima cut the engine something caused that keep your head low but we can look with caution she produced a pair of zeiss glasses from the map compartment and focused them ah a flash of orange she nodded and turned to him handing the glasses over and another two of them inflatables with outboards can we get closer not without making a noise ill try using the pole you stay here watching she went down to the stern and commenced and talbot watched cautiously as the reeds parted and stingray floated through some distance away to the left he could hear the sound of an engine what do you think he called down to fatima it sounds like two engines i think nadim has probably brought both boats how many men sixteen or so each boat has a machine gun mounted theres nothing those bastards like better than sweeping the marshes with those things shooting everything in sight like schoolboys playing with toys the next thing youll be saying is thats men for you just a little closer if you will she did as he asked and everything happened in a hurry there they are two small orange inflatables in a waterway two men to each boat i cant see who it is because theyre wearing jungle kit and their faces are black but here goes he took deliberate aim and fired twice saw his target fall into the water did you get him fatima called up oh yes talbot smiled in triumph and for a moment forgot to keep low sean dillon with an uncertain glimpse of the tuareg who was shamrock took a snap shot it drilled talbots left side and he staggered back awkwardly dropping the ak and sliding down the ladder fatima was on her knees merciful allah how bad is it well i wouldnt know would i he managed a smile youll have to take a look ive got a medical kit in my rucksack you must find the morphine when youre first shot the shock kills the pain but not for long the engines of the approaching launches sounded louder now theyre coming fast fatima said yes well lets keep our heads down and stay out of it just let them get on with it if you look in my rucksack youll find half a bottle of cognac too get me that first holley had dragged hakim out of the water and the colonel lay there groaning soaked to the skin blood oozing through he was obviously in a very bad way holley had been aware of the return shot and called out dillon miller where are you there was no reply so he took out a spring knife and cut open hakims tunic he knew just how bad it was straight away and hakim moaned im going to die daniel shut up and lie still holley said this isnt exactly the best place for medical treatment he took two morphine ampoules from his bag because he figured one wouldnt be enough jabbed them in tore open a pack containing a wound dressing and applied it hakim shook his head a waste of time this is allahs punishment on me for my betrayal of you and malik the most shameful thing i have ever done in my life dont worry about it holley told him i understand osama al qaeda and the preacher really had you in their clutches hakim clutched at holley but at least i can make amends before i go and how would you do that to others the preacher is just a voice on the phone but not to me i gave the special mobile he supplied to an electronic genius he managed to break into the system and who is the preacher holley said suppressing his excitement hes a britishborn muslim named hassan shah he lives in bell street west hampstead ive checked hes investigated war crimes for the british government and is a professor in international law at the london school of economics good god almighty holley said weve got the bastard yes i believe you have hakims hand tightened on holleys jacket he convulsed and his head fell to one side holley sat there looking at him for a moment wondering about his next move but he was not given a choice small waves rippled though the reeds as the speed of whichever boat was approaching increased and then the boats heavy machine gun sprayed recklessly through the reeds and there was coarse laughter the inflatable rocked violently as the launch passed and holley took a fragmentation grenade from his bag and lobbed it over blindly there were cries of dismay followed by a violent explosion he eased out into the channel and saw the evening star well alight two men with their uniforms on fire jumped into the water holley took another grenade out and lobbed it after the others which seemed to finish the boat and the entire crew but there was still the fortuna somewhere out there holley could hear the engines and the sound of its heavy machine gun firing into the reeds at random he called dillon on his codex whats your situation dillon demanded hakim was hit by a sniper never saw who but hes dead the sniper was shamrock in his tuareg getup i fired back and he definitely went down i got the evening star with two grenades and watched them die where are you not far away at all well move closer to the boat and find you well one other thing i must tell you in case i get knocked off myself it turns out that hakim knew the name and address of the preacher jesus mary and joseph dillon said tell me which holley did and dillon said angrily the bastard i can just see him now standing in the dock at the old bailey claiming his human rights there was another burst of obviously haphazard machine gun fire not too far away so what are we going to do holley asked do you still have hakims body sure i do i didnt know what to do were only yards away from the evening star and its burning nicely start calling out and well call out too and see if we can get together before the fortuna turns up if nadims still on it he wont be pleased a hundred yards or so away the machine gun fired again so holley started up shouting and could immediately hear dillon and miller calling in a few minutes they connected now what holley asked hakim did us nothing but harm in life dillon said but ive got a use for him in death dont waste time because the fortunas coming up fast well dump your inflatable next to whats left of the evening star with hakim sitting up in it the perfect ambush nadim was at the wheelhouse of the fortuna as it broke out into the channel and saw the smoke and what was left of the evening star still burning his men cried out angrily as bodies floated by and then nadim saw the inflatable and hakim propped up in it there were cries of rage from the men nadim cut the engine and came out get the pole and hook him in three men started to do that there were only the marsh sounds in the rain smoke drifting the fire crackling as they lifted hakim up on to the deck nadim had never known such rage dillon he roared out in arabic i will cut you to pieces and feed you to the fishes when i find you over here a voice responded in arabic the grenades bounced on deck two at the same time then a third that rolled against hakim it was the last thing nadim saw on this earth somewhere nearby in the rain there was the sound of a plane taking off but in the mist there was little to see are you thinking what im thinking holley asked miller and dillon i definitely shot the tuareg dillon said well lets do the sensible thing and go see your friend omar hamza miller said to holley as they emerged at the side of the lagoon they saw the sport fisherman with fatima at the wheel moving towards the trading post holley checked through his binoculars hamzas sitting beside a browning machine gun he said and called loudly across the water its daniel lets talk fatima got out of the sport fisherman and tied up and turned to look at them all hamza shouted okay come over he was drinking beer and sitting there beside his machine gun when they arrived fatima leaned in the doorway arms folded watching them closely hamza said so youve been killing again holley how many all of them except for ali hakim shamrock shot him twice so hes dead he lived long enough to tell me a few interesting things was that shamrock flying away so it would appear hamza said i thought id shot him dillon said he shot hakim fatima nodded so you did you hit him in the left side and the bullet came out through his back and you patched him up dillon asked he had a military kit he told me what to do i gave him morphine and then took him to his plane yes his friend was waiting what kind of plane was it miller asked i have no idea he was english i believe not an arab it was her father who said thats enough go daniel and dont come back just one more thing he was in reasonable health when you left him you gave him the penicillin in the kit and soon said dillon oh yes i did everything he told me not that it will do him the slightest good hes obviously going to die and i think he knows it she went inside leaving a stunned silence and hamza said thats it on your way he patted the machine gun unless you want to argue with this whatever you say old friend holley told him i think you can take it that we wont be back you werent even here as far as were concerned hamza said i imagine thats the way the authorities in algiers will look at it after all an al qaeda operation is the last thing theyd want to have anything to do with the heavy rain kept what little life there was in dafur indoors they dumped the inflatable in the creek walked down to the runway where the falcon stood silent and waiting holley took the controls and within five minutes they were taking off dillon found himself a drink and miller called roper on his codex that was quick did you finally come face to face with shamrock in a way i suppose the whole thing was a sting what do you mean ali hakim turned out to be al qaedas man in algiers god in heaven roper said you can imagine what a shock it was for holley the story about shamrock having dealings with hamza was just bait for us to go and get knocked off theyd hoped ferguson would be there too so no shamrock no he turned up apparently he wanted to enjoy dealing with us personally just start at the beginning so i can make some sense of it roper said which miller did and when he was finished said so there it is shamrock winging his way back to wherever he came from with the pilot who flew him in and waited for him badly wounded and dying according to this fatima girl shes a strange one but thats what she said miller was repeating himself now dillon shot him in the side and the bullet went straight through and hes making a flight to we dont know where which could take hours hes committing suicide well thats the story and its obviously not finished yet its incredible youve certainly had an extraordinary outing this time god knows what ferguson will make of it hell be over the moon about one thing we now know who the preacher is imagine a professor of international law at the london school of economics and hes moonlighting for al qaeda in london if you wrote it up nobody would believe it roper said i would my father knew kim philby at cambridge miller told him anything been happening while weve been away there hasnt been time harry youve hardly been away take it easy ill see you soon l ondo n n orthern i reland by the time the citation x was winging its way across spain to the bay of biscay chuck alan was beginning to worry when justin talbot had returned to the plane at fasa he had seemed very hyper and full of nervous energy hed insisted on taking the controls on takeoff and only handed over during the second hour when chuck had suggested the autopilot excellent idea justin said i dont think i had a wink of sleep while i was away ill get my head down two hours later when alan checked him he was still asleep his forehead damp so alan returned to the cockpit consider ably concerned at the same time the preacher having heard nothing from hakim and no response when he tried to call him contacted hamza whats happened to hakim i dont seem to be able to contact him well you wouldnt hamza said hes dead in fact his people are all dead dillon and his friends dont take prisoners merciful allah and shamrock where did you find that guy the arabian nights he was really something in his tuareg robes god knows what he was here for he only managed to shoot one person and that was hakim by mistake dillon shot him in return are you saying hes dead no badly wounded but fit enough to have flown back out of this cesspool my daughter did her best for him with his medical kit so hes going to be all right not according to her she thinks hes a goner and shes usually right about things like that where did you get my mobile number from hakim well dont call again im not afraid of al qaeda and neither is anyone else that i know around here after this cockup your new motto should be stay out of the khufra he cut off and shah sat there thinking about it and then called talbot who came awake with a start the phone ringing in his breast pocket hamzas told me everything what a debacle and not helped by you indulging in your usual theatricals so youve managed to get yourself shot yes and i dont exactly feel at my best when i hit belfast i should book in at the seaton when it comes to gunshot wounds belfast hospitals are the best in the world the troubles gave them forty years practice but i dont know theyll report me whats the point in that and shah angry and immensely irritated said you bloody fool youre dying hamzas daughter said so did she well there you are then she was a nice girl you know your trouble preacher you dont listen i told you dillon and his friends were hell on wheels but you wouldnt have it your stupidity has ruined everything my stupidity shah said damn you to hell talbot ill destroy you if im dying it wont make any difference so why dont you go fuck yourself justin told him and cut off in his study at bell street sitting behind the desk hassan shah quite suddenly felt utterly helpless for the first time in years everything was slipping away from him the consequences of the fiasco in the khufra would undoubtedly affect his position in al qaeda when word reached osama bin laden once hed had the power to ruin justin talbot by just reaching for a telephone and making an anonymous call to any major newspaper but that was no threat to a dying man he frowned suddenly as a thought struck him as long as he did die of course roper informed ferguson of everything while the falcon was still on its way and ferguson was astounded this is one of the most sensational coups in the history of my department do you envisage repercussions general no algeria is not welldisposed towards al qaeda and hakim was notorious for his deeply secret covert operations where no questions were ever asked i think this will simply be regarded as one that went badly wrong and in one of the worst places in the country the whisper of an al qaeda connection will kill it stone dead it never happened major tell that to shamrock flying off into the blue with dillons bullet in him and dying if that young woman is right ferguson added thoughtfully which leaves us with professor hassan shah roper told him whats to be done there do we arrest him not at the moment we know how badly things have gone wrong and so will he by now al qaedas tentacles spread far call in billy right now tell him hes to stick to shah like glue should i put out a red code travel restriction so he cant leave the country no ill rely on billy and also shahs confidence in his social and governmental position ferguson shook his head you know what really gets to me hes the kind of eminent lawyer you would have expected to get a life peerage i see your point general i suppose hell have to make do with a thirtyyear sentence for high treason instead exactly ferguson said but give billy his orders now the citation x landed at belfast city just after noon chuck alan sitting alone in the cockpit he parked as instructed went in the cabin and opened the door he found justin dozing he shook his shoulder lightly and justins eyes opened he seemed puzzled for a moment as if unaware of where he was and the sweat on his forehead was more obvious he smiled suddenly hi old buddy are we there belfast city alan said you dont look too good justin sat up reached for a napkin and wiped his face im good chuck just fine he reached in the rucksack found the medical kit and the morphine pack he extracted a phial and jabbed it in his left arm what in the hell are you doing chuck alan demanded whats going on boss morphines going in chuck it kills the pain which is good if youve been shot which i was back in that stinking marsh justin was obviously lightheaded now look i dont know what ive been involved with or what happened back there this morning i dont think ive heard machine gun fire like it since iraq but i think you should probably be in the hospital a man in groundcrew overalls peered in weve brought your mercedes from the vip car park major talbot they presumed you needed it well thats damned nice of them justin picked up his rucksack with his right hand and said to alan you should be at frensham justin went down the steps carefully like a drunk and walked to the mercedes where the groundcrew man held the drivers door open for him he put the rucksack on the passenger seat slid behind the wheel switched on the engine and lowered the window bon voyage old buddy happy landings he drove away was waved through security without a search smiling and calling hello to various officials who knew him well a few minutes later and he was part of the busy city traffic of belfast chuck had to hang on for another hour for his departure slot and waited in the private lounge drinking black coffee and going over it all in his mind he finally did the right thing and called the house number hed been given for talbot place a mans voice answered its chuck alan mr talbots pilot i was hoping to speak to his mother im afraid shes out im the estate manager jack kelly i thought you were in algeria weve just got back is there something wrong i know justin was up to no good chuck hesitated look this is my boss were talking about just tell me the worst kelly ordered which alan did and when he was finished said i know it sounds difficult to believe kelly cut him off not where justins concerned im going to change your orders you do have your talbot credit card i sure do cancel your departure put the citation in for a flight check refuelling and so on and then go down to the europa book in and await further instructions i dont know how this business is going to turn out but you could be needed understand perfectly mr kelly ill get moving on that at once jean talbot had been up the mountain again with nell hoping that the strong wind blowing in from the irish sea would clear her head of the dark thoughts that had filled it since justins departure she was surprised to see kellys old morris driving towards her on the lower track it stopped kelly got out and came towards her she knew it must be trouble of a sort and hurried to meet him what is it justin get in the car out of the wind and ill tell you she took the passenger seat nell scampered in the back and kelly got behind the wheel as it started to rain jack whats going on and then the thought hit her and she turned pale oh dear god hes dead no but i understand hes been shot then where is he it would appear hes driving down from belfast kelly started the morris and coasted down to the road below she took a deep breath to pull herself together whats been going on jack ive heard half of everything for too long who is my son really what kind of man i dont think hes ever known that kelly told her the little protestant bastard who was really a catholic bastard a boy who had to survive a bigger bastard colonel henry talbot but forget all that the serious trouble hes in started after he left the army and went to pakistan and peshawar why was that he and our happy band of brothers from kilmartin were selling illegal arms over the border to the taliban in afghanistan selling arms became also agreeing to train people in their use al qaeda discovering what he was doing blackmailed him into working for them she said in horror youre asking me to believe he would go along with that he didnt have a choice jean and certainly not at first the trouble is he found he liked it action and passion are everything to him you know your own son she nodded calmer now just how bad is what hes done hes led a taliban group some of them including british muslims in battle against american and british forces and killed people a great many im afraid this cant be happening she shook her head why hasnt he been arrested the authorities dont know who he is i do because the other year he confided in me hes controlled by a man in london called the preacher and justin has a codename shamrock dillon and daniel holley whom you met are working for general charles ferguson of british intelligence trying to find out who shamrock is so where does algeria come in false information was fed by al qaeda sources to ferguson that shamrock was known to be in a pretty unsavoury part of algeria justin devised the plot which was to draw fergusons people to hunt for him unaware that they were the hunted themselves and this is what hes back from and with a bullet in him where is he like i said hes on his way from belfast city airport driving his mercedes sl they were on the coast road now and she seemed to have recovered what do you suggest do we go looking for him or do we just wait for him to turn up the problem was solved for jacks mobile sounded at that moment it was hannah the strangest thing jack i went down to the pub for a few things and noticed justins mercedes by the church lychgate is he in it no i found him sitting on the bench beside seans grave but its raining for christs sake i know could he be drunk i wish he were but im afraid not were on our way im with jean he explained what was happening and put his foot down so that they were there in fifteen minutes they found hannah with a raincoat over justins shoulders and father cassidy holding an umbrella justin dear what are you doing jean said hello mum just paying my respects to sean and all the brave young men a bloody sight braver than i could ever be eh jack and then he started to cry slow and bitter tears she cradled his head for a moment its all right love its all right just lets get you home he nodded and reached for kelly and grabbed him by the coat only no hospital jack this is good old ulster where all gunshot wounds must be reported to the police youre the expert you know that dont worry yourself boy jack kelly eased him up and as justin groaned said where are you shot left side and straight through i dont know how the hell dillon did it it was dawn light so it was appalling visibility and pouring with bloody rain just like this a snap shot was all he managed but it was enough the mans a bloody marvel hes done for me natural justice in a way when you think what i did to his uncle he started to laugh helplessly they got him into the back of the morris jean holding him hannah joined her husband in the front and called dr ryan on her mobile then alerted murphy at talbot place he was waiting anxiously at the front door and seeing the situation got colonel henrys wheelchair out of the cloakroom he and jean crowded into the lift and took him up to his bedroom kelly and his wife followed upstairs and hannah got bath towels and spread them on the bed so they could lay him out justin seemed quiet now and jean panicked whats wrong murphy said hes passed out his pulse is weak but its there dr ryan is on his way so just leave me to do my job im the nurse here go and have a cup of tea or something he produced scissors and cut open justins battle blouse and eased him out of it fatima had used two wound packs and they were swollen with blood oh my god jean said just take her away jack until the doctor gets here you stay hannah murphy said kelly tucked jeans arm firmly in his let murphy do his job during his years as a nurse in belfast he worked on more gunshot wounds than most battlefield surgeons he took her down to the study and gave her a brandy in spite of her protests drink it down it will help she did as she was told the warm glow steadying her but refused another tell me what justin meant when he said that what dillon had done to him was natural justice kelly was caught and it showed in his face oh he was just rambling come off it jack youre hiding something it cant be any worse than what ive heard already so spit it out mickeen oge flynns mishap i was with justin that night he was out of his mind with rage about everything after the funeral dillon had been on the phone from london to mickeen and paddy orourke overheard it was mentioned in pira circles and the news passed to me i told justin because in his circumstances id no choice and what did he do insisted he and i go and speak to mickeen which we did and found him under the car and working justin just lost it he was shouting at mickeen demanding to know what dillon had been talking about and there was an accident jean talbot sounded so weary exactly the jack was raised justin was stop it jack she cut in what happened to that old man wasnt any accident you know it and i know it kelly couldnt help himself and blurted out all right then but dillon believes that it was an accident mickeens had serious brain surgery hes in a coma dillons had him flown over to a private hospital in london but theres every chance hell never regain consciousness and thats supposed to be good is it her face was white and strained so it lets justin talbot off the hook is that what youre saying she shook her head what kind of world has it become when im surrounded by deceit and lies at every turn she turned wrenched open the door ran out and found dr ryan just being admitted at the front door by hannah it took larry ryan only fifteen minutes to examine the wound they all waited for his verdict no question the bullets passed straight through which is fine but he should be in the hospital jack kelly said how many times did you say that to pira volunteers who went to you for help in time of trouble larry and we were grateful to you thats a kind of blackmail jack id remind you i could get struck off jean said please larry anything you can do he sighed heavily damn justin he was always a wild man but just for you jean he turned to murphy youre as good as i am at handling wound trauma keep a close eye on him im going back to my place to pick up everything well need to set up a hospital bed he went out and murphy said why dont you all go and have a cup of tea pull yourselves together so we can sort everything out when doc ryans back oh i dont think so jean began hes right mum justin murmured sorry about all this i always was a bloody nuisance the falcon had landed at farley an hour and a half later than the citation x had in belfast on the way in dillon stopped by rosedene to check on mickeen professor bellamy wasnt there but maggie duncan was and had a bit of news as they stood looking in at mickeen through the window he looked exactly the same as when dillon had last seen him lying very still with all the paraphernalia attached to him hes moved a little according to the staff on night duty a line in his saline drip was pulled out and theyve reported sounds what kind of sounds dillon asked her nurse perry said shes heard long low sighs in the middle of the night what does bellamy think her practical scottish nature came to the fore wee signs of hope sean thats all he will say it could be worse though absolutely he kissed her cheek ill be seeing you at talbot place justins bedroom had been adapted as much as possible to hospital standards his double bed had been replaced by a single to facilitate the nursing he wore a hospital smock and there was a saline drip on the pole beside the bed a portable machine on the other side measuring heart and pulse rates ryan had stitched both the entry and exit wounds assisted by murphy and justin heavily bandaged around his waist was propped up the top of the bed inclined behind him ryan had used local anaesthetic for the stitching and justin sat there drinking glucose through a straw and looking surprisingly well murphy was sitting beside his bed when jean came in go and get something to eat ill spell you she said and murphy got up and left she leaned down and kissed justins forehead its not so sweaty she said larrys done a firstclass job on you dont worry ill see hes taken care of it was a careless and throwaway remark and in a way typical of him hes taking a great chance justin its a criminal act in the eyes of the law he could be struck off his career ruined okay mum i take your point dammit he did enough for men on the run during the troubles so now hes doing it for me when i hear you talking like that i think i never really knew you you use people justin then throw them away thats a nice turn of phrase he smiled dont tell me youre turning against me too i mean here i am the wounded hero she cut right in on him dont give me that shamrock because i only see the young british and american soldiers youve killed and for what because justin talbot enjoys war in all its blood and gore more than anything else in this life when i look at you i see the body count and if that wasnt enough i see mickeen oge flynn lying under a car and that car collapsing on him it was an accident justin said that was no accident she shouted the words carefully spacing them ive spoken to jack a moment later the door burst open and murphy came in jack kelly behind him is everything okay he said no its not apparently youve been shooting your mouth off jack justin said to kelly we cant have that i think youre maybe forgetting your place justin for gods sake jean said after everything jacks done to talk to him like that its all right jean kelly said i always worried there was too much of his grandfather to him he was colonel henry to the life for a minute there he went out justin said so now youll go after him and say sorry well im damned if i will she took a deep breath turned and went out leaving the door swinging justin reached and opened the locker on his right side and found his rucksack the pain on his left side was intense he cursed found the halfbottle of brandy and turned the cap with his teeth murphy had closed the door and stood watching you were dying when you got here and doc ryans done a marvellous job just about pulled you back from the brink you could still die id be failing as a nurse not to tell you that but one thing is certain drink that stuff and you might as well order your coffin is that so justin talbot said and swallowed deep murphy showed no emotion like they say its your funeral major ill go down to the kitchen now and see what theyve got for you to eat in london shah was methodically going through the newspapers when the text light blinked on his mobile on the desk he picked it up at once and his world turned the message said the winds of heaven are blowing and you must fly with them as does the eagle may allah go with you it was advice he had hoped never to receive and from the highest level of al qaeda the word that meant the game was up and his cover blown if there was no escape for him the only alternative was death he thought quickly he had three passports under different names many muslims used the airports in yorkshire or lancashire hed blend in better there at least he could try he quickly packed a holdall with basic requirements the passports a toilet bag a koran and a couple of law books he had always kept two thousand pounds in the zipped base of the holdall had never touched it so that was all right he looked around him so this was how it all ended the house in which he had been born in the west hampstead street where he had played as a boy in the great city with one of the finest universities in the world where hed been privileged to work he suddenly felt incredibly sad as if all this couldnt be happening he shook himself out of it let himself out of the front door and went to the toyota saloon parked in its usual place he opened the drivers door and got in but when he started it up the car wouldnt move he got out and saw the case all four tyres were flat as he stood there looking at the car billy salter got out of a red alfa one of a line of cars parked on the other side of the street shah recognized him instantly billy called have a nice day then produced his mobile called roper and shah went back in the house roper said to billy did you hear anything to make you think he was going to try to leave the country no i checked him out chatting up people in the local newsagent and cafe he never uses his car since he had a bump a year ago hes a taxi man i just thought it would be a good idea to make the car useless to him just in case and he saw you too damned right he did fergusons voice boomed youve forced my hand of course well have to lift him now stay there make sure he doesnt try to sneak out of the back shah sat at his desk as despair overwhelmed him for the first time he realized the price he was going to have to pay his eminence as a lawyer his professional standing he had come to this someone to be despised and for what it was all talbots fault the fiasco of the khufra affair damn him a complete loose cannon he thought back to what the girl fatima had said if she was right and talbots life hung in the balance it would be nice if somebody gave him a nudge shah thought he had the very man jack kelly was in the estate office at talbot place angrily clearing his desk for what had passed between him and justin had been hard to take jack kelly he barked why you sound angry mr kelly you should be after justins role in the algeria debacle hes not well i understand i gather sean dillon put a bullet in him who the hell is this kelly was aghast talbot knows me as the preacher shahs front doorbell rang he got a pillbox out of a small drawer in his desk took what looked like a lozenge out of it and slipped it into his pocket he walked to the bow window taking the desk phone looking through the glass at ferguson who was standing there with billy and harry miller kelly was shouting answer me damn you whats going on well ive just looked out to see major general charles ferguson at my door with two henchmen i fear my end is near does he know that justin is shamrock not that im aware of but i havent time for a prolonged discussion i just wanted you to know as an old pira hand that major justin talbot lied to you and your friends at kilmartin lied to his own mother many years ago he moved from the grenadier guards to the twentysecond sas at hereford he took part in more than twenty covert operations over a number of years youre lying kelly shouted come now mr kelly why would i lie june the third nineteen eightynine an ambush at kilrea eight members of the pira were killed it was known as the kilrae massacre i believe justin killed four of them himself damn you jack kelly said already taken care of shah dropped the desk phone on a coffee table took the lozenge from his pocket and kept it in his cheek the doorbell rang again and he opened the door as ferguson led the way in followed by billy with a walther in his hand and harry miller ah there you are ferguson said i presume you know who i am i do indeed general shah turned to walk to the sofa billy said where do you think youre going to sit down shah told him i might as well die comfortably he bit hard no ferguson cried and reached out and shah fell back face contorted gave a terrible moan jerked to one side his legs shaking and rolled on to the floor there was a strange and pungent smell and miller dropped to one knee see the froth on his lips the only good thing about it is it was quick what a stink billy said what was it cyanide capsule ferguson told him a favourite of highranking nazis when they lost the war miller had gone to check the desk and found shahs open mobile which hed left there he read aloud the text the winds of heaven are blowing and you must fly with them as does the eagle may allah go with you he handed it to ferguson maybe some kind of warning well never know but ill give it to roper to ponder over what do we do now send for the disposal unit billy asked i think not ferguson said leave him to be found as what people believed him to be an eminent professor of a great university christ you are being kind billy said no billy just charitable he cant harm us now so lets go shall we and he led the way out jack kelly totally distraught sat with his head in his hands at his desk trying to come to terms with what he had been told that the preacher faced with the prospect of being lifted by charles ferguson was choosing death made perfect sense to kelly on the other hand in such circumstances why would the preacher lie about anything so justin had served with the sas hunted down and killed members of the pira the real problem was it didnt really surprise kelly it fitted with everything else about justin hed had a kind of madness since boyhood and kelly saw that now he took a browning hed used in his wild days out of a bottom drawer always kept loaded from force of habit put it in his righthand pocket and went out he went up the stairs in the great hall slowly aware of the weight of the browning in his pocket feeling like an executioner again for he had been here before in similar situations a bullet being the only way to deal with traitors and informants when he went in justin was sitting up his head slightly to one side eyes closed murphy was reading a book kelly said go and have your tea break i want a word with him not for long he gets tired murphy said and went out kelly stood at the end of the bed justin opened his eyes there you are again i was out of order before i apologize ive got news for you from the preacher justin frowned youve got what he called me on my office number he said he only had a few minutes because charles ferguson and two of his men were at the front door demanding entrance what was he going to do make a fight of it no kill himself but he told me that he thought i ought to know a few things like that you lied to all your friends in kilmartin about your army service during the troubles that you served on more than a score of covert operations with the twentysecond sas including the kilrea massacre in june eightynine justin tried to brazen it out are you telling me youd take the word of a man like the preacher against mine the word of a dying man kelly said he seemed very well informed to me that girl in algeria said you were dying and it would be the best thing for you when this gets out youre finished in kilmartin i wouldnt be surprised if someone wasnt able to resist the temptation to shoot you he produced his browning youve no idea how much id like to use this justin leaned down picked up his rucksack put it on the bed and produced a walther you could always try you bastard kelly said according to the preacher you even lied to your own mother what did you expect me to do worry her to death every time the sas handed me another death warrant anyway it would have made life for her and the old man impossible he smiled ive always thought the world of my mother i do have my good side i doubt that kelly said ask her if you like shes been trying to make some sense of my clothes in the dressing room you launched your attack too soon didnt give me an opportunity to tell you she was there the halfopen door next to the bathroom opened and jean entered she wore jeans and a white shirt her hair tied back and her face was incredibly calm sorry about the guns mum ill put mine away if hell pocket his hes caught me out again more of those secrets you keep bumping into where im concerned youll have heard what jacks had to say and im afraid its all true i deceived you for years and it was so easy to do covert operations with the sas are as secret as anything could be i was thinking of what was best for you she was instantly aware of what he was trying to do trying to clear her name of any blame in the matter against what would happen when the news spread for this was ireland and spread it would so she lied in a sense and said to kelly i can see his point but obviously you and the villagers will have a different attitude not where youre concerned but as for this one here goes kelly shook his head i lost one son at nineteen justin and you were the closest i came to replacing him but if sean was alive today hed spit on your grave well im not in one yet so be a good chap and clear off justin cocked the walther and pointed kelly walked out of the room and justin said to his mother so the preachers gone to a better place thats something to be grateful for anyway i wouldnt know about that she said in fact i dont know about anything much any more and she too went out on the way back ferguson called on roper and filled him in on what had happened do you think ive done right he asked oh yes although it could well give his cleaning lady a heart attack when she finds the body if wed used disposal it would have left an ongoing mystery about what had happened to him if wed gone through the motions properly and arrested him the show trial would have damaged everybody including the cabinet office for having employed him harry miller cut in i agree the secret intelligence service wouldnt have come out of it very well for not spotting him well the prime ministers private army has done it again roper said i think hell be pleased another notch on your gun general all very well but shamrock the mystery man is still floating around out there dillon and holley had just turned up at the computer room and roper gave them the news its fantastic when you think of it holley said a man like that one of the most eminent in his field academic degrees up to his armpits and yet he chooses the path of violence ever since robespierre in the french revolution the big movers and shakers have always been intellectuals roper said i seem to remember you got firstclass honours in your degree he told holley which is absolutely no help at all when some bastards trying to shoot me ferguson and miller walked in the general was in an excellent mood billy rather pushed things with shah and i must admit i was annoyed but in the circumstances im glad he did hes following us in his own car a hell of a coup dillon said you could get a promotion with this one dont be silly dillon billy joined them and dillon said you did well sometimes you need to take a chance on doing the wrong thing in the hope it will get the right result you were on the button with this one i cant really take much credit billy said the truth is i had it in for shah for getting me shot well there you go dillon told him anyway weve got a lot to celebrate tonight are you going to line something up for us general he asked ferguson at that moment roper took a call on speaker and maggie duncans voice boomed out hello major roper have you got sean there what is it dillon asked weve had movement with mickeen lots of groans and moans and vigorous stirring ive phoned professor bellamy hes at guys hospital hes going to come straight round when hes finished but hes suggested you come now if youre available in this kind of case a result can come right out of the blue im on my way dillon told her one thing sean i dont want a crowd here it wouldnt be good for him just you and one other person if you like ill see you fantastic news ferguson said you must get moving straightaway dillon said to holley will you come with me daniel after all you and i are the only ones here whove visited the scene of his accident my mini coopers outside you can drive it im too excited how could i refuse holley said and they hurried out at rosedene there was a certain excitement maggie duncan at the window peering in a couple of nurses looking over her shoulder when dillon and holley appeared she chased the other nurses away an older nurse was sitting at mickeens bedside marys there to control him if anything happens in a hurry a patient can get panicked when he awakens out of nowhere as she said that mickeen opened his eyes raised an arm and reached out at mary she took his hand he looked thoroughly bewildered and then spoke very hoarsely who are you where am i youre all right mr flynn she said youve been ill he panicked then whats going on i dont remember you he shrank back pulling out the line to his saline bag and another line to the machines monitoring his vital signs maggie duncan opened the door and rushed in to assist mary mickeen was shaking crying desperately and dillon stepped in the room leaned over the bed from the other side and took his hand mickeen oge flynn he said in irish its me your nephew sean dillon come to help you in your hour of need be still now for you have not been yourself maggie mary and holley didnt understand a word but mickeen did god save the good work sean is it indeed you and none other dillon smiled and touched his face but shall we speak english now for it is only good manners with the ladies not understanding the old man nodded slowly and said to mary in english and who are you my dear staff nurse mary hanson mickeen and this is the matron maggie duncan youre in hospital in london he looked puzzled london you say i havent been to london in years there was alarm how did i get here and whos that dillon glanced up and saw bellamy standing in the door excited and fascinated this is your doctor professor bellamy now then mickeen youve been on a long journey can you remember it bellamy connected the electronics line and mary the drip mickeen frowned i dont recall and then he looked up at dillon i remember you sean phoning me from london about the funeral and which funeral would that be bellamy asked and murmured to mary a cup of tea i think and chocolate biscuits all nice and normal she withdrew and mickeen said which funeral old colonel henry talbots he was a bad man a real bad man he was wandering now and dillon said gently so you went to the funeral mickeens face seemed to light up i did that but they were stopping people going in who the provos from kilmartin justin didnt want outsiders to go his face became vacant as he looked at something he alone could see thats right i went back to collyban and paddy had left father ogradys car up on the jack his exhaust was damaged so i thought id take a look and i got underneath and they came there was a stillness in the room now and bellamy said who came i could only see their feet so i put my head out to look up it was jack kelly from kilmartin and mr justin talbot he was angry and asked me why id tried to go to the funeral and then he said he knew youd been on the phone to me sean and asked what was it about and what did you say dillon asked that you were family had just called to say hello and what happened then he said there must have been more to it than that he lost his temper then he started kicking at my face and the car fell down he shook his head puzzled or did it he smiled a little like a child in a way i only remember one word after that someone said shamrock a strange thing to say surely he looked around where am i how did i get here daniel holley said sweet jesus now we know sean dillons face was very dark so it would appear i should have remembered the old sherlock holmes quote when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth justin talbots war record speaks for itself hes simply been carrying on except that hes been doing it for the taliban and al qaeda mary returned with tea and biscuits and bellamy said now then mickeen settle back and enjoy yourself do you like sugar in your tea i do indeed three sugars and those chocolate biscuits look grand well leave you now with mary to enjoy yourself and well be back in a little while mickeen was already trying a biscuit you wont go seaneen without telling me now why would i do that dillon reached over and kissed him on the forehead the terrible scare you gave me enjoy your tea they sat in the lounge and maggie said ill get some tea on the way and went into the kitchenette bellamy said i never cease to marvel at the human spirit the journey that old man has been on is a miraculous one so much to learn from it so damn much i agree but its his past thats important now dillon said the events leading up to all this bellamy nodded a bad business i agree a matter for the police id say my confidentiality goes without saying but obviously the name of talbot is very familiar to me and to a lot of other people holley said is what he said about justin talbot beyond doubt daniel holley said yesterday he murdered a man in my custody in algiers i fired back and shot him in the left side dillon said weve returned by private jet and i believe so has he he has a house in county down i expect to find him there just then two things happened at the same moment maggie duncan emerged with the tea tray and down the corridor the alarm bell sounded an ugly and frightening sound maggie dumped the tray went off on the run bellamy following her dillon and holley went after them the crash team had swung into action working desperately on mickeen and through the window dillon could see the flat line on the heart monitor the team worked in a frenzy but it was fruitless finally bellamy gave the order to switch off time of death two oclock matron agreed she nodded wiping her eyes and went back down the corridor dillon stood there looking through the window holley put an arm about him for a moment come on sean let them get on with what theyve got to do they went back to the lounge and bellamy found them ten minutes later theres absolutely nothing i can say except that the reaction of coming back to life as it were obviously put an enormous strain on his entire system which was weakened already by the brain surgery ive absolutely no complaint professor this is a remarkable hospital as i know more than once from my own experience if you couldnt save him no one could i believe you are the only relative dillon nodded so i presume youll want everything done right a catholic burial and so on everything above board not like some of the cases that have come my way from you and ferguson in the past of course then that means a post mortem and a coroners inquest obviously this would take some time and it would require that proceedings be brought against justin talbot in a court of law thats how i see it too perhaps you should discuss it with ferguson he will want to do whats right for him i want to do whats right for mickeen i understand how you feel but i really think you should talk to ferguson when i start handling this in the way you wish i dont want to find any roadblocks waiting for me if you know what i mean i do but i intend to have things the way i want them this time and fergusons going to have to accept that he got up and shook hands many thanks professor but well be on our way holley drove again on the way back and dillon just sat there gazing out at the traffic roper called and said a terrible business sean bellamys been in touch and filled us in what do you think of the shamrock affair now its so unlikely that it must be true theres an imbalance in the man a kind of madness there must be for someone who has everything to risk losing the lot maybe its because hes decided that in having everything hes got nothing then theres the whole relationship with al qaeda to explain dillon said is ferguson there he added hes been called to a cabinet office meeting with harry miller and then hes on the list to see the prime minister told me to tell you hell see you both early evening and talbot when i raised the matter he said that since there was absolutely nowhere in the world that talbot could hide there was no rush hes probably right the way i see it with all that talbot money theyll have a phalanx of the finest barristers in the business working for him hes a decorated war hero wounded in afghanistan imagine what the psychiatrists will make of that to hell with the barristers and the psychiatrists talbots mine if hes still alive i want to lift him dillon said he was sitting in the computer room with roper and holley at holland park everything according to the law i want his arrest a post mortem a coroners inquest and most of all i want to see him standing in the dock of the old bailey i owe it to mickeen ive crossed him off my guest list roper said he deserves everything they can throw at him but the way things look you arent going to get it i remember during the cold war if you arrested a communist spy he never ended up in the dock because they wanted to turn him are you saying thats what ferguson wants to do with talbot no sean roper said what i think is that this might go way beyond ferguson were talking politics here and on an international level and you agree with that dont insult me you daft bastard just listen for once in your life what do you think its like sitting here year after year in this wheelchair knowing whats right and not being able to do anything about it because of the system dillon said im sorry giles this business has really got to me roper reached for his bottle of scotch poured a large one and tossed it back heres the bad news fergusons already been told by the cabinet office to invoke the official secrets act when mickeens death is put before a special crown coroner the coroner will give a closed court order no jury necessary theyll issue a burial order and thats it to whom dillon said mr teague and the disposal team roper ignored him it all takes place quickly id say about a week there was a silence between the three of them and it was roper who said you know i did some checking talbot international has a citation x in the past couple of days its flown from belfast to algeria and back again landed today just after noon in belfast holley said a great plane that some say is the fastest commercial jet in the world and the pity of it all said roper is that i havent been able to tell ferguson about it why not dillon asked i cant go breaking in on him when hes at a cabinet office can i or when hes with the prime minister so what are you saying holley asked roper looked up at the clock twenty to three its half an hour to farley and you could make belfast in one hour if there happened to be say a mercedes waiting you could be at kilmartin at five oclock how the hell did you manage to arrange all this its better you dont know roper reached into his desk heres a copy of the warrant authorizing you to take into custody major justin talbot wherever he may be found youve got your mi warrant card sean but heres one for you daniel i took it for granted you wouldnt mind using the plane i wouldnt miss it for anything holley turned to dillon lets get going then they rushed out roper put the weather chart for the irish sea up on the screen a nice summer afternoon nightfall about eight oclock possibility of showers later ah well that was ireland for you he wondered how ferguson was going to take it and discovered that he didnt really care and he was laughing as he poured another scotch at talbot place justin had spent much of the day dozing his forehead was damp when larry ryan dropped in for the second time that day to see him it was fourthirty the sky clouding over a rumble of thunder in the far distance jean greeted the doctor and accompanied him to her sons bedroom she stood with murphy while ryan examined him and justin said here we are again larry well done thou good and faithful servant shut up justin jean said only joking mum ryan said you always did justin i might call in again later he went out and jean and murphy followed him how is he she asked not good his temperature is a hundred and three and the pulse is racing the hearts under great strain in my opinion i really do think he needs not only hospital but intensive care but you and murphy have done so much for him im not certain its enough jean if that fever really erupts it will be the death of him hes determined to tough it out she said what can i do theres not much left but prayer i suppose has father cassidy been to see him justin refused to speak to him thats a shame i saw the old boy myself earlier he told me hell be asking people to pray for justin jean said i doubt hell appreciate it ryan said to murphy he cant bathe or shower because i dont think it wise to disturb the dressings just give him a body wash and fresh garments of some sort he kissed jean on the cheek take care and i want you to know you can rely on me jean ill call back this evening again around seven she went back in the room and found justin arguing with murphy he wants to give me a body wash as if i were a bloody schoolboy shut your mouth and do as youre told she reached behind him untied the ribbons on his bed smock youll feel better when murphys washed you down and dressed you so dont be stupid all right but youll have to go out im not a little boy any more she went downstairs found hannah and emily the cook and young jane dressed in their best and putting their coats on you remembered we were going to six oclock mass hannah told her murphy promised to go with us hes just giving justin a wash and change but he wont be long is jack going not if he can help it if i know him to be honest with you hes putting his time into sorting the office out just in case he leaves hes not thinking of going after all these years he doesnt need it jean hes got the pub and ive got to be honest with you because i love you he feels betrayed i doubt it will ever be the same again between him and justin jean gave her a kiss for she was obviously very upset im sorry about justin hannah and the way its turned out i dont know what to say ill go and send murphy on his way well hang on jean went up in the lift and when she entered justins bedroom found him wearing a navy blue track suit he was sitting in the bedside armchair while murphy fitted a pair of white sneakers on his feet thats great justin said i feel a hundred per cent better prop up the pillows on the bed and ill lie back which murphy did assisting him back up on to it jean said off you go murphy the ladies are waiting to take you to mass ill see you later he said and hurried out there was for her at least a slight awkward silence can i get you anything i dont think so then i think ill just go to my studio for a while still working on my portrait no i decided id gone about as far as i could get and are you happy with it i think it says what you are and it tells the truth when i was a student at the slade my professor said the most important thing was that your subject was so perfectly realized that it was as if the individual was saying not this is me but this is what i am and does mine do that oh yes i think so then you must put it over the fireplace in the study no i couldnt do that why not id always be afraid that somebody would put it on a bonfire she went out he lay there thinking about what shed said then reached down for the rucksack and put it on the bed beside him it hurt like hell so he rummaged amongst the things inside and took out the halfbottle of brandy and swallowed some it burned all the way down and he remembered what murphy had said but he was past caring so he swallowed some more it was almost six when holley drove through kilmartin people going into church and organ music clearly heard dillon kept his head down as they passed the pub and moved along the approach road to talbot place which loomed ahead through beech trees and then they were at the entrance to the drive how do we play this holley asked im remembering that jack kelly is the estate manager dillon said they must have an office for him all these great estates do just follow your nose which holley did and then they saw the main entrance porch to the house and at the same time noticed a sign board saying estate manager an arrow pointing there was a shogun and a mercedes and they parked their own car with them and walked round to the courtyard and found the office opened the door without knocking and walked in jack kelly was arranging files on a shelf and received a severe shock he moved to his desk fast got the drawer open and took out his browning put it away jack dillon told him we havent come for you weve come for justin he took out the national security warrant and put it on the desk read it kelly did his face troubled on whose authority mi fives dillon showed him his warrant card daniels got one too bloody traitors the both of ye youre entitled to your opinion holley said but dont tell us hes not here his plane is at belfast city airport and since his pilot happened to be in the staff canteen we took the opportunity of interviewing him he was most revealing so we know hes here and in a poorly way dillon said kelly still tried to bluster and what is it hes supposed to have done if youll take us to him youll discover that now where do we go dillon demanded suddenly it was all too much for kelly and he said despairingly christ theres no way round this is there the silly stupid mad young idiot hes going down and taken the entire house of talbot with him even colonel henry couldnt do that come on follow me he brushed past them and led the way out they went up the stairs together and it was kelly who knocked on the door and led the way in jean was sitting in an easy chair by the old fireplace justin still propped up on the bed yes jack what is it jean asked and then dillon and holley moved in on either side of him justin talbot dillon said were from mi five here to take you into custody you cant do that justin was surprisingly calm you should have police with you we dispense with that on special occasions so whats the charge there will be many your exploits as shamrock have been better than the midnight movie you know and by the way it wasnt one of us you shot in the khufra it was colonel ali hakim justin laughed out loud you dont say i think thats really very funny holley said hakim also told me the identity of the preacher before he died its professor hassan shah of the london school of economics if youre interested oh i am but its a pity i didnt know it earlier i believe he met a bad end cyanide poisoning dillon told him justin turned to his mother and said just like heinrich himmler for gods sake justin jean said this isnt funny theyre here to arrest you im afraid ill have to disappoint them what do you mean im planning to go down to drumgoole and fly away in my beech baron she was incredibly distressed justin this is madness but i am mad just like colonel henry said ive always known it his hand went into the rucksack and holley drew his walther justin produced the halfbottle of brandy waved it at him and drank deeply holley dropped his hand holding the walther against his leg justin replaced the brandy bottle in the rucksack pulled out a browning and shot holley and dillon in the chest kelly cowered raising his hands and his mother screamed no justin he laughed wildly your lucky day jack im out of here he pushed kelly to one side pulled open the door and lurched out making for the stairs reaching for the banister to support him on the way down jean almost demented dropped on her knees beside dillon but found him taking one deep breath after another and then already sitting up body armour he gasped its like being kicked by a mule but a lot better than being dead he was panting his voice hoarse but holley was already stirring in the same way as kelly helped him up jean turned and ran out justin was making slow progress getting down the stairs and she caught up with him as he reached the door its no use love theres nowhere to go he knocked her hand away yes there bloody well is he went down the steps and made by mistake for the mercedes that dillon and holley had parked there as he got the drivers door open it started to rain and there was thunder in the distance he got in and she pulled open the passenger door and scrambled in beside him by chance holley had left the key in the ignition justin please darling think again jean said oh no none of that mum i told you where i was going and i meant it he switched on the engine and drove away dillon holley and kelly came down the stairs together are you okay dillon asked holley im more angry than anything else imagine falling for a cheap trick like that so thank god once again for the nylonandtitanium vest dillon said and asked kelly what about drumgoole its a small flying club just off the coast road when he flies over from frensham he uses a twinengine beech baron drumgoole is only twenty minutes from the house so its convenient well you know the way so you take us there dillon told him only put your foot down god knows where he thinks he can hide now but id prefer to put a hand on him while we still can there was very little wind but it was raining hard now and gloomy as night touched the far horizon the mercedes turned into the small car park at drumgoole but the flying club was closed not a soul about nobodys here justin said thats usual when theres no activity no bookings she said there were two archers a cessna and the beech baron there she is the darling justin said lets hope regans done his stuff and left the cabin key in the usual place he got out of the mercedes walked to the redpainted sand box hanging beside the door of the office and felt inside he held the key up in triumph there you go he started to walk towards the beech baron and jean went after him begging please justin dont do this where will you go stay and give us a chance to work this out i dont think so he reached the plane stepped up on the wing and unlocked the cockpit door at that moment kellys morris appeared up on the road paused and started down to the car park oh dear must go justin scrambled in across to the lefthand seat jean tried to follow him stepping up on the wing as he switched on the engine im coming with you i dont think so as the propellers started to turn he shouted above the engine roar better this way mum shoved her down off the wing slammed the door and started to move away the morris braked to a halt the three men got out and the beech baron was moving jean talbot running alongside pleading dillon ran in ducked and grabbed her dragging her away and justin gazing out of the cockpit window raised his thumb the plane swung round and rushed forward lifting as he boosted the engines very fast and very low and then it started to climb and continued until perhaps a quarter of a mile out the engines stopped there was silence except for the rushing rain and jean talbot screamed as if knowing what was going to happen and the beech baron dropped its nose and went straight down into the sea there was a great fountain of foam and she cried helplessly as she turned and buried her face against dillons chest and he held her she looked up at him her face swollen with her weeping damn you all of you with your lies and deceit and endless killing the world should be better than this she started to cry helplessly and jack kelly came and took her gently from dillon and held her close lets go home jean back to the place he nodded to dillon and said theres a trench three hundred feet deep out there he knew that this is your mercedes i think id go if i were you much the best thing they sat in the mercedes waiting for the morris to leave and dillon got out his codex called roper and gave him a quick resume of events roper seemed subdued so thats it if you mean is justin talbot dead youd better believe it i suppose recovering the plane is possible if jean talbot wants it what do you think ferguson will make of it he rang me from the cabinet office so i seized the opportunity to get it over with and i told him what you were up to he just said i might have known well god knows how hell react to the result ill be seeing you holley said god but im sore youre alive dillon said thats all that counts holley nodded do you think justin talbot was mad barking mad dillon said so really it wasnt his fault any of it its a point of view dillon told him twenty minutes later when they were close to the outskirts of belfast roper called again and dillon put it on speaker so holley could hear ive told him what happened and what was his reaction he said it was perfect justin talbot dies in a tragic plane crash and that clears the whole thing up without a scandal as someone else said very recently you have a great gift for doing the wrong thing but getting the right result see you dillon and then he rang off right for whom dillon said ferguson the prime minister the cabinet office he shook his head do you ever get tired daniel really tired sure i do holley said its a mad world dillon but its all weve got r equie m by the good offices of blake johnson dillon found himself soon after on assignment to the cia at langley on an antiterrorism programme the principle was set a thief to catch a thief his years on the other side of the fence providing invaluable experience for students it was two months before he found himself back at holland park and on the first day roper said something that might interest you is taking place tomorrow what would that be dillon asked jean talbots the new chairman of talbot international the board didnt have much choice since she owns so much of the firm she moved back to marley court and is back at the slade as a visiting professor in fine art and apparently shes getting an enormous number of portrait assignments i was reading her up in tatler magazine shes got an exhibition in bond street thats nice for her but whats happening tomorrow she had a dutch salvage firm look for justin and they found him in the beech baron shes burying him tomorrow at st mary the virgin church in dun street mayfair i thought you might be interested now do i look like that kind of fella actually i think you do in any event an assignment for ferguson got in the way dillon got to the church too late for the service and things had moved out to the churchyard most roman catholic churches in london are victorian and st mary the virgin was a charming example with a delightfully melancholic feel to it crowded with gothic tombs winged angels and effigies of children who had died far too young he stayed back from the crowd of thirty or forty people standing around the grave with bowed heads while the priest read the prayers for the dying jean talbot looked very fine the veil on her black hat thrown back smiling at everyone she turned to move back towards the church talking to people close to her moving directly towards dillon then passing without the slightest sign that they had met he was surprised to realize how put out he felt and the following day being in bond street by the zion gallery he went in to have a look at her collection it was all excellent more than interesting but the big surprise was the portrait of her son it was incredibly good a masterwork it was late in the afternoon and the crowd had thinned and he sat on a bench for twenty minutes looking at it thinking of lord byron mad bad and dangerous to know you obviously like it mr dillon she appeared from behind him its a very remarkable painting of a very remarkable young man he stood and turned to face her and was amazed that a woman of her age could look so incredibly attractive i tried to make the funeral but got held up and missed the church i did manage some of the funeral though i saw you i didnt know that he was lying of course and she knew it she turned to look at the painting again my son was a deeply troubled man and a great
