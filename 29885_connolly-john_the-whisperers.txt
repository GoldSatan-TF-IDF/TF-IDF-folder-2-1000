john connolly the whisperers the ninth book in the charlie parker series to mark dunne paul oreilly noel maher and emmet hegarty princes all extract from a terrible love of war by james hillman published by penguin books prologue war is a mythical happening where else in human experience except in the throes of ardor do we find ourselves transported to a mythical condition and the gods most real james hillman a terrible love of war baghdad april it was dr aldaini who found the girl abandoned and alone in the long central corridor she was almost entirely buried beneath broken glass and shards of pottery under discarded clothing and pieces of furniture and old newspapers used as packing materials she should have been rendered almost invisible amid the dust and the darkness but dr aldaini had spent decades searching for girls such as she and he picked her out where others might simply have passed over her only her head was exposed her blue eyes open her lips stained a faded red he knelt beside her and brushed some of the detritus from her outside he could hear shouting and the rumble of tanks changing position suddenly bright light illuminated the hallway and there were armed men shouting and giving orders but they had come too late others like them had stood by while this had happened their priorities lying elsewhere they did not care about the girl but dr aldaini cared he had recognized her immediately for she had always been one of his favorites her beauty had captivated him from the first moment he set eyes on her and in the years that followed he had never failed to make time to spend a quiet moment or two with her during the day to exchange a greeting or merely to stand with her and mirror her smile with one of his own perhaps she might still be saved he thought but as he carefully shifted wood and stone he recognized that there was little he could do for her now her body was shattered broken into pieces in an act of desecration that made no sense to him this was not accidental but deliberate he could see marks on the floor where booted feet had pounded upon her legs and arms reducing them to fragments little larger than the grains of sand on which she now rested yet somehow her head had escaped the worst of the violence and dr aldaini could not decide if this rendered what had been visited upon her less awful or more terrible oh little one he whispered as he gently stroked her cheek the first time that he had touched her in fifteen years what have they done to you what have they done to us all he should have stayed he should not have left her should not have left any of them but the fedayeen had been battling the americans near the ministry of information the sounds of gunfire and explosions reaching them even as they sandbagged friezes and wrapped foam rubber around the statues grateful that they had at least managed to transport some of the treasures to safety before the invasion commenced the fighting had then spread to the television station less than a kilometer away and to the central bus station at the other side of the complex drawing closer and closer to them he had argued in favor of staying for they had stockpiled food and water in the basement but many of the others felt that the risks were too great all but one of the guards had fled abandoning their weapons and their uniforms and there were already blackgarbed gunmen in the museum garden so they had locked the front doors and left through the back entrance before fleeing across the river to the eastern side where they waited in the house of a colleague for the fighting to cease but it did not stop when they attempted to return over the bridge of the medical city they were turned back and so they stayed with their colleague once again and drank coffee and waited some more perhaps they had remained there for too long debating back and forth the wisdom of abandoning what was for now a place of safety but what else could they have done yet he could not forgive himself or assuage his guilt he had abandoned her and they had had their way with her and now he was crying not from the dirt and filth but from rage and hurt and loss he did not stop not even as booted feet approached him and a soldier shone a flashlight in his face there were others behind him their weapons raised sir who are you asked the soldier dr aldaini did not reply he could not all of his attention was fixed on the eyes of the broken girl sir do you speak english ill ask you one more time who are you dr aldaini picked up on the nervousness in the soldiers voice but also the hint of arrogance the natural superiority of the conqueror over the conquered he sighed and raised his eyes my name is dr mufid aldaini he said wiping his eyes and i am the deputy curator of roman antiquities at this museum then he reconsidered no i was the deputy curator of roman antiquities for now there is no museum left now there are only fragments you let this happen you stood by and let this happen but he was speaking as much to himself as he was to them and the words turned to ash in his mouth the staff had left the museum on tuesday on saturday they learned that the museum had been looted and then began to return in an effort to assess the damage and prevent any further theft someone said that the looting had commenced as early as thursday when hundreds of people had gathered at the fence surrounding the museum for two days they were free to ransack already there were rumors that insiders had been involved some of the museums own guardians targeting the most valuable artifacts the thieves took everything that could be moved and much of what they could not take they attempted to destroy dr aldaini and some others had gone to the headquarters of the marines and pleaded for help in securing the building for the staff was fearful that the looters would return and the us army tanks at the intersection only fifty meters from the museum had refused to come to their aid citing orders they were eventually promised guards by the americans but only now on wednesday had they come dr aldaini had arrived just shortly before them for he had been one of those assigned the role of liaison with the soldiers and the media and had spent the previous days being passed up and down the military ranks and providing contacts for journalists carefully he raised the head of the broken girl youthful yet ancient the paint still visible on her hair and mouth and eyes after almost four thousand years look he said still weeping look at what they did to her and the soldiers stared for a moment at this old man covered in white dust a hollow head in his hands before moving on to secure the looted halls of the iraq museum they were young men and this operation was about the future not the past no lives had been lost not here these things happened after all there was a war on dr aldaini watched the soldiers go he looked around and saw a swatch of paintspattered cloth lying by a fallen display case he checked it and found it to be relatively clean so he placed the head of the girl upon it then wrapped the cloth carefully around her tying a knot with the four corners so that he might more easily carry her he stood wearily the head now hanging from his left hand like an executioner bearing to his potentate the evidence of the axs work for so lifelike was the girls expression and so troubled and shocked was dr aldaini that he would not have been surprised had the severed neck begun to bleed through the material casting red drops like petals upon the dusty floor all around him were reminders of what had once been absences like open wounds jewelry had been taken from skeletons their bones scattered statues had been decapitated so that the most striking aspect of them might more easily be carried away curious he thought that the girls head exquisite as it was should have been overlooked or perhaps it was enough for whomever had broken her that her body was ruined enough to have removed a little beauty from the world the scale of the destruction was overwhelming the warka vase a masterpiece of sumerian art from about bc and the worlds oldest carved stone ritual vessel was gone hacked away from its base a beautiful bullheaded lyre had been reduced to kindling as the gold was stripped from it the bassetki statue base gone the statue of entema gone the warka mask the first naturalistic sculpture of a human face gone he passed through room after room replacing all that was lost with phantasms ghosts of themselves here an ivory seal there a bejeweled crown so that what had once been was superimposed over the wreckage of the present even now while still near numb at the extent of the damage that had been done dr aldaini was already cataloging the collection in his mind trying to recall the age and provenance of each precious relic in case the museums own records might no longer be available to them when they began the seemingly impossible task of recovering what had been taken relics dr aldaini stopped walking he swayed slightly and his eyes closed a soldier passing by asked him if he was okay and offered him water a small gesture of kindness that dr aldaini was unable to acknowledge so grave was his disquiet instead he turned to the soldier and gripped his arms a movement that might well have ended his troubles on the spot had the soldier in question had his finger on the trigger of his gun i am dr mufid aldaini he told the soldier i am a deputy curator here at the museum please i need you to help me i have to get to the basement i must check something it is very very important you must help me to get through he gestured at the shapes of the armed men ahead of them beige figures in the darkened hallways the young man before him looked doubtful then shrugged youll have to let go of my shoulders first sir he said he couldnt have been more than twenty or twentyone but there was an assurance to him an ease more appropriate to an older man dr aldaini stepped back apologizing for his presumption the name on the soldiers uniform read patchett do you have some identification asked patchett dr aldaini found his museum badge but the lettering was in arabic he searched in his wallet and found a business card arabic on one side english on the other and handed it across squinting slightly in the poor light patchett examined it then returned it okay lets see what we can do he said dr aldaini had two titles in the museum as well as being deputy curator of roman antiquities a job description that did insufficient justice to the depth and breadth of his knowledge or indeed the additional responsibilities that he had shouldered unofficially and without remuneration he was also the curator of uncataloged items another name that barely hinted at the extent of the herculean labors involved the museums inventory system was both ancient and complicated and there were tens of thousands of items that had yet to be included one part of the museums basement was a labyrinth of shelves piled high with artifacts boxed and unboxed most of them or most of the tiny fraction that had been cataloged by dr aldaini and his predecessors of little monetary value yet each one a marker a remnant of a civilization now changed beyond recognition or departed utterly from this world in many ways this basement was dr aldainis favorite part of the museum for who knew what might be discovered here what unsuspected treasures might be revealed so far in truth he had found few indeed and the trove of uncataloged items remained as great as it ever had for with every shard of pottery every fragment of a statue that was formally added to the museums records ten more seemed to arrive and so as the body of what was known became greater so too did the mass of the unknown a lesser man might have regarded it as a fruitless task but dr aldaini was a romantic when it came to knowledge and the thought that the store of what remained to be discovered was forever increasing filled him with joy now flashlight in hand the soldier patchett behind him with another light draldaini passed through the canyons of the archives his key redundant for the door had been smashed open the basement was stiflingly hot and there was a sharp smell in the air left by the burning foam that the looters had used as torches since the electricity had stopped working before the invasion but dr aldaini barely noticed his attention was fixed on one spot and one spot only the looters had made their mark here too overturning shelves scattering the contents of boxes and crates even burning records but they must have realized quickly that there was little worthy of their attentions and so the damage was less yet some items had clearly been taken and as dr aldaini moved deeper into the basement so his anxiety increased until at last he came to the place that he had sought and stared at the empty space on the shelf before him he almost gave up then but there was still some hope something is missing he told patchett i beg of you help me to find it what are we looking for a lead box not very big dr aldaini held his hands about two feet apart plain with a simple clasp and a small lock and so together they searched the unlocked areas of the basement as best they could and when patchett was recalled by his squad leader dr aldaini continued to look all that day and into the night but there was no sign of the lead box if one wants to hide an item of great value surrounding it with the worthless is a good way to do so better yet if one can swathe it in the poorest of garbs disguising it so well that it can remain in plain sight and yet not attract even the slightest of glances one might even catalog it as that which it is not in this case a lead casket persian sixteenth century containing a slightly smaller unremarkable sealed box apparently made of iron painted red date unknown provenance unknown value minimal contents none all lies especially the last for if one got close enough to that box within a box one might almost have thought that something inside it was speaking no not speaking whispering cape elizabeth maine may the dog heard the call and came warily to the top of the stairs she had been sleeping on one of the beds which she knew that she was not supposed to do she listened but picked up on nothing in the voice to suggest that she might be in trouble when the call came again and she heard the sound of her leash jangling she took the stairs two at a time almost falling over her own legs with excitement when she reached the bottom damien patchett calmed the dog by raising his finger and attached the leash to her collar although it was warm outside he wore a green combat jacket the dog sniffed at one of the pockets recognizing a familiar scent but damien shooed her away his father was over at the diner and the house was quiet the sun was about to set and as damien walked the dog through the woods toward the sea the light began to change the sky bleeding red and gold behind him the dog bit at the leash unused to being restricted in this way usually she was given free roam on her walks and she indicated her displeasure by tugging hard she was not even allowed to stop and sniff scents and when she tried to urinate she was dragged along causing her to yelp unhappily there was a nest of baldfaced hornets in a birch tree nearby a gray construct now quiet but in the daytime a buzzing mass of aggression the dog had been stung earlier in the week when she went to investigate the trees sap lick where a yellowbellied sapsucker had cleared the bark to feed leaving a useful source of sweetness for assorted insects birds and squirrels she began to whine as they drew close to the birch recalling her pain and desirous of giving its source a wide berth but he calmed her by patting her and changing direction easing her away from the site of her mishap as a boy damien had been fascinated by bees and wasps and hornets this colony had formed in the spring when the queen roused from months of sleep after mating the previous fall began to mix wood fiber with saliva creating a pole of paper pulp to which she gradually added the hexagonal cells for her young first the females from the fertilized eggs then the males from her virgin eggs he had kept track of each stage of its development just as he used to do when he was a boy it was the aspect of female rule that he had always found most interesting for he came from an oldfashioned family where the men made the decisions or so he had always believed until as he grew older he began to recognize the infinite subtle ways in which his mother and his grandmothers and various aunts and cousins had manipulated the males to their satisfaction here in this gray nest the queen could be more open in her government giving birth creating defenders of the hive feeding and being fed even keeping her young warm by her own shivers the warm air created by the actions of her body becoming trapped in a bellshaped chamber of her own creation he stared back at the shape of the nest almost invisible among the leaves as though reluctant now to leave it his sharp eyes picked out spider webs and ants nests and a green caterpillar scaling a bloodroot and each creature gave him pause and each sight he seemed to store away they could smell the sea when damien stopped had anyone been there to see him it would have been clear that he was weeping his face was contorted and his shoulders convulsed with the force of his sobs he looked around right and left as if expecting to glimpse presences moving between the trees but there were only birdsong and the sound of waves breaking the dogs name was sandy she was a mutt but more retriever than anything else she was now ten years old and she was as much damiens dog as his fathers despite the sons long absences loving both equally just as they loved her she could not understand her younger masters behavior for he was tolerant of her in ways that even his father was not she wagged her tail uncertainly as he squatted beside her and tied her leash to the trunk of a sapling then he stood and removed the revolver from his pocket it was a special a smith wesson model he had bought it from a dealer who claimed that it had come from a vietnam vet who was down on his luck but whom damien subsequently discovered had sold it to feed the cocaine habit that had eventually claimed his life damien put his hands to his ears the gun in his right hand now pointing to the sky he shook his head and squeezed his eyes shut please please stop he said im begging you please his mouth curled down snot running from his nose as he removed his hands from his head and trembling pointed the gun at the dog it was inches from her muzzle she leaned forward and sniffed it she was used to the smell of oil and powder for damien and his father had often taken her to hunt birds with them and she would bring them back in her jaws she wagged her tail expectantly anticipating the game no said damien no dont make me do it please dont his finger tightened on the trigger his whole arm was shaking with a great effort of will he turned the gun away from the dog and screamed at the sea and the air and the setting sun he gritted his teeth and freed the dog from her leash go he shouted at her go home sandy go home the dogs tail went between her legs but it was still wagging slightly she didnt want to leave she sensed that something was very wrong then damien ran at her aiming a kick at her behind but pulling it at the last minute so that it made no contact now the dog fled retreating toward the house she paused while damien was still in sight of her but he came at her again and this time she kept going stopping only when she heard the gunshot she cocked her head then slowly began to retrace her steps anxious to see what her master had brought down i i fought singlehanded yet against such men no one could do battle homer the odyssey book i summer had come the season of awakenings this state this northern place was not like its southern kin here spring was an illusion a promise made yet always unkept a pretence of new life bound by blackened snow and slowmelting ice nature had learned to bide its time by the beaches and the bogs in the great north woods of the county and the salt marshes of scarborough let winter hold sway in february and march beating its slow retreat to the fortyninth parallel refusing to concede even an inch of ground without a fight as april approached the willows and poplars the hazel and the elms had budded amid birdsong they had been waiting since the fall their flowers shrouded yet ready and soon the bogs were carpeted in the purplebrown of alders chipmunks and beavers were on the move the skies bloomed with woodcock and geese and grackle scattering themselves like seeds upon fields of blue now may had brought summer at last and all things were awake all things sunlight splashed itself upon the window warming my back with its heat and fresh coffee was poured into my cup a bad business said kyle quinn kyle a neat compact man in pristine whites was the owner of the palace diner in biddeford he was also the chef and he happened to be the cleanest diner chef id ever seen in my life id eaten in diners where the eventual sight of the chef had made me consider undertaking a course of antibiotics but kyle was so nicely turned out and his kitchen so spotless that there were icus with poorer hygiene than the palace and surgeons with dirtier hands than kyles the palace was the oldest diner car in maine custombuilt by the pollard company of lowell massachusetts its red and white paintwork still fresh and spruce and the gold lettering on the window that confirmed ladies were indeed invited glowed brightly as if written in fire the diner had opened for business in and since then five people had owned it of whom kyle was the latest it served only breakfast and closed before midday and was one of those small treasures that made daily life a little more bearable yeah i said bad in the worst way the portland pressherald was spread before me over the counter of the diner at the bottom of the front page beneath the fold the headline read no leads in slaying of state trooper the trooper in question foster jandreau had been found shot to death in his truck behind the former blue moon bar just inside the saco town line he hadnt been on duty at the time and was dressed in civilian clothes when his body was discovered what he was doing at the blue moon nobody knew especially since the autopsy revealed that hed been killed sometime after midnight but before am when nobody had any business hanging around the burntout shell of an unloved bar jandreaus remains were found by a road crew that had pulled into the moons parking lot for some coffee and an early morning smoke before commencing the days work he had been shot twice at close range with a once in the heart and once in the head it bore all of the hallmarks of an execution that place was always a magnet for trouble said kyle they should have just razed what was left of it after it burnt yeah but what would they have put there instead a tombstone said kyle a tombstone with sally cleavers name on it he walked away to pour coffee for the rest of the stragglers most of whom were reading or talking quietly among themselves seated in a line like characters in a norman rockwell painting there were no booths at the palace and no tables just fifteen stools i occupied the last stool the one farthest from the door it was after am and technically the diner was now closed but kyle wouldnt be moving folk along anytime soon it was that kind of place sally cleaver her name had been mentioned in the reporting of jandreaus murder a little piece of local history that most people might have preferred to forget and the final nail in the blue moons coffin as it were after her death the bar was boarded up and a couple of months later it was torched the owner was questioned about possible arson and insurance fraud but it was just a matter of routine the birds in the trees knew that the cleaver family had put the match to the blue moon bar and nobody uttered a word of blame for it the bar had now been closed for nearly a decade a cause of grief for precisely no one not even the rummies who used to frequent it locals always referred to it as the blue mood as nobody ever came out of it feeling better than they had when they went in even if they hadnt eaten the food or drunk anything that they hadnt seen unsealed in front of them it was a grim place a brick fortress topped with a painted sign illuminated by four bulbs no more than three of which were ever working at any one time inside the lights were kept dim to hide the filth and all of the stools at the bar were screwed to the floor to provide some stability for the drunks it had a menu right out of the chronic obesity school of cooking but most of its clientele preferred to fill themselves up on the free beer nuts salted to within an inch of a stroke in order to encourage the consumption of alcohol at the end of the evening the uneaten but heavily pawed nuts that remained were poured back into the big sack that earle hanley the bartender kept beside the sink earle was the only bartender if he was sick or had something else more important to do than pickle drunks the blue moon didnt open sometimes if you watched the clientele arriving for their daily fill it was hard to tell if they were relieved or unhappy to find the door occasionally bolted and then sally cleaver died and the moon died with her there was no mystery about her death she was twentythree and living with a deadbeat named clifton andreas cliffie to his buddies it seemed that sally had been putting a little money aside each week from her job as a waitress perhaps in the hope of saving enough to have cliffie andreas killed or to convince earle hanley to spike his beer nuts with rat poison i was familiar with cliffie andreas as a face around town one that it was sensible to avoid cliffie andreas never met a puppy that he didnt want to drown or a bug that he didnt want to crush any work that he picked up was seasonal but cliffie was never likely to qualify for employee of the month work was something that he did when there was no money left and he viewed it entirely as a last resort if borrowing theft or simply leeching off someone weaker and more needy than himself werent available options he had a superficial bad boy charm for the kind of woman who assumed a public pose of regarding good men as weak even as she secretly dreamed of a regular joe who wasnt mired in the mud at the bottom of the pond and determined to drag someone else down there with him i didnt know sally cleaver apparently she had low selfesteem and lower expectations but somehow cliffie andreas succeeded in reducing the former still further and failed to live up even to the latter anyway one evening cliffie found sallys small hardearned stash and decided to treat himself and his buddies to a free night at the moon sally came home from work found her money gone and went looking for cliffie at his favorite haunt she found him holding court at the bar drinking on her dime the moons only bottle of cognac and she decided to stand up for herself for the first and last time in her life she screamed at him scratched him tore at his hair until at last earle hanley told cliffie to take his woman and his domestic problems outside and not to come back until he had both under control so cliffie andreas had grabbed sally cleaver by the collar and pulled her through the back door and the men at the bar had listened while he pounded her into the ground when he came back inside his knuckles were raw his hands were stained red and his face was flecked with freckles of blood earle hanley poured him another drink and slipped outside to check on sally cleaver by then she was already choking on her own blood and she died on the back lot before the ambulance could get to her and that was it for the blue moon and for cliffie andreas he pulled ten to fifteen in thomaston served eight then was killed less than two months after his release by an unknown assailant who stole cliffies watch left his wallet untouched then discarded the watch in a nearby ditch it was whispered that the cleavers had long memories now foster jandreau had died barely yards from the spot on which sally cleaver had choked to death and the ashes of the moons history were being raked through once again meanwhile the state police didnt like losing troopers hadnt liked it since right back in when emery gooch was killed in a motorcycle accident in mattawamkeag nor since when charlie black became the first trooper killed by gunfire while responding to a bank raid in south berwick but there were shadows around jandreaus killing the paper might have claimed that there were no leads but the rumors said otherwise crack vials had been found on the ground by jandreaus car and fragments of the same glass were discovered on the floor by his feet he had no drugs in his system but there were now concerns on the force that foster jandreau might have been dealing on the side and that would be bad for everyone slowly the diner began to empty but i stayed where i was until i was the only one remaining at the counter kyle left me to myself making sure that my cup was full before he started cleaning up the last of the regulars mostly older men for whom the week wasnt the same without a couple of visits to the palace paid their checks and left ive never had an office i never had any use for one and if i had i probably couldnt have justified the expense of it to myself even given a favorable rent in portland or scarborough only a handful of clients had ever commented upon it and on those occasions when a particular need for privacy and discretion had arisen id been in a position to call in favors and a suitable room had been provided occasionally i used the offices of my attorney up in freeport but there were people who disliked the idea of going into a lawyers office almost as much as they disliked the idea of lawyers in general and id found that most of those who came to me for help preferred a more informal approach usually i went to them and spoke with them in their own homes but sometimes a diner like the palace empty and discreet was as good as anywhere in this case the venue for the meeting had been decided by the prospective client not by me and i was fine with it shortly after midday the palaces door opened and a man in his late sixties entered he looked like a model for the stereotypical old yankee feed cap on his head an ll bean jacket over a plaid shirt neat blue denims and work boots on his feet he was wiry as a tension cable his face weathered and lined light brown eyes glittering behind surprisingly fashionable steelframed spectacles he greeted kyle by name then removed his hat and gave a courtly little bow to tara kyles daughter who was cleaning up behind the counter and who smiled and greeted him in turn good to see you mr patchett she said its been a while there was a tenderness to her voice and a brightness to her eyes that said all that needed to be said about the new arrivals recent sufferings kyle leaned through the serving hatch between the kitchen and the counter area come to check out a real diner bennett he said you look like you could do with some feeding up bennett patchett chuckled and swatted at the air with his right hand as though kyles words were insects buzzing at his head then took a seat beside me patchett had owned the downs diner close to the scarborough downs racetrack on route for more than forty years his father had run it before him opening it shortly after he returned from service in europe there were still pictures of patchett senior on the walls of the diner some of them from his military days surrounded by younger men who looked up to him as their sergeant hed died when he was still in his forties and his son had eventually taken over the running of the business bennett had now lived longer than his own father just as it seemed that i was destined to live longer than mine he accepted the offer of a cup of coffee from tara as he shrugged off his coat and hung it close to the old gas fire tara discreetly went to help her father in the kitchen so that bennett and i were left alone charlie he said shaking my hand how you doing mr patchett i asked it felt odd to be calling him by his last name it made me feel about ten years old but when it came to such men you waited until they gave you permission to be a little more familiar in your mode of address i knew that all of his staff called him mr patchett he might have been like a father figure to some of them but he was their boss and they treated him with the respect that he deserved you can call me bennett son the less formal this is the better i dont think ive ever spoken with a private detective before except you and that was only when you were eating in my place only ever saw them on tv and in the movies and truth to tell your reputation makes me a little nervous he peered at me and i saw his eye linger briefly at the scar on my neck a bullet had grazed me there the previous year deep enough to leave a permanent mark in recent times i seemed to have accumulated a lot of similar nicks and scratches when i died they could put me in a display case as an example to others who might be tempted to follow a similar path of beatings gunshot wounds and electrocution then again i might just have been unlucky or lucky it depended upon how you looked at the glass dont believe everything you hear i said i dont and you still concern me i shrugged he had a sly smile on his face but no point in hemmin and hawin he continued i want to thank you for taking the time to meet with me i know that youre probably a busy man i wasnt but it was nice of him to suggest that i might be since my license had been restored to me earlier in the year following some misunderstandings with the maine state police things had been kind of quiet id done a little insurance work all of it dull and most of it involving nothing more strenuous than sitting in a car and turning the pages of a book while i waited for some doofus with alleged workplace injuries to start lifting heavy stones in his yard but insurance work was thin on the ground what with the economy being the way it was most private detectives in the state were struggling and i had been forced to accept any work that came along including the kind that made me want to bathe in bleach when i was done id followed a man named harry milner while he serviced three separate women in the course of one week in various motels and apartments as well as holding down a regular job and taking his kids to baseball practice his wife had suspected that he was having an affair but unsurprisingly she was a little shocked to hear that her husband was engaged in the type of extensive sexual entanglements usually associated with french farces his time management skills were almost admirable though as were his energy levels milner was only a couple of years older than i was and if id been trying to keep four women satisfied every week id have incurred a coronary probably while i was soaking myself in a bath of ice to keep the swelling down nevertheless that was still the best paying job id had in a while and i was back doing a couple of days a month tending bar at the great lost bear on forest avenue as much to pass the time as anything else im not as busy as you might think i replied then youll have time to hear me out i guess i nodded then said before we go any further id just like to say that i was sorry to hear about damien i hadnt known damien patchett any better than i knew his father and i hadnt made any effort to attend the funeral the newspapers had been discreet about it but everybody knew how damien patchett had died it was the war some whispered he had taken his own life in name only iraq had killed him bennetts face creased with pain thank you in a way as you might have figured its why were here i feel kind of funny approaching you about this you know you doing the things that you do compared to them fellas who killed and got hunted down by you what ive got to offer might seem pretty dull i was tempted to tell him about waiting outside motel rooms while people inside engaged in illicit sexual congress or sitting for hours in a car with a camera on the dashboard in the hope that someone might bend down suddenly sometimes the dull stuff makes a pleasant change ayuh said patchett i can believe that his eyes shifted to the newspaper before me and he winced again sally cleaver i thought damn i should have put the newspaper away before bennett arrived sally cleaver had been working at the downs diner when she died he sipped his coffee and didnt speak again for at least three minutes people like bennett patchett didnt reach their later years in pretty much perfect health by rushing things they worked on maine time and the sooner that everyone who had to deal with them learned to adjust their clocks accordingly the better i got a girl waitressing for me he said at last shes a good kid i think you might remember her mother woman name of katie emory katie emory had been at scarborough high school with me although wed moved in different circles she was the sort of girl who liked jocks and i wasnt much for jocks or the girls who hung with them when i returned to scarborough as a teenage boy after my fathers death i wasnt much in the mood for hanging with anyone and i kept myself to myself the local kids had all formed longestablished cliques and it was hard to break into them even if you wanted to i made some friends eventually and for the most part i didnt cross too many people i remembered katie but i doubt if she would have remembered me not in the normal course of events but my name had made the papers over the years and maybe she and others like her read it and remembered the boy who had arrived in scarborough for the last two years of his schooling trailing stories about a father who was a cop a cop who had killed two kids before taking his own life hows she doing she lives up along the airline somewhere the airline was the local name for route which ran between brewer and calais third marriage shacked up with a musician really i didnt know her that well good for you could have been you shacked up with her theres a thought she was a goodlooking girl still not such a badlooking woman now i suppose said bennett a little thicker around the trunk than you might recall but you can see what she was can see it in the daughter too whats the daughters name karen karen emory only child of her mothers first marriage and born after the father took to his heels so she has her mothers name only child of any of her marriages come to think on it shes been working for me for over a year now like i said a good kid shes got her troubles but i think shell come through them all right long as shes given the help that she needs and shes got the sense to ask for it bennett patchett was an unusual man he and his wife hazel who had died a couple of years ago had always viewed those who worked for them not simply as staff but as part of a kind of extended family they had a particular fondness for the women who passed through the downs some of whom stayed for many years others for only a matter of months bennett and hazel had a special sense for girls who were in trouble or who needed a little stability in their lives they didnt pry and they didnt preach but they listened when they were approached and they helped when they could the patchetts owned a couple of buildings around saco and scarborough and these they had converted into cheap lodgings for their own staff and for the staff of a select number of other established businesses run by people of a similar outlook to themselves the apartments werent mixed so that women and men were required to stay with their own sex some occasional meetings of the twain did inevitably occur but less often than one might have thought for the most part those who took up the patchetts offer of a place to stay were happy with the space not just physical but psychological and emotional that it offered them the majority moved on eventually some getting their lives back together and some not but while they worked for the patchetts they were looked out for both by the couple themselves and by the older members of staff sally cleavers death had been a grave blow but if anything it had made them more solicitous toward their charges while bennett had taken his wifes death hard the loss of her had not changed his attitude toward his staff one iota anyway they were now all that he had left and he saw sally cleaver in the face of every one of those women and perhaps he had already begun to see damien in the young men karens fallen in with a man one i dont much care for said bennett she was living in one of the staff houses just up on gorham road she and damien they got on well together i thought he might have had a crush on her but she only had eyes for this friend of his a buddy from iraq by the name of joel tobias used to be damiens squad leader after damien died or it could have happened even before he died karen and tobias hooked up i hear that tobias is troubled by some of what he saw over in iraq he had friends die on him and i mean literally they bled to death in his arms he wakes up in the night screaming and sweating she thinks that she can help him she told you this no i heard it from one of the other waitresses karen wouldnt tell me that kind of thing i suppose she prefers to talk to other women about these matters thats all and she knows that i didnt approve of her moving in with tobias so soon after theyd met maybe im oldfashioned that way but i felt that she should wait told her so too they hadnt been together more than a couple of weeks at that point and well i asked her if she didnt feel that she was rushing things a bit but shes a young girl and she thinks she knows her own mind and i wasnt about to interfere she wanted to keep working for me and that was just fine weve been hurting a bit lately same as everywhere but i dont need to make more from the place than lets me pay my bills and i can still do that with money to spare i dont need more staff and i guess it might be said that i dont need all of the ones ive got but they need the work and it does an old man good to have young people around him he finished his coffee and looked longingly at the pot on the other side of the counter as if by telepathy kyle looked up from where he was cleaning the prep station and said go get that pot if you want some itll go to waste otherwise bennett walked around to the other side of the counter and poured us both a little more coffee when he had done so he remained standing staring out of the window at the old courthouse thinking on what he would say next tobias is older than her midthirties too old and too screwed up for a girl like her got himself wounded over in iraq lost some fingers and damaged his left leg he drives a truck now hes an independent contractor or thats what he calls himself but he seems to work pretty casually he always had time to hang out with damien and hes always around karen more than someone whos supposed to be on the road earning a living should be like money isnt a worry for him bennett opened some creamer and added it to his coffee there was another pause i didnt doubt that hed spent a lot of time considering what he was going to say but i could tell that he was still cautious about speaking all of it aloud you know i got nothing but respect for the military couldnt help but have man my father was my eyesight hadnt been so bad id probably have gone to vietnam and it might be that we wouldnt be having this conversation now maybe i wouldnt be here but buried under a white stone somewhere whatever id be a different man or even a better one i dont know the rights and wrongs of that war in iraq seems to me to be a long way to go for no good cause that i can see with a lot of lives lost but it could be that wiser minds than mine know something that i dont worse than that though they didnt look after those men and women who came back not the way they should have my father he returned from world war two wounded but he just didnt know it he was damaged inside by some of the things that hed seen and done but the damage didnt have the same medical name then or people just didnt understand how bad it could be when joel tobias came into the downs i could tell that he was damaged too and not just in his hand and his leg he was hurting inside as well all torn up with anger i could smell it on him could see it in his eyes didnt need anyone to tell me about it dont misunderstand me he has as much of a right to be happy as anyone maybe even more so because of the sacrifices that hes made the hurt hes going through mental or physical doesnt deny him that right and it could be that in the normal run of events someone like karen might be good for him shes been hurt too i dont know how but its there and it makes her sensitive to others like herself a good man could be healed by that once he doesnt exploit it but i dont think joel tobias is a good man thats what it comes down to hes wrong for her and hes just plain wrong with it how can you tell i asked i cant he said and i could hear the frustration in his voice not for sure its a gut feeling though and something more than that he drives his own rig and it looks as new as a baby in the nurses arms hes got a big silverado and thats new too he lives in a pretty nice house in portland and hes got money he throws it around some more than he should i dont like it i waited i had to be careful with what i said next i didnt want to sound like i was doubting bennett but at the same time i knew that he could be overprotective of the young people in his charge he was still trying to make up for failing to protect sally cleaver even though he could not have prevented what befell her and it was not his fault you know all of that could be on credit i said until recently theyd let you pay a nickel down to see you drive a new truck off the lot he may have received compensation for his injuries you just shes changed said bennett he said it so softly that i might almost have missed it yet the intensity with which he spoke meant that it couldnt be ignored hes changed too i can see it when he comes for her he looks sick like hes not sleeping right even worse than he was before lately ive started to see it in her too she burnt herself a couple of days back tried to catch a coffeepot that was falling and ended up getting hot coffee on her hand it was carelessness on her part but the carelessness that comes from being tired shes lost some weight and she was never carrying much to start off with and i think hes raised a hand to her i saw bruising on her face she told me that shed walked into a door like anyone believes that old story anymore you try speaking to her about it tried but she got real defensive like i said before i dont think she likes talking to men about personal matters i didnt want to pursue it further not then for fear that id drive her away entirely but im worried for her what do you want me to do you still know them fulci fellas maybe you could get them to beat on tobias some tell him to find someone else to share his bed he said it with a sad smile but i could tell that there was a part of him that would really have liked to see the fulcis who were essentially weapons of war with appetites unleashed on a man who could hit a woman doesnt work i said either the woman starts to feel sorry for the guy or the guy figures the woman has been talking to someone and it gets worse well it was a nice thought while it lasted he said if thats not an option id like you to look into tobias see what you can find out about him i just need something that might convince karen to put some distance between her and him i can do it but theres a chance that she wont thank you for it ill take that chance do you want to know my rates are you going to screw me over no then i figure youre worth what you ask for he put an envelope on the counter theres two thousand dollars down how much is that good for long enough if i need more ill get back to you if i spend less ill refund you youll tell me what you find out i will but what if i discover that hes clean hes not said bennett firmly no man who hits a woman can call himself clean i touched the envelope with my fingertips i felt the urge to hand it back to him instead i pointed at the jandreau story old ghosts i said old ghosts he agreed i go out there sometimes you know couldnt tell you why unless its that i hope ill be pulled back in time so i can save her mostly i just say a prayer for her as i pass by they ought to scour that place from the earth did you know foster jandreau he came in sometimes they all do state troopers local cops we look after them oh they pay their check like anyone else but we make sure that they dont leave hungry i knew foster some though his cousin bobby jandreau served with damien in iraq bobby lost his legs hell of a thing i waited before speaking again there was something missing here you said that this meeting was about damiens death in a way the only connection is karen emory bennett looked troubled any mention of his son must have been painful for him but there was more to it than that tobias came back troubled from that war but my son didnt i mean hed seen bad things and there were days when i could tell he was remembering some of them but he was still the son i knew he told me over and over that hed had a good war if such a thing is possible he didnt kill anyone who wasnt trying to kill him and he had no hatred for the iraqi people he just felt sorry for what they were going through and he tried to do his best by them he lost some buddies over there but he wasnt haunted by what hed been through not at first that all came later i dont know much about posttraumatic stress i said but from what ive read it can take some time to kick in there is that said bennett ive read about it too i was reading about it before damien died thinking that i might be able to help him if i understood better what he was going through but you see damien liked the army i dont think he wanted to leave he served multiple tours and would have gone back again as it was all he talked about when he got back was reenlisting why didnt he because joel tobias wanted him here how do you know that from what damien said he took a couple of trips up to canada with tobias and i got the sense that they had something going on some deal that promised good money at the end of it damien began to talk about setting up his own business maybe moving into security if he didnt return to the army that was when the trouble started that was when damien began to change change how he stopped eating couldnt sleep and when he did manage to fall asleep id hear him crying out and shouting could you hear what he was saying sometimes hed be asking someone to leave him alone to stop talking no to stop whispering he became anxious and aggressive hed snap at me for nothing when he wasnt doing stuff for tobias he was somewhere by himself smoking staring into space i suggested that he ought to talk to someone about it but i dont know if he did he was back for three months when this all started and he was dead by his own hand two weeks later he patted my shoulder look into that tobias fella and well talk again with that he said his goodbyes to kyle and tara and left the diner i watched him walk slowly to his car a beatup subaru with a sea dogs sticker along the rear fender as he opened the car door he caught me watching him he nodded and raised a hand in farewell and i did likewise kyle came out from the kitchen im going to lock up now he said you all done thank you i said i paid the check and left a good tip both for the food and for kyles discretion there werent many diners in which two men could meet and discuss what bennett and i had discussed without fear of eavesdropping hes a good man said kyle as bennetts car turned out of the lot yes he is on the way back to scarborough i took a detour to drive by the blue moon yellow police tape flapped in the breeze from a downpipe bright against the blackened shell of the bar the windows remained boarded up the steel door secured with a heavy bolt but there was a hole in the roof where the flames had burst through all those years ago and if you got close enough it smelled of damp and even now charred wood kyle and bennett were right it should have been demolished but still it remained like a dark cancer cell against the red clover of the field that stretched behind it i pulled away the ruin of the blue moon receding in my rearview until at last i left it behind yet it seemed something of it remained on the mirror like a smudge left by a blackened finger a reminder from the dead of what the living still owe to them i thought about what bennett patchett had said when i returned to my house in scarborough and sat down at my desk to make notes on our conversation if joel tobias was beating his girlfriend then he deserved to experience some grief of his own but i wondered if bennett knew what he was getting himself into even if i found something that he could use against tobias i didnt believe it would have much impact on the relationship not unless what i found was so terrible that any woman who wasnt clinically insane would instantly pack her bags and head for the hills i had also tried to warn him that karen emory might not thank him for getting involved in her personal affairs even if tobias was being violent toward her still if that had been bennetts sole reason for becoming involved in his employees business his motives would have been sound and i could have afforded to give him a little of my time after all he was paying for it the problem was that karen emorys wellbeing was not the sole reason for his approach to me in fact it was a dupe a means of opening a separate but linked investigation into the death of his son damien it was clear that bennett believed joel tobias bore some responsibility for the change in damien patchetts behavior a change that had led finally to his selfdestruction ultimately all investigations instigated by individuals and conducted outside the corporate or law enforcement spheres are personal but some are more personal than others bennett wanted someone to answer for his sons death in the absence of his son being able to answer for it himself some fathers in a similar situation might have directed their anger at the military for failing to recognize the torments of a returning soldier or at the failings of psychiatrists but according to bennett his son had returned from the war relatively unscathed that claim in itself warranted further investigation but for now joel tobias was in bennetts eyes as much a suspect in damien patchetts death as if he had steadied damiens hand as the trigger was pulled bennett was a curious man while he might have had a soft center the exterior was like a crocodiles plated carapace bennett was solid now but he had served time as a young man he had fallen in with a group of guys out of auburn who had taken down gas stations and grocery stores before progressing to the big time and a raid on the farmers first bank in augusta during which a weapon was waved and shots were fired albeit blanks it hadnt netted them a whole lot about two thousand dollars plus change and soon the cops had informally identified at least one of the members of the gang he was hauled in sweated for a while and finally rolled over on the rest of his accomplices in return for a reduced sentence bennett who had been the wheelman was facing ten years and served five he was no career criminal five years in thomaston a fortress prison from the nineteenth century still bearing the mark of its old gallows as assuredly as if it had been burnt into the earth had convinced him of the error of his ways he had returned to his fathers business with his tail between his legs and hed kept out of trouble ever since that didnt mean that he had any great fondness for the law and being ratted out by someone in the past meant that bennett wasnt about to rat out anyone else in turn he may not have cared much for joel tobias but hiring me instead of going to the cops was a very bennettian compromise i thought as was asking me to investigate one man in the hope that it might reveal the truth behind the death of another nothing is secret anymore with a little ingenuity and a little cash you can find out a great deal about people that they might have believed or have preferred to remain confidential and protected its even easier when youre a licensed private investigator within an hour i had joel tobiass credit history laid out on my desk there were no outstanding warrants against him and from what i could see he had never been in trouble with the police since he had been invalided out of the military just over a year earlier he seemed to have worked hard paid his bills and led what to all appearances was a regular blue collar existence one of my grandfathers favorite words was hinky milk that was just about to go off might taste a little hinky a tiny almost inaudible noise in his car engine might lead to suspicions of undiagnosed hinkiness in the carburetor for him something that was hinky was more troubling than something that was outright wrong simply because the nature of the flaw was undefined he would know that it was there but he would not be able to tackle it because its true face had not yet revealed itself what was wrong could either be dealt with or lived with but what was hinky would come between him and his sleep joel tobiass affairs were hinky his rig with a sleeper had cost him eightyfive thousand dollars when hed bought it despite what bennett had said it wasnt quite new when he picked it up but it was as good as at the same time hed also purchased a dry van or box trailer for another ten thousand hed put five percent down and was paying off the rest monthly at a rate of interest that wasnt excessive and might even have been considered pretty favorable but he was still eating about twentyfive hundred dollars a month in payments in addition that same month hed bought himself a new chevy silverado hed negotiated himself a pretty good deal on it eighteen thousand dollars which was six thousand off the regular dealer price and he was paying that loan off at dollars a month finally the payments on the mortgage on his house in portland just off forest and not far from the great lost bear as it happened came to another thousand a month the house had been his uncles and had already fallen into arrears when it was left to joel in his uncles will taken together it all meant that tobias needed to be taking in almost five thousand dollars each month just to keep his head above water and that was before he paid for insurance medical coverage gas for his chevy food heating beer and whatever else he needed to make his life comfortable add in conservatively another thousand dollars per month for all that and tobiass annual earnings would have to be in the region of seventy thousand dollars after taxes it wasnt completely unattainable given that as an owneroperator tobias could expect to earn about ninety cents per mile plus fuel but hed be working long hours to do it and would need to put in the miles in addition he was probably receiving compensation for his injured hand and maybe for his leg as well at a guess he was pulling down somewhere between five hundred and twelve hundred dollars tax free each month for his injuries which would help some with his bills but would still leave him with a lot of cash to earn on the road his credit rating remained steady he hadnt defaulted on any of his loans and he was paying contributions into his ira but according to bennett or the impression he had gained tobias wasnt working all the hours god had given him in fact tobias didnt seem to have many financial worries at all which suggested that there was money coming in from somewhere other than what he earned by driving or received in comp that or he had money stored away and was subsidizing his business from his savings which meant that he wouldnt be in business for very long so there it was joel tobias was hinky there was cash coming from elsewhere it was just a matter of establishing the source of that additional income and something that bennett had told me meant that i could hazard an educated guess at that source bennett had said that tobias traveled back and forth between maine and canada canada meant a border crossing and a border meant smuggling and when it came to the border between canada and maine that meant drugs according to an article in the new york times to check smuggling along the maine and canada line would require a small army so wild is the greater part of the territory and so great and varied the opportunities the article in question was written in and it was as true now as it was then in the late nineteenth century what worried the authorities most was the loss of customs revenue from liquor fish cattle and produce being smuggled over the border but drugs were also becoming an issue with opium being brought into new brunswick in bond and from there transported into the united states via maine the state had four hundred miles of land border with canada most of it wilderness as well as three thousand miles of seacoast and about fourteen hundred small islands it was then and still is a smugglers paradise in the s as the dea began focusing increasingly on the southern border with mexico new england became an attractive option for pot smugglers especially as there was a ready market for it among the students in its colleges it was simply a matter of buying a boat hitting jamaica or colombia and then running an established route that allowed a ton each to be dropped off in florida the carolinas rhode island and finally maine since then the mexicans had established a presence here along with assorted south americans bikers and anyone else who figured he was hard enough to capture a share of the narcotics market and hold on to it i sat back in my chair and stared out of my window at the salt marshes and the seabirds scudding across their waters to the south a thin column of dark smoke raised itself to the sky before slowly dissipating in the still air leaving a faint trace of pollution to mar the otherwise faultless blue of the gently closing day i called bennett patchett and he confirmed that karen emory was working her shift was due to finish at pm and as far as bennett knew joel tobias would be coming by to pick her up he often did when he wasnt out on the road karen had told bennett after he had asked if she could work a little late that evening that she couldnt because she and joel were going out for dinner she said that joel had a bunch of canadian runs lined up over the coming weeks and they were unlikely to have much time together as a result so with nothing better to do i decided to take a look at joel tobias and his girlfriend the downs was a pretty big place capable of taking a hundred covers or more assuming the kitchen was fully staffed and the waitresses were prepared to sweat hard for their tips large glass windows looked down on route and the parking lot of the big bowling alley on the other side of the road a single counter ran almost the entire length of the room taking a dogleg to the north and south to form a kind of elongated u the walls were lined with fourseater booths with another bank of fourseaters creating an island of vinyl and formica in the center of the restaurant the waitresses wore blue tshirts with the name of the restaurant on the back beneath which was an illustration of three horses straining for a finishing post each waitress had her name stitched into the fabric above her left breast i didnt go inside but waited in the parking lot i could see karen emory depositing checks on her tables in preparation for the end of her shift bennett had described her to me and she was the only blonde working that evening she was pretty and tiny perhaps only five feet tall and slimly built for the most part given that even from a distance her tshirt looked like it was at least a size too small for her around the bust guys probably came to the downs just to dribble egg on their chin as they gazed upon the stretched material at pm a black silverado with smoked glass windows pulled into the lot twenty minutes later karen emory emerged wearing a short black dress and heels her hair loose on her shoulders and freshly applied makeup on her face she climbed into the silverado and it turned left on to route heading north i stayed behind it all the way to south portland where it pulled into the beale street barbecue on broadway karen got out first followed by joel tobias he was at least a foot taller than his girlfriend his dark hair a little long and already streaked with gray brushed back over his ears and away from his forehead he wore jeans and a blue denim shirt if there was any fat on him it was well hidden he walked with a slight limp favoring his right foot and kept his left hand tucked into front pocket of his jeans i gave them a couple of minutes then followed them inside they were sitting at one of the tables near the door so i took a seat at the bar and ordered a bottle of alcoholfree beer and some fries positioning myself so i could watch the tv and the table occupied by tobias and karen they seemed to be having a good time they got a couple of margaritas with beer on the side and shared a sampler plate there was a lot of smiling and laughing mostly on karen emorys part but it seemed kind of strained or that might have been bennett patchetts opinion coloring my own i tried to blot out all that he had said and just regard them as a couple of interesting strangers in a restaurant nope karen was still trying too hard an impression confirmed when tobias went to the mens room and karens smile gradually faded as she watched him walk away to be replaced by a look that was equal parts thoughtful and troubled i had just ordered another beer which i didnt plan to drink when joel tobias appeared at my elbow i didnt react when he squeezed in at the bar and asked the bartender for the check pointing out that the waitress appeared to be busy elsewhere he turned to me smiled said beg your pardon sir and returned to his girlfriend i caught a glimpse of his left hand as he walked away there were two fingers missing and the skin was scarred a minute or two later the waitress arrived picked up the check at the bar on the instructions of the bartender and brought it to their table a couple of minutes more and they had paid up and left i didnt follow them it had been enough to watch them together and tobiass appearance at my side had made me uneasy i hadnt seen him return from the mens room which meant that he must have gone outside through the side door and come back in by the main door maybe hed smoked a cigarette while he was out there but if so he was strictly a twodrag guy it was probably just a coincidence but i wasnt about to confirm any suspicions he might have had about my presence there by running out to the parking lot and taking after them with squealing tires i finished most of the beer that i hadnt wanted and watched some more of the game on the tv before settling up and leaving the bar the parking lot was almost empty the black silverado long gone it was not yet pm and there was still light in the sky i drove into portland to take a ride by joel tobiass place it was a small wellmaintained twostory the silverado was parked in the drive but there was no sign of tobiass big rig a light burned in an upstairs room visible through the partly closed drapes but as i watched it was extinguished and the house became entirely dark i waited for a moment or two longer regarding the house and thinking about the look of karen emorys face and the way that tobias had appeared at my elbow before i drove back to scarborough and my own quiet home there had been a woman and a child with me once and a dog but they were in vermont now i visited my daughter sam once or twice a month and sometimes she came to stay with me for a night if her mother rachel had business in boston rachel was seeing someone else and i felt awkward intruding upon her for that reason and sometimes resentful of her for doing so but i also kept my distance because i wanted no harm to come to them and harm followed me their places had been taken by the shadows of another woman and child no longer glimpsed but felt nonetheless like the lingering scent of flowers that have been discarded after the petals began to fall they had ceased to be a source of unease this departed wife and daughter they had been taken from me by a killer a man whose life i had taken in turn and in my guilt and rage i had allowed them to become transformed for a time into hostile vengeful presences but that was before now the sense of them consoled me for i knew that they had a part to play in whatever was to come when i opened the door the house was warm and filled with the smell of salt from the marshes i felt the emptiness of the shadows the disinterest of the silence and i slept softly and alone jeremiah webber had just poured a glass of wine to ease himself into the act of cooking his evening meal when the doorbell rang webber did not like his routines being interrupted and thursday evenings at his relatively modest home modest at least by the wealthy standards of new canaan connecticut were sacrosanct on thursday evenings he switched off his cell phone did not answer the land line and in truth his few friends aware of his quirks knew better than to disturb him mortality impending or actual being the only permissible excuse and most certainly did not respond to the ringing of the doorbell his kitchen was at the back of the house and he kept the door closed while he cooked so that only a thin horizontal shaft of light might possibly be visible through the glass of the front door a lamp burned in the living room and another in his bedroom upstairs but that was the sum total of the illumination in the house bill evans was playing at low volume on the kitchens sound system webber would sometimes spend the preceding days of the week planning precisely what music he would play while cooking and eating what wine would accompany his meal what dishes he would prepare these small indulgences helped to keep him sane on thursday evenings therefore those who knew that he was at home were unlikely to interrupt him and those who did not know for certain if he was there or not would be unable to confirm his presence or absence merely on the basis of the lights in the house even his most valued clients some of whom were wealthy men and women used to having their needs met at any hour of the day or night had come to accept that on thursday nights jeremiah webber would be unavailable his routine had already been thrown slightly on this particular thursday by a series of extended telephone conversations so that it had been after eight by the time he returned home and now it was nearly nine and he had still not eaten more so than usual he was in no mood for interruptions webber was an urbane darkhaired man in his early fifties good looking in what might have been considered a slightly effeminate way an impression enhanced by his fondness for spotted bow ties bright vests and a range of cultural interests including but not limited to ballet opera and modern interpretive dance it led casual acquaintances to assume that he might be homosexual but webber was not gay far from it in fact his hair had not yet begun to turn even slightly gray a genetic quirk that took ten years off his age and had enabled him to date women who were by any standards too young for him without attracting the form of disapproving if envious attention that such maydecember assignations frequently aroused his relative attractiveness to the opposite sex combined with a degree of personal generosity to those who found his favor had proved to be a mixed blessing it had brought two marriages to fraught ends only the first of which he actually regretted for he had loved his first wife if not quite enough the child of that marriage his daughter and only offspring had ensured that the lines of communication remained open between the estranged partners with the result that he believed his first wife now viewed him for the most part with a certain bemused affection the second marriage meanwhile was a mistake and one that he did not intend to make again now preferring casual to committed when it came to sex so he rarely wanted for female company even if he had paid a price for his appetites in broken marriages and the financial penalties that come hand in hand with such matters as a consequence webber had recently found himself with serious cash flow problems and had been forced to take steps to rectify the situation he was about to commence deboning the trout that lay upon a small granite slab when he heard the bell he wiped his fingers on his apron picked up the remote control unit and turned the volume down still further listening carefully he walked to the kitchen door and stared at the small video screen by the intercom there was a man standing on his doorstep he was wearing a dark fedora and his face was turned away from the camera lens but as webber watched the mans head moved as though he were somehow aware that he was under examination he kept his head lowered so that his eyes were hidden in shadow but from the brief glimpse of his face that he caught webber could tell that the man on the doorstep was a stranger to him there appeared to be a mark on the mans upper lip but perhaps that was simply a trick of the light the doorbell rang a second time and the man kept his finger on the button so that the twonote sequence repeated itself over and over what the hell said webber aloud his finger hit the intercom button yes who are you what do you want i want to talk said the man who i am doesnt matter but for whom i work should concern you his speech was slightly unclear as though he were holding something in his mouth and who is that i represent the gutelieb foundation webber released the intercom button his right index finger went to his mouth he chewed at the nail a habit of his since childhood an indication of distress the gutelieb foundation he had only engaged in a handful of transactions with it everything had been conducted through a third party a firm of lawyers in boston attempts to discover precisely what the gutelieb foundation might be and who might be responsible for deciding on its acquisitions had proved fruitless and he had begun to suspect that it did not exist as anything more than a piece of convenient nomenclature when he had persisted in his efforts he had received a letter from the lawyers advising him that the organization in question was very particular about its privacy and any further inquiries on webbers behalf would result in an immediate cessation of all business from the foundation as well as some appropriately placed whispers indicating that perhaps mr webber was not as discreet as some of his customers might wish him to be after that webber had backed off the gutelieb foundation real or a front had sourced some unusual and expensive items from him the tastes of those behind it appeared to be very particular and when webber had been able to satisfy those tastes he had been paid promptly and without question or negotiation but that last item he should have been more careful in his dealings more attentive about its provenance he told himself even as he understood that he was simply preparing the lies he might offer in exculpation to the man on his doorstep if it became necessary to do so he reached for his wine with his left hand but misjudged the movement the glass crashed to the floor splashing his slippers and the bottoms of his trousers swearing webber returned to the intercom the man was still there im rather busy at the moment he said surely this is something that can be discussed during normal hours one would have thought so came the reply but we seem to be having trouble getting your attention a number of messages have been left with your service and at your place of business if we did not know better we might have begun to believe that you are deliberately avoiding us but what is this about mr webber youre trying my patience just as you have tried the patience of the foundation webber gave in all right im coming he looked at the wine pooling on the blackandwhite tiled floor carefully avoiding the broken glass such a shame he thought as he discarded his apron he made his way to the front door pausing only to remove the gun from the hall stand and slip it into the back of his trousers beneath his cardigan the weapon was small and easily concealed he checked his reflection in the mirror just to be sure and opened the door the man on the doorstep was smaller than he expected and dressed in a dark blue suit that might at one point have been an expensive purchase but now looked dated although it had survived the intervening years with a degree of grace there was a blue and white spotted handkerchief in the breast pocket that matched the mans tie his head was still lowered but now it was part of the gesture of removing his hat for a moment webber had a strange vision of the hat coming off and taking the top of the visitors head with it like an egg that has been neatly broken permitting him to peer into the cavity of the skull instead there were only loose strands of white hair like tendrils of cotton candy and a domed head that came to a discernible point then the man looked up at him and instinctively webber took a small step back the face was quite pale the nostrils slim dark holes cut into the base of the narrow perfectly straight nose the skin around the eyes was wrinkled and bruised it spoke of illness and decay the eyes themselves were barely visible obscured as they were by folds of skin that had descended on them from the forehead like wax melting from an impure candle below the eyeballs red flesh was visible and webber thought that this individual must have been constantly irritated by grit and dust but then the man clearly had other distractions when it came to pain his upper lip was distorted reminding webber of those photographs in sunday newspapers of children with cleft palates that were used to elicit charitable donations except this was no cleft palate it was a wound an arrowhead incision into the skin exposing white teeth and discolored gums it was also grossly infected red raw and speckled in places with purple dots darkening to black webber thought that he could almost see the bacteria eating away at the flesh and wondered at how this man could bear the torment and what kind of drugs he would have to take just to allow him to sleep in fact how could he even bear to look at himself in a mirror and be reminded of his bodys betrayal and his own clearly imminent mortality his age was impossible to surmise because of his illness but webber put him at between fifty and sixty even allowing for the depredations he was suffering mr webber he said and despite his wound his voice was soft and pleasant let me introduce myself my name is herod he smiled and webber had to force his face to remain still and not register his disgust for he feared that the movement of the visitors facial muscles would tear the wound on his lip still further opening it to the septum i am often asked if i am fond of children i take the question in good spirit webber wasnt sure how to respond so he simply opened the door a little wider to admit the stranger his right hand moving almost casually to his waist and resting there within a hands reach of his gun as herod stepped into the house he nodded politely and glanced at webbers waist and webber felt sure that he knew of the gun and that it didnt bother him in the slightest herod looked toward the open kitchen and webber indicated that he should enter he saw that herod walked slowly but it was not a function of his illness herod was just a man who moved with deliberation once in the kitchen he laid his hat on the table and looked around smiling in benign approval of all that he saw only the music seemed to disturb him his forehead creasing slightly as he stared at the music system it sounds like no it is its faurés pavane he said i cant say that i approve of what is being done to it though webber gave an almost imperceptible shrug its bill evans he said who didnt like bill evans herod contrived a little moue of disgust ive never cared for such experimentation he said im afraid that i am a purist in most matters to each his own i guess said webber indeed indeed it would be a dull world if we all shared the same tastes still it is hard not to feel that some are better resisted than indulged do you mind if i sit down be my guest said webber with only a hint of unhappiness herod sat noting the wine and broken glass on the floor as he did so i hope i wasnt the cause of that he remarked my own carelessness ill clean it up later webber didnt want his hands full with a brush and pan while this man was in his kitchen i appear to have disturbed you in the act of preparing your meal please by all means continue i have no desire to keep you from it its okay equally webber decided that he would rather not turn his back on herod ill continue after youve gone herod considered this for a moment as though resisting an impulse to comment upon it then let it pass like a cat that decides not to chase down and crush a butterfly instead he examined the bottle of white burgundy on the table turning it gently with one finger so that he could read the label oh very good he said he turned to webber would you mind pouring a glass for me please he waited patiently as webber unused to guests making such demands of him retrieved two glasses from the kitchen cabinet and poured a measure for herod that under the circumstances was more than generous then one for himself herod raised the glass and sniffed it he removed a handkerchief from his trouser pocket folded it neatly then placed it against his chin as he took a sip from the glass with the corner of his mouth avoiding the wound on his lip a little of the wine trickled down and soaked into the handkerchief wonderful thank you he said he waved the hand kerchief apologetically one gets used to the necessity of sacrificing a little of ones dignity in order to continue living as one might wish he smiled again as you may have surmised i am not a well man im sorry to hear that said webber he struggled to put any emotion into the words i appreciate the sentiment said herod dryly he raised a finger and pointed at his upper lip my body is riddled with cancers but this is recent a necrotizing illness that failed to respond to penicillin and vancomycin the subsequent debridement did not remove all of the necrotic tissue and now it seems that further explorations may be required curiously it is said that my namesake the slayer of infants suffered from necrotizing fasciitis of the groin and genitalia a punishment from god one might say are you referring to the king or yourself webber wondered and it was as if the thought were somehow audible to herod for his expression changed and what little benignity he had about him seemed to vanish please mr webber sit down also you may want to remove your weapon from your belt it can hardly be comfortable where it is and im not armed i came here to talk slightly embarrassed webber retrieved the weapon and placed it on the table as he took a seat across from herod the gun was still close if he needed it he held his wineglass in his left hand just to be safe to business then said herod as i told you i represent the interests of the gutelieb foundation until recently it was felt that we had a mutually beneficial relationship with you you sourced material for us and we paid without complaint or delay occasionally we required you to act on our behalf purchasing at auction when we preferred to keep our interests hidden again i believe that you were more than adequately compensated for your time in such cases in effect you were permitted to buy such items with our money and sell them back to us at a markup that was considerably more than an agents commission am i correct i am not overstating the nature of our understanding webber shook his head but didnt speak then some months ago we asked you to acquire a grimoire for us seventeenth century french described as being bound in calfskin but we know that was merely a ruse to avoid unwanted attention human skin and calfskin have as we are both aware very different textures a unique item then to put it mildly we gave you all of the information required for a successful preemptive sale we did not want the book to go to auction even one as discreet and specialized as this one promised to be but for the first time you failed to produce the goods instead it appeared that another buyer got there before you you handed back our money and informed us that you would do better on the next occasion unfortunately it is in the nature of the unique that next time never applies herod smiled again this time regretfully a disappointed teacher faced with a pupil who has failed to grasp a simple concept the atmosphere in the kitchen had changed since herod entered palpably so it was not merely the creeping unease that webber felt at the direction that the conversation was taking no it felt to him that the force of gravity was slowly becoming greater the air heavier when he tried to raise his glass to his lips the weight of it surprised him webber felt that if he were to stand and try to walk it would be like wading through mud or silt it was herod who was altering the very essence of the room releasing elements from within himself that were changing the composition of every atom there was a feeling of density about the dying man for dying he most assuredly was as though he were not flesh and blood but some unknown material a thing of polluted compounds an alien mass webber managed to get the glass to his lips wine dribbled down his chin in an unpleasant imitation of herods own previous indignity he wiped it away with the palm of his hand there was nothing that i could do said webber there will always be competition for esoteric and rare finds its hard to keep their existence a secret yet in the case of the la rochelle grimoire its existence was a secret said herod the foundation spends a great deal of time and effort tracking down items of interest that may have been forgotten or lost and it is very careful in its inquiries the grimoire was traced after years of investigation it had been incorrectly listed in the eighteenth century and by an arduous process of crosschecking on our part that error was confirmed only the foundation was aware of the grimoires significance even its owner regarded it merely as a curiosity a valuable one possibly but with no awareness of how important it might be to the right collector the foundation in turn nominated you to act on its behalf you were required only to ensure that payment was made and then arrange for safe transportation of the item all of the hard work had been done for you im not sure what youre implying said webber im not implying anything im telling you what occurred you became greedy you had dealt in the past with the collector graydon thule and you knew that thule had a particular passion for grimoires you made him aware of the existence of the la rochelle grimoire in return he agreed to pay you a finders fee and offered one hundred thousand dollars more for the grimoire than the foundation had earmarked in order to ensure that it would go to him you did not pass on that full amount to the seller but kept half of it for yourself in addition to the finders fee you then paid a subagent in brussels to act on your behalf and the grimoire went to thule i dont think ive missed out on any details have i webber was tempted to argue to deny the truth of what herod had said but he could not it had been foolish to think that he might be able to get away with the deception but only in retrospect at the time it had seemed perfectly possible even reasonable he needed the money his cash flow had slowed in recent months for his business was not immune to the economic downturn in addition his daughter was a second year med student and her fees were crucifying him while the gutelieb foundation like most of his clients paid well it did not pay well often enough and webber had been struggling for some time he had made dollars in total from acquiring the grimoire for thule once he had paid off the subagent in brussels that was a lot of money for him enough to ease his debts cover his share of suzannes fees for the next year and leave himself with a little in the bank he began to feel a sense of indignation at herod and his manner webber did not work for the gutelieb foundation his obligations to it were minimal true his actions in the sale of the grimoire were not strictly honorable but such deals happened all the time screw herod webber had enough money to get by on for now and he was in thule s good books if the gutelieb foundation cut him off then so be it herod couldnt prove anything of what he had just said if inquiries were made about the money webber had enough false bills of sale to explain away a small fortune i think you should go now said webber id like to get back to preparing my meal im sure that you would unfortunately i am afraid that i cant let the matter rest there some form of recompense must be made i dont think so i dont know what youre talking about yes ive done some work for graydon thule in the past but he has his sources too i cant be held responsible for every failed sale youre not being held responsible for every failed sale just this one the gutelieb foundation is very concerned with issues of responsibility nobody forced you to act as you did that is the joy of free will but also its curse you must accept the blame for your actions amends must be made webber began to speak but herod silenced him with a raised hand dont lie to me mr webber it insults me and makes a fool out of you be a man acknowledge what you did and we can set about arranging restitution confession is good for the soul he reached out and laid his right hand upon webbers herods skin felt damp and cold painfully so but webber was unable to move herods grip seemed to weigh him down come said herod all that i ask from you is honesty we know the truth and now it is simply a matter of finding a way that we can both put this behind us those dark eyes glinted like black spinels in snow webber was transfixed he nodded once and herod responded with a similar gesture things have been very difficult lately said webber his eyes grew hot and the words caught in his throat as though he were about to cry i know that these are hard times for many ive never acted in this way before thule contacted me about another matter and i just let it slip i was desperate it was wrong of me i apologize to you and to the foundation your apology is accepted unfortunately we now have to discuss the matter of restitution half of the money is already gone i dont know what sum you were considering but herod appeared surprised oh its not a matter of money he said we dont require money webber sighed with relief then what he said if you need information on items of interest i may be able to provide it at a reduced rate i can ask some questions check my contacts im sure that i can find something that will make up for the loss of the grimoire and he stopped talking there was now a manila envelope on the table the kind with a cardboard back used to protect photographs what is that asked webber open it and see webber picked up the envelope there was no name or address on it and it was unsealed he reached inside and withdrew a single color photograph he recognized the woman in the picture captured when she was clearly unaware of the camera her head turned slightly to the right as she gazed over her shoulder smiling at someone or something out of shot it was his daughter suzanne what does this mean he asked are you threatening my daughter not as such said herod as i told you before the foundation is very interested in concepts of free will you had a choice in the matter of the grimoire and you made it now i have been instructed to give you another choice webber swallowed go on the foundation has authorized the rape and murder of your daughter it may be some consolation to you to hear that the acts do not have to be committed in that order instinctively webber looked to his gun then began to reach for it i should warn you continued herod that if anything happens to me then your daughter will not see out this night and her sufferings will be greatly increased you may yet have use for that gun mr webber but not now let me finish then consider uncertain of what to do webber did nothing and his fate was sealed as i said herod continued an action has been authorized but it does not have to be carried out there is another option which is you take your own life that is your choice your life ended quickly or the life of your daughter taken slowly and with much pain webber stared at herod dumbfounded youre insane but even as he said it he knew that it wasnt true he had looked into herods eyes and he had seen nothing there but absolute sanity it was possible that with enough pain a person might be driven to madness but this was not the case with the man who sat opposite him instead his suffering had given him perfect clarity he had no illusions about the ways of the world only an insight into its capacity for inflicting agony no i am not you have five minutes to choose after that it will be too late to stop what is about to occur herod sat back webber picked up the gun and pointed it at him but herod did not even blink call tell them to leave her alone so youve made your choice no there is no choice im warning you that if you dont make the call ill kill you and then your daughter will die i could torture you i can shoot you in the knee the groin i can keep hurting you until you accede to my demand your daughter will still die you know that at the most basic level you acknowledge the truth of what you have been told you must accept it and choose four minutes thirty seconds webber thumbed back the hammer on the revolver im telling you for the last time do you think that youre the first man to have been presented with this choice mr webber do you honestly believe that i havent done this before ultimately you must choose your life or the life of your daughter which do you value more herod waited he glanced at his watch counting the seconds i wanted to see her grow up i wanted to see her marry and become a mother i wanted to be a grandfather do you understand i understand her life will still be hers to live and her children will lay flowers for you four minutes dont you have anyone whom you love no i do not the gun wavered in webbers hand as he realized the futility of his arguments how do i know that youre not lying about what about raping and killing your daughter oh i think you know that i mean what i say no about about letting her go because i dont lie i dont have to others lie it is for me to present them with the consequences of those lies for every fault there must be a reckoning for every action there is a reaction the question is who do you love more your daughter or yourself herod stood he had a cell phone in one hand his wineglass in the other ill give you a private moment he said please dont attempt to use a phone if you do so our deal will be off and ill make sure that your daughter is raped to death oh and my associates will also ensure that you dont live to see the dawn webber did not try to stop herod as he stepped slowly from the room he seemed stunned into immobility in the hallway herod examined his reflection in a mirror he straightened his tie and brushed some lint from his jacket he loved this old suit he had worn it on many occasions like this one he checked his watch a final time from the kitchen he discerned words being spoken he wondered if webber had been foolish enough to try to make a call but the tone of voice was wrong then he thought that it might be webber making an act of contrition or saying some unheard goodbye to his daughter but as he moved closer he heard webbers words who are you webber was asking are you the one the one whos going to hurt my suzie are you are you herod glanced into the kitchen webber was staring at one of the kitchen windows herod saw webber and himself reflected in the glass and for just a moment he thought that there might be a third figure visible too insubstantial herod believed to be someone in the garden looking in and yet there was nobody else in the kitchen apart from the living or the soontobe dead webber turned to look at herod he was weeping damn you he said damn you to hell he put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger the sound of the shot made herods ears ring as it echoed off the tiled walls and floor of the kitchen webber fell and lay bucking by his overturned chair it was an amateurish way to turn a gun on oneself herod mused but then webber could hardly have been expected to be a professional in the art of suicide the nature of the act precluded it the barrel of the gun had pulled upward with the shot blowing a chunk out of the top of webbers skull but he had not managed to kill himself instead his eyes were wide and his mouth was opening and closing spasmodically rather like the final moments of the fish he had left on the slab in a moment of mercy herod took the gun from webbers hand and finished the job for him then drank the last of the wine in his glass and prepared to leave he paused at the door and peered back at the kitchen window something was wrong quickly he moved to the counter and looked out upon webbers neatly tended and gently illuminated garden it was surrounded by high walls and blocked off by gates at either side of the house herod could see no sign of another person yet he remained troubled he checked his watch he had already stayed too long especially if the shots had attracted attention he found the main switchbox for the house in a closet beneath the stairs and killed all of the lights before taking a blue surgical mask from his inside pocket and placing it over the lower part of his face in a way the hn virus had been a blessing to him oh people still sometimes stared at him in passing but for one who exhibited such signs of illness as he did they were looks of understanding as much of curiosity then concealed by shadows herod became part of the night and he put jeremiah webber and his daughter from his mind forever webber had made a choice the correct choice in herods view and his daughter would be allowed to live herod who worked alone despite his threats to webber would not harm her for he was an honorable man in his way far to the north as the blood from webbers body mixed with spilled wine and congealed upon his kitchen floor and herod returned to the shadows from which he had emerged the sound of a telephone ringing echoed around a forest glade the man curled on the filthy sheets was dragged back to consciousness by the noise and he knew immediately that it was them he knew because he had unplugged the phone before he went to sleep lying on the bed he moved only his eyes glancing slowly in the direction of the handset as though they were already there with him and any significant shift in position would alert them to the fact that he was awake go away leave me alone the television boomed into life and for an instant he caught a snatch of some old comedy from the sixties one at which he could remember laughing with his mother and father as he sat between them on the sofa he felt tears spring from his eyes at the memory of his parents he was frightened and he wanted them to protect him but they were long gone from this earth and he was all alone then the picture faded leaving only static and the voices came through the screen just as they had the night before and the night before that and every night since he had taken delivery of the latest consignment he began to shiver although the air was warm stop go away in the kitchen at the far end of the cabin the radio began to play it was his favorite show a little night music or it used to be he liked to listen to it just before he tried to sleep but not any more now when he turned on the radio he could hear them behind the music and in the spaces between symphonic movements and talking over the announcers voice not quite blocking him out but loud enough that he could not concentrate on what was being said the names of composers and conductors lost to him as he tried to ignore the foreign tongue that spoke so mellifluously and even though he did not understand the words the sense of them was clear to him they wanted to be set free at last he could take it no longer he jumped from his bed and grasped the baseball bat that he kept by his bedside swinging it with a power and purpose that his younger self would have admired the television screen imploded with a dull whomp and a cascade of sparks moments later the radio was in pieces on the floor and then only the phone remained to be dealt with he stood above it the bat poised staring at the power cord that was not even close to the outlet and the plastic connector cable that lay tantalizingly close to the box not connected yet still the phone was ringing he should have been surprised but he was not in recent days he had entirely lost the capacity for surprise instead of reducing the phone to shards of plastic and circuitry he put down the bat and restored the power and the connection he placed the receiver close to his ear careful not to let it touch him for fear that the voices might somehow leap from the handset into his head and take up residence there driving him to madness or closer to it than he already was he listened for a time his mouth trembling his tears still falling before he dialed a number the phone at the other end rang four times and then a machine clicked on it was always a machine he tried to calm himself as best he could then began to speak theres something wrong he said you need to get up here and take it all away you tell everyone that im out just pay me what im owed you can keep the rest he hung up the phone put on an overcoat and a pair of sneakers and grabbed a flashlight after a moments hesitation he reached beneath his bed and found the green m universal military holster he removed the browning slipped it into his overcoat pocket picked up the baseball bat for added peace of mind and left the trailer it was a moonless night heavy with cloud so that the sky was black and the world seemed very dark to him the flashlight beam scythed through the darkness as he made his way down to the row of boardedup rooms coming at last to number his father returned to mind and he saw himself as a boy standing with the old man outside this very same room asking him why there was no number why the rooms went straight from to his father had explained to him that people were superstitious they didnt want to stay in room or on the thirteenth floor of one of those big city hotels and changes had to be made to set their minds at rest so it was that became and everybody slept a little better as a result even if in truth was still didnt matter what way you chose to hide it big city hotels still had a thirteenth floor and small motels like theirs still had a room in fact there were folk who wouldnt stay in room for precisely that reason but generally most guests didnt notice now he was alone outside there was no sound from inside but he could sense them they were waiting for him to act waiting for him to do what they wanted him to do what they had been demanding over the radio and the television and in latenight calls from a phone that shouldnt have worked but did to be released the bolts on the door were still in place the locks undamaged but when he checked the screws that he had drilled into the frame through the wood he found that three of them were loose and one had fallen out entirely no he said thats not possible he picked up the screw from the ground and examined the head it was intact and unmarked he supposed that it was possible someone had come along while he was away from his trailer and used a drill to unscrew it but why stop at one and why leave some of the others only partially removed it made no sense unless unless they had done it from inside but how i should open it he thought i should open it and make sure but he didnt want to open it he was afraid of what he might see and of what he might be forced to do for he knew that if he only ever performed one more good act in his life it would be to ignore those voices he could almost hear them in there calling him taunting him he returned to his trailer found his big tool kit and returned to as he began to fit the bit into the drill his attention was distracted by the sound of metal on wood he put the drill down and directed the flashlight beam at the door one of the remaining screws was turning gently removing itself from the wood while he watched its length was at last fully exposed and the screw fell to the ground screws werent going to do it not anymore he put the drill aside and took out the nail gun breathing heavily he approached the door set the muzzle of the gun against the wood and pulled the trigger the force of the recoil jarred him slightly but when he stepped back he saw that the nail all six inches of it was buried up to the head in the wood he moved on until there were nails in the door removing them all would be a pain in the ass but the fact that they were there for now made him feel a little more comfortable he sat on the damp ground the screws were no longer moving and there were no more voices yeah he whispered you didnt like that did you soon youll be somebody elses problem and then ill be done im gonna take my money and leave this place i been here too long as it is gonna find me somewhere warm hole up there for a time uhhuh he looked at the tool box it was too damn heavy to haul all the way up to the trailer and lord knows he might have need of it again before too long number was secured only by a piece of plywood using his screwdriver he prised out the two nails that held it in place and placed his kit in the dark room beyond he could make out the shape of the old cabinet on the left and the bare frame of the bed all rusted springs and broken posts like the skeleton of some longdead creature he turned and stared at the wall separating this room from the paint was peeling and it had bubbled in places he placed his hand against one of the bubbles of paint feeling it give way against his skin he expected it to be moist to the touch but it was not instead it was warm warmer than it should have been not unless there was a fire blazing in the room on the other side he moved his hand sideways letting it trail along the wall until he came to a cooler patch one on which the paint remained undamaged what the he spoke the words aloud and the sound of his own voice in the gloom startled him as though it were not he who had spoken but a version of himself that stood somehow apart watching him with curiosity a man aged beyond his years damaged by war and loss haunted by phones that rang in the dead of night and voices that spoke in unfamiliar tongues for as his palm rested against the paintwork he felt the cool spot on the wall begin to grow warm no not just warm hot he closed his eyes briefly and an image flashed in his mind a presence in the next room a figure that was crooked and distorted burning from within as it placed a hand against the paintwork on its own side and followed the progress of the man on the other like a piece of metal drawn by a magnet he pulled his hand away and rubbed it against the leg of his sweat pants his mouth and throat were dry he felt the urge to cough but he suppressed it it was absurd he knew after all hed just drilled and then nailed a door closed so it wasnt as if hed been quiet so far but there was a difference between those mechanical noises and the simple human intimacy and say it frailty of a cough so he covered his mouth with his hand and backed out of the room leaving his tool box behind he replaced the plywood but didnt bother trying to find a way of securing it again the night was still so there was no wind that might cause it to fall he didnt turn his back on the motel until he was at his cabin once inside he locked the door then drank some water followed by a glass of vodka and some nyquil to help him sleep he called again the number he had dialed earlier and left a second message one more night he reiterated i want my money and i want this stuff gone i cant do it no more im sorry then he stamped the telephone to pieces before removing his shoes and overcoat and curling up in bed he listened to the silence and the silence listened back they were nickel and dimed that was what he thought right from the start they were nickel and dimed theyd even managed to spell his name wrong on his new identification tags bobby jandrau instead of jandreau damned if he was going to war with his name messed up that was bad karma right there way theyd kicked up when he pointed it out youd have thought he wanted to be carried to iraq in a sedan chair but then the rich always screw the poor and this was a rich mans war being fought by poor people there was nobody wealthy waiting to fight alongside him and had there been he would have asked them why because there was no sense in being here if you had a better option no there were just men like himself and some who were poorer yet although he knew what it was to live short still by the standards of some of the guys he knew who were on first name terms with poverty before they joined up he was comfortable the brass told them that they were ready to deploy ready to fight but they didnt even have body armor thats cause the iraqis aint going to fire at you said lattner theyll just use sarcasm and say mean things about your moms lattner who was a long drink maybe the tallest man hed ever met always called them his moms and his pops when he was dying he asked for his moms but she was thousands of miles away probably praying for him which might have helped he was dosed up to take away some of the pain and he didnt know where he was he thought that he was back in laredo they told him that his moms was on her way and he died believing it they scavenged scraps of metal and flattened cans to make their own sappy plates later they took body armor from dead iraqis the men and women who came later would be better equipped pads eye pro wileyx sunglasses even pieces of green card with answers to possible media questions because by then it was all going to hell jizzicked to fuck and back as his old man used to say and they didnt want anybody speaking out of school there were no showers at the start they bathed out of hard hats they lived in ruined buildings and later five to a room without ac in degree heat no sleep no showers weeks in the same clothes in time there would be airconditioning and containerized housing units and proper shitters and a mwr center with playstations and bigscreen tvs and a px selling lame whos your baghdaddy tshirts and a burger king there would be internet terminals and phone centers open except when a soldier was killed when they would be closed until the family was informed there would be a concrete mortar bunker by the door of the conex so that you didnt have to face them out in the open but he didnt care about the difficulties not at first you didnt sign up because you wanted to stay home and see out your time stateside you signed up because you wanted to go to war and what was it secretary rumsfeld said you go to war with the army you have not the army you wish you had then again secretary rumsfeld still had all of his limbs last time he looked so it was kind of easy for him to say he had some tattoos on his arms stupid childish shit but not gangrelated he wasnt even sure that there were any gangs in maine worth getting tattooed over and even if there were the tattoos wouldnt have meant much to real hardasses like the bloods and the crips the army would eventually add another tat of its own his dogtag information was etched on his side his meat tag so even if he was blown to pieces and his dog tags lost or destroyed his body would still bear his identity a staff sergeant promised a waiver for the old tats when he enlisted even offered to clear up any minor criminal stuff that might have been on his sheet but he didnt have so much as a dui to his name he was guaranteed the good life a signing bonus paid leave and a college education if he wanted it once hed completed his time he scored over percent on the vocational aptitude battery the armys sats which made him eligible for a twoyear enlistment but he signed up for four he didnt have a whole lot else going on anyway and a fouryear enlistment meant that he would be guaranteed a slot with a particular division and he wanted to serve with other men from maine if that was possible hed enjoyed being a soldier he was good at it it was why he reenlisted if he hadnt then things would have been very different the second time was the doozy the second time was the killer but that was years away first off he was sent to fort benning for fourteen weeks of training and he thought he was going to die on the second day after basic they gave him two weeks to kick around then put him on the hometown recruiting assistance program where he was supposed to recruit his buddies in a class a uniform the armys equivalent of a pyramid selling scheme but his buddies werent buying that was when he met tobias even then tobias was an operator he had a way of forming alliances of cutting deals of doing small favors that he could call in at a later date tobias took him under his wing you dont know beans tobias told him you stick with me and ill educate you and he did tobias looked out for him just as in time he himself had looked out for damien patchett until the roles were reversed and the bullets came and he thought i am bait i am a stalking goat i am going to die i was back at joel tobiass place early the next morning instead of the saturn which as on the night before i sometimes used for surveillance id been forced to drive the mustang just in case tobias had any suspicions that he was being followed after our encounter the previous night the mustang wasnt exactly inconspicuous but id parked behind a truck in the lot of the big sky bread company on the corner of deering avenue and had angled myself so that i could just about see tobiass house on revere from where i was but he would have trouble spotting me unless he came looking his silverado was still in the drive when i parked and the drapes remained drawn at the upstairs window shortly after eight tobias appeared at the front door wearing a black tshirt and black jeans there was a tattoo on his left arm but i couldnt tell what it was from a distance he got in his truck and hung a right once he was out of sight i went after him there was plenty of traffic on the streets and i was able to stay well back from tobias while still keeping him in sight i nearly lost him at bedford when the lights changed but i caught up a couple of blocks later eventually he pulled into a warehouse complex off the franklin arterial i drove by then slipped into the lot next door where i watched tobias park by one of three big rigs parked close to a chain link fence he spent the next hour performing routine maintenance checks on his rig then got back in the silverado and returned to his house i filled up the mustangs tank bought a cup of coffee at big sky and tried to figure out what i was supposed to be doing all that i knew so far was that tobiass finances didnt add up and he might be having troubles with his girlfriend as bennett had suggested but i couldnt help feeling that in the end little of this was any of my business in theory i could have stayed with him until he embarked on his planned run to canada followed him across the border and then waited to see what transpired but the chances of his not making me if i did follow him all the way up there were pretty slim after all if he was engaged in illegal activity he was likely to be alert for any kind of surveillance and a proper pursuit would require two maybe three vehicles i could have brought in jackie garner as the second driver but jackie didnt work for free not unless he was guaranteed a little fun and the possibility of being able to hit someone without legal consequences and following a truck up to quebec hardly sounded like jackies idea of a good time and if tobias was smuggling so what i wasnt an arm of us customs the issue of whether or not he was hitting his girlfriend was another matter but i couldnt see how my involvement was going to improve that situation bennett patchett was in a better position to make a discreet approach to karen emory than i was perhaps through one of her female colleagues at the diner since a complete stranger coming up to her and asking if her boyfriend had beaten her up lately was unlikely to endear himself to her i called bennetts cell phone it went to voice mail so i left a message i tried the downs but he wasnt there and the woman who answered the phone told me that she didnt expect him today i hung up my coffee was going cold i opened my window and poured it out then tossed the paper cup in the back of the car i was bored and frustrated i took a james lee burke novel from the glove compartment sat back in my seat and started to read three hours later my ass was aching and i had finished the book the coffee had also made its way through my system like every good pi i kept a plastic bottle in the car for just such an eventuality but it hadnt reached that stage as yet i tried bennetts cell phone again and once more it went to voice mail twenty minutes later karen emorys green subaru appeared at the intersection with karen at the wheel she was already wearing her blue downs tshirt there appeared to be nobody else in the car with her i let her go half an hour later tobiass silverado appeared and headed for the highway i followed him to the nickelodeon theater in portland where he bought a ticket for a comedy i waited for twenty minutes but he didnt come out for now it seemed that joel tobias wasnt heading to canada at least not today even if he was preparing for a night run there was little that i could do to follow him i was also due at the bear that night and the next and i couldnt let dave evans down i felt that i had wasted a day and bennett wasnt going to get his moneys worth out of me not like this it was now pm i was due at the bear by eight i wanted to shower first and i wanted to use the bathroom i drove back to scarborough it was a warm close evening with no breeze by the time i had showered and changed i had made a decision i would charge bennett for the hours i had put in so far then give him back the rest of his money unless he could come up with a pressing reason why i should not if he wanted me to and he acted as an intermediary id sit down with karen emory for free and advise her on her options if she was experiencing domestic abuse as for joel tobias assuming that he wasnt making up the shortfall in his finances through entirely legal means of which i had no knowledge he could continue doing whatever it was he was doing until the cops or customs caught up with him it wasnt an ideal compromise but then compromises rarely were the bear was buzzing that night there were some state cops drinking at the far end of the bar away from the door i considered it politic to avoid them and dave agreed they had no love for me and one of their number a detective named hansen was still on medical leave having involved himself in my affairs earlier in the year it was no fault of mine but i knew that his colleagues didnt see it that way i spent the evening taking care of orders from the waitstaff and left the two regular bartenders to look after those seated at the bar the night passed quickly and by midnight i was done for the sake of it i took another ride past joel tobiass place the silverado was still there along with karen emorys car when i went to the warehouse complex off federal tobiass rig hadnt moved my phone rang as i was halfway home the caller id showed bennett patchetts number so i pulled in at a dunkin donuts and answered calling a little late mr patchett i said figured you for a night owl like myself he replied sorry for taking so long to return your call i was tied up with legal business all day and to tell you the truth when i was done with it i didnt much feel like checking my messages but ive had a nightcap and i feel a bit more relaxed now you find out anything worth mentioning i told him that i hadnt apart from the possibility that joel tobiass finances didnt quite add up and bennett had suspected as much already i went over my concerns with him how i believed that following tobias would be difficult without additional manpower and that perhaps there were better ways of dealing with the possibility that karen emory was a victim of domestic abuse and my boy said bennett his voice cracked when he said it and i wondered if hed had more than a single nightcap what about my boy i didnt know what to tell him your boy is gone and this wont bring him back posttraumatic stress took him not his involvement with whatever joel tobias might be doing under the guise of a legitimate trucking business look said bennett it may be that you think im a foolish old man who cant accept the circumstances of his sons death and you know thats probably true but i have a good sense for people and joel tobias is crooked i didnt like him when i first met him and i wasnt happy about damien getting involved in his affairs im asking you to keep on this its not a question of money money i got if you need to hire some help then do it and ill pay for that as well what do you say what was there to say i said that id give it a few more days even though i believed it was pointless he thanked me then hung up i stared at the phone for a time before tossing it on the seat beside me that night i dreamed of joel tobiass rig it stood in a deserted lot its container unlocked and when i opened it there was only blackness blackness that extended farther than the rear of the container as though i were staring into a void i felt a presence approaching fast from out of the darkness rushing toward me from the abyss and i woke to the first light of dawn and the sense that i was no longer quite alone the room smelled of my dead wifes perfume and i knew that it was a warning the mail boat was departing for its morning run as i parked at the casco bay terminal a handful of passengers on board most of them tourists watching as the wharf receded taking in the bustle of the fishing boats and the ferries the mail boat was an integral part of life on the bay a twicedaily link between the mainland and the folk on little diamond and great diamond and diamond cove on long island and cliff island and peaks island on great chebeague the largest of the islands on casco bay and on dutch island or sanctuary as it was sometimes called the most remote of the calendar islands the boat was a point of connection not only between those who lived by the sea and those who lived on the sea but also between the inhabitants of the various outposts on casco bay the sight of the mail boat always brought with it a hint of nostalgia it seemed to belong to another time and it was impossible not to look upon it and imagine its earlier incarnations the importance of that link when travel between the islands and the mainland was not so easy the mail boat brought letters and packages and freight but it also brought and disseminated news my grandfather my mothers father took me on one of the mail boats runs shortly after my mother and i returned to maine in the aftermath of my fathers death as we fled north to escape the spreading stain of it i wondered then if it might be possible for us to live on one of those islands to leave the mainland behind forever so that when the blood reached the limits of the coast it would drip slowly into the sea and be dispersed by the waves looking back i realize that i was always running from my fathers legacy from the deaths of susan and jennifer my wife and child and ultimately from my own nature but now i had stopped running the sailmaker was not to put too fine a point on it a dump it was one of the last of the old wharf bars in portland the ones that were built to cater for the needs of lobstermen dock workers and all of those whose livelihood depended on the grittier aspects of portland s working harbor it was there long before anyone thought that tourists might want to spend time on the waterfront and when the tourists did eventually appear they gave the sailmaker a wide berth it was like the dog on the street that snoozes in the yard its fur pitted with the scars of old battles its mouth even in repose always baring yellowed teeth its eyes rheumy beneath halfclosed lids every aspect of it exuding restrained menace and promising the loss of a finger or more if a passing stranger were foolish enough to attempt a pat on the head even the name on the sign that hung outside the bar was barely legible its paintwork ignored for years those who needed it knew where to find it which was true of locals and a certain type of new arrival the type that was not concerned with fine dining and lighthouses and nostalgic thoughts about mail boats and islanders that kind sniffed out the sailmaker and found their place in it once theyd snapped at the other dogs and taken their bites in return the sailmaker was the only business still open on its wharf around it shuttered windows and padlocked doors secured premises that had nothing inside left to steal even to enter them would be to risk plummeting through the floor and into the cold waters beneath for these buildings like the wharf itself were slowly rotting into the sea it seemed a miracle that the whole structure had not collapsed many years before and while the sailmaker appeared to be more stable than its neighbors it sat on the same uncertain pilings as they did so it was that drinking in the sailmaker brought with it a sense of danger on a great many levels the prospect of drowning in the bay due to stepping through a busted board being a relatively minor concern when compared with the more immediate threat of physical violence serious or minor from one or more of its customers for the most part even the lobstermen no longer frequented the sailmaker and the ones who did were less interested in fishing than in drinking steadily until fluid came out of their ears they were lobstermen in name only for those who ended up in the sailmaker had resigned themselves to the fact that their days of being contributory members of society of working hard for an honest wage were long behind them the sailmaker was where you ended up when there was nowhere else left to go when the only ending in sight was a funeral attended by people who knew you only by your seat at the bar and the drink that you ordered and who would be mourning their own lives as much as yours as you were lowered into the ground every coastal town used to have a bar like the sailmaker in a way the lost were more likely to be remembered in such places than they were among the remnants of their own family in that sense the sailmaker was nominally as well as figuratively an apt venue in which to end ones days for it was the sailmaker on board ship who would sew the dead man up in his hammock passing a final stitch through the nose of the departed to ensure that he was dead at the sailmaker no such precautions were necessary its patrons were drinking themselves to death so when they stopped ordering drinks it was a pretty sure sign that theyd succeeded the sailmaker was owned by a man named jimmy jewel although i had never heard him called anything other than mr jewel to his face jimmy jewel owned a lot of places like the sailmaker and the wharf upon which it stood apartment buildings that barely came up to code ruined structures on waterfronts and side streets in towns all the way from kittery to calais and vacant lots that were used for nothing but storing filthy pools of stagnating rainwater lots that were not for sale and bore no indication of ownership beyond a series of no trespassing signs some of them reasonably official in appearance others just scrawled boards with increasingly varied and creative spellings of the word trespassing what these buildings and lots had in common was the possibility that they might at some future date be valuable to a developer the wharf on which the sailmaker sat was one of a number tipped to become part of the new maine state pier redevelopment a million effort to revitalize the commercial waterfront involving a new hotel soaring offices and a cruise ship terminal which had since been dropped and now looked to be an increasingly distant prospect the port was struggling the international marine terminal that had once been filled with cargo containers waiting to be taken out on ships and barges or transported inland by truck and train was quieter than it had ever been the number of fishing boats bringing their catches to the fish exchange on the portland fish pier had fallen from to in the space of fifteen years and the livelihoods of the fishermen were being threatened further by a reduction in their number of permitted fishing days the highspeed cat service between portland and nova scotia was ending taking with it much needed jobs and income for the port some were suggesting that the survival of the waterfront depended on increasing the number of bars and restaurants permitted on the wharfs but the danger was that the port would then become little more than a theme park with a handful of lobstermen left to eke out a meager living and provide some local color for the tourists leaving portland just a shadow of the great deepwater harbor that had defined the citys identity for three centuries and in the middle of all this uncertainty squatted jimmy jewel sizing up the angles his finger damp and raised to the wind it wouldnt be true to say that jimmy didnt care about portland or its piers or its history he just cared about money more but decaying buildings although a significant part of his portfolio did not represent the sum total of jimmys business interests he had a slice of interstate and crossborder trucking and he knew more about the smuggling of narcotics than almost anyone on the northeastern seaboard jimmys main deal was pot but hed suffered a couple of serious hits in recent years and now he was rumored to be taking a step back from the drug business in favor of more legitimate enterprises or those enterprises that gave the appearance of legitimacy which was not the same thing old habits died hard and when it came to criminality jimmy kept his hand in as much for the money as for the pleasure he got in breaking the law i didnt have to call ahead to make an appointment with him the heart of jimmys empire was the sailmaker he had a small office in back but it was used mainly for storage instead jimmy could always be found at the bar reading newspapers answering occasional calls on an ancient phone and drinking endless cups of coffee he was there when i entered that morning there was nobody else with him apart from a bartender in a stained white tshirt who was hauling in crates of beer from the storeroom the bartenders name was earle hanley the same earle hanley who had tended bar at the blue moon on the night that sally cleaver was beaten to death by her boyfriend for the owner of the sailmaker and the blue moon were one and the same jimmy jewel earle looked up as i came in if he liked what he saw he made a manly effort to disguise the fact his face creased wrinkling like a ball of paper that had just been squeezed hard and even in repose earles face already resembled the last walnut in the bowl a week after thanksgiving he doubled as one of the guys who occasionally doled out beatings to recalcitrants who crossed jimmy and incurred his displeasure he appeared to have been constructed from a series of balls of encrusted lipids the topmost fringed with greasy black hair even his thighs were circular i could almost hear the fats sluicing around in his body as he moved jimmy meanwhile wore a morticians black suit over an opencollared blue shirt he was thin and his hair was varying shades of gray held in place with a pomade that smelled faintly of cloves he was six feet tall but slightly stooped so that he seemed to be struggling under some burden invisible to all but deeply oppressive to himself the righthand side of his mouth was permanently raised as if life were some amusing comedy and he was merely a spectator jimmy wasnt a bad guy as smugglers and drug dealers went hed knocked heads a couple of times with my grandfather who was a state cop and knew jimmy from way back but they had respected each other jimmy had come to my grandfathers funeral and the grief he had expressed to me was genuine since then i had enjoyed few dealings with him but our paths had crossed on occasion and once or twice hed been good enough to point me in the right direction when i had a question that needed to be answered as long as nobody got hurt by it and the law didnt get involved he looked up from his newspaper and that semismile flickered like a lightbulb that has suffered a momentary disturbance to its power supply shouldnt you be wearing a mask he asked why you got anything worth stealing no but i thought all you avengers wore masks that way people can say who was that masked avenger as you vanish into the night otherwise youre just a guy who dresses too young for his age sticking his nose where hes got no business sticking it and looking surprised when it gets bloodied i took a stool across from him he sighed and folded his newspaper you think i dress too young for my age i said you ask me everybody dresses too young these days when they get dressed at all i can still remember a time when there were hookers in these bars and even they wouldnt have dressed like some of the young girls i see passing by summer and winter i want to buy them all coats make sure they wrap up warm but what do i know from fashion i think any suit that isnt black looks like something liberace would wear he stretched out a hand and we shook how you doing kid pretty good you still with that woman he asked he meant rachel the mother of my daughter sam i didnt feel any urge to express surprise nobody survived for as long as jimmy jewel without keeping tabs on whomever crossed his path no we broke up shes in vermont she take the kid with her yes im sorry to hear it this wasnt a topic of conversation i wanted to pursue i sniffed warily at the air your bar stinks i said my bar smells fine said jimmy its my clientele that stink but to get rid of the stink id have to get rid of them and then it would just be me and my ghosts oh and earle doesnt smell so good either but that may be genetic earle didnt reply but just added a few more wrinkles to his expression and went back to rearranging the dirt you want a drink its on the house i dont think so i hear you water your booze down to add taste you got balls coming in here and insulting my place its not a place its a tax writeoff if it ever made any real money your empire would collapse i have an empire i never knew i did id have dressed better bought more expensive black suits you have a guy who brings you coffee without being asked and breaks heads on the same basis i guess that counts for something so you want some coffee then asked jimmy is it as bad as everything else in here worse but i made it myself so at least you know my hands are clean literally not metaphorically coffee would be good thanks its kind of early for me otherwise then youre in the wrong place you think the windows are small because i couldnt afford the glass the sailmaker was always dark its customers didnt care to be reminded about the passage of time jimmy gestured to to earle who stood retrieved a mug from somewhere examined its insides to make sure that it wasnt too dirty or was just dirty enough and poured when he put the mug down on the bar coffee slopped over the sides and pooled on the wood earle looked at me as though daring me to complain hes dainty for a big man i said he doesnt like you said jimmy dont take it personal though he doesnt like anyone sometimes i think that he doesnt even like me but i pay him so that buys me a degree of tolerance jimmy passed me a silver jug of milk not cream and a bowl of sugar jimmy didnt like uht milk or cheap creamer or sachets of sweetener i took the milk not the sugar so is this a social call or have i done a great wrong that needs to be righted because i got to tell you having you in my place makes me feel like checking my insurance you think trouble follows me jesus death himself probably sends you a fruit basket at christmas thanking you for the business i have a question about trucking dont get into it thats my advice long hours no overtime youll sleep in a cab eat bad food and die at a rest stop on the other hand nobody will actively try to kill you which seems to be one of the occupational hazards of your line of work or the version of it that you pursue i ignored the career advice theres a guy an independent hes got payments to keep up on a nice rig a mortgage the usual stuff id say overall his expenses come close to seventy grand a year and thats not leading an extravagant lifestyle that allowing for some massage on the figures probably you ever met an honest man not when it comes to taxes i did id take him for every penny he was worth just like the irs but not as vindictive this guy he do long haul some canadian stuff but thats it i think canada s a big place how far are we talking quebec as far as i know thats not long haul he work a lot of hours not enough or that would be my take on it so you figure he might be doing a little work on the side hes crossing the border the thought had struck me and with respect i dont think squirrels cross the border without you knowing it and taking ten percent of their nuts fifteen said jimmy and thats the friends rate this guy have a name joel tobias jimmy looked away and clicked his tongue hes not one of mine you know whose he might be jimmy didnt answer the question instead he said whats your interest in him on my way to portland i had debated how much i was prepared to tell jimmy in the end i decided that i was going to have to tell him most of it but i wanted to leave out damien patchetts death for now hes got a girlfriend i said a concerned citizen thinks he may not be treating her right and that shed be better off away from him and what you prove hes smuggling and she tosses him aside and dates a preacher instead either youre lying and i dont believe youd come in here and do that or this concerned citizen needs a lesson in the ways of the world half the girls in this town will jump on a guy with a nickel in his pocket and wear him down to a stub and they wont care where the money came from in fact you tell them you got it illegally and some of them will call their sisters to join in as well what about the other half theyll just steal his wallet shortterm goals shortterm gains he rubbed his face with his hand and i heard the crackle of his stubble i know youre not the kind to take advice but maybe youll listen to me for the sake of your grandfather he continued this one isnt worth it not if its just about some domestic situation thatll resolve itself one way or the other let it go theres easier money out there i drank some coffee it tasted like sump oil if i hadnt watched him pour it id have said that earle had gone in back and dipped the mug in the bay before giving it to me then again maybe he just kept a couple of really nasty mugs and glasses to one side for special visitors it doesnt work that way jimmy i said yeah i figured i was talking to the breeze so you know about tobias you first this isnt just about a girl dating the wrong guy ive been hired by someone who figures hes dirty and may have a grudge against him and you came to me because you figure tobias is augmenting his cargo illegally to make ends meet and id know about it if he was jimmy you know about stuff even god doesnt know about thats because god is only interested in his own cut and we all pay that eventually so god can afford to wait i on the other hand am always seeking to expand so joel tobias jimmy shrugged i dont have much to tell you about this guy but what i do have you wont like jimmy knew the ways of the border he was familiar with every road every inlet every secluded cove in the state of maine he worked for himself largely in the sense that he was an agent for a number of criminal organizations who were often happy to remain at one remove from the illegal activities that funded them booze drugs people money whatever needed to be transported jimmy would find a way to do it longstanding bribes were in place and there were men in uniform who knew when to look the other way he used to say that he had more people on his payroll than the government and his jobs were more secure the events of changed things for jimmy and others like him border security was tightened and jimmy was no longer able to guarantee deliveries without a hitch the bribes grew larger and some of his inside men quietly told jimmy that they couldnt take the risk of working for him anymore a couple of shipments were seized and the people whose goods he was transporting werent happy about it jimmy lost money and clients but the economic downturn had also helped some cash was scarce jobs were disappearing and under those circumstances smuggling seemed like a pretty good option to men who were struggling to weather hard times but even though jimmy was always in need of good help he was careful about those whom he employed he wanted people who could be trusted who wouldnt show signs of panic when the dogs began sniffing around their trucks or their cars who wouldnt decide to take a chance on ripping jimmy off and making a run for it with the proceeds only newbies did stuff like that the older ones knew better jimmy might have seemed like a genial guy but earle wasnt earle would break a kittens legs for spilling its milk and if earle couldnt handle the situation which was rare jimmy had friends everywhere the kind of friends who owed him and knew where to look for anyone dumb enough to cross jimmy jewel and since newbies only got consignments to transport worth a lowfivefigure sum at most there was a limit to how far any of them could run assuming they could access the traps the hidden storage compartments to begin with even those who did run inevitably ended up back where they came from because jimmy also made sure that he employed people who had friends and family within easy reach either the offending parties would return of their own volition largely because they missed the company or they would be encouraged to return in order to avoid trouble for those close to them then a beating would follow and a sequestration of assets or in the absence of any such assets a couple of risky dirty jobs done for little or no payment as a gesture of atonement jimmy resisted punishments that were terminal as they drew unwanted attention to his operations but that wasnt to say that people had not died for crossing jimmy jewel there were bodies buried in the great north woods but jimmy hadnt put them there it was just that sometimes clients emerged who resented the disruption caused to their affairs by someone running off with their cash or their drugs and who insisted upon an example being made pour décourager autres as some of his quebeçois contacts liked to put it in such cases jimmy did his best to plead for leniency but if his pleas fell on deaf ears jimmy had always made it clear that he wasnt about to cap anyone because that wasnt the way he worked and the finger on the trigger wouldnt belong to any of his people nobody ever complained about jimmys position on this matter mainly because there were always men who were happy to dim some unfortunates lights if only to keep themselves fresh and in the game jimmy never put pressure on anyone to work for him he was content to make a delicate approach sometimes through a third party and if that approach was rebuffed to move on elsewhere he was patient often it was enough to sow the seed and wait for a change in financial circumstances to occur at which point his offer might be reconsidered but he kept tabs on the local truckers and he was always listening up for rumors of excessive cash being thrown around or someone picking up a new rig when common sense would suggest that he should barely have been able to maintain the old one if there was one thing jimmy didnt care for it was competition or smart guys trying to run independent operations however small in scale there were some exceptions to that rule he was rumored to have a sweet deal with the mexicans but he wasnt about to try to reason with the dominicans or the colombians or the bikers or even the mohawks if they wanted to avail themselves of his services as they sometimes did that was fine but if jimmy jewel started questioning their right to move product he and earle would end up tied to chairs in the sailmaker with pieces of themselves scattered by their feet assuming their feet werent among the scattered pieces while the bar burned down around their ears assuming they still had ears that was how joel tobias had come to jimmys attention he had a rig a truck a house but he wasnt making the kind of runs that would enable him to keep them all for long the figures didnt add up and jimmy had begun to make some gentle inquiries because if tobias was smuggling drugs then those drugs had both to come from somewhere and to go somewhere once theyd crossed the border and there were only a limited number of possible options in either case booze was unwieldy and didnt bring in enough dough for the risk and as far as jimmy could tell tobias was using the monitored crossings which meant that hed be subject to regular searches and unless he was being provided with some very highclass documentation his career as a booze smuggler would be short that left cash but again large dollar amounts had to come from somewhere and jimmy had cornered the market in that particular specialty anyway the actual physical movement of cash was also a very minor part of his operation as there were easier ways to transport money from place to place than in the trunk of a car or the cab of a truck so jimmy was very curious indeed about joel tobias which is why he decided to approach him directly one day when tobias was drinking alone over at three dollar deweys after making a legitimate delivery to a warehouse on commercial it was four in the afternoon so the evening rush hadnt yet hit deweys jimmy and earle joined tobias at the bar one on either side of him and asked if they could buy him a drink im good said tobias and went back to reading his magazine just trying to be friendly said jimmy tobias had glanced at earle in response yeah your buddy has friendly written all over him earle had friendly written all over him the way that a plague rat had hug me emblazoned on its fur tobias didnt appear disturbed or frightened he was a big guy not as big as earle but better toned jimmy knew from asking around that tobias was exmilitary hed served in iraq and his left hand looked chewed up missing the little finger and its nearest neighbor but he was in good condition so it appeared that hed maintained the habits that hed learned in the army hed also kept up with his old buddies from what jimmy could ascertain which concerned him slightly whatever scam tobias was running he wasnt running it alone soldiers former or otherwise meant guns and jimmy didnt like guns hes a pussycat said jimmy im the one you should be worried about look im having a beer and reading why dont you take igor here and go scare some kids ive got nothing to talk to you about you know who i am asked jimmy tobias took a sip of his beer but didnt look at him yeah i know who you are then you know why im here i dont need the work im doing okay better than okay from what i hear you drive a sharp rig youre making your payments and you got enough left over to buy a beer at the end of a hard days work you ask me youre rocking and rolling like you said i work hard seems to me that youd need thirty hours in the day to make the kind of money that youre pulling down in these difficult times independent operator competing with the big guys hell you mustnt ever sleep tobias said nothing he finished his beer folded the magazine and took most of his change from the bar leaving a dollar tip you need to let this go he said you need to show some respect said jimmy tobias looked at him with a degree of amusement nice talking to you he said as he got up earle reached for him to force him back down but tobias was too fast for him he spun away from earle then kicked him hard in the side of the left knee earles leg buckled and tobias grabbed earles hair as he went down and banged earles head hard against the bar earle slumped to the floor stunned you dont want to do this said tobias you mind your own business and ill mind mine jimmy nodded but it wasnt a conciliatory gesture merely an indication that a suspicion had now been confirmed for him drive safely he said tobias backed out earle who was nursing his knee but had recovered his composure seemed inclined to take matters further when jimmy put a hand on his shoulder to quieten him let him go he said as he watched tobias depart this is just the beginning back in the sailmaker earle was doing a good job of pretending not to listen to our conversation tobias hurt his professional pride said jimmy yeah well im all torn up about that you should be earle doesnt forget a hurt i watched the big man cleaning the bar even though there were no customers and the sailmaker wasnt about to get any cleaner without dousing its surfaces with acid in that way it had a lot in common with the blue moon he didnt do a days time for what happened to sally cleaver i said maybe a couple of years in the can might have made him a little less sensitive he was younger then said jimmy hed handle it differently now wont bring her back no it wont youre a harsh judge charlie people got the right to change to learn from their mistakes he was right and i wasnt in a position to point the finger although i didnt like admitting it why do you let that place stand i said the moon sentimentality maybe it was my first bar a shithole but theyre all shitholes i know my place and i know my customers and its a reminder for me for earle we take it away and we start to forget you know anything about jandreau the state trooper who died there no and i already answered all the questions the cops had to throw at me about that last time i looked you werent wearing a badge not unless it read inquisitive asshole and tobias it looks like he decided to keep a low profile after i spoke to him he didnt make any runs outside the state for a month now hes started again any idea of destinations on the canadian side all standard runs some animal feed paper products machine parts i could probably get you a list but it wouldnt help theyre straight operations either i started asking questions too late or these people are cleverer than they seem people were talking associates some army buddies theyve gone on runs with him shouldnt be hard for a man of your talents to find them he picked up his newspaper and began reading our conversation had come to an end it was good talking to you again charlie im sure you dont need earle to show you out i stood up and put on my jacket whats he moving jimmy jimmys mouth creased and the right side raised itself to mirror the left forming a crocodile smile that matter is in hand maybe ill let you know how it works out did i trust jimmy jewel i wasnt sure my grandfather once described him as the kind of man who would lie through omission but who preferred not to lie at all naturally jimmy made an exception for us customs and the forces of law and order in general but even where they were concerned he tended to avoid confrontations wherever possible thereby obviating the necessity for untruths but it was now clear from what i had been told that joel tobias was on jimmy jewels radar which was a little like being tracked by a military drone aircraft it might just soar above you for the most part but you never knew when it would call down vengeance upon your head after checking that tobiass rig remained at the warehouse and that his silverado was still parked at his house i stopped for a bowl of gumbo at the bayou kitchen on deering jimmy had said that joel tobias was being helped by former soldiers which brought with it a whole new set of problems maine was a veterans state there were more than veterans living here and that wasnt counting the ones who had been called up again to fight in iraq and afghanistan most of them lived away from the cities holed up in rural areas like the county in my experience a lot of them didnt care much for talking to outsiders about their activities legal or otherwise i made a call to jackie garner from my table and told him that i had some work for him despite being well into his forties jackie still lived with his mom who evinced a benign tolerance for her sons love of homemade explosives and other improvised munitions although he was under strict instructions not to bring them into the house lately a degree of tension had crept into this cozily oedipal relationship precipitated by the fact that jackie had begun to date a woman named lisa who seemed very fond of her new beau and was pressing him to move in with her even if it wasnt yet clear how much she knew about the whole munitions business jackies mother regarded the new arrival as unwanted competition for her sons affections and had recently begun to play the frail ageing whowilllookaftermewhenyouregone role one into which she did not easily fit as there were great white sharks less well equipped for the solitary life than mrs garner thus it was that jackie caught between these twin poles of affection like a condemned man whose arms have been attached to a pair of draft horses with a whip braced over their withers seemed grateful for my call and was more than willing to take on some otherwise dull surveillance work that did not involve dealing with the women in his life i told him to stay with joel tobias but if tobias met up with anyone then he was to follow the second party in the meantime i planned to talk with ronald straydeer a penobscot indian who had his finger on veterans affairs and might be able to tell me a little more about tobias but for now i had other obligations dave evans had asked me to come in and cover for him for the weekly beer delivery at the bear and then act as bar manager for the rest of the day it would be a long shift but dave was in a hole so i put ronald straydeer off until the next day then headed down to the bear in time to meet the nappi truck and because the bear was busy afternoon slipped quickly into evening and then into night with barely a change to the bars dimly lit interior until at last it was after midnight and i heard my bed calling they were waiting for me in the parking lot there were three of them all wearing black ski masks and dark jackets i caught a glimpse of one of them as i was opening my car door but by then they were on top of me i lashed out with my right hand catching someone a glancing blow to the face with my elbow i followed through with the car key and felt it cut through the mask and tear the skin beneath i heard swearing and then i took a hard blow to the back of the head that sent me sprawling a gun was placed against my temple and a male voice said enough a car pulled up hands were placed beneath my armpits dragging me to my feet a sack was forced over my head and i was pushed into the back of the car and made to lie flat on the floor one booted foot was placed against the back of my neck my hands were pulled behind my back and seconds later i felt the plastic restraints tighten painfully against my skin gunmetal tapped me lightly on the same spot where i had earlier been struck and sparks went off behind my eyes stay down and stay quiet and with no further choice in the matter i did as i was told we headed south on i i could tell from the distance we traveled on forest and the turn we made on to the interstate we drove for no more than fifteen minutes before pulling off to the left i heard gravel crunch beneath the tires as we came to a halt and then i was pulled from the car my arms were forced high behind my back almost to the point of dislocation and i was made to walk bent over nobody spoke a door opened through the sack i could smell old smoke and urine i was pushed inside helped by a boot in the ass that sent me to the floor someone laughed there were rough tiles beneath me and the smell of human waste was nauseatingly strong my captors took up positions around me their footsteps echoed i was indoors but the sound was wrong and i had a sense of space above my head in fact i now had a pretty good idea of where i was even after all these years the place still smelled of burning i was at the blue moon and i understood that a connection had been made between jimmy jewel and me those who had brought me to this place knew about our meeting and they had decided wrongly that i was in jimmys employ a message was about to be sent to jimmy through me and even before they began communicating it i was certain that i would have preferred it to be delivered to jimmy in person someone knelt beside me and the sack was pulled up as far as my nose we dont want to hurt you it was the same male voice that had spoken earlier it was calm and measured the voice of a younger man and without animosity maybe you should have thought that one through before you knocked me down in the parking lot i said you were pretty fast with that key seemed like a good idea to quieten you down some anyway enough with the pleasantries answer my questions and youll be back at your muscle car before the headache really starts to bite you know what this is about do i yes you do why are you following joel tobias whos joel tobias there was silence for a time before the voice came again closer now i could smell mint on the mans breath we know all about you youre a big shot running around with a gun putting bad guys in the ground dont get me wrong i admire you and what youve done youre on the right side and that counts for something its why youre still breathing instead of sinking into the marshes with a new hole in your head to let the water in ill ask you one more time why are you following joel tobias who hired you is jimmy jewel picking up the tab speak now or youll be forever holding your tongue my head ached and my arms hurt something sharp was biting into my palm i could just have told them that bennett patchett had hired me because he believed that joel tobias was abusing his girlfriend i could have but i didnt it wasnt simply out of concern for bennetts own safety there was an element of stubbornness to it too then again sometimes stubbornness and principle are almost indistinguishable from each other like i said i dont know any joel tobias strip him said another voice strip him and cornhole him you hear that said the first voice some of my buddies here arent as concerned about the niceties of conversation as i am i could step outside to smoke a cigarette and leave them to amuse themselves with you a blade touched my buttocks and glanced against my groin even through my trousers i felt the keenness of its edge is that what you want youll be a changed man after it thats for sure in fact youll be a bitch youve made a mistake i said and i sounded braver than i felt youre a fool mr parker youre going to tell us the truth within the next minute i guarantee you he let the sack drop down over my nose and mouth hands grabbed my legs and i heard the sticky rasp of heavyduty tape before it was wound tightly around my calves the sack was twisted tightly against my adams apple then i was lifted and carried across the room i was turned so that i was facing up and then my legs were raised higher than my head the voice spoke again youre not going to like this it said and id prefer not to have to do it but needs must i could just about breathe through the material but i was already hyperventilating i tried to bring my breathing under control counting slowly from one to ten in my head i got as far as three before i smelled fetid water and then i was plunged headfirst below its surface i tried to resist the urge to inhale tried to hold my breath entirely but a finger probed for my solar plexus and then began placing steady pressure on it water flooded into my nose and mouth i started to choke then i began to drown it wasnt just a sensation of drowning my head was filling with water when i inhaled the cloth tightened against my face and i took in fluid when i tried to cough it away more water flooded my throat i began to lose track of whether i was inhaling or exhaling of what was up and what was down i was certain that i was on the verge of blacking out when they pulled me out and laid me on the floor the sack was yanked away from the lower half of my face i was turned on my side and allowed to cough up water and phlegm theres plenty more where that came from mr parker said my interrogator for that was what he was my interrogator and my torturer who hired you why were you meeting with jimmy jewel i dont work for jimmy jewel i gasped out the words then why did you go to his place today it was just a casual meeting look i the sack was pulled back down and i was lifted and immersed lifted and immersed but there were no more questions no opportunities to make it stop and i believed that i was going to die when i went down for the fourth time i would have told them anything to bring it to an end anything at all i thought that i heard someone say youre killing him but there was no anxiety about the fact it was merely an observation i was raised from the water and lowered to the floor again but i still felt as though i were drowning the sack was pressed against my nose and mouth and i couldnt breathe i thrashed on the floor like a dying fish trying to push the sack away not caring as i scraped my face against the floor through the material at last mercifully it was pulled up i had to force myself to inhale for my system seemed to have shut down in expectation of water not air facedown i felt hands pushing at my back forcing the fluid from me it seared my throat and nostrils as it emerged as though it were acid not filthy water jesus said the same voice that had earlier commented on the possibility of my death he pretty much swallowed half the barrel the first man spoke again for the last time mr parker who hired you to follow joel tobias no more i said and i hated the pleading tone of my voice i was broken no more just be straight with us but this is your last chance the next time well leave you to drown bennett patchett i said i was ashamed at my weakness but i didnt want to go under again i didnt want to die that way i coughed again but less water emerged this time damiens father came a third voice one that i had not heard before it was deeper than the rest the voice of a black man he sounded tired hes talking about damiens father why said the first voice again why did he hire you he employs joel tobiass girlfriend he was concerned about her he thought tobias might be beating her youre lying i felt him reach for the sack again and i pulled away no i said its the truth bennetts a good man he was just worried about the girl shit said the black man all this because joel cant keep his old lady in line quiet did the girl say something to patchett to make him think this no theyre his own suspicions nothing more theres more to it than that though isnt there tell me weve come this far its nearly over now i had no dignity left he wants to know why his son died damien shot himself the why wont bring him back thats hard for bennett to accept hes lost his boy his only son hes hurting for a time nothing else was said and i experienced the first glimmer of hope that i might yet come out of this alive and perhaps that bennett would not suffer for my weakness the interrogator leaned in close to me his breath was warm against my cheek and i felt the terrible intimacy that is part of the pact between the tormented and the tormentor why did you follow tobias to his rig i swore if tobias had made that tail too i was more out of practice than i thought patchett doesnt like him and he wanted evidence to present to the girl that might make her leave him i thought that maybe he might be seeing someone else on the side that was why i followed him and jimmy jewel tobias drives a truck jimmy jewel knows the trucking business jimmy jewel knows smuggling he told me that he tried to recruit tobias but tobias didnt bite thats all i know he considered this it almost sounds plausible he said sleazy but plausible im tempted to give you the benefit of the doubt except that i know youre an intelligent man youre inquisitive im pretty certain that joel tobiass sexual habits were not the only branch of his affairs that you might have been tempted to examine i could see his boots through the gap at the bottom of the sack they were shiny and black i watched as they moved away from me a conversation was conducted nearby in tones too soft for me to pick up on what was being said instead i concentrated on breathing i was shaking and my throat was raw eventually i heard footsteps approaching and those black boots appeared in my field of vision again now you listen mr parker the girls welfare isnt anything that you need to concern yourself with shes in no danger i guarantee you there will be no further repercussions for you or mr patchett as long as you both just walk away i give you my word on that nobody is being hurt here do you understand nobody whatever you suspect or think you know youre wrong your word as a soldier i said i sensed him react and braced myself for the blow but none came i guessed that youd be a smartass he said dont get any ideas im sure that youre all riled up or you will be once we let you go and youll be tempted to come looking for payback but i wouldnt if i were you you come after us because of this and well kill you this is none of your concern i repeat this is none of your concern i regret what had to be done here tonight i truly do were not animals and if youd cooperated at the start then it wouldnt have been necessary consider it a lesson hard learned he pulled the sack back down were done here take him back to his car and treat him gently the tape was cut from my legs i was helped to my feet and escorted to the car i was disoriented and weak and i had to stop halfway to throw up hands held me tight at the elbows but at least i wasnt being made to walk bent over with my arms raised behind my back this time i was put in the trunk not the back of the car when we got to the bear i was laid facedown on the parking lot and my restraints were removed my car keys jangled as they landed beside me the voice that had earlier spoken of joel tobiass old lady told me to keep my head covered for a count of ten i remained where i was until the car pulled away then raised myself slowly and stumbled to the edge of the lot i could see the rear lights of a car racing away red i thought maybe a ford too far to make out the plates the bear was dark and my car was the only vehicle still in the lot i didnt call the cops i didnt call anybody not then instead i drove home fighting nausea all the way my shirt and jeans were filthy and torn i threw them in the trash as soon as i reached the house i wanted to shower to clean the dirt of the blue moon from my skin but i elected simply to scrub myself in the sink i wasnt ready for the sensation of water pouring onto my face again that night i woke up twice when the sheets touched my face and i lashed out at them in panic after the second time i chose to sleep on top of not under them and lay awake as my mind shuffled names like cards damien patchett jimmy jewel joel tobias i replayed in my head the voices i had heard the sense of humiliation i had felt as they threatened me with rape so that i would know them when i heard them again i let anger course through me like an electrical charge you should have killed me you should have left me to drown in that water because now im going to come after you and im not going to do it alone the men ill bring with me will be worth a dozen of you military training or not whatever youre doing whatever operation youre running im going to tear it apart and leave you to die in the wreckage for what you did to me im going to kill you all the body of jeremiah webber had been discovered by his beloved daughter after he failed to make a lunch appointment with her a meeting dictated at least as much by the desire to hit on her old man for a few bucks and a good meal as the childs natural affection for her parent suzanne webber loved her father but he was a curious man and her mother had hinted that his financial affairs did not bear close scrutiny his shortcomings as a husband were merely one aspect of his flawed nature as far as his first exwife was concerned he could not be trusted to behave properly under any circumstances with the exception of ensuring his daughters wellbeing in that at least she could be certain that he would act according to what passed for his better nature and as has been said before she liked jeremiah webber his second exwife who had no residual affection for him whatsoever regarded him as a reptile when his daughter found her fathers body lying on the kitchen floor her first thought was that there had been a robbery or an assault then she saw the gun by his hand and given the implied precariousness of his financial circumstances wondered if he had taken his own life although in shock she had retained sufficient selfpossession to use her cell phone to call the police and not to touch anything in the room she then spoke to her mother while she waited for the police to arrive she sat outside not inside the smell in the house distressed her it was the stink of her fathers mortality and something else something that she could not quite place later she would describe it to her mother as the lingering stench of matches that had been lit in an effort to disguise the aftermath of a bad trip to the restroom she smoked a cigarette and cried and listened as her mother through her own tears denied the possibility that webber had shot himself he was selfish she said but he wasnt that selfish it quickly became apparent to the investigating detectives that jeremiah webber had not in fact taken his own life not unless he was a perfectionist who having botched the first shot had found the will and strength to pop a second one in his head in order to finish the job given the angle of entry that would also have required him to be a contortionist and possibly superhuman considering the nature of the catastrophic injuries inflicted by the first bullet so it looked like jeremiah webber had been murdered and yet and yet there was powder residue on his hand true it might have been possible for his killer or killers to put the gun against his head and apply pressure to his finger in order to force him to pull the trigger but that usually only happened in movies and it was easier said than done no professional was going to take the risk of putting a gun in the hands of someone who didnt want to die at best there was a chance that before he was encouraged to plant one in his own head he might fire a shot into the ceiling or the floor or someone elses head in addition there was no evidence of a struggle and no marks on his body to indicate that webber might have been restrained at some point so what if suggested one of the detectives he shot himself botched it and then someone else finished the job for him out of a sense of mercy but who stands back and watches another man kill himself was webber ill or so overcome by difficulties financial or otherwise that he saw no way out of them but to take his own life had he then found someone loyal enough to stay by his side as he fired what was intended to be the fatal shot and then having watched him fail to deliver the coup de grâce it seemed unlikely better then to assume that the suicide was forced upon him that the hands of another placed webbers finger on the trigger and applied the pressure required to fire the first bullet into his brain and that those same hands finished him off instead of leaving him to die in agony on his kitchen floor and yet and yet who tries to make a murder look like a suicide and then undoes all that good work by firing a second shot an amateur thats who an amateur or someone who just doesnt care about appearances then there was the matter of the wineglasses three in all one smashed on the floor and the other two on the kitchen table both had been drunk from and both had fingerprints upon them no that wasnt quite true both had webbers fingerprints all over them and the second glass had smears that were almost fingerprints except that when examined they proved to be without whorls or loops or arches they were entirely blank leading to the suggestion that at least one other person in the room with webber had been wearing gloves or some form of patch to mask the prints perhaps in an effort to put webber at ease initially for what kind of killer would choose to leave evidence upon a wineglass of his presence at a crime scene the glass was sent for testing in the hope that dna traces might be obtained from it in time that analysis would discover saliva which when analyzed revealed the presence of unusual chemical compounds a drug of some kind a clever lab technician acting on little more than a hunch separated the drug and its metabolites from the saliva using a metaldoped solgel immobilized in a glass capillary and found it to be fluoruoracil or fu commonly used to treat solid tumors the second person in the room with jeremiah webber on the night that he died was thus shown to be a male on chemotherapy which led to a possible resolution of the fingerprint issue certain drugs used in the treatment of cancer among them capecitabine caused inflammation of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet leading to peeling and blistering of the skin and over time the loss of fingerprints unfortunately by the time this was revealed weeks had passed since the discovery of the body and subsequent events had played themselves out to the end and so on the day after the body was discovered the police began investigating webbers exwives his daughter and his business associates in time they would find more than one dead end but the strangest of all was the correspondence in webbers files relating to an institution described as the gutelieb foundation or more often merely the foundation because the foundation did not appear to exist the lawyers who purported to represent it were shysters with holes in their shoes and they claimed never to have encountered in person anyone from the foundation all bills were paid by money order and all communication was carried out via yahoo the woman who took messages on the foundations behalf worked out of the back of a strip mall in natick sitting in a booth surrounded by five other women all of them purporting to be secretaries and pas for companies or businessmen whose offices were their cars or their bed rooms or a table in a coffee shop the secretarial services company secserve which the detectives investigating webbers death felt was a name open to misinterpretation particularly if spoken aloud informed the police that all bills relating to the foundation were paid once again by money order secserve had never raised any objection to this form of payment after all it was perfectly legitimate some of the companys other clients had been known to pay in bags of quarters and in the current climate secserves boss whose name was obrad was just relieved when people paid at all what kind of name is obrad anyway asked one of the detectives it is serbian said obrad it means to make happy he had even had it written on his business cards obrad make happy the cops were tempted to correct his grammar and point out that statements like this combined with the possibilities for misunderstanding inherent in his company name were likely to get him into trouble at some point but they did not obrad was helpful and an enthusiast they didnt want to hurt his feelings and you never spoke to anyone connected with this foundation obrad shook his head everything done on internet now they fill out form forward payment and i make happy obrad did manage to produce a copy of the original contract form filled out over the net they traced it back to a cyber café in providence rhode island and there the trail ended the money orders came from a number of post offices all over new england the same one was never used twice and the transactions were untraceable since the us post office did not accept credit cards as payment for money orders they set about seeking court orders to examine security footage from the post offices in question the existence of the foundation troubled the investigating officers but post offices and internet cafés were as close as they would ever get to it as it happened the foundation was herod and it was only one of the names that he used to disguise his affairs after webbers death the foundation effectively ceased to exist in time herod decided he would reactivate it in another form webber had been punished and the small community through which both men had briefly moved would be aware of the reason why herod was not worried about someone approaching the police they all had something to hide each and every one of them two nights after webbers death yellow tape still indicated the scene of the crime but there was no longer a police presence at the house the alarm system had been activated and the local patrols made regular passes to discourage rubberneckers the alarm on the house went off at am the local police were at the door just as the clock tipped am the front door was closed and all of the windows appeared to be secure at the back of the house they found a crow with a broken neck it appeared to have flown into the kitchen window activating the alarm although neither of the cops could remember ever seeing a crow in the dead of night the alarm went off again at am and a third time at am the alarm companys monitoring system indicated that each time the source was the kitchen window beneath which the dead crow had been found they suspected a malfunction of some kind which they would check in the morning at the request of the police the alarm was deactivated at am the kitchen window was opened from outside using a thin piece of metal warped at the center so that its top half was perpendicular to its lower half enabling it to be twisted in order to move the latch unlocking the window a man climbed through and alighted gently on the kitchen floor he sniffed the air uncertainly then lit a cigarette had the light been better and had anyone been there to see him he would have been revealed as a disheveled figure wearing an old black jacket and black trousers that nearly but not quite matched his shirt might once have been white but was now faded to a bone gray its collar frayed the mans hair was long and slicked back revealing a pronounced widows peak his teeth were yellow as were his fingernails all stained from decades of smoking his movements were graceful although it was the predatory grace of a mantid or a spider he reached into his jacket pocket and removed a maglite he pulled the drapes on the kitchen windows twisted the top of the flashlight and allowed its beam to play upon the table the chairs and the dried blood on the floor he did not move but simply followed the light taking in all that it showed but touching nothing when he had concluded his inspection of the kitchen he progressed through the other rooms of the house as before only looking never touching finally he returned to the kitchen lit another cigarette from the first and disposed of the remains of the latter in the sink then he retreated to the door connecting the kitchen to the hallway and leaned against the frame trying to pinpoint the source of his unease the death of webber had not come entirely as a surprise the man in the kitchen kept a close eye on the activities of webber and his kind their occasional lack of scruples did not surprise him all collectors were the same their desire would sometimes overcome their better natures but webber was not really a collector true he had kept some items for himself over the years but he made his money as a middleman a facilitator a front for others a certain degree of good faith was expected from such individuals they might sometimes play one buyer off against another but they rarely actively cheated it was unwise to do so for the shortterm gain from a single deal handled dishonestly might well damage ones reputation in webbers case the damage revealed in a smear of blood and gray matter had been fatal the visitor took a long pull on his cigarette his nostrils twitching the smell that had so disturbed webbers daughter and which to her shame she associated with the relaxation of her fathers muscles after death had faded but the intruders senses were intensely acute and largely unaffected by his love of cigarettes the smell bothered him it did not belong it was alien behind him was the darkness of the hallway but it was not empty forms moved in the gloom gray figures with skin like withered fruit shapes without substance hollow men and though he felt them gathering he did not turn around they were his creatures despite their hatred for him the man who stood in the kitchen called himself the collector he sometimes went by the name of kushiel the demon reputed to act as hells jailer which might simply have been a dark joke on his part he was not a collector in the manner of those for whom webber solicited items no the collector viewed himself more as a settler of debts a striker of balances there were some who might even have termed him a killer for that ultimately was what he did but it would have represented a misunderstanding of the work in which the collector was engaged those whom he killed had by their sins forfeited the right to life more to the point their souls were forfeit and without a soul a body was merely an empty vessel to be broken and discarded from each one that he killed he took a token often an item of particular sentimental value to the victim it was his way of remembering although he also took a considerable degree of pleasure from his collection and my how it had grown over the years sometimes those soulless beings lingered and the collector gave them a purpose even if that purpose was only to add to their own number now as they prowled back and forth behind him he sensed a shift in their mood if such lost hopeless shells of men could be said to retain even a semblance of real human emotion other than rage they were frightened but it was fear tempered by an edge of was that expectation they were like a crowd of minor playground bullies cowed by one stronger than them but now awaiting the approach of the big dog the lead jock the one who would put the usurper back in his rightful place the collector rarely felt uncertain he knew too much of the ways of this honeycomb world and he hunted in its shadows he was the one to be feared the predator the judge without mercy but here in this expensively appointed kitchen of a house in a wealthy suburb the collector was nervous he sniffed the air again finding the taint that lingered he walked to the window reached for the drapes then paused as though fearful of what he might see on the other side finally he pulled them apart stepping back as he did so his right hand raised slightly to protect himself there was only his own reflection but something else had been here and not the man who had delivered the shot that killed webber for the collector knew all about him herod always searching never finding herod who lived behind aliases and shell companies who was so clever and so adept at concealment that even the collector had failed to track him down his time would come eventually after all the collector was engaged in gods work he was gods murderer and who could hope to hide from the divine no this was not herod this was another and the collector could smell him in his nostrils and taste him on his tongue could almost see the faintest trace of his presence like the condensation of a breath upon the glass he had been here watching as webber died wait the collectors eyes widened as he made connections speculation hardening into belief not watching webber as he died but watching herod as webber died the collector knew then why he had been drawn to this place knew why herod had been assembling his own private collection of arcane material even if he believed that herod did not yet himself fully understand the final purpose behind his efforts he was here he had come at last the laughing man the old tempter the one who waits behind the glass i woke feeling poorly rested and with a deep ache in my throat my nose and my lungs my right hand wouldnt stop shaking and hot water spilled on my shirt when i tried to make a cup of coffee in the end it didnt matter about the coffee it tasted of filthy water anyway i sat in a chair looking over the marshes my rage from the night before had departed to be replaced by a lassitude that was not quite deep enough to block out my fear i didnt want to think about bennett patchett and his dead son or joel tobias or containers filled with a rushing darkness id experienced delayed shock before but never like this added to the pain and the fear was the shame that i felt for naming bennett patchett wed all like to believe that in order to protect another person and to save a little something of ourselves we might hold out against torture but its not true everybody breaks eventually and to stop myself from being drowned in stagnant water id have told them anything that they wanted id have confessed to crimes that i hadnt committed and promised to commit crimes repugnant to my nature i might even have betrayed my own child and the knowledge of that made me curl in upon myself they had unmanned me in the ruins of the blue moon after a time i called bennett patchett before i could speak he told me that karen emory hadnt shown up for work that day and he hadnt been able to get a reply when he called the house he was worried about her he said but i cut him off i told him of what had happened the night before and confessed what i had done he didnt seem troubled or even surprised they were military he asked exmilitary i think and they knew about damien for that reason i want to believe that theyre not going to cause you trouble not if you just go back to mourning your son in silence is that what youd do mr parker is that what you want me to do are you going to back away from all this i dont know sir right now i need some time for what but he sounded resigned as though no answer i could give would be good enough to find my anger again i said and maybe somehow i gave him the one answer that sufficed when you do ill be here he said and hung up i dont know how long i stayed in that chair but eventually i forced myself to my feet i had to do something or else i would sink just as assuredly as if the men at the blue moon had released their grip and left me to fall headfirst to the bottom of a container of standing water i picked up the phone and called new york it was time to bring in some serious help after that i showered and i made myself hold my face up to the falling water jackie garner contacted me an hour later it looks like tobias is moving out he said hes got a bag packed and hes out by his rig giving it one last check it made sense they probably figured that theyd scared me enough to proceed with whatever it was they were planning and they might almost have been right stay with him for as long as you can i said hes making a run to canada you have a passport its at home ill call mom she can bring it to me even if tobias gets on the road i can stay with him until she catches up mom drives like a demon that i could believe you okay said jackie you sound sick i told him the basics of what had occurred the night before and warned him about keeping his distance from tobias when you figure out the route hes taking you can pass him and wait for him over the border any sign of trouble you let him go these guys arent screwing around so youre not dropping this i guess not i said in fact companys coming from new york asked jackie and he could barely keep the hope out of his voice from new york man wait until i tell the fulcis he said and he sounded like a child at christmas theyll be buzzed i knocked three times waiting a minute or two between each knock before karen emory answered she was wearing a robe and slippers her hair was unkempt and she looked as though she hadnt slept much i knew how she felt she had also been crying yes said karen emory what do you she stopped talking and squinted youre the guy the one who was at the restaurant she said thats right my name is charlie parker im a private investigator get lost she slammed the door closed and my foot wasnt there to stop it sticking your foot in someones door is a good way to get maimed or have your toes broken its also trespassing and i had enough of a reputation with the cops as it was i was trying to keep my nose clean i knocked again and kept knocking until karen came back to the door im going to call the cops if you dont leave me alone im warning you i dont think youre going to call the cops ms emory your boyfriend wouldnt like it it was a low blow but like most low blows it hit home she bit her lip please just go away id like to talk to you for a moment believe me im taking more of a chance than you are im not going to get you into any trouble just a few minutes of your time is all i ask and then ill be gone she looked past me checking to make sure that there was nobody on the street then stepped aside to let me in the door opened directly into the living area with a kitchen ahead and stairs to the right and what looked like the entrance to a basement beneath them she closed the front door behind me and stood with her arms folded waiting for me to speak can we sit down i asked she seemed inclined to say no then relented and led me to the kitchen it was bright and cheerful decorated in whites and yellows it smelled of fresh paint i took a seat at the table you have a nice house i said she nodded its joels he did all of the work himself she leaned against the sink not sitting keeping as much distance between us as possible you say youre a private detective i suppose i should have asked for some id before i let you in its usually a good idea i said i flipped my wallet and showed my license to her she examined it in a cursory way without touching it i knew your mother a little i said we went to the same high school oh my mom lives in wesley now thats nice i said for want of something better to say not really her new husband is an asshole she searched in the pocket of her robe and came out with a lighter and a pack of cigarettes she lit one then put the pack and the lighter back in her pocket she didnt offer one to me i didnt smoke but its always polite to ask joel says that bennett patchett hired you i couldnt really deny it but if nothing else it confirmed that the men at the blue moon had spoken to tobias after last night and he in turn had spoken of it to his girlfriend thats right she rolled her eyes in exasperation he meant well i said he was worried about you joel says that he doesnt think i should work there no more he says i have to quit my job and find another we had a fight about it she glared at me the implication being that it was my fault and what do you say i love him and i love this house if it comes down to it therell be other jobs i guess but id prefer to keep working for mr patchett her eyes grew damp a tear fell from her right eye and she rubbed it away hurriedly this whole case was a mess sometimes thats just the way things are i wasnt even sure why i was here apart from ensuring that joel tobias hadnt done to karen emory what once upon a time cliffie andreas had done to sally cleaver has joel hit you or abused you in any way ms emory there was a long pause no not like you or mr patchett think we had a big argument a while back and it got out of control thats all i watched her closely i didnt think it was the first time that shed been hit by a boyfriend the way she spoke suggested that she regarded the occasional slap as an occupational hazard a downside of dating a particular type of man if it happened often enough a woman might start to believe that she was at fault that something in her a flaw in her psychological makeup caused men to respond in a particular way if karen emory wasnt already thinking along those lines then she was close to it was it the first time that hed hit you she nodded it was what do they say out of character for him joels a good man she stumbled a little on the last three words as though she were trying to convince herself as well as me hes just under a lot of stress at the moment really why would that be karen shrugged and looked away its hard working for yourself does he talk to you about his work she didnt reply is that what you were arguing about still no reply does he frighten you she licked her lips no this time it was a lie and his friends his army buddies what about them she stubbed out the halfsmoked cigarette in an ashtray you have to go now she said you can tell mr patchett that im fine ill give him my notice this week karen youre not alone in this if you need help i can put you in touch with the right people theyre discreet and theyll advise you on what you can do to protect yourself you dont even have to mention joels name if you dont want to but even as i spoke i could see that my words werent going to have any effect karen emory had hitched herself to joel tobiass star if she left him shed have to go back to bennett patchetts dorms and in time another man would come along one who might be worse than tobias and shed go with him just to escape i waited for a moment but it was clear that i was going to get no more out of her she gestured to the door and followed me down the hallway as she opened the front door and i slipped past her to stand on the front porch she spoke again what would joel do if he knew youd been here she asked she sounded like a mischievous child but it was all bravado her eyes were bright with tears waiting to be shed i dont know i said but i think his friends might kill me what are they doing karen why are they so worried about someone finding out she swallowed hard and her face crumpled because theyre dying she said theyre all dying and the door closed in my face the sailmaker was still barren of customers as i peered through the glass door and jimmy jewel was still seated on the same stool at the bar but there were now papers scattered before him and he was checking figures on a desk calculator the light was constantly changing in the bar shards of sunlight broke the murk only to be swallowed up again by the movement of the clouds like shoals of silver fish disappearing into the oceans darkness although the sailmaker should have been open for business by now jimmy had stopped earle from unlocking the door the sailmaker had inherited some of the habits of the blue moon it might be open before midday or at five in the afternoon but it might not the regulars knew better than to go knocking on the door seeking entry thered be a place for them when jimmy and earle were ready and once they were settled in nobody would bother them unless they fell on the floor and made a mess but i wasnt a regular and so i knocked jimmy looked up considered me for a time while he debated whether or not he could get away with telling me to go play with the white lines on i then gestured to earle to let me in earle did so then went back to filling the coolers which didnt present too much of a challenge since the bar didnt stock anything that might have counted as exotic when it came to beers you could still order a miller high life at the sailmaker and pbr was drunk without a shot of irony on the side i took a seat at the bar and earle departed to grab a fresh pot of coffee for jimmy if id drunk as much coffee every day as jimmy did i wouldnt be able to write my name without trembling on jimmy though it seemed to have no effect maybe he had vast reservoirs of calm on which to draw you know it seems like only moments since you were last here said jimmy either time is passing more quickly than it should or youre just not giving me enough time to start missing you tobias is on the road again as the song goes i said jimmy kept his eyes on his papers adding figures and making notes in the margins why is this such a beef with you you work for the government now no i prefer a private pension as for why this is a beef i made some new friends last night really you must be pleased strikes me that you could use all the friends that you can get these ones tried drowning me until i told them what they wanted to know friends like them i can do without jimmys pen stopped moving and what did they want to know they were interested in why i was asking questions about joel tobias and what did you tell them the truth you didnt feel the urge to lie i was too busy trying not to die to make anything up so youve already been warned off once and not gently and youre still asking questions thats the point they werent polite polite what are you a duchess theres also the matter of where they took me to ask their questions which was the blue moon or whats left of it jimmy pushed the calculator away i knew youd bring bad luck with you i knew it as soon as you walked in that first time i think you might have helped by getting in joel tobiass face over in deweys but yeah they connected me to you or vice versa taking me to the blue moon was a way of warning us both except you didnt get the business end of the message earle had returned and was now watching us he didnt look happy at the return to the subject of the blue moon but it was always hard to tell with earle he had a face like a bad tattoo jimmy meanwhile had gone somewhere else for a time when he eventually spoke he sounded tired and old maybe i should get out of this business he said i didnt know if he was referring to the bar or smuggling or even life itself hed get out of them all eventually if that was any consolation but i didnt offer that thought i just let him talk you know i have money tied up in this wharf i thought it would pay dividends when they started developing it but now it looks like the only cash ill see out of it is the insurance money when it collapses into casco bay and then this place will probably take me with it so i wont get to enjoy it then he patted the bar softly and fondly the way a man might stroke a beloved if ornery old dog i always thought of myself as a gentleman trader he continued it was a game moving stuff over the border trying to steal a nickel or two from uncle sam people got hurt sometimes but i did my best to make sure that didnt happen too often i got into drugs kind of reluctantly if that makes any sense to you and i found ways to salve my conscience about it mostly though if im being honest i dont think about it and it doesnt bother me too much same with people doesnt matter if theyre chinamen looking to work in the kitchen of some restaurant in boston or whores from eastern europe im just the middleman he turned to gauge my response i guess you think that im a hypocrite or that im just fooling myself about all of this you know what you are i said im not here to absolve you i just want information cut to the chase in other words yes earle snapped into life and refreshed jimmys coffee knowing instinctively that his boss now needed his gears oiled he found a second mug and put it down beside me i held my hand over it to indicate that i didnt want any and thought for a moment that earle might have been tempted to pour the hot coffee over my fingers just to let me know that he could care less what i did or didnt want in the end he contented himself with turning his back on me and walking to the far end of the bar where he retrieved a book from under the counter and began to read or to pretend to read it was a penguin paperback one of the old blackjacketed classics although i couldnt see the name id like to have said that i wasnt surprised but i was earle didnt seem like the kind of guy who was big on selfimprovement jimmy followed the direction of my gaze im getting old he continued we all are there was a time when earle wouldnt have picked up a book not unless it was a phone book and he was trying not to leave bruises on someone but the years mellow us some i suppose in good ways and bad there was also a time when earle wouldnt have been taken so easily by someone like joel tobias either but the guy managed him without blinking he wanted to he could have hurt earle bad i could see it in him but he didnt no he really did just want us to leave him alone but his needs are irrelevant you might say i want to know what hes doing its important to my business but its also crucial that the existing balance is maintained the mexicans the colombians the dominicans the russians the cops me and just about anyone else with an interest in the movement of goods across the border we all exist in a state of equilibrium its very fragile and if someone who doesnt understand the rules starts screwing around with it then it will all collapse and cause wicked amounts of trouble for everybody i couldnt figure out tobiass angle and being out of the loop makes me nervous so so so i could have given customs a headsup but never ask a question to which you dont already know the answer when it comes to the law if it suits me to feed tobias to them then ill do it but only when i know what hes carrying across the border ive called in favors every time joel tobias gets a job a copy of the paperwork comes to me lately hes been working interstate in new england and it all seems legit this week he has a job transporting feed from canada and that means a border crossing and you have men on him jimmy smiled lets just say that i convinced some friends of mine to take a closer look at joel tobias and that was all i could get from jimmy jewel barring the name of the company in quebec that was supplying the feed and the one in maine that had ordered it but i believed that it represented a great deal of what he knew about joel tobias he was as much in the dark as i was i walked back to my car the smell of fetid water was in my nostrils again and on my clothes i realized that it was coming from the mustang which had absorbed some of the stink of the blue moon then again i might simply have been imagining it one more facet of my response to what had taken place i drove out to the blue moon i was always going to eventually there was an oil drum in the center of the floor beneath what was left of the charred roof insects buzzed above the dark water inside it i felt the urge to recoil at the sight of it and i started to breathe faster as my system responded to the memories associated with the smell of this place instead i took my little flashlight from my pocket and searched the ruin but the men who had brought me there had left no trace of their presence outside i called bennett patchett and asked him to put together a list of the names of those who had served alongside his son in iraq and who were now back here especially those who might have attended his funeral he told me that hed do it straight away so i guess you got your anger back he said it seems i had untapped reserves i replied and hung up psychological or not the mustang still smelled i took it to a place in south portland phils onestop that usually did a good job hand washing it instead of using a hose as a hose found every leak in the seals and made the upholstery so damp that the windows fogged up they cleaned the mustang inside and out while i drank a soda even working at the dirt behind the fenders which was how they found the device in the best possible way phil ducasse looked like the kind of guy who ran a onestop valet and auto repair shop i dont think he owned any clothing that didnt have an oil stain on it somewhere he showed a five oclock shadow by midday and his hands appeared dirty even when they were clean he was carrying a few pounds of burger weight and his eyes held the weary impatience of one who would always know more about an engines problems than the next guy and who could fix everything quicker than anyone else if only he had enough time to fix everything which he hadnt now he used a handheld lamp to point out an object around twelve inches long that was bound with black duct tape and attached to the inside of the fender with a pair of magnets ernesto thought it might be a bomb said phil referring to the little mexican who had been working on the car when the device was found ernesto was now standing some distance from the auto shop along with most of the other employees although nobody had yet called the cops what do you think phil shrugged could be so how come were standing here with our noses pressed against it because it probably isnt that probably is reassuring why you think its a bomb i looked more closely at the device from its shape it seems to be mainly electronic components i dont see anything that looks like explosives you want to know what i think said phil i think youve been tagged its a bug it made sense it could have been placed on my car while i was being questioned at the blue moon its big i said you couldnt call it inconspicuous inconspicuous enough not to be found unless someone went looking for it you want to be certain i can make a call who to kid i know hes a genius is he discreet you got a wallet yes then hes discreet twenty minutes later a young man with bright yellow dreadlocks and a scrawny beard and wearing a rustic overtones tshirt arrived on a red yamaha street tracker bike seventyseven said phil he was beaming like a proud parent at graduation xs full restoration i did most of that the kid helped some but i bled for that bike the kids name was mike he was scrupulously polite and insisted on calling me sir which made me feel i was representing the aarp wow neat he said when he took his first look at the piece of equipment on my car he carefully removed it and placed it on a workbench nearby using only his fingertips he traced the outline of each piece of equipment under the tape he then used a blade to make small incisions in the tape so he could examine what lay beneath when he was done he nodded approvingly well i said its a tracking device pretty sophisticated although it may not look that way what with all the tape wrapped around it some of this equipment well id guess that its military grade could be that the government doesnt like you he looked at me hopefully but i didnt bite anyway whoever put it there probably didnt have a whole lot of time to work if he had hed have used something smaller that could be hidden more easily and run it off the car battery so it wouldnt need its own power supply to do that though youd need fifteen twenty minutes to work undisturbed he used a screwdriver to point out a bulge at the center of the device thats a gps receiver just like the ones used in a regular satnav it pinpoints the cars location so it can be checked on a pc there are eight twelvevolt screw terminal batteries at the end providing the power theyd have to be changed regularly so if it was part of some longterm surveillance it would make sense to come back and fit the smaller version to the car battery when the opportunity presented itself but this baby would still do fine to be getting along with the magnets wouldnt affect the reported position and it would be easy to remove once it had done its job will whoever put it there know that its been detached i dont think so i deliberately didnt move it far from the car and i dont believe the tracking is that sensitive i leaned back against the bench and swore i should have been more careful i had kept an eye on my mirrors when i was on my way to visit both karen emory and jimmy jewel and had taken a circuitous route with dead ends and uturns just in case but had picked up no signs of anyone following me now i understood why in addition the men who had interrogated me at the blue moon now knew that i had been to see both karen and jimmy which meant they were aware that their warnings to back off had fallen on deaf ears you want me to put it back where you found it asked mike you serious said phil maybe he should just strap it to his chest so they can track him around the house as well uh i dont think you want to do that sir said mike sarcasm didnt seem to have much effect on him which made me like him more i looked out at the lot a big rig pulled in and flashed its lights for assistance i thought of joel tobias i wondered where he was now and what he might be bringing over the border the rig had jersey plates jersey phil followed my gaze hey i dont know the driver he said makes no difference to me instead of sending the tracking device to jersey i told mike to put the unit back where hed found it after all he seemed pleased that id managed to catch up with his own thought processes at last my knowledge of the units presence was a weapon that could be used against whomever put it there if the right opportunity presented itself i paid mike generously for his time and he gave me his cell phone number in case i ever needed his help again good kid i said as phil and i watched him go smart too my sisters boy said phil he didnt call you uncle phil i told you he was discreet i also tipped ernesto he thanked me but clearly felt that the shock hed received merited a bigger tip since he hadnt actually been blown up i ignored his pained expression you got any idea who put that thing on your car said phil i do you figure theyll come at you possibly you got help its on its way it was me and someone was putting militarygrade surveillance packages on my car id want the kind of help with a gun is it that kind of help no i said its the kind of help with lots of guns they hijacked tobias when he was only a few miles south of moosehorn on route a car had been behind him since hed crossed the border but hed paid it little heed hed made this run so many times that hed grown casual his main concern was the us customs post at coburn gore and once he passed through safely he tended to switch off on this occasion he was also frustrated he was bringing back only a fraction of what he had anticipated and he was tired of taking on the burden of these trips alone as the fatalities had mounted their group had contracted to its core it meant more work and more risk for everybody but the rewards would be commensurately greater in the end there had been a problem at the warehouse that day canadian cops had been crawling all over the neighboring complex as part of a drug operation that was likely to be ongoing for a couple of days and it seemed unwise to begin moving items within a stones throw of the law faced with the choice of hanging around or trying another run when everything was quieter tobias had taken the second option later though hed berate himself for not being more wary on the journey home but hed been assured that parker had been taken care of and the tracking device had confirmed that the detective had still been in portland when tobias was an hour into his trip the detective concerned tobias but not as much as jimmy jewel did hed told the others about jewel immediately after that first clumsy approach in deweys and how it looked like he was getting curious about the economics of tobiass operation but theyd advised him to see how it played out the best that he could do was to convince them to let the operation rest for a time but as the days passed without incident they grew impatient and soon he was back on the crossborder run although for a while they kept tabs on jimmy and the big elephant who watched his back but it seemed like jimmy had decided that joel tobias wasnt worth worrying about joel wasnt so sure but the others had done their best to convince him otherwise so with jimmy apparently minding his own business and no sign of anyone snooping around joel had begun to relax a little he was also tired he was taking on more and more runs as the demand for what they were selling increased theyd told him that this would happen just as soon as word got around about the quality and rarity of what was on offer until recently they hadnt moved anything that wasnt already sold but now joel was transporting items in anticipation of the final big sale the fire sale as they had begun to refer to it they had always known that those initial trickle sales might raise warning flags somewhere but they were necessary to bring in some funds and confirm the value and extent of what would ultimately become available now the big rewards were in sight but joel was the point man and when jewel and then the detective had come sniffing he had been seriously unnerved his advance payments had already increased substantially but not as much as joel would have liked seeing as how he was taking all of the risks words had been exchanged on top of their initial casual approach to the jewel business it had made joel resentful he knew that a confrontation was coming maybe he should have kept his mouth shut but deep down he felt that he was right which was why hed spoken up to begin with it took a lot to make joel mad he was a simmerer but when he did go off then heaven help anyone who got caught by the blast hed also been having more and more bad dreams and the disruption of his sleep patterns had made him testier with karen and he hated that she was a special girl and he was lucky to be with her but sometimes she just didnt know when to stop asking questions and stay quiet ever since damien patchett and the rest of them had died shed been different perhaps fearful that the same fate might befall him but joel had no intention of taking his own life still damiens death had hit him harder than the earlier ones three of them were dead now three of his old squad all by their own hands but damien had been the best of them he always had been damien and the others had started appearing to him in his dreams bloody and ruined they spoke to him but not in english he couldnt understand what they were saying it was as if they had learned a new language on the other side of the grave but even as he dreamed he wondered if they were really his old brothers in arms that he was seeing they scared him and their eyes were wrong they were black and filled with fluid like oily water their bodies were warped their backs hunched their arms too long the fingers thin and grasping jesus no wonder he was tense at least the border runs were coming to an end hed carefully cultivated the customs officials and the goons from homeland security his license plate holder identified him as a veteran as did the stickers and decals in the cab he wore an army baseball cap and was careful to listen to the stories from the older veterans who now manned the border he would slip them a pack of cigarettes occasionally even playing on his injuries when necessary and in return they smoothed the way for him the others had no idea how hard he had worked on his image and how much the success of their endeavor was dependent upon him with all of this on his mind he hadnt been paying as much attention as he should have been to the car behind him when it passed he was glad to see it go but that was the rig drivers natural response to any vehicle that got too close eventually you knew that they were going to try to pass and you just had to hope that they did it sensibly oh there were truckers who liked playing around with impatient motorists and others who just took the view that they were the biggest baddest sons of bitches on the road and if you wanted to screw around with them then it was your funeral sometimes literally joel had never been that way even before hed started the border runs where drawing the attention of the law to himself by driving carelessly could see him end up in jail for a long time even though there wasnt much room and the trees were practically scratching at his cab he had pulled over slightly to let the car pass it wasnt a smart place to pass as they were approaching a bend in the road and if someone else came at speed from the opposite direction then everyone involved would need as much blacktop as possible if they werent all to end up as roadkill but the way ahead was clear and he watched the red lights disappear leaving the road empty and dark half a mile later he saw the flashing lights and someone waving a pair of neon glowsticks he hit the brakes as the beams of his truck caught the yellow plymouth that had overtaken him earlier it was sideon bisected by the white line beside it was another car the one with the flashing redandblue lights he couldnt make out any markings on it though which was odd a figure in uniform approached him its head slightly misshapen he rolled down the window what seems to be the problem he asked as a flashlight shone in his face forcing him to raise his hand to shield his eyes in that moment the figure produced a gun and two other men emerged from the tree line armed with semiautomatic weapons their faces were hidden behind ghoulish masks and now the man in uniform was pulling a mask down on his face too but not before joel got a look at him and thought mexican this was confirmed when the man spoke keep your hands where we can see them buey he said we dont want nobody to get hurt we cool joel nodded the fact that they were masked offered him some reassurance that he wasnt about to be killed killers on a lonely road dont need to worry about being identified by their victim my friends here are going to get in that cab with you and tell you where to go just do as they say and this will all be over and you can go home to your novia sí joel nodded again so they knew that he had a girlfriend which meant that they or someone close to them had been keeping tabs on him in portland he filed that particular piece of information away the cab doors werent locked tobias kept his hands on the steering wheel as the two men climbed in one slipped into the space behind the seat while the other stayed beside joel his body twisted slightly so that he was leaning against the door the gun resting casually across his thigh casual seemed to be the order of the evening thought joel although this changed when the radio of the uniformed man outside crackled into life andale he said waving a hand first at the other vehicles then at joel he pointed his gun at joel through the windshield to make sure he got the message apurate the plymouth reversed a few feet before heading south the second car killed its flashing lights as the uniformed man ran back to join it it pulled over to one side to allow joel to pass then fell into place behind him so that he was hemmed in by both cars where am i going he asked just watch the road buey came the reply joel did as he was told and remained silent he could have asked them if they knew who they were screwing with or made some threat of retribution if they didnt get their asses out of his cab right now and let him go about his business but he didnt all he wanted was to survive this in one piece with his body and with luck his rig intact once he was safely back in portland he would start making calls but he was already working on possibilities if this was a standard hijacking these guys had either picked the wrong truck or theyd been misinformed which meant that they were going to score nothing more lucrative than a couple of grands worth of dry animal feed the other option was that this wasnt a standard hijacking in which case they were very wellinformed indeed and that could only mean trouble and possibly pain for joel ahead of him the plymouth began to signal right follow him said the man behind him and joel began to slow down in order to make the turn the road was narrow and sloped slightly downhill you want me to fit it through the eye of a needle while im at it he asked the machine pistol brushed the skin of his cheek lightly its barrel icy cold i can drive a truck said a voice it was so close to his ear he could feel the warmth of the mans breath on his skin you dont want to do it then i will but then we got no use for you mi hijo joel figured the guy was bluffing but he wasnt about to test his theory he made the turn perfectly and began following the lights of the plymouth once again hey you see what you can do with a little encouragement said the gunman the plymouth flashed its warning lights as they pulled into a clearing before a ruined house its stone chimney still standing intact beside its collapsed roof there were two more men waiting beside a black suv like the others they wore masks but instead of leather jackets they were dressed in suits cheap suits but suits nonetheless joel hit the brakes get out said the gunman joel did as he was told the brown car had joined them and now he and his rig were lit by the headlights of three vehicles one of the men in suits stepped forward he was about a foot shorter than joel and stocky but not fat he stretched out a hand and after a moments hesitation joel shook it the smaller man spoke english with hardly any hint of an accent you can call me raul he said lets make this as quick and easy as possible what have you got in the truck animal feed open it let me see with two guns trained on him joel unlocked the big double doors flashlights shone on the bags of feed stacked on six wooden pallets raul pointed two fingers into the trailer and two men climbed in with knives and began methodically tearing bags apart scattering their contents inside the truck i hope theyre going to clean up after themselves said joel dont worry about it said raul i guarantee you that if they dont find what theyre looking for youll have more significant concerns and what are they looking for more protein in their diet its animal feed you got the wrong rig buddy raul said nothing he lit a cigarette and offered one to joel who declined together the two men watched as bags were cut and searched until the searchers were standing shindeep in the mess its a nice rig said raul it would be a shame to damage it look i told you you got the wrong shipment raul shrugged joel heard movement from behind him his arms were grasped tightly and he was forced down on his knees raul lit a fresh cigarette and squatted so that he and joel were face to face he grabbed a handful of joels hair and placed the tip of the cigarette firmly against joels right cheek just below the bone there was no threat no warning just intense pain the smell of burning flesh and a low sizzling sound that was swamped by joels scream after a couple of seconds raul withdrew the cigarette the tip was still glowing faintly raul blew on it until it was entirely red once again listen to me said raul we could take your rig apart piece by piece and then set it alight before your eyes we could even kill you and bury you in the woods we might not even go to the trouble of killing you before we bury you all of these options are open to us but we dont want to do any of those things because i dont yet have a problem with you personally so here it is i know youre smuggling i want to know what youre smuggling so youre going to show me the traps and i am going to keep burning you until you do now tell me after the third time joel did they left him in the clearing before he departed raul gave joel a salve for his wounds the burn on his face was bad the two to his hands were worse raul had placed the cigarette to the skin between the thumb and forefinger on each hand when that hadnt worked he had threatened to put it out in joels right eye and joel had believed him he told them where the trap was but even after following his instructions they couldnt find it it was a professional job designed to pass undetected during anything but the most painstaking of searches he was forced to show it to them first explaining how the seat came apart so that the space which ran the width of the cab could be accessed he then opened it by the careful application of pressure to its two lower corners the compartment was capable of being divided into smaller sections depending upon what was being transported on this occasion there was a plastic tool box containing a dozen small cylindrical objects similar in length to pieces of chalk and wrapped in layers of cloth and plastic to protect them the men in the cab handed one of them down to raul once it had been stripped of its protection it was ornately carved capped with gold at each end and inset with precious stones raul held it in the palm of his hand testing its weight then asked what is this i dont know said joel im just the transporter i dont ask questions it looks old and valuable raul held out a hand and a flashlight was placed in it he used it to examine the stones more closely these are emeralds and rubies and thats a diamond on the tip the seal in rauls hand dated from bc it was an ancient bureaucratic device used to verify business and legal transactions by impressing the seal into documents inscribed on clay tablets by this point joel had seen enough of them to know but he remained silent carefully raul rewrapped the seal and handed it to one of his men take them all he said and handle them gently he lit another cigarette and smiled as he saw joel wince involuntarily so you say that you just drive and you know nothing about the items that you are paid to transport said raul i dont believe you but thats of no consequence now im going to ask around about those little cylinders and if theyre as valuable as they look i may hold on to some of them you can tell your employers if thats what they are that they may consider it a penalty for attempting to run an operation like this without informing the proper authorities and by that i dont mean us customs if they want to continue transporting such items then they should come talk to me and well work something out why should they talk to you asked joel why not the dominicans or jimmy jewel he saw something flash in rauls eyes and knew that hed hit a nerve because said raul we have the cylinders then he walked away leaving joel to nurse his wounds but not before stamping joels cell phone into pieces and draining most of the fuel from his tanks leaving him with just enough to get to a motel outside of eustis the burn to his face attracted a few glances when he entered the lobby but nobody commented upon it he found the ice machine then wrapped some of the ice in a towel from his room and used it to ease the pain in his hands and face before making the call from his room theres been a problem he said when the phone was picked up he gave a detailed account of all that had occurred leaving out almost nothing well have to get them back came the reply you say that this guy raul wants to keep the seals as some kind of fine thats what he said jesus you think hes going to use them to mark bags of coke i think hes going to try to sell them weve succeeded so far because weve been careful those seals cant turn up on the open market joel did his best to hide his irritation why just because he drove a truck was it assumed that he was some kind of moron after all hed been there at every stage of the operation right from the start without him it would have fallen apart long before now im aware of that he said and was unable to keep the edge from his voice dont get smart with me i didnt lose the consignment yeah well i havent seen enough cash to compensate me for the removal of an eye youve seen more up front than anyone else you dont like the arrangement then walk away joel stared at the wounds on his hands thats not what i meant lets just get this mess fixed up it wont take this raul long to find out what hes got after that a child will be able to piece together whats happening ill start asking around find out who he is jimmy jewel knows you sure pretty sure you ask me i think the instruction to hit us came from him well thats where well start then you say they took everything yeah they got it all go home get some sleep and see to those burns call me tomorrow as soon as youve rested this isnt the only mess that needs to be cleaned up joel didnt ask for clarification on the final comment he was too tired and too sore he hung up the phone and walked to the gas station across the road where he bought a sixpack of beer to drink in his room occasionally holding one of the cold bottles to his damaged cheek as he stared out of the window at the lights of passing cars and the darkness of flagstaff lake after two beers he felt nauseated it had been so long since hed experienced shock that hed almost forgotten the sensation but what had been done to him in the clearing brought back other memories other moments he scratched absentmindedly at his left shin feeling the scar tissue and the hollow in the muscle he called karen but she wasnt home so he left a message on the machine telling her that he was tired and had decided to get a room for the night he also told her that he loved her and apologized for their fight that morning the fight was all the detectives fault his and that meddling old bastard patchett tobias knew enough about the detective from local gossip not to underestimate him and he wasnt sure that threatening him was the way to deal with him but hed been angry as well as relieved when theyd come to him and told him that the detective had been hired to investigate him and his relationship and not the larger operation he wanted to sleep he popped some painkillers and sat on his bed his feet stretched before him he searched in his jacket pocket and withdrew the two exquisitely carved gold loops he had said that the mexicans had taken everything but hed lied he figured he was owed something for his pain and for the fact that what he had already shipped was worth a fortune a fortune of which he had yet to see more than a few bucks in real terms he also wanted to make up to karen for their fight he held the earrings up to the light and even though in pain he marveled at their beauty ii i dream of horsemen in smoking hills shadows on horseback reed breastplates quirts halfbreed moon some other war some other ancient war but this same place richard currey crossing over the vietnam stories war smells it smells of open sewers and excrement it smells of garbage and rotting food and standing water it smells of dog carcasses and human corpses it smells of the homeless and the dying and the dead they were flown from mccord afb to rheinmain afb then on to kuwait they traveled in full kit with their weapons the bolts removed and kept in their pockets in kuwait they filled sandbags to line the bottoms of their vehicles and absorb shrapnel it was only a couple of days later that they were told they were heading into the box the officers cheered they wanted to earn their combat patches the chill was intense as they moved north through the desert night he had never been in the desert before not unless you counted the desert of maine and that was just a field with some sand in it he hadnt expected the desert to be so cold but then he knew about as much about deserts as he knew about iraq before he was sent there he couldnt even have found it on a map hed never had any intention of visiting so why bother trying to look for it but now he knew what did these people do how did they live there was nothing growing that he could see the kids were barefoot and lived in houses made of mud and brick they were told not to trust anybody but he still handed out candy and water to kids when he could most of the guys did at the start until the insurgency kicked in and the rivers began filling up with bodies and the haji started using children as lookouts or human shields or soldiers after that they stopped treating kids as kids by then he was scared most of the time but hed entered a place where the concept of fear had ceased to have any concrete meaning because fear was always present either as a whisper or a scream then there was the dust it got everywhere he tried to keep his m clean and welllubricated but it didnt always help and the gun sometimes jammed there were those who said that the standard army cleaner wasnt worth a shit and guys asked for commercial lubricants as part of their care packages from home later he read that there was something about the iraqi dust that was different from the dust used in the weapons tests stateside it was smaller and contained more salts and carbonates which tended to corrode it also reacted with some of the gun lubricants creating bigger particles that blocked the chambers it was as though the land itself was conspiring against the invaders this place was old they didnt understand that he didnt understand it either not then it was only after when he began tracing its history that he realized this was the cradle of civilization the ancestors of these people peering at him fearfully from out of mud houses had created writing philosophy religion this army of tanks and rockets and airplanes was following in the path of the assyrians the babylonians and the mongols of alexander and julius caesar and napoleon this was once the greatest empire in the world he struggled to grasp just how old it was even as he read of gilgamesh and mesopotamia and the kings of agade and the sumerians that was when he came across the names of enlil and his wife ninlil and the story of how enlil took three forms and impregnated his wife three times and from those three unions sprang nergal and ninazu and one other one whose name was lost rendered illegible by the damage to the old stones on which the story had been written three unions three entities things of the netherworld demons and that was when he began to understand jackie garner was all apologies when he called the next morning hed managed to stay with joel tobias as far as blainville quebec and had watched the loading of the animal feed he hadnt noticed anything untoward and then had stayed with tobias until the border where something about the way jackie looked or possibly smelled had aroused suspicion a chemical test had been run on his bag and traces of explosives had been found given that this was jackie garner the munitions king it would have been a miracle if traces of explosives hadnt been found but it meant that jackies car was searched and hed been forced to answer a lot of awkward questions about his hobbies before he was allowed to leave by which time joel tobias had vanished dont worry about it jackie i told him well find another way you want me to go back to his house and wait for him yeah why not it would make jackie feel that he wasnt in trouble if nothing else any word from new york theyll be here tonight you wont tell them how i screwed up you didnt screw up jackie you were just unlucky i should be more careful said jackie with regret but i do love explosives soon after bennett patchett emailed me some names of former soldiers who had attended his sons funeral the first two were vernon and pritchard both had a note beside them indicating that he wasnt sure of the spelling he admitted that he couldnt remember the names of all those who had been there because not everyone had signed the book of condolences and not everyone had been introduced to him but he thought that at least a dozen exsoldiers had been present he did recall a woman named carrie saunders who had something to do with counseling veterans but as far as he knew shed had no formal contact with damien before he died there was also bobby jandreau who was now in a wheelchair due to the injuries that he had suffered in iraq he was on my list of those to whom i wanted to talk once the help from new york had arrived were any of those at the funeral black vernon s a colored fella he said is that important just curious i made a note to call carrie saunders and to find out more about bobby jandreau but first i took a trip out to scarborough downs where ronald straydeer lived in a cabin within shouting distance of the racecourse ronald had served in the k corps during the vietnam war and was haunted as much by the loss of his dog which hed had to abandon as surplus to requirements during the fall of saigon as by the deaths of his comrades now his house was a kind of rest stop for veterans who happened to be passing through town and needed a place to sleep somewhere they could have a beer and a toke without being bothered by foolish questions i wasnt certain what ronald did for a living but it probably wasnt unconnected to the ready supply of weed that he always appeared to have close at hand ronald had also recently begun to involve himself in the issue of rights for veterans after all hed had firsthand experience of the problems that they faced upon his own return from vietnam and especially after he probably believed that hed seen the last of such ugliness instead a whole new bag of ugly had been opened on veterans worse even than that faced by their vietnam predecessors then it had been about returning soldiers being blamed for an unpopular war their critics inflamed by images of kids dying on college campuses or with burning napalm on their skin as they ran across a vietnamese bridge now that anger had been replaced by ignorance of the consequences of combat both physical and psychological for exsoldiers and the reluctance of those who had been happy to send them to war to look after the injured and battlescarred whether those injuries were visible or not once they came home id seen ronald on local television a couple of times and he was often approached for comment by newspapers in the state when the subject of disabled veterans was raised in any form hed set up an informal organization called concerned veterans of maine and for the first time since id known him he seemed to have a real sense of purpose a new battle to fight instead of old ones to relive i saw a drape twitch when i arrived at his place i knew that ronald had a sensor fitted at the end of the private drive that led up to his house and anything larger than a small mammal broke the beam he was smart enough not to keep too significant a stash at his home so that any raid would net possession but not possession with intent to supply then again ronalds activities were kind of an open secret among certain branches of the local law enforcement community but they were content to let them slide because ronald didnt sell to kids he didnt use violence and he was helpful to the cops when the need arose it wasnt as if ronald was operating a drug empire anyway if he had been he wouldnt have been living in a small cabin out by scarborough downs hed have been living in a big cabin out by scarborough downs ronald came to the door as i stepped from the car he was a large man his black hair cut short and heavily streaked with silver he wore tightfitting jeans and a checked shirt hung loosely over his belt around his neck hung a leather pouch what is that i asked big medicine nope i keep my small change in there his hand tanned and corded with muscle and veins gripped mine and swallowed it like a gnarly old catfish consuming a minnow youre the only native american i know i said and you dont do any of that proper native american stuff you disappointed some it just feels like youre not making the effort i dont even want to be called a native american indian does just fine see i bet i could have arrived here dressed as a cowboy and you wouldnt even have blinked an eye nope i mightve shot you but i wouldnt have blinked an eye we sat at a table in his yard and ronald pulled a couple of sodas from a cooler music played softly from a boombox in the kitchen a mix of native american blues folk and americana slidin clyde roulette keith secola butch mudbone social call he asked sociable i replied you remember a kid named damien patchett local boy served in iraq with the infantry ronald nodded i went to his funeral i should have known whenever he could ronald attended the local funerals of veterans his argument was that in honoring one he honored all it was part of his ongoing personal duty to the fallen did you know him no never met him i hear that he may have taken his own life who told you that his father ronald touched a small silver cross that hung from a leather strap around his wrist a small gesture toward bennett patchetts grief its happening again he said you hope the brass and the politicians will learn but they never do war changes men and women and some of them change so much that they dont know themselves anymore and they hate what theyve become you ask me were just getting better at collating suicide figures thats all more vietnam veterans have died by their own hands since the war than were killed in country and more iraq veterans will die by their own hands this year than will be killed in iraq judging by the way the figures are heading the same dictum applies to both wars poor treatment over there poor treatment back home what was the talk about damien that hed become isolated that he was having trouble sleeping a lot of guys have trouble sleeping when they get back they have trouble doing a lot of stuff but when you cant sleep you know your head gets messed up and you start getting moody and depressed maybe you drink more than you should or you take something to bring you down and then you start needing a little more of it every time hed been on trazodone but then he stopped why youd have to ask someone who knew him better than i did some guys dont like taking sleep meds they find they get a drug hangover from it when they wake up and it screws up their rem sleep but all i got was secondhand news about damien did his father hire you to look into his death in a way i didnt think that there was any doubt about how he died there isnt at least not about his final moments its what led him to do it that his father is curious to understand so youre looking into posttraumatic stress disorder now in a way i see that youre still having trouble answering straight questions i like to think of it as circling yeah like before a raid maybe you should have worn that cowboy hat after all he sipped his soda and looked away it wasnt quite a huff just the dignified native american equivalent of one okay i said i surrender ill give you a name joel tobias ronald had a good poker face there was only the slightest flicker of his eyelids at the mention of tobiass name but it was enough to indicate that ronald didnt care much for him he was at the funeral too he said a bunch of guys who served with damien came to pay their respects some from away there was trouble at the cemetery although they managed to keep the patchetts from seeing any of it trouble a photographer was hanging around from a small newspaper the sentineleagle he was taking some shots part of a photo essay he was putting together and hoping to sell to the new york times you know the funeral of a fallen warrior the grief the release someone in the family must have been bennett had told him that it would be okay well it wasnt not with everyone a couple of damiens old buddies had a word with him and he went away one of them was tobias he was introduced to me later at a bar by that time we were down to the stragglers has tobias come up on your radar why would he there might be people who suspect hes smuggling if he is its not pot id know you talk to jimmy jewel he doesnt know either if jimmy doesnt know then i got no chance you spend a dollar that man hears the change hit the counter but youre aware of tobias ronald shifted in his seat whispers thats all what kind that tobias is working an angle hes that kind of guy was he one of those who didnt want his picture taken there were four or five of them that spoke to the photographer as far as i can remember tobias was among them one of the others made the papers himself a week or so later how come his name was brett harlan from caratunk that name meant something harlan brett harlan murdersuicide i said killed his wife then himself with an m bayonet those were hard deaths specialist brett harlan stryker c second saber brigade third infantry his wife was on leave from the one hundred and seventysecond military intelligence battalion damien patchett served with the second saber brigade and so did bernie kramer whos bernie kramer corporal bernie kramer hanged himself in a hotel room in quebec three months ago i thought of what karen emory had said to me theyre all dying its a cluster i said a cluster of suicides so it seems any reason why that might be i can give you general but not specific theres a woman out of togus exmilitary her name is carrie saunders and i think shed met both harlan and kramer you should talk to her shes conducting research and she came to me looking for some information names of people who might be willing to be interviewed both from my era and later i gave her what i could bennett said that carrie saunders attended damiens funeral she might have been at the church i didnt see her myself what is she researching ronald finished his soda crushed the can and tossed it into a recycling bin posttraumatic stress disorder he said her specialty is suicides the sun rose higher it had turned into a beautiful summers day with clear blue skies and just the faintest of breezes but ronald and i were no longer outside he had taken me into his small office from which he was running concerned veterans of maine the walls were covered with clippings from newspapers and tables of fatalities and photographs one directly above ronalds computer depicted a woman helping her injured son from his bed the picture had been taken from behind so that only the mothers face was visible it took me a moment to spot what was wrong with the photograph almost half of the young mans head was missing and what was left was a network of scars and crevasses like the surface of the moon his mothers face displayed a mixture of emotions too complex to interpret grenade said ronald he lost forty percent of his brain hell need constant care for the rest of his life his mother she doesnt look young does she he said it as if noticing her for the first time even though he must have stared at her every single day no she doesnt and i wondered what would be better for him to die before his mother so that his pain could come to an end and hers could take another perhaps less wrenching form or for him to outlive her so that she could have her time with him and be a mother to him as she was when he was an infant when the possibility of a life like this could only have come to her in a nightmare the former would be best i thought for if he lived too long then she would be gone and eventually he would become a shadow in the corner of a room a name without a past forgotten by others and with no memories of his own surrounded by all of this ronald spoke to me of suicides and homelessness of addiction and waking nightmares of men left without limbs who were struggling to receive full disability from the military of the backlog of claims and counting and of those whose scars were not visible who were damaged psychologically but not physically and whose sacrifice was therefore not recognized as yet by their government for they were denied a purple heart and as he talked his anger grew he never raised his voice never even clenched a fist but i could feel it coming off him like heat from a radiator its the hidden cost he said at last body armor protects the torso and a helmet is better than no helmet the medical responses are getting better and faster but one of those ieds goes off beside you or underneath your hummer and you can lose an arm or a leg or take a piece of shrapnel in the back of your neck that leaves you paralyzed for life now you can survive with catastrophic injuries but it might be that youll wish you hadnt you look at the new york times and you look at usa today and you see the death toll in iraq and afghanistan rising in that little box that they use for the bad news but not as fast as it once did not in iraq anyway and you think that maybe things are getting better they are if youre only counting the dead but you need to multiply that figure by ten to count the injured and even then theres no way to tell how many are seriously wounded one in four of those who come home from iraq and afghanistan needs medical or mental health treatment sometimes its not available to them like it should be and even if theyre fortunate enough to get a little of what they need the government tries to shortchange them at every turn you got no idea how hard it is to get full disability and then the same men who sent those soldiers over to fight tried to close walter reed to save a dollar walter reed theyre fighting two wars and they want to close the armys flagship medical center because they think its costing too much money this has got nothing to do with being for or against the wars its got nothing to do with liberalism or conservatism or any other label that you choose to throw at it its about doing whats right by those who fight and theyre not doing right by them they never have they never ever have his voice trailed off when he spoke again he sounded different when the government wont do what it should and the military cant take care of its own injured then maybe it falls to others to try and do something about it joel tobias is an angry man and it could be that hes gathered others like him to his cause his cause whatever tobias is doing it grew out of good intentions he knew men and women who were struggling we all do promises were made they would be helped youre saying that the money from whatever theyre moving across the border was meant for injured soldiers some of it most of it at first what changed its a lot of money thats what i hear the bigger the sum the greater the greed ronald stood our conversation was drawing to a close you need to talk to someone else he said give me a name there was a fight at sullys sullys was a notorious portland dive bar it was after we buried the patchett boy a couple of us were in a corner and tobias and some others were at the bar one of them was in a wheelchair his trouser legs pinned up halfway to his groin hed had a lot to drink when he turned on tobias he accused him of reneging he mentioned damien and the other guy kramer there was a third name too one that i didnt catch it began with r rockham something like that boy in the wheelchair said that tobias was a liar that he was stealing from the dead what did tobias do ronalds face creased with disgust he pushed him toward the door the guy in the wheelchair there was nothing that he could do to stop it except put the brake on his chair he almost fell to the floor but tobias held on to him when he wouldnt lift the brake on his chair and he struck out at them when they tried to force him they just picked him up chair and all and put him out on the street they stripped him of his dignity just like that they reminded him of how powerless he was they didnt laugh after they did it and one or two of them looked sickened but it doesnt change what happened that was a low thing that they did to that boy was his name bobby jandreau thats right seems that he served alongside damien patchett he owed damien his life from what i hear i went outside to make sure that he was okay but he didnt want any help hed been humiliated enough he needs help though i could see it in him he was on the way down so now you know more than you did when you came here right yes thank you he nodded part of me it wanted them to succeed he said tobias whoever else is helping him i wanted them to make the score whatever it is and now its gone bad you should be careful charlie they wont like you sticking your nose in their business they already tried to warn me off by drowning me in an oil barrel yeah so hows that working out for them not so good the one who did all the talking was softspoken maybe with a hint of something southern in there you get any ideas about who that might be id like to hear them i tried to reach carrie saunders at the va facility in togus later that day but the call went straight to her answering service then i called the sentineleagle which was a weekly local paper in orono and from its news editor got a cell phone number for a photographer named george eberly he wasnt a staffer but he did some freelance work for the paper eberly answered on the second ring and when i told him what i wanted he seemed happy to talk it was agreed with bennett patchett he said he spoke to the rest of the family about what i wanted to do it would be a memorial to his son i told him but also a way of connecting with other families who had lost sons and daughters or fathers and mothers to the war and he understood that i promised to be unobtrusive and i was i stayed in the background most people didnt even notice me and then suddenly i was confronted by a bunch of goons did they tell you what their problem was they said it was a private ceremony when i pointed that i had the familys permission to take pictures one of them tried to take my camera from me while the rest shielded him i backed away and a guy a big guy with fingers missing grabbed my arm and told me to delete any photographs that werent of the family he said that if i didnt hed break the camera and then later he and his buddies would find me and break something else of mine something that didnt have a lens and couldnt be replaced so you deleted the photos like hell i did i own a new nikon its a complicated piece of machinery if you dont know what youre doing i pressed a couple of buttons locked the screen and told him that id done what he asked the big guy let me go and that was it any chance that i could take a look at those photos sure i dont see why not i gave him my email address and he promised to send the photos as soon as he got back to his computer you know added eberly there was a connection between damien patchett and a corporal named bernie kramer who killed himself up in canada i know they served together well kramers family came from orono after he died we printed a piece that hed written his sister asked us to publish it she still lives here in town thats how i came to be interested in this whole photo project to be honest the article was a big deal around here and it got the editor in trouble with the military what did kramer write about that ptsd thing posttraumatic stress ill forward the piece to you with the photos eberlys material came in about two hours later while i was cooking myself a steak for dinner i took the pan from the heat and set it aside to cool bernie kramers article was short but intense it spoke of his struggle with what he believed to be ptsd his paranoia his inability to trust his moments of crippling fear and dread and in particular his anger at the militarys refusal to recognize ptsd as a combat injury instead of an ailment clearly it had been written as an extended letter to the papers editor a letter never sent but the editor had seen the potential in it and moved it to the oped page most affecting of all was a description of his time at the warrior transition unit at fort bragg kramer implied that fort bragg was being used as a dumping ground for soldiers who were suffering from problems related to drug abuse and that constant staff changes meant that awards record recovery and retirement ceremonies were being ignored by the time we came home he concluded we were already being forgotten it wasnt hard to see how the army might have been unhappy with one of its exsoldiers going on the record in this way although worse had been written in soldiers blogs and elsewhere nevertheless a small local paper would have been easy meat for a military press officer with a point to prove to his superiors i printed out the article and added it to those i had earlier collected regarding the deaths of brett harlan and margaret his wife i had also made notes for myself regarding ptsd and military suicides then i looked at the photos that eberly had taken after damiens funeral helpfully he had circled the faces of the men who had confronted him joel tobiass among them i regarded the others carefully only one of them was black so i figured that was vernon i checked the photographic printer to make sure that it had paper in it then printed duplicate copies of each of the best pictures i wanted to know the names of the rest of these men ronald straydeer might be able to help me i had his email address so i forwarded some of the images to him eberly had also given me the name and phone number for bernie kramers sister lauren fannan i called her and we spoke for a while she told me that bernie had come back sick from iraq and his condition had worsened in the months that followed she was under the impression that pressure had been put on him not to talk about his problems but she couldnt tell if that pressure had come from the military or from his own buddies why would you say that i asked there was a friend of his joel tobias he was bernies sergeant in iraq tobias was the reason why bernie was up in quebec to begin with bernie spoke fluent french and he was doing some work for tobias up there something to do with shipping and trucks bernie was taking medication to help him sleep and tobias told him to stop because it was screwing with bernies ability to work if joel tobias had told bernie kramer to stop taking his medication because it was interfering with his assigned tasks might he also have been responsible for damien patchett setting aside his trazodone did bernie seek professional help i got the impression that he was receiving some kind of help because of the way he started talking about his condition but he never said from whom after bernie died i called tobias and told him that he wouldnt be welcome at the funeral so he stayed away i havent seen him since i found the letter that bernie had written about his posttraumatic stress among his private papers and decided that it should be printed in the newspaper because people should know how these men and women have been treated by their own government bernie was a lovely man a gentle man he didnt deserve to end his life that way you mentioned bernies private papers mrs fannan do you still have them some of them she replied the rest i burned there was something here why did you burn them she had started to cry and i had trouble understanding some of what she said next hed written page after page of just madness about how he was hearing voices and seeing things i thought it was all part of his illness but it was so disturbing and so insane i didnt want anyone else to read it because if it got out i thought it would detract from the letter he was talking about demons and being haunted none of it made any sense none of it i thanked her and let her go a message had appeared in my mailbox ronald straydeer had come through for me hed printed one of the photographs marked it then scanned the image again and returned it there was a short note above it after you left i remembered something else about the funeral that struck me as odd there was a veteran of the first iraq war hanging around with tobias and the others at sullys his name is harold proctor as far as i can tell he never gave a damn about anyone or anything and theres no reason why he should be close to tobias unless hes part of whats happening he owns a rundown motel near langdon northwest of rangeley you dont need me to tell you how close that is to the canadian border proctor wasnt in any of the photographs i knew that there was a system in place whereby veterans of former wars met returning soldiers but i had no idea how to find out if proctor had participated or if he might have been among those who had met damien patchett when he got back home but if ronald was right in his assessment of proctor and i had no reason to doubt him then the older man seemed an unlikely candidate for a meetandgreet ronald had given me two more names mallak and bacci beside mallaks name hed written unionville but raised in atlanta hed also formally identified the black man as vernon and a short bearded man next to him as pritchard hed put an x over the face of a tall man wearing glasses and had written harlan deceased next to it finally barely visible in the distance to the left of the image there was a muscular man in a wheelchair bobby jandreau kyle quinns words returned to me spoken as i looked at the photograph of foster jandreau in the newspaper a bad business i picked up my pen and formally added foster jandreaus name to the list of the dead tobias made the run to harold proctors motel early the next morning he supposed that it was fate hed been on his way to proctors place when the mexicans had taken him so it didnt exactly throw him to be told to proceed there anyway even without a cargo to deposit the reason for the trip was more unexpected although when he had time to think about it he believed that he had foreseen just such an eventuality proctors flaking on us said the voice that morning on the other end of the line he wants out take whatever is left there and pay him off its mostly small stuff thats left anyway you sure hes not going to talk out of school said tobias he knows better than to do that tobias wasnt so sure he planned to have a few words with proctor when he saw him just to make certain that he understood where his obligations lay his face and hands were hurting the ibuprofen that hed taken had dulled the pain somewhat but not enough to help him sleep properly lack of sleep was nothing new to him though not lately in iraq hed slept through mortar fire hed been so tired all the time but ever since hed returned home hed been having trouble getting a good nights rest and when he did sleep he dreamed they were bad dreams and recently they had begun to get worse he thought that he could even trace the start of his recent problems to one of the runs that hed made to proctors place a month or so ago ever since then he hadnt been right tobias wasnt much for hard liquor but he could have used a serious drink right about now proctor would give him one if he asked but tobias didnt intend to impose on proctors hospitality for that long anyway the last thing tobias wanted was to be stopped by the cops with booze on his breath while driving a rig a rig whats more that would probably contain more potential wealth per square foot than any other that had ever previously been driven through the state as if to remind him of the wisdom of his decision to wait until he got back to portland before slaking his thirst a border patrol vehicle passed him on the road heading east tobias raised a hand casually in greeting and the gesture was returned he watched the border cop in his mirrors until he was gone from sight then breathed more easily it would be just his luck to cross the cops after what had happened the night before proctor was simply the shitty icing on that particular turd cake tobias didnt care much for the older man proctor was a lush and he believed that the fact they had both served in the military meant that they were brothers deep inside but tobias didnt view the world in that way they hadnt even served in the same war their conflicts were separated by more than a decade he and proctor were on different paths proctor was drinking himself to death while tobias was looking forward to making some money and improving his life he thought that he might ask karen to marry him and once they were hitched theyd head south get away from the damn maine cold the summers were better up here not so humid as florida or louisiana some august days excepted but they werent good enough to make up for the winters not by a long shot he thought again about a drink hed settle for a couple of beers when he returned to portland he hated himself when he got messy and hated seeing others get messy too he flashed to bobby jandreau in sullys bobby shooting his mouth off and attracting attention even in a place like sullys where most people were too busy getting drunk to pay any mind to whatever might be going on around them he pitied bobby joel wasnt sure that he could have gone on living if hed been wounded as badly as bobby had his own injuries were enough for him he limped with every step and he still experienced phantom pain where the tips of his missing fingers should have been but bobbys injuries didnt excuse him from getting loud and saying the things that hed said theyd promised him a cut and joel had been willing to keep to the deal even after what was said at sullys but now bobby didnt want it he didnt want anything to do with them and that worried joel it troubled the others too theyd tried reasoning with bobby but it had done no good joel figured that his pride had been hurt by what theyd done with him at sullys but theyd had no choice nobody gets hurt that was the essence of the arrangement that they had do no harm unfortunately that wasnt always possible in the real world and the principle had been subtly altered to do no harm to our own the detective parker had asked for what had happened to him and foster jandreau had too tobias might not have pulled the trigger on him but hed agreed on the necessity of it tobias was already anticipating the sign for proctors motel giving him time to prepare for the turn he was nervous a rig turning into a disused motel was just the kind of action that attracted attention this close to the border tobias preferred those occasions when small items were being moved and the exchange could be made at a gas station or a diner the movement of larger pieces requiring him to come to the motel always made him sweat but there were only one or two more of those shipments to go and now hed find some place near portland to store them after kramers death a decision had been made that most of the larger items werent worth the risk presenting as they did all kinds of logistical difficulties an alternative means of disposing of them would be found even if it meant a smaller profit after all theyd gone to the trouble of transporting them as far as canada and damned if they were just going to dump them in a quarry somewhere or bury them in a hole still buyers had already been found for a number of statues and it had fallen to tobias to get them across the border hed driven the first shipment certified as cheap stone garden ornaments for those with more money than taste straight to a warehouse in pennsylvania without a hitch the second shipment had to be stored for a couple of weeks with proctor and moving it had taken four men and five hours all the time tobias had been waiting for the state police or us customs to come blazing in and he could still recall his sense of relief when the work was completed and he was back on the road heading for home and karen he just needed to finish with proctor this last time then he would be done if it was true that proctor wanted out so much the better tobias wouldnt miss him he wouldnt miss him or the stink of his cabin or the sight of his lousy motel slowly sinking into the ground a man who couldnt hold his booze wasnt to be trusted it was a sign of a deeper weakness tobias would bet a dollar to a dime that proctor had come out of iraq one a prime candidate for ptsd counseling or whatever passed for it then instead hed retreated to a rundown motel at the edge of the woods and tried to fight his demons alone aided only by the bottle and any food that came wrapped in plastic with a microwave time written on the side tobias had never believed that he himself suffered from posttraumatic stress oh sure he had trouble relaxing and he still had to fight the urge to flinch at the sound of fireworks launching or a car backfiring there were days when he didnt want to get out of bed and nights when he didnt want to get into bed didnt want to close his eyes for fear of what might come and that was even before the new nightmares but posttraumatic stress no not him well not the severe kind not the kind where just to get through the day you had to be so doped up that it popped out of your pores like discolored sweat not the kind where you wept for no reason or you lashed out at your woman because she burned the bacon or spilled your beer no not that kind not yet but its started you did lash out didnt you he looked around the cab certain that someone had spoken the voice strangely familiar the wheel twisted slightly so that he felt his heart skip a beat before he readjusted fearful of sending the rig off the road and onto the slope fearful of tumbling of ending up trapped in his cab trapped almost within sight of the old motel not yet where had that voice come from and then he remembered a warehouse its walls cracked its roof leaking a consequence of the earlier bombing and the poor workmanship that had gone into its construction a man little more than a pile of bloodied cloth now the life already leaving his eyes tobias was standing over him the muzzle of his m carbine the gun that had torn the man apart pointing unwaveringly at the fighters head as though this bloodied rag doll could pose any threat to him now take it take it all its yours the fingers stained red indicated the crates and boxes the shrouded statues that filled the warehouse tobias was amazed that he could even speak he must have taken four five shots to the body now there he was waving a hand in the flashlights beam as though any of this was his to give or to retain thanks said tobias and he felt himself sneer as he spoke the word and heard the sarcasm in his voice and he was ashamed he had belittled himself in front of the dying man tobias hated him hated him as he hated all of his kind they were terrorists haji sunni or shia foreign or iraqi they were all the same in the end it didnt matter what they called themselves alqaeda or one of the bullshit names of convenience that they made up from their stock jumble of phrases like those collections of magnetic words that you stuck to your fridge and used to create bad poetry victorious martyrs of the brigade of jihad assassination front of the imam resistance all interchangeable all alike haji terrorist yet there was an intimacy to death in moments like this in giving it and in receiving it and he had just breached the protocol answering like a surly teenager not a man the haji smiled and some white was still visible through the blood that had filled his mouth and stained his teeth dont thank me he said not yet not yet that was the voice he heard the voice of a man with the promised virgins waiting for him in the next world the voice of a man who had fought to protect what was in that warehouse fought but not hard enough that was what damien had said to him they fought but not as hard as they should have why the motel came into view to his left he saw the line of boardedup rooms and shivered the place always gave him the creeps no wonder proctor had become what he was holed up here with only the trunks of trees behind him and his bequest this dump before him it was hard to look at those rooms and not imagine unseen guests unwanted guests moving behind the walls guests who liked damp and mold and ivy curling around their beds guests who were themselves in the process of decaying malevolent shadows entwined on leafstrewn beds old ruined bodies moving rhythmically dryly passionlessly the horns on their heads tobias blinked hard the images had been so vivid so strong they reminded him of some of the dreams hed been having except in those there had only been shadows moving hidden things now they had shape form jesus they had horns it was the shock he decided a delayed reaction to all that he had endured the evening before he pulled up within sight of proctors cabin and waited for him to emerge but there was no sign proctors truck was parked over to the right under ordinary circumstances tobias would have hit the horn and rousted the old bastard but it wouldnt have done to blast the woods particularly not since proctor had a neighbor who might be tempted to come and take a look at what all the noise was about tobias killed the engine and climbed down from the cab his burned hand felt damp beneath the bandages and he knew that the wounds were seeping the only consolation for the pain and humiliation was the knowledge that payback would not be long in coming the wetbacks had crossed the wrong people he walked up to the cabin and called proctors name but there was still no response from inside he knocked on the door hey harold wake up he called its joel only then did he try the door even so he was careful and slow proctor slept with a gun close by and tobias didnt want him coming out of a drunks sleep and loosing a couple of shots at a suspected intruder it was empty even in the gloom created by the mismatched drapes he could see that he hit the lightswitch and took in the unmade bed the wrecked television and the demolished phone the laundry spilling from a basket in the corner and the smell of neglect of a man who had let himself go to his right was the kitchencumliving room tobias saw what it contained and swore proctor had lost it the asshole the remaining crates and boxes the ones that were supposed to stay hidden in rooms and were stacked almost to the ceiling visible to anyone who might just happen to stick a nose into proctors place to see what was going on the crazy old bastard had hauled them up here by himself instead of waiting for tobias to come and take them off his hands he hadnt even bothered closing most of them the stone face of a woman stared out of one another contained more of the seals their gemstones glittering as tobias approached worst of all on the kitchen table entirely unconcealed stood a gold box about two feet long two feet wide and a foot deep its lid comparatively plain apart from a series of concentric circles radiating from a small spike there was arabic lettering along the margins and its sides were decorated with intertwined bodies twisted distended figures with horns protruding from their heads just like the figures i imagined in the motel rooms thought tobias he had helped to move the box on that first night recalling how they had opened the lead casket in which it was contained revealing it to the flashlights the gold had gleamed dully later bernie kramer who came from a family of jewelers would tell him that the box had recently been cleaned there were traces of paint still visible as though it had once been disguised to hide its true value he had barely glanced at it then for there were so many other artifacts to take in and adrenalin was still coursing through his body in the aftermath of the fight he hadnt even seen the sides until now just the top there was no way that he could have known about the creatures carved into it no way that he could have pictured them so clearly in his mind warily he approached the box three of its sides were sealed with twin locking devices shaped like spiders with a single large spider lock on the front seven locks in all he heard that kramer had tried to open it but hadnt been able to figure out how the mechanisms worked they had discussed the possibility of breaking the box open to see what it contained but wiser counsel had prevailed a bribe was paid and the box was xrayed it was found to be not one box but a series of interconnected boxes each of the interior boxes having only three sides the fourth in every case being one of the walls of the larger box surrounding it but every box still appeared to have seven locks only the arrangement of them differing slightly the locks themselves growing smaller and smaller seven boxes seven locks on each fortynine locks in total it was a puzzle contraption and it was empty apart from what the radiographer identified as fragments of bone wrapped in what appeared to be wire each wire connected in turn to the locks on the boxes it might have looked like a bomb on the xray but the box kramer had suggested was a reliquary of some kind he had also translated the arabic writing on the lid ashrab min damhum i will drink their blood it was decided that the box should remain intact the locks unbroken now they were so close and proctor had almost blown it for them well proctor could stay out here and drink himself to death as far as tobias was concerned hed said that he didnt care about his cut of the final total just wanted the stuff gone and tobias was happy to stick to that arrangement it took him more than an hour to get everything into the rig two of the pieces of statuary were particularly heavy he had to use the dolly and even then it was a struggle he left the gold box until last as he was lifting it from the table he thought that he felt something shift inside carefully he tipped it listening for any sign of movement but there was nothing the bone fragments he knew were slotted into holes carved in the metal and held in place with the wire anyway what he had felt was not a piece of bone moving but an identifiable change in the distribution of the weight from right to left as though an animal were crawling inside then it was gone and the box felt normal again not empty exactly but not as though anything had come loose he carried it to the rig and placed it beside a pair of wall carvings the interior was a mess of animal feed and torn sacks but hed done his best to clean it up most of the sacks had been salvageable and they were now serving as additional packing for the artifacts hed have to come up with a story and compensation for the customer in south portland but he could manage both he locked the box trailer and climbed into the cab he backed the rig carefully toward the forest in order to turn back on to the road he was now facing the motel he wondered if proctor was down there after all his truck wasnt gone which meant that proctor shouldnt have been gone either something might have happened to him he could have taken a fall then tobias thought again of the treasures left in open view in proctors cabin and the effort of moving them alone into the trailer and the pain in his hands and face that had begun to return and of karen waiting for him back home karen with her smooth unblemished skin and her firm breasts and her soft red lips the urge to see her to take her came to him so strongly that he almost wavered on his feet to hell with proctor he thought let him rot as he drove south he felt no guilt at not searching the motel at the possibility that he might have abandoned an injured man to death in a deserted motel a veteran who had served his country just as he had served it it did not strike him that such an action was not in his nature for his thoughts and desires were elsewhere and his nature was already changing in truth it had been changing ever since he had first set eyes on the box and his willingness to countenance the killing of jandreau and the torture of the detective was simply another aspect of it but now the pace of that change was about to accelerate greatly only once as he passed augusta did he feel discomfited there was a sound in his head like waves breaking as of the sea calling to the shore it troubled him at first but as the miles rolled by beneath him he began to find it soothing even soporific he no longer wanted that drink he just wanted karen he would take her and then he would sleep the road unspooled before him and the sea sang softly in his head breaking hissing whispering the rojas warehouse stood on the northern outskirts of lewiston it had formerly been a bakery owned by the same family for half a century and the family name bunder was still visible written in faded white paint across the front of the building the companys slogan bunder the wonder bread used to run on local radio sung to a tune not a million miles removed from that of the tv serial champion the wonder horse franz bunder the father figure of the business in every way had come up with the idea of using the tune himself and neither he nor the gentlemen responsible for creating the ad bothered to concern themselves greatly with issues such as copyright or royalties given that the ad was only heard in eastern maine and no aggrieved fans of blackandwhite horse dramas had ever complained the tune remained in use until bunders bakery eventually baked its last loaf forced out of business by the big boys in the early eighties long before people began to understand the value to a community of small familyrun operations antonio rojas known to most of those in his ambit by his preferred pseudonym of raul could never be accused of making a similar mistake for his business was entirely dependent on family near and extended and he was acutely aware of his links to the larger community since it bought pot cocaine heroin and more recently crystal meth from him for which he was very grateful methamphetamine was the mostly widely abused narcotic in the state both as powder and ice and rojas had been quick to realize its profit potential especially since its addictiveness guaranteed a greedy and constantly expanding market he was further aided by the popularity of the mexican variety of the drug which meant that he was able to tap into his own connections south of the border instead of relying on local twoman meth labs which even if they could source the raw materials including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine could rarely maintain the longterm consistency of supply that an operation like rojass required instead rojas had it transported by road from mexico and now supplied not only maine but the adjacent new england states when necessary he could call upon the smaller operations to boost his own supply he tolerated these labs as long as they didnt threaten him and he made sure that they were taxed accordingly rojas was also careful not to alienate any of his competitors the dominican cartels controlled the heroin trade in the state and their operation was the most professional so rojas was scrupulous about buying wholesale from them whenever possible instead of cutting them out entirely and risking reprisals the dominicans also had their own meth business but rojas had organized a sitdown years before and together they had hammered out an agreement about spheres of influence to which everyone had so far adhered cocaine was a relatively open market and rojas dealt mainly in crack which addicts preferred because it was simpler to use similarly illegal pharmaceuticals from canada represented pretty easy money and there was a ready market for viagra percocet vicodin and kicker or oxycontin so coke and pharmaceuticals were in play for everyone the dominicans kept their heroin rojas looked after meth and marijuana and everyone was happy well nearly everyone the motorcycle gangs were another matter rojas tended to leave them alone if they wanted to sell meth or anything else then god bless them and vaya con diós amigos in maine the bikers had a big cut of the marijuana market so rojas was careful to sell his product mainly bc bud out of state screwing with the bikers was timeconsuming dangerous and ultimately counterproductive as far as rojas was concerned the bikers were crazy and the only people who argued with crazies were other crazies still the bikers were a known quantity and they could be factored into the overall equation so that equilibrium was maintained equilibrium was important and in that he and jimmy jewel whose transport links rojas had long used and who was a minority shareholder in some of rojass business ventures were of one mind without it there was the potential for bloodshed and for attracting the attention of the law recently though rojas had become concerned about a number of issues including the prospect of forces beyond his control impacting upon his business rojas was linked by blood to the small but ambitious la familia cartel and la familia was currently engaged in an escalating war not merely with its rival cartels but with the mexican government of president felipe calderón it meant a definite end to what had been termed the pax mafiosa a gentlemans agreement between the government and the cartels to desist from actions against one another as long as movement of the product remained unaffected rojas had not become a drug dealer in order to start an insurrection against anyone he had become a drug dealer to get rich and his ties by marriage to la familia and his status as a naturalized us citizen thanks to his now deceased engineer father had made him eminently suited to his present role la familia s main problem as far as rojas was concerned was its spiritual leader nazario moreno gonzález also known with some justification as el más loco or the craziest one while quite content to accept some of el más locos rulings such as the ban on the sale of drugs within its home territory which had no effect on his own operations rojas was of the opinion that spiritual leaders had no place in drug cartels el más loco required his dealers and killers to refrain from alcohol to the extent that he had set up a network of rehab centers from which la familia actively recruited those who managed to abide by its rules a couple of these converts had even been forced on rojas although he had managed to sideline them by sending them to bc to act as liaisons with the canadian bud growers let the canucks deal with them and if the young killers suffered an unfortunate accident somewhere along the way well rojas would smooth any ruffled feathers over a couple of beers for rojas liked his beer el más loco also seemed prepared to indulge even encourage what was in rojass opinion an unfortunate taste for the theatrical in a member of la familia had walked into a nightclub in uruapán and dumped five severed heads on the dance floor rojas didnt approve of theatrics he had learned from many years in the us that the less attention one attracted the easier it was to do business more over he regarded his cousins in the south as barbarians who had forgotten how to behave like ordinary men if they had ever truly known how to conduct themselves with discretion he did his best to avoid visiting mexico unless it was absolutely necessary preferring to leave such matters to one of his trusted underlings by now he found the sight of los narcos in their big hats and ostrich leather boots absurd even comical and their predilection for beheadings and torture belonged to another time he was also under increasing pressure through his trucking connections to facilitate the movement of weapons easily acquired in the gun stores of texas and arizona across the border as far as rojas was concerned it could only be a matter of time before he became a target for la familia s rivals or the dea neither eventuality appealed to him rojass problems had been compounded by the global financial recession he had squirreled away a considerable amount of money both cash to which he was entitled by virtue of his role in la familia s operations and some to which he was not even in the early days he had invested funds in shell banks in montserrat internationally notorious for being almost all entirely fraudulent and willing and able to launder money his bankers had operated out of a bar in plymouth until the fbi began putting pressure on montserrats government and they had been forced to transfer their operations to antigua there it was business as usual under the two bird administrations father and son until the us government again began applying pressure unfortunately rojas had discovered too late one of the downsides of investing with fraudulent banks they had a tendency to commit fraud and their customers were usually the ones who suffered rojass principal banker was currently languishing in a maximum security prison and rojass investments carefully funneled offshore over two decades were now worth about twentyfive percent of what they should have been he wanted an out before he ended up dead or in prison which for him would be the same thing as his life expectancy would be measured in hours once he was behind bars if his rivals didnt get him his own people would kill him to keep him quiet he wanted to run but he needed a big score before he could do so now it seemed jimmy jewel might just have given him that opportunity he had already spoken with the old smuggler twice that day initially to inform him of what had been found in the rig then after rojas had sent him photographs of the items in question neither rojas nor jimmy trusted email as they knew what the feds were capable of when it came to surveillance the solution they had come up with was to establish a free email account to which only they had the password emails would be written but never sent instead they were stored as drafts where they could be read by one man or the other without ever attracting the attention of federal snoopers after viewing the items jimmy had counseled caution until they evaluated precisely what they were dealing with he would make inquiries jimmy told rojas just keep the stuff safe jimmy was as good as his word he had contacts everywhere and it didnt take long for the items to be identified as ancient cylinder seals from mesopotamia rojas who was not usually interested in such details had listened in fascination as jimmy told him that the seals in his possession dated from about bc or the sumerian early dynastic period whatever that was they were used to authenticate documents as testaments of ownership and also as amulets of luck healing and power which appealed to rojas jimmy told him that the caps at the end appeared to be gold and the precious stones inset on the caps were emeralds and rubies and diamonds but rojas hadnt needed jimmys help to figure out what gold and precious stones looked like in the course of their second conversation which had just ended jimmy had also told rojas that the gentleman with whom he had spoken had predicted huge interest among wealthy collectors for the seals and furious bidding could be anticipated the expert also believed that he knew the source of the items similar seals had been among the treasures looted from the iraq museum in baghdad shortly after the invasion which offered some clue as to how they might have come to be in the possession of an exsoldier turned truck driver the problem for jimmy and rojas lay in getting rid of the seals that rojas wanted to sell as his tax on the operation before the authorities realized that he had them and came knocking on his door but much as rojas liked jimmy jewel he was not about to trust him entirely it was he rojas who had taken the risk in hijacking the truck he wanted to ensure that he was compensated appropriately for it and he also wanted an independent assessment of the worth of the seals he had already prized the gold and gemstones from two seals and had them valued even allowing for the middleman and the fact that they couldnt be disposed of on the open market he was dollars in profit from taking down the truck driver he had experienced only a slight pang of regret when jimmy had told him that the seals were much more valuable intact so that by destroying them he had sacrificed four or five times as much money again at the very least the destruction of such ancient artifacts did not disturb rojas unduly for he knew how to make money from gold and precious stones while the market for old seals however valuable was significantly smaller and more specialized rojas was now wondering how many other such seals or similar items the driver named tobias and his associates might have in their possession he didnt like the idea that they might possibly have been running such goods through what he regarded as his territory without anyone suspecting at least not until jimmy jewel became involved the upper floor of the bunder warehouse had been converted into a loft apartment by rojas he had kept the brick walls and had furnished it in a determinedly masculine style leather dark woods and handwoven rugs there was a huge plasma screen tv in one corner but rojas rarely watched it neither did he entertain women here preferring to use a bedroom in one of the houses nearby all of which were owned by members of his family even meetings were conducted in venues other than his loft this was his space and he valued the solitude that it offered there were bunks on the floor below and couches and chairs and a tv that always seemed to be showing mexican soap operas or soccer games there was also a galley kitchen and at any one time at least four armed men were in attendance the floor of rojass loft had been soundproofed so he was barely aware of their presence even so his men tended to keep conversation to a minimum and the volume on the tv low in order not to disturb their leader now seated at a table an anglepoise lamp adjusted so that it shone its light directly over his shoulder rojas examined one of the remaining seals tracing the lettering carved upon it and allowing the rubies and emeralds embedded in it to reflect red and green shards of light upon his skin he had no intention of handing all of the undamaged seals back to tobias and whomever else might be involved in their operation he never had and he already had plans for a number of the gemstones for the first time though he considered holding on to some of the intact seals for himself and not damaging them or selling them on everything in his loft had been bought new and although it was all beautiful it was also anonymous there was nothing distinctive about it nothing that could not have been acquired by any man with a modicum of money and taste but these these were different he looked to his left where there was a fireplace topped by a stone mantel and imagined the seals resting on the granite he could have a stand made for them no better still he would carve one himself for he had always been skilled with his hands the mantel already housed a shrine to jesús malverde the mexican robin hood and patron saint of drug dealers the statue of malverde with its mustache and white shirt bore a certain resemblance to the mexican matinee idol pedro infante even though malverde had been killed by police in thirty years before pedro was born rojas believed that jesús malverde would approve of the seals being laid beside him and might smile in turn upon rojass operations thus could became would and the decision was made to keep the seals the room was almost entirely circular as though set in a tower and lined with books from floor to ceiling it was perhaps forty feet in diameter and dominated by an old bankers desk lit by a greenshaded lamp nearby was a more modern source of illumination stainless steel and hinged with a light source that could be adjusted to a pinpoint beside it lay a magnifying glass and assorted tools tiny blades callipers picks and brushes reference volumes were piled one on top of another their pages marked with lengths of colored ribbon photographs and drawings spilled from files the floor itself was a maze of books and papers set in piles that seemed forever on the verge of collapsing yet did not a labyrinth of arcane knowledge through which only one man knew the true path the bookshelves some of them seeming to bend slightly at the center beneath the weight of their volumes had been pressed into service for other purposes as well in front of the books some leatherbound some new there were statues ancient and pitted and fragments of pottery mostly etruscan although curiously no undamaged items iron age tools and bronze age jewelry and littered among the other relics like curious bugs dozens of egyptian scarabs there was not a speck of dust to be found on anything in the room and there were no windows to look out upon the old massachusetts village below the only light came from the lamps and the walls absorbed all noise despite some modern appliances among them a small laptop computer discreetly set on a side table there was a timelessness about this place a sense that were one to open the single oak door that led from the study to elsewhere one would be confronted with darkness and stars above and below as though the room were suspended in space at the great desk sat herod a fragment of a clay tablet before him pressed to one eye was a jewelers glass through which herod was examining a cuneiform symbol etched into the slab it was the sumerians who had first created and used the cuneiform writing system which was soon adopted by neighboring tribes most particularly the akkadians semitic speakers who dwelt to the north of the sumerians with the ascendancy of the akkadian dynasty in bc sumerian went into decline eventually becoming a dead language used only for literary purposes while akkadian continued to flourish for two thousand years eventually evolving into babylonian and assyrian aside from the damage to the tablet over time the difficulty facing herod in determining the precise meaning of the logogram that he was examining lay in the difference between the sumerian and akkadian languages sumerian is agglutinative which means that phonetically unchanging words and particles are joined together to form phrases akkadian meanwhile is inflectional so that a basic root can be modified to create words with different if related meanings by adding vowels suffixes and prefixes thus sumerian logographic signs if used in akkadian would not convey the same exact meaning while the same sign could depending upon context mean different words a linguistic trait known as polyvalency to avoid confusion akkadian used some signs for their phonetic values instead of their meanings in order to reproduce correct inflections akkadian also inherited homophony from sumerian the capacity of different signs to represent the same sound combined with a script that had between seven hundred and eight hundred signs it meant that akkadian was incredibly complex to translate clearly the tablet was making reference to a god of the netherworld but which god herod loved such challenges he was an extraordinary man largely selfeducated he had been fascinated by ancient things since childhood with a preference for dead civilizations and nearforgotten languages for many years he had dabbled without purpose in such matters a gifted amateur until death changed him his death the computer beeped softly to herods right herod did not like to keep the laptop on his work desk it seemed to him wrong to mix the ancient and the modern in this way even if the computer made some of his tasks immeasurably easier than they might once have been herod still liked to work with paper and pen with books and manuscripts whatever he needed to know was contained in one of the many volumes in this room or stored somewhere in his mind of which the library in which he toiled was a physical representation under ordinary circumstances herod would not have abandoned such a delicate task to answer an email but his system was set up to alert him to messages from a number of specific contacts for access to herod was carefully regulated the message that had just arrived came from a most trusted source and had been sent to his priority box herod removed the eyeglass and tapped the perspex lightly with the tip of a finger like a player forced to leave the chessboard at a crucial moment as if to say we are not done here eventually you will yield to me he stood and made his way carefully between the towers of paper and books until he reached the computer the message opened to reveal a series of highresolution images depicting a cylindrical seal its caps inset with precious stones the seal had been laid upon a piece of black felt then moved slightly for each photograph so that every part of it was revealed particular details the jewels a perfectly rendered carving of a king upon a throne had been photographed in closeup herod felt his heart beat faster he drew closer to the screen squinting at what he saw then printed off all of the images and took them back to his desk where he examined them again through a magnifying glass when he was done he made the call the woman answered almost immediately as he knew she would her voice cracked and old a fitting instrument for the withered old hag that she was nevertheless she had been in the antique business for a long time and had never yet led herod astray their natures were also similar although her malevolence was merely a dull echo of herods own capacities where did you get this he asked i dont have it it was brought to me and i was asked to offer an opinion on its value who brought it to you a mexican he calls himself raul but his real name is antonio rojas he works closely with a man named ironically jimmy jewel who is based in portland maine rojas told me that there were other seals a number regrettably have been destroyed destroyed taken apart for their gold and gemstones the fragments too he showed to me it was all that i could do not to cry under ordinary circumstances herod would also have mourned the annihilation of such a beautiful object but there were other seals and such treasures were not unique what he wished to find was immeasurably more valuable and you believe that this is linked to what i seek according to the catalog it was stored in locker other less valuable seals from locker were found at the scene of the warehouse killings along with the lock from the lead storage box where did this raul get the seals said herod he wouldnt say but he is not a collector he is a criminal a drug dealer ive facilitated him in the past with the sale of certain items which is why he came to me if he really has other seals then my guess is that he stole them or took them in payment of a debt either way he has no idea of their true value what did you tell him that i would make inquiries and get back to him he gave me two days otherwise he threatened to cut out the jewels on the remaining seals and sell them despite his priorities herod hissed in disapproval and he found himself already despising the man who had uttered the threat so much the better it would make what he would have to do next even easier youve done very well he said youll be amply rewarded thank you do you want me to find out more about raul naturally but be discreet herod hung up the phone his earlier tiredness began to fade this was important he had been searching for so long and now it seemed that he might be closing in on that which he sought myth given form he felt an old mans urge to visit the bathroom so he left his library breaking its bubble of solitude and walked through the living room into his bedroom he always used the master bath never the main bathroom because it was easier to clean he stood over the toilet his eyes closed feeling the welcome release such a small pleasure yet not one to be underestimated his body was betraying him in so many ways that he felt a sense of elation at the minor triumph of an organ that functioned properly as the sound of the last trickle faded herod opened his eyes and regarded himself in the mirrored wall of the bathroom the wound on his mouth tormented him the surgeons wanted to try again to remove the necrotic tissue and he would have no choice but to acquiesce yet they had failed before just as the chemotherapy had not arrested the metastasizing of his cells he was being eaten alive inside and out a lesser man would have succumbed by now would have chosen to end it all but herod had a purpose he had been promised a reward an end to his suffering and a visitation of greater suffering on others in turn that promise had been made to him when he died and upon his return to this life he had commenced his great search and his collection had begun to grow he sighed and buttoned himself up no zippers for him he was a man of older tastes one of the buttons was giving him trouble so he looked down as he struggled to slip it through its hole when he glanced back at the mirror he had no eyes herod had died on september th his heart had stopped during an operation to remove a diseased kidney the first of the fruitless attempts to stall the progress of his cancers later the surgeons would describe the occurrence as extraordinary even inexplicable herods heart should not have ceased beating yet it did they had fought to save him to bring him back and they had succeeded a chaplain visited him while he was recovering in the icu inquiring if herod wanted to talk or to pray herod shook his head they tell me that your heart stopped on the operating table said the priest he was in his fifties overweight and redfaced with kind twinkling eyes youve died and returned not many men can say theyve done that he smiled but herod did not smile back his voice was weak and his chest hurt as he spoke are you trying to find out whats beyond the grave priest he said and even in the mans weakened state the chaplain detected the hostility in his voice it was like dark water closing over my head like a pillow suffocating me i felt it coming and i knew there is nothing beyond this life nothing are you happy now the priest stood ill leave you to rest he said he was untroubled by the mans venom he had heard worse before and his faith was strong strangely too he had the sense that the patient herod and from where did such a name originate or was it chosen as some bleak joke was lying it was most peculiar yet with it came another realization if herod was lying the priest did not want to know the truth not that truth not herods truth herod watched the priest go then closed his eyes and prepared to relive the moment of his own death there was light it shone red against his eyelids he opened his eyes he was lying on the operating table there was an open wound in his side but it gave him no pain he touched his fingers to it and they came away bloody he looked around but the theater was empty no not merely empty it was abandoned and had been for some time from where he lay he could see rust upon the instruments and dust and filth upon the tiles and the steel trays a clicking noise came from his right and he watched as a cockroach skittered into hiding he was lying in a pool of light that came from the great lamp that burned above the table but a gentler illumination rippled around the walls of the theater although he could not detect its source he sat up then placed his feet on the floor there was a bad smell the stink of decay he felt the dust between his toes and looked down there were no other footprints to be seen he saw that the sinks to his right were stained brown with dried blood he turned the faucet no water came but he heard sounds coming from the pipes they echoed around the room making him uneasy he turned the faucet back to its previous position and the sounds ceased only when the noise from the pipes disturbed the quiet did he realize just how deep was the silence he pushed through the theater doors barely pausing to take in the deserted prep area here too the sinks were stained with blood but it had also splashed on the floor and the walls a great gusher that seemed to have come from the sinks themselves as though the pipes had spit back all of the fluids that had been washed into them over time the mirrors above the sinks were almost entirely obscured by the dried blood but he caught a glimpse of himself in a dusty but otherwise unmarked spot he looked pale and there were yellow stains around his mouth but the hole in his side apart he appeared well he still could not understand why there was no pain there should be pain i want pain pain will confirm that i am alive and not dead is this death he walked on the corridor beyond the theater was empty but for a pair of wheelchairs and the nurses station was deserted each ward room that he passed contained an unmade bed filthy sheets tossed aside or trailing across the floor pulled from beneath the mattress where where the patients had resisted being dragged away he thought clinging to the sheets in a last effort to prevent what was about to occur it resembled a hospital evacuated during wartime and never reoccupied or perhaps one that had been in the process of moving its patients when the opposing forces had arrived and the slaughter had begun but if that was so where were the bodies herod thought of the images from old news footage of the second world war of villages purged by the nazis littered with the scattered remains of the dead like broken crows dotting a highway on a warm still day of pale forms in camp pits lying on top of one another like figures from the nightmares of bosch bodies where were the bodies he turned a corner a pair of elevator doors stood open the shaft gaping emptily he peered down cautiously holding on to the wall for support he could see nothing for a moment only blackness but as he prepared to withdraw he was certain that far below there was movement the faintest scratching carried up to him and there was a smear of gray in the dark like a brush stroke on a black canvas he tried to speak to call for help but no sound came from his lips he was mute struck dumb and yet in the depths of the elevator shaft the presence below arrested its progress and he felt its regard as an itch upon his face softly quietly he stepped back as behind him the lights in the corridor extinguished themselves throwing the path that he had followed into shadow what did it matter he thought what was there to go back to he should continue searching yet even as he made the decision the lights to his rear continued to go out forcing him to go forward if he was not to find himself trapped in the gloom and as he walked the darkness pressed against his back urging him on he thought that he heard movement behind him but he did not look over his shoulder for fear that those gray smears might assume a more concrete form of tooth and claw the environs of the hospital grew older as he walked the institutional paint faded and began flaking until only bare walls remained tiles became wood there was no longer glass in the doors instruments glimpsed in treatment rooms appeared cruder more primitive operating tables were reduced to blocks of scarred and pitted wood buckets of stinking water at their feet to sluice the blood from them all that he saw spoke of pain both ancient and eternal testament to the fragility of the body and the limits of its endurance at last he came to a pair of crude wooden doors that stood open to admit him inside was a light slight and flickering behind him the darkness encroached and all that it contained he stepped through the doors the room or what he could see of it was empty of furniture its walls and ceiling were invisible to him lost in shadow but he imagined his surroundings as impossibly high and immeasurably wide still he felt claustrophobic and constrained he wanted to go back to leave this place but there was nowhere to which to return the doors behind him had closed and he could no longer see them there was only the light a hurricane lamp placed on the dirt floor in which a flame burned faintly the light and what was illuminated by it at first he thought it a shapeless mass an accumulation of detritus brushed into a pile and forgotten then as he drew closer he saw that it was covered in cobwebs the threads so old that they were coated in dust forming a blanket of strands that almost entirely obscured what lay beneath it was much larger than a man although it shared a mans form herod could discern the muscles in its legs and the curvature of its spine although its face was hidden from him sunk deep into its chest its arms flung over its head in an effort to shield itself from some impending hurt then as though slowly becoming aware of his presence the figure moved like an insect in its pupal shell the arms lowering the head beginning to turn herods senses were suddenly flooded with words and images books statues drawings a box and in that moment his purpose became clear suddenly herods body arched as the wound in his side was violated it was followed by a violent convulsion he saw light and heard voices before him the patina of cobwebs was broken and a thin finger emerged topped by a sharp nail ingrained with dirt the shock came again longer now more painful his eyes were open and there was something plastic in his mouth there were masked faces above him only the eyes visible there were hands on his heart and a voice was speaking to him softly and insistently talking of grave secrets of things that must be done and before his resurrection it spoke his name and told him that it would find him again and he would know it when it came now as he stepped back from the bathroom mirror the reflection remained in place a featureless eyeless mask hanging behind the glass before it found its place above the collar of an old checked suit like a fairground barkers a red bow tie knotted tightly at the neck of a yellow shirt decorated with balloons herod gazed and he knew and he was not afraid oh captain he whispered oh captain my captain the city was changing but then it was in the nature of cities to change perhaps it was just that i was getting older and had already seen too much fall away to be entirely comfortable with the closure of restaurants and stores that i had known the transformation of portland from a city that was struggling not to drop into casco bay and sink to the bottom into one that was now thriving artistic and safe had begun in earnest at the start of the s funded largely with federal money through the kind of porkbarrel appropriations that are frowned upon by pretty much everyone except those profiting by them congress street got brick sidewalks the old port was rejuvenated and the municipal airport became the international jetport which at least had the benefit of sounding futuristic even if for most of the last decade you couldnt fly direct to canada from portland let alone anywhere that wasnt part of the contiguous land mass making the international part largely superfluous some of the gloss had gone from the old port in recent years exchange street one of the loveliest streets in the city was in transition books etc was gone emerson books was about to close due to the retirement of its owners and soon only longfellow books would be left in the old port walters restaurant where i had eaten with both susan my late wife and rachel the mother of my second child had shut its doors in preparation for a move to union street but congress street was still flying the flag for weirdness and eccentricity like a little fragment of austin texas transported to the northeast there was now a decent pizzeria otto offering slices late into the night and the various galleries and used bookstores vinyl outlets and fossil stores had been augmented by a comic book emporium and a new bookstore green hand that boasted a museum of cryptozoology in its back room which was enough to gladden the heart of anybody with a taste for the bizarre well nearly anybody what the fuck is cryptozoology asked louis as we sat in monument square drinking wine and watching the world go by today louis was wearing dolce gabbana a black threebutton suit white shirt no tie even though his voice was not loud an elderly woman eating soup outside the restaurant to our left looked at louis disapprovingly i had to admire her courage most people tended not to give louis looks of any kind other than fear or envy he was tall and black and quite lethal my apologies said louis nodding to her i didnt mean to use inappropriate words he turned back to me then said what the fuck is whatever it was you said cryptozoology i explained its the science of creatures that may or may not exist like bigfoot or the loch ness monster the loch ness monster is dead said angel today angel was wearing tattered jeans noname sneakers in red and silver and a virulently green tshirt promoting a bar that had closed down sometime during the kennedy era unlike his partner in love and life angel tended to provoke responses that varied between bemusement and outright concern that he might be colorblind angel was also lethal although not quite as lethal as louis but then that was true of most people as well as most varieties of poisonous snake i read it somewhere angel continued this expert who was looking for it for years and years he decided that it had died yeah like two hundred and fifty million years ago said louis course its dead the fuck else would it be angel shook his head in the manner of one faced with a child who cant grasp a simple concept no it died recently until then it was still alive louis stared hard at his partner for a long time then said you know i think we need to set a limit on the conversations you can join in with like in a churrascaría i offered we could turn up a green symbol when you can speak and a red one when you have to sit quietly and digest whatever it is youve just heard i hate you guys said angel no you dont i do he confirmed you dont respect me well that is true i admitted but then we really have no reason to angel thought about this before conceding that i had a point we moved on to the subject of my sex life which although apparently endlessly entertaining to angel didnt detain us for long what about that cop the one whod started coming into the bear cagney macy yeah her sharon macy was pretty and dark and shed certainly been sending out signals of interest but i had still been trying to figure out how to deal with the fact that rachel and our daughter were now going to be living in vermont and that my relationship with rachel was effectively over it was too soon i said theres no such thing as too soon said louis theres just too late and then theres dead a trio of young men in loosefitting jeans oversized tshirts and freshoutofthebox sneakers oozed along congress like algae on the surface of a pond heading for the bars on fore street they had out of town written all over them well written anywhere that wasnt already occupied by a brand or the name of a rapper one god help us even wore a retro black power tshirt complete with clenched fist even though they were all so white they made pee wee herman look like malcolm x beside us two men were eating burgers and minding their own business one of them wore a discreet rainbow triangle on the collar of his jacket and a vote no on i badge beneath it a reference to the impending proposition intended to overturn the possibility of gay marriage in the state you gonna marry him bitch said one of the passing strangers and his friends laughed the two men tried to get on with their meal fags said the same guy clearly on a roll he was small but muscled up he leaned over and took a french fry from the plate of the man with the badges who responded with an aggrieved hey i aint gonna eat it man said their tormentor never know what i might catch from you burn rod said one of his buddies and they highfived rod tossed the fry on the ground then turned his attention to angel and louis who were watching them without expression what you looking at said rod you faggots too no said angel im an undercover heterosexual and im really white said louis he is really white i confirmed takes him hours to put on his makeup before he can leave the house rod looked confused his face fell into the appropriate expression without too much effort so it probably wasnt the first time so im just like you continued louis because youre not really black either heres something for you to think about all those bands on your shirts they only tolerate you because you put money in their pockets theyre hardcore and theyre talking to and about black people in an ideal world they wouldnt need you and youd just have to go back to listening to bread or coldplay or some other maudlin shit that white boys are humming to these days but for now those guys will take your money and if you ever wander into any of the hoods they emerged from youll get stomped and someone will take the rest of your money as well and maybe your sneakers too you want me to i can draw you a map and you can go express your solidarity with them see how that works out for you otherwise you run along and take curly and larry there with you go on now bust a move or whatever it is you homeboys do to help you perambulate bread i said youre a little out of touch with popular culture arent you all that shit sounds the same said louis im down with the kids yeah the kids from the nineteenth century i could kick your ass said rod feeling the urge to contribute something to the conversation he might have been dumb enough to believe it but the two guys behind him were smarter which wasnt exactly something worth putting on their business cards already they were trying to move rod along yes you could said louis feel better now by the way said angel i lied im not really heterosexual although he still really isnt black i looked at angel in surprise hey you never told me you were gay i knew that id never have let you adopt those children too late now said angel the girls are all wearing comfortable shoes and the boys are singing show tunes oh you gays and your cunning ways you could run the world if you werent so busy just making things prettier rod seemed about to say something else when louis moved he didnt get up from his chair and there was nothing obviously threatening about what he did but it was the equivalent of a dozing rattlesnake adjusting its coils in preparation for a strike or a spider tensing in the corner of its web as it watches the fly alight even through his fog of alcohol and stupidity rod glimpsed the possibility of serious suffering at some point in the near future not here perhaps on a busy street with cop cars cruising by but later maybe in a bar or a restroom or a parking lot and it would mark him for the rest of his life without another word the three young men slipped away and they did not look back nicely done i said to louis what are you going to do for an encore scowl at a puppy might steal a toy from a kitten said louis put it on a high shelf well you struck a blow for something there im just not sure what it was quality of life said louis i guess beside us the two men abandoned their burgers left a twenty and ten on the table and hurried away without saying a word you even frighten your own people you probably convinced that guy to vote yes on prop one just in case you decide to move here with that in mind remind us why were here again said angel they had arrived barely an hour before and their bags were still in the trunk of their car louis and angel only took planes when it was absolutely necessary to do so as airlines tended to frown on the tools of their trade i told them everything from my first meeting with bennett patchett through the discovery of the tracking device on my car and finished with my conversation with ronald straydeer and the sending of the photographs from damien patchetts funeral so they know that you havent dropped the case said angel if the gps tracker was working yes they also know that i visited karen emory which may not be good for her you warn her i left a message on her cell phone another call in person might just have compounded the problem you think theyll come at you again asked louis wouldnt you id have killed you the first time said louis if they figured you for the kind of guy who walks away after some amateur waterboarding they got you all wrong straydeer said that theyd started out with the intention of helping wounded soldiers it may be that killing is a last resort the one who interrogated me said that nobody was going to be hurt by what they were doing but he made an exception for you funny how folk do that where youre concerned which brings us back to why youre here and why were meeting in public on a bright summer evening if theyre watching you want them to know that youre not alone i need a couple of days if i can get them to keep their distance it will make life that much easier and if they dont keep their distance then you can hurt them i said louis raised his glass and drank well heres to not keeping ones distance he said we paid our check and headed to the grill room on exchange for steak for the prospect of hurting someone always made louis hungry jimmy jewel sat in his usual seat as earle finished closing up it was close to midnight and the bar had been quiet all evening a few rummies looking for a straightener after the previous nights excesses yet without the stamina or the funds to embark on another bender and a pair of masshole tourists who had taken a wrong turn and then decided to order a couple of beers while congratulating themselves on the authentic squalor of their surroundings unfortunately earle didnt take kindly to people making unkind remarks about his working environment especially not urban preppies who in the good old days would have been kissing the lid of a trash can in a back alley as atonement for their bad manners the massholes attempt to order a second round was met by a blank stare and the suggestion that they should take their business elsewhere preferably somewhere over the state line or even over multiple state lines you got a way with people jimmy told earle you ought to be with the un helping in trouble spots you wanted them to stay you should have said earle replied his face was guileless there were times when even jimmy didnt know if earle was being sincere or not still waters and all that thought jimmy occasionally earle would pass a remark or make an observation and jimmy would stop whatever he was doing as his brain struggled to process what he had just heard forcing him to reassess earle just when he believed that he had him figured out lately it was earles choice of reading material that was throwing him he seemed to be playing catchup with classic literature and not just tom sawyer and huckleberry finn either earlier that evening earle had been reading a collection by tolstoy master and man and other stories when jimmy had questioned him about it earle had described the plot of the title story something about a wealthy guy who shields his serf after they both become lost in a winter storm so that the serf lives and the wealthy guy dies the wealthy guy made it to heaven as a consequence though so that was all right is there supposed to be a message in that jimmy had asked for whom for whom like earle was john houseman now i dont know said jimmy for wealthy guys with bad consciences im not a wealthy guy said earle so youre like the other guy i guess i mean i didnt take it that way you dont have to be one or the other its just a story if we get caught in a blizzard and one of us is going to die you think im not going to use you like a blanket to keep warm you think id take a hit for you earle had considered the question yeah he said i think you would take a hit for me wouldnt be the first time either and jimmy knew that earle was referring to sally cleaver because he had sensed it playing on earles conscience ever since the detectives first visit jimmy knew earle well enough by now to recognize when that particular ghost had chosen to whisper in earles ear youre out of your mind said jimmy maybe said earle thing of it is i wouldnt let you take that hit mr jewel id keep you alive even if i had to smother you to do it that sounded to jimmy like a contradiction in terms and he was also mildly disturbed by the image of his slender frame lost in the folds of earles fleshy body he decided that this was a conversation that they didnt need to have again with no further customers likely to trouble them and with other more pressing matters on his mind jimmy had told earle to lock the door for the night now the floor was swept the glasses were clean and the nights meager takings were safely locked up in the safe in jimmys office a newspaper lay half read by jimmys left hand this was unusual thought earle by now jimmy would usually have dispensed with the paper entirely even down to the crossword but today he had seemed distracted and he was currently staring at the pencil that lay on the bar before him as though expecting it to move of its own volition and provide him with the answers that he sought jimmy was right about earle despite his bulk and the impression he gave that his family tree still had members hanging from it making ookook noises earle was not an insensitive man the routine of the bar gave an order to his life that allowed him to function with the minimum of unwanted complexities but also gave him time to think his role was to lift carry threaten and guard and he performed all of these tasks willingly and without complaint he was paid relatively well for what he did but he was also loyal to jimmy jimmy looked out for him and he in turn looked out for jimmy but as his boss had guessed earle had been brooding in recent days he didnt like being reminded about sally cleaver earle was sorry for what had happened to her and he felt that he should have acted to prevent it but it wasnt like it was the first domestic that had ever broken out in the blue moon and earle was smart enough to know that the best course of action on such occasions was simply not to get involved but to move the feuding parties off the premises and let them sort everything out in the privacy of their own home it was only when cliffie andreas had come back into the bar with blood on his fists and face that earle had begun to realize his attitude amounted to an abdication of responsibility as one of the detectives had later put it indicating that in a just world earle would have spent some time behind bars alongside cliffie for what had happened deep down which was deeper than even jimmy might have allowed earle knew that the cop was right and so every year on the anniversary of sally cleavers death earle would leave a bouquet of flowers in the garbagestrewn weedcaked lot of the blue moon and apologize to the shade of the dead girl but jimmy had never ascribed even partial blame to earle for what had occurred even though it had led to the closure of the blue moon he made sure that earle had the best legal representation close by when there was talk of charging him as an accessory to the crime they had only ever discussed earles feelings about those events on one occasion and that was on the day that jimmy had told earle he was not going to reopen the bar earle had assumed that this meant he would be looking for employment elsewhere and that jimmy was washing his hands of him just like a lot of people said he should because around town earles name wasnt worth the spittle it would take to say it earle had begun to apologize again for allowing sally cleaver to die and as he did so he found that his voice was breaking he kept trying to form coherent sentences but they wouldnt come jimmy had sat him down and listened as earle described going outside and seeing sally cleavers ruined face and how he had knelt beside her as her lips moved and she spoke the last words that anyone would ever hear her speak im sorry she whispered as earle not knowing what else to do laid one of his huge hands on her forehead and gently brushed her bloodstained hair from her eyes at night earle told jimmy he saw sally cleavers face and his hand would reach out automatically to brush her hair from her eyes every night earle said i see her every night just before i fall asleep and jimmy had told him that it was a crying shame and all he could do to make up for it was ensure that it never happened to another woman either on his beat or off it not if he could do anything to prevent it the next day earle had started working at the sailmaker even though there was already barely enough custom for old vern sutcliffe the regular bartender when vern died a year later earle became the sole bartender at the sailmaker and thus it had remained ever since now after ruminating for hours on how he might broach the subject earle had come to a conclusion he placed the last bottles of beer in the cooler collapsed the box then made his way tentatively to where jimmy was sitting he laid his fists on the bar and said anything wrong mr jewel jimmy emerged from his reverie looking slightly shocked what did you say i said anything wrong mr jewel jimmy smiled in all of the years that he had known him earle had probably asked no more than two or three questions of a remotely personal nature now here he was his face filled with concern and only minutes after indicating that hed lay down his life for his employer if things went any further theyd be booking a church for the wedding and moving to ogunquit or hallowell or somewhere else with too many rainbow flags hanging from the windows thank you for asking earle everything is fine im just mulling over how to handle a certain matter when ive figured it out though i may ask for your help earle looked relieved hed already come as close as he had ever done to expressing his affection for mr jewel and he wasnt sure that he could cope with any further intimacy he lumbered away to add the crushed box to the recycling pile leaving jimmy alone jimmy took a series of photographs from beneath the newspaper and examined once again the images of the jeweled seals the gems alone were worth a fortune but combined with the artifacts themselves well jimmy had no concept of how much the right person might pay for such an item now jimmy knew that tobias and his buddies were not smuggling drugs they were smuggling antiquities jimmy wondered what else in a similar vein they might have in their possession he had spent a day trying to work out the angles figuring out a way that he could profit from what he had learned and at the same time expand his knowledge his only regret was that rojas was involved rojas had let slip that he had begun trying to sell on some of the gems and gold promising jimmy a cut of twenty percent as a finders fee as though jimmy were just some rube to be palmed off with a chumps cut rojas couldnt see the big picture the trouble was neither could jimmy but unlike him rojas wasnt prepared to wait until it was revealed jimmy twisted the saucer with his finger causing the cold coffee in the cup to ripple slightly he wasnt hurting for money but he could always do with more the downturn in the economy and the hiatus in the development of the waterfront meant that he had cash tied up in buildings that were depreciating with every passing day the market would bounce back it always did but jimmy wasnt getting any younger he didnt want it to bounce back just in time to provide him with a bigger headstone he shivered there was an unseasonably cool breeze coming in off the water and jimmy was highly susceptible to cold even in the height of summer he wore a jacket he had always been that way ever since he was a little kid there just wasnt enough meat on his bones to keep him warm hey earle he called close the goddamn door there was no reply jimmy swore he walked through the office and past the storeroom to where a door opened on to the bars small parking lot he stepped outside there was no sign of earle jimmy called his name again suddenly uneasy his foot slipped as he stepped into the lot he looked down and saw the dark spreading stain to his left was earles truck the blood was coming from beneath it jimmy squatted so that he could see under the truck and looked into earles dead eyes the big man was lying on his belly on the far side of the vehicle between the passenger door and the garbage cans by the wall his mouth open his face frozen in a final grimace of pain jimmy stood and felt the gun nudge his skull like deaths first tentative touch inside said a voice and jimmy couldnt hide his surprise at the sound of it but he did as he was told he glanced at the truck as he rose and caught a glimpse of a masked figure reflected in the window then the blows rained down on him for having the temerity to look kicks followed driving him along the hallway and into the storeroom the assault ceased as jimmy crawled over to the liquor shelves looking for some kind of purchase so he could raise himself he could taste blood in his mouth and he had trouble seeing out of his left eye he tried to speak but the words came out as hoarse whispers still it was clear that he was begging for time to recover for the blows to stop for more life one of the kicks had broken a rib and he could feel it grinding as he moved he slumped against the shelves drawing ragged breaths he raised his right hand in a placatory gesture you killed a man for a hundred and fifty dollars and change said jimmy you hear me no i killed him for much more than that and jimmy knew for sure that this wasnt about the money in the safe it was about rojas and the seal and jimmy jewel understood that he was about to die as the black mouth of the suppressor gaped like the void into which jimmy would soon pass he gave away everything after the first shot but his interrogator had fired two more anyway just to be sure that he wasnt holding anything back no more said jimmy no more his wounds bleeding onto the floor and it was both a plea and an admission a rejection of further pain and an acceptance that all was about to come to an end his interrogator nodded oh my god whispered jimmy i am heartily sorry the final bullet came he did not hear it but only felt the mercy of it it would be days before his body and that of earle were found summer rains came that night and washed away earles blood sending it flowing across the sloped surface of the lot through the wooden pilings that supported the old pier and into the sea salt to salt earles truck was left at the maine mall and when it was still there after two days mall security took an interest and subsequently the police arrived for by then it was clear that jimmy jewel had fallen off the radar calls were going unanswered and beer could not be delivered to the sailmaker and the drunks who worshipped there missed its cloisters jimmy was discovered in the storeroom he had been shot through both feet and one knee by which point he had presumably told all that he knew and therefore the fourth shot had taken him through the heart earle lay at jimmys ruined feet like a faithful hound dispatched to keep its master company in the afterlife it was only later that someone noticed the correspondence of dates earle and jimmy had died on june nd ten years to the day since sally cleaver had breathed her last at the back of the blue moon and old men shrugged and said that they were not surprised karen emory woke to find joel gone from their bed she listened for a time but could hear no sound beside her the clock on the night table read am she had been dreaming and now as she lay awake trying to discern some indication of his presence in the house she felt a kind of gratitude that she was no longer sleeping it was foolish of course in less than three hours she would have to get up and get dressed for work she had decided that she would keep working for mr patchett for the moment and had told joel so when she came home and found him returned from his trip a dressing on his face that he wouldnt explain he hadnt objected which had surprised her but maybe her arguments had made sense to him or so she thought at first that work was hard to come by that she couldnt just sit around at home or shed go crazy that shed give mr patchett no further cause to go looking into her affairs or joels she needed to sleep soon her legs and feet would be aching from hours of service but then her feet always hurt even with the best shoes in the world which she couldnt have afforded anyway not on her pay she still would have experienced the ache in her heels and the balls of her feet that came from standing for eight hours a day mr patchett was a better boss than most though better in fact than any boss shed ever had before which was one of the reasons that she wanted to remain at the downs diner shed worked for enough sleazebags in her time to recognize a good soul when she encountered one and she was grateful for the hours that he gave her the diner could easily get by with one less waitress and as one of the most recent employees she would be among the first to be shown the door but he continued to put regular work her way he was looking out for her the way he looked out for all of the people who worked for him and at a time when businesses were letting staff go left and right there was something to be said for a man who was prepared to shuck a little profit in order to let people live but mr patchetts concern for her was a problem especially since the private detective had started nosing around as joel put it shed have to be careful what she said to mr patchett just as shed tried to be careful when the detective came to the house even though shed ended up saying more than she should have it was joel who had first spotted the detective joel had a kind of sixth sense about these things for a man he was very perceptive he could tell when she was sad or when there was something preying on her mind just by looking at her and she had never encountered a man like that before maybe shed just been unlucky with her choices before joel came along and most men were as attuned to the women they were with but she doubted it joel was unusual in that way and in others and yet karen hadnt wanted to tell joel about the detectives visit she couldnt have said why exactly not at first except for a vague sense that joel wasnt being straight with her about parts of his life and because of her own fears for his safety which was why shed let some stuff slip to the detective when he came by she had watched how the deaths of joels friends had affected him he was frightened even though he didnt want to show it then he had come home yesterday evening with the bandaid on his face and the wounds on his hands and wouldnt speak of how hed hurt himself instead hed retired to the basement moving stuff in boxes down there from the truck wincing sometimes when a box touched against his injuries and when he eventually came to bed well that hadnt been so good she sighed and stretched the clock had moved up two digits there was still no sound no flushing of the toilet or closing of the refrigerator door she wondered what joel was doing but she was afraid to go looking for him not after what happened earlier karen wondered if he had been hiding that aspect of himself all along and if she had been mistaken in her assessment of him no not mistaken misled taken for a fool manipulated and abused by a man she hardly knew she had been looking to get away from the patchett dorms oh shed been grateful for the room and the company of the other women but such places were always meant to be temporary stops she felt even though one of the waitresses eileen had been living there for fifteen years now that wasnt going to happen to karen living like a spinster according to mr patchetts oldfashioned rules about not keeping male company in the dorm house first it had seemed like damien might have provided an escape but he had no interest in her she thought that he might even have been gay but eileen assured her that he was not hed had a fling with the previous hostess in between deployments and it had seemed like they might get together permanently but she hadnt wanted to become an army wife or worse an army widow and it had fizzled out karen thought that mr patchett might have liked it if she and damien had become an item and when damien returned home permanently his father had done everything to steer the two of them together inviting karen to have dinner with them or sending her off with damien to buy produce and talk to suppliers but by then shed already begun seeing joel whom shed met through damien when she had eventually allowed joel to pick her up from work for the first time shed seen the disappointment in mr patchetts face he hadnt said anything but it was there and hed never been quite as easy with her after that when his son died the possibility struck her that he might believe she was in some way to blame for what happened that if damien had someone to care for and who cared for him then he wouldnt have taken his own life maybe that was what lay behind the hiring of the detective mr patchett was angry at her for dating joel but he was taking it out on joel not her joel made good money driving his truck more money than she thought an independent truck driver could or should make most of his work involved him moving back and forth across the border with canada shed tried to find out about it from him and hed told her that he hauled whatever needed to be hauled but the way he said it left her under no illusions that this was a discussion he either welcomed or wanted to continue and shed dropped the subject still she wondered but she loved joel she had decided that within a couple of weeks of meeting him she just knew he was strong he was kind and he was older than she so he understood more about the world which made her feel secure he had a place of his own and when he asked her to move in with him hed barely had time to finish the sentence before shed said yes it was a house too not some apartment where theyd be bumping into the walls and getting on each others nerves there was plenty of space two bedrooms upstairs and a smaller box room a big living area and a nice kitchen and a basement where he kept his tools he was clean too cleaner than most of the men that shed known before oh the bathroom had needed a good scrub and the kitchen too but they werent filthy just untidy shed been happy to do it she was proud of their house that was how she thought of it their house not just his not anymore slowly she was imposing elements of her own personality upon it and he seemed content to let her do so there were flowers in vases and more books than there had been before shed even picked up some pictures for the walls when shed asked him if he liked them hed said sure and made an effort to examine each one as though he were appraising them for a sale at some later date she knew that he was just doing it to please her though he was a man largely unconcerned with trimmings and she doubted if he would even have noticed the paintings if she hadnt pointed them out to him but she appreciated the fact that hed made the effort to seem interested was he a good man she didnt know shed thought so at the start but hed changed so much in recent weeks then again she supposed that all men changed once they got what they wanted they stopped being quite as caring as before as solicitous it was as if they put up a front to attract women and then slowly shed it once that was achieved some dispensed with it more quickly than others and lord knows shed seen men switch from lambs to wolves with the flip of a coin or with one last drink for the road but his change had appeared more gradual and was somehow more disturbing because of that at first hed just been distracted he didnt talk as much to her and he sometimes snapped at her when she persisted in trying to have a conversation she thought that it might have been something to do with his injuries sometimes his hand hurt hed lost two fingers from his left in iraq and his hearing wasnt so good in his left ear hed been lucky the other guys hit by the ied hadnt made it he rarely talked about what had happened but she knew enough he was away a lot driving his truck and there were his army buddies the ones who used to come to the house but didnt anymore they never said much to her and one of them paul bacci gave her the creeps the way his eyes wandered over her body lingering on her breasts her crotch when they arrived joel would close the living room door and she would hear the steady buzz of their soft tones through the walls like insects trapped in the cavities joel there was no reply she wanted to go and find him but she was frightened she was frightened because he had hit her again it had come as she tried to question him about his wounds after she opened the bathroom door and saw him applying salve to the burns on his hands and the terrible one on his face he had answered her question with one of his own why didnt you tell me about your visitor he said and it took her a moment to realize that she was referring to parker the detective after all how could he have known she was still trying to come up with a suitable reply when his right hand had shot out and caught her not hard and hed seemed almost as shocked by what hed done as she was but it had been a strike nonetheless catching her on the left cheek and causing her to stumble backward against the wall it was different from the first time that had been an accident she was sure of it this one had power and venom behind it hed apologized as soon as it happened but she was already running to the bedroom and it was a couple of minutes before he followed her he kept trying to talk to her but she wouldnt listen she couldnt listen she was crying so hard eventually he just held her and she felt him fall asleep against her and in time she fell asleep too because it was an escape from thinking about what he had just done he woke her during the night to say sorry again and his lips had brushed hers his hands searching her body and they had made up but no they hadnt not really she had done it for him not for herself she hadnt wanted him to feel bad and she hadnt wanted him to hurt her yes that was it that was the horror of it now as she lay in the darkness she realized that her view of him had changed as much as he had shed wanted him to be a good man or at least a better man than some of those shed dated before him but deep down she thought now that he wasnt not really not if he could hit her like that not if he was changing so dramatically sex was no longer gentle hed actually hurt her some when hed woken her earlier and when shed asked him to be more tender with her hed simply finished and turned away from her leaving her staring at his bare back im talking to you shed said and had tugged at his shoulder trying to get him to look at her shed felt him tense up and then he had turned and the expression on his face even in the darkness had caused her to let her hand fall and she had moved as far away from him as she could in their bed for a moment she had been certain that he was going to hit her again but he had not leave me alone he had said and there was something in his eyes that might almost have been fear and shed had the sense that he might have been talking both to her and to someone else an unseen entity of whom only he was aware then she had dozed and the dream had come she couldnt call it a nightmare not really although it made her uneasy in it she was trapped in a small space almost like a coffin but it was simultaneously larger and smaller than that which made no sense to her she was struggling for breath and her mouth and nostrils were filling with dust but worst of all she wasnt alone there was a presence in there with her and it was whispering she couldnt understand what it was saying and she wasnt even sure that the words were meant for her anyway but it never stopped speaking a noise came from downstairs an unfamiliar sound that did not belong in the darkness of their home it was a giggle quickly stifled there was something childlike about it yet also unpleasant it was a spontaneous eruption of mirth at a word or act that was more shocking than funny it was laughter at a thing that should not be laughed at carefully she pushed back the blankets and put her feet to the floor the boards did not creak joel had done much of the work on the house himself and was proud of its solidity she padded across the carpet and opened the door wider now she heard whispering but it was his voice not the voice of the others the ones in her dream others she had not recognized that before it was not one but more than one there were many voices all speaking in the same tongue but using different words she moved to the top of the stairs then knelt down and peered through the banisters joel was sitting crosslegged on the floor by the cellar door his hands in his lap tugging at his fingers he reminded her of a small boy and she almost smiled at the sight of him almost he was carrying on a conversation with someone on the other side of the basement door he always kept that door locked it didnt concern her unduly not at first shed gone down there with him to help him bring up some paint during the first week after shed moved in and it had seemed to her just the usual clutter of boxes junk and old machinery since then she had rarely gone down there and always with joel he hadnt forbidden her from entering the basement he was smarter than that and anyway she had no cause to do so in addition she had never liked dark spaces which was probably why her dream was troubling her so much she held her breath as she peered down straining to hear what he was saying he was whispering but she could hear no response to his words instead he would speak for a moment then listen before responding sometimes he would nod his head silently as though following the course of an argument that only he could hear he giggled again and as he did so he put his hands to his mouth smothering the sound he glanced up instinctively as he did so but she was hidden in the shadows thats bad he said youre naughty then he seemed to listen once more ive tried he said i cant do it i dont know how he was silent again his face grew serious she heard him swallow hard and thought that she could sense his fear even from her perch above him no he said determinedly no i wont do that he shook his head no please i wont you cant ask me to do that you cant he put his hands to his ears trying to block out the voice that only he could hear he stood up keeping his hands in place leave me alone he said his voice rising stop it stop whispering you have to stop whispering he banged against the wall as he began to climb the stairs stop it he said and she could hear in his voice that he had begun to cry stop stop stop she slipped back into the bedroom and pulled the sheets around her seconds before he opened the door and stepped inside he did it so noisily that she couldnt help but react but she did her best to sound sleepy and surprised honey she said lifting her head from the pillow are you okay he didnt answer her joel she said whats the matter she saw him move toward her and she was frightened he sat down on the edge of the bed and touched his hand to her hair im sorry i hit you he said but id never hurt you bad not really she felt her stomach contract so hard that she was sure shed have to run to the bathroom to avoid soiling herself it was those last two words not really as if it was somehow okay to hurt someone a little now and again but only when it was deserved only when a nosy little bitch asked questions that she shouldnt or entertained snoops in the kitchen only then and the punishment would fit the crime and later she could spread herself for him and theyd make up and it would be all right because he loved her and that was what people who loved each other did when i hit you he continued that wasnt me it was something else it was like i was a puppet and someone pulled my string i dont want to hurt you i love you i know she replied trying to keep the tremor from her voice and only partly succeeding honey whats wrong he leaned into her and she felt his tears as he put his cheek against hers she wrapped her arms around him i had a bad dream he said and she heard the child in him even as she did so she looked down and saw him staring up at her and for an instant his eyes were cold and suspicious and even she thought amused as though they were both playing a game here but only he knew the rules then it was gone his eyes closing as he nuzzled against her breasts she held him tightly even as she felt the urge to cast him aside to run from that house and never ever return stress damages the mind that was what they didnt understand the people back home the ones who hadnt been there even the army didnt understand that not until it was too late take a little r r they said hang out with the family make love to your girlfriend occupy yourself get a job find a routine embrace normality but he couldnt have done that even if his legs didnt end halfway down his thighs because stress is like a poison a toxin working its way through the system except that it affects only one vital organ the brain he remembered how hed been in an automobile accident out on route i when he was thirteen shortly before his dad died it hadnt been a bad smash a truck had run a red light and had hit the passenger side of their car hed been in the back on the drivers side it was pure dumb luck there was an automobile dealership on that part of the road and it always had some cool old cars lined up outside if the weather was good he liked looking at them imagining himself behind the wheel of the best of them at any other time hed have been on the passenger side so that he could talk to his dad and who knows what might have happened then instead theyd both been shaken up pretty badly and hed been cut some by the glass afterward when the tow truck had gone and the scarborough cops had given them a ride home hed gone pale and started shaking before puking up his breakfast that was what stress did it made you ill physically and mentally and if you kept encountering stressful situations day after day broken up by periods of tedium of hanging around playing games or eating or catching some rack or writing the compulsory monthly card home to let your nearest and dearest know that you werent dead yet with no end in sight because your deployment kept being extended then your neurons became so polluted that they couldnt recover and your brain began to rewire itself altering its modes of operation the nerve cell extensions in the hippocampus which deals with learning and longterm memory started to rot the response capacity of the amygdala which governs social behavior and emotional memory changed the medial prefrontal cortex which is involved in establishing feelings of fear and remorse and enables us to interpret what is real and unreal altered similar frazzling of the wiring could be found in schizophrenics sociopaths drug addicts and longterm prisoners you became like the dregs and it wasnt your fault because you hadnt done anything wrong youd simply done your duty during the civil war they called it irritable heart for the soldiers of the great war it was shell shock and in world war ii it was battle fatigue or war neurosis then it became postvietnam syndrome and now it was ptsd he sometimes wondered if the romans had a word for it and the greeks he had read the iliad upon his return part of his attempt to understand war through its literature and believed that he saw in the grief of achilles for his friend patroclus and in the rage that followed something of his own grief for the comrades that he had lost damien most of all they left you this way your emotions are no longer under control you are no longer under your own control you become depressed paranoid removed from those who care about you you believe that you are still at war you fight your bedclothes at night you become estranged from your loved ones and they leave you and maybe just maybe you start believing that you are haunted that demons speak to you from boxes and when you cant satisfy them when you cant do what they want you to do they turn you against yourself and they punish you for your failings and maybe just maybe that moment of obliteration comes as a relief herod arrived in portland by train at am carrying only a black garment bag the leather old but undamaged a testament to the quality of its manufacture he was not averse to flying and rarely felt the necessity to carry anything that might make a bag search at an airport awkward if not actively unwelcome but where possible he preferred to travel by train it reminded him of a more civilized era when the pace of life was slower and people had more time for small courtesies in addition his debilitated condition meant that he found driving for long distances to be uncomfortable and a chore as well as potentially hazardous for the medication that he took to control his pain often led to drowsiness unfortunately this was not a particular problem at present he had reduced the dosage to keep his head clear and consequently he was suffering on a train he could get up and prowl the carriage or stand in the café car sipping a drink anything to distract himself from the torments of the body he had taken a seat in a quiet car at penn station a contented smile on his face as the train emerged from below ground into hazy sunshine the blue surgical mask hid his mouth and attracted only one or two glances from those who passed him he became aware of the captains presence just as the manhattan skyline vanished from view the captain was sitting in the seat directly across the aisle from herod visible only in the window glass and then only partially he was a smear a blur a moving figure captured by a camera lens when all around him was otherwise still herod found it easier to see him when he did not look directly at him the captain was dressed as a clown say what you wanted about the captain herod thought but he had a fondness for the old reliables the captain wore a jacket of white and red stripes and a small bowler hat from beneath which sections of a bedraggled red wig sprouted there were cobwebs in the artificial hairs and herod thought that he could make out the shapes of spiders moving through them his forearms were extended along the armrests of his seat and his hands were mostly hidden by stained white gloves except at the fingertips where sharp blackened nails had erupted through the material the forefinger of his right hand tapped rhythmically slowly raising itself and then falling like a mechanical device winding and then releasing over and over the captains face was painted with white pan stick makeup the mouth was large and red and painted as a frown there were blots of rouge on each cheek but the eye sockets were empty and black the captain stared fixedly ahead and only his finger moved the car was full but the captains seat while apparently unoccupied remained empty as did the seat next to herods as though something of the captains aura had extended across the aisle the woman seated by the window next to the captain was old and herod watched her discomfort grow as the journey progressed she shifted in her seat she tried to put her arm on the shared rest but she would only allow it to remain in place for a second or two before she withdrew it and rubbed her skin in distress sometimes her nose wrinkled her face crinkling in disgust she began to brush at her hair and face and when herod looked at her reflection he could see that some of the captains spiders had begun to colonize her gray strands eventually she picked up her coat and bag and left for another car new passengers passed through the car after each regional station stop and although a number paused at the two empty seats some atavistic instinct caused them to move on and all the time the captain sat and his finger went taptaptap herod alighted at portlands new transport terminal he could still recall the old union station where the service from boston had once terminated he had last taken it when he thought yes certainly it was he could almost picture the big silver car with its interlinked blue b and white m the fact that there was now a train once again between boston and maine even if it meant switching stations at boston pleased him he took a cab to the airport in order to pick up a rental car like his train ticket the reservation was not in his own name instead he was traveling under the name uccello herod always used the name of a renaissance artist when he was obliged to show identification he had drivers licenses and passports in the name of dürer bruegel and bellini but he had a special fondness for uccello one of the first artists to use perspective in his paintings herod liked to think that he too had an awareness of perspective the captain was no longer with him the captain was elsewhere herod drove into portland and found the bar owned by the man named jimmy jewel he parked behind the building opposite and slipped his gun into the pocket of his overcoat before making his way to the other side of the wharf the bar appeared to be closed and he could see no signs of life inside as he stared through the glass the captain returned a bright reflected figure he stood for a moment that red frown fixed on his face then turned and walked to the back of the bar herod followed the captains progress visible in the panes of the windows like the frames of a film being projected too slowly at the rear door herod knelt and examined the step he touched his fingers to the spots of blood then stared at the door for a moment before nodding to himself and turning away he was back at the car and about to start the engine when he felt a coldness on his forearm he looked to the right and saw the captains image in the passenger window the captains left hand holding him in place the nails like the stingers of insects the captains attention was fixed upon the bar there was a man at the main door his actions mirroring herods own earlier attempts to see inside he was about fiveten in height his hair graying at the temples herod watched him curiously there was a sense of threat to the new arrival it was in the way that he held himself a kind of grim selfpossession but there was an otherness to him too and herod aided by the captain recognized one like himself a man who spanned two worlds he wondered what it was that had opened the fissure that had enabled this one to see as herod saw pain yes inevitably so but not merely physical not where this man was concerned herod picked up grief and rage and guilt the captain acting like a transmitter pulses of emotion coursing through him as if responding to herods interest the man turned he stared at herod he frowned the grip tightened on herods arm and herod understood the captains desire to leave he started the engine and pulled away passing two other men as he turned right a black man exquisitely attired and a smaller white man who appeared to have dressed in a hurry from his laundry basket he saw them watching him in his rearview mirror and then they were gone and so too was the captain you see that guy in the car i asked louis yeah the one with the mask didnt get a good look at him but id guess that hes ailing for something was he alone alone yes was there someone else in the passenger seat beside him louis appeared puzzled no it was just him why nothing it must have been the sunlight on his window no sign of jimmy jewel ill try again later lets go herod drove to waldoboro because that was where his contact lived the old woman who ran the antique store he ordered coffee and a sandwich in a diner and made a call from a pay phone while he waited for his food to arrive only a handful of other customers were present none of them nearby so he had no fear of being overheard where do we stand he said when the call was answered he lives above a warehouse in lewiston an old bakery herod listened as the location was described to him in detail does he keep company with his kind he asked some and the items it appears that some interested parties have already emerged but they remain in his possession herod grimaced how did the other parties come to hear of them he is a careless man word has spread i am on my way make contact with him tell him id like to talk ill tell mr rojas that i may have a buyer and that he should take no further action until we meet as you know he is not unaware of the value of the objects it could be an expensive business im sure that i can convince the seller to be reasonable especially since i have no interest in what he is selling merely in the source nevertheless he is not a reasonable man really said herod how unfortunate neither is he unintelligent intelligent and unreasonable one would have assumed such qualities were mutually contradictory i have a photograph of him if that might help i printed it from the surveillance camera in my store herod described his car and where it was parked he told the woman that it was unlocked and she should leave whatever material she had under the passenger seat it was better he felt if they did not meet the woman did her best not to sound disappointed at the news he hung up his food had arrived he ate it slowly and in a corner far from the other customers he knew that his appearance had a way of putting people off their food but equally he found eating under such scrutiny to be unpleasant eating was hard enough for him as it was his appetite was minimal at best but he had to consume to keep his strength up that was more important now than ever before as he ate he thought about the man at the window of the bar and the captains reaction to his presence there was a mirror on the wall opposite his booth it reflected the road where a little girl in a torn blue dress her back to the diner held a red balloon and watched the cars and trucks going by a big mack rig was heading her way but she did not move and the driver high in his cab did not appear to see her herod turned from the mirror as the truck hit the girl driving straight over her herod almost cried out and when the truck had passed the girl was gone there was no sign that she had ever been there slowly herod looked back at the mirror and the girl was where she had always been except now she was facing the diner and herod she seemed to smile at him even as the dark hollows of her eyes mocked the light gradually she faded from sight and in the reflected world her balloon floated up toward grayblack clouds streaked with purple and red like wounds torn in the heavens then the sky cleared and the mirror was merely a reflection of this dull world not a window into another when herod had eaten as much as he was able he lingered over his coffee after all he had plenty of time it would be some time before darkness fell and herod worked best in the dark then he would pay a visit to mr rojas herod had no intention of waiting until the next day to begin negotiations in fact herod had no intention of negotiating at all far away in an apartment on the rue du seine in paris just above the sales rooms of the esteemed ancient art dealers rochman et fils a deal was about to be concluded emmanuel rochman the latest in a long line of rochmans to make a very comfortable living from the sale of the rarest of antiquities waited for the iranian businessman seated across from him to cease prevaricating and announce the decision that they both knew he had already reached after all this facetoface meeting in the presence of the ancient artifacts was but the final step in a lengthy negotiation that had begun many weeks before and items as rare and beautiful as those currently before him were never likely to be offered to him again two delicate ivories from the tombs of the assyrian queens at nimrud and a pair of exquisite lapis lazuli cylindrical seals years old and therefore the oldest such items that rochman had ever been able to offer for sale the iranian sighed and shuffled on his seat rochman liked dealing with iranians the iranians had been particularly keen pursuers of the stolen items from the iraq museum that had so far made it on to the market even if they like the jordanians had ultimately been forced to relinquish most of the loot that had come their way while many thousands of items remained missing the most valuable of them had largely been recovered opportunities to acquire iraqi treasures were growing increasingly rare and the amount that collectors were willing to pay had increased accordingly although rochman had not encountered this particular buyer before he came strongly recommended by two former clients who had spent a great deal of money with monsieur rochman without troubling themselves unduly about matters of provenance and paperwork will there be more asked the iranian he called himself mr abbas the lion which was clearly a pseudonym but his goodwill deposit of two million dollars had cleared without a hitch and those who vouched for him had assured rochman that two million dollars barely represented a days earnings for mr abbas nevertheless rochman was starting to grow weary of this particular lion hunt come he thought i know youre going to buy them just say yes and we can be done not like these said rochman then reconsidered who knew how much extra revenue a little patience might generate the ivories or others even half as beautiful as them are unlikely ever to resurface if you decline they will disappear the seals he tipped his right hand back and forth in the universal gesture of possibility erring on the side of the negative but if you are satisfied with this particular purchase artifacts of a similar quality may be made available to you and provenance the house of rochman stands behind everything that it sells said rochman naturally were any legal issues to materialize the buyer would be the first to know but i am confident that no such difficulties will arise in this particular instance it was a standard line on the rare occasions when rochman truly breached the boundaries of legality oh there were often gray areas when it came to ancient treasures but this was not one of them both he and abbas knew the source of the ivories and the seals it did not need to be spoken aloud and no receipts would accompany this particular sale abbas nodded in apparent contentment well i am satisfied he said let us proceed he reached into his pocket and removed a gold pen pressing the top to make the nib appear you wont need a pen monsieur abbas rochman began to say which is when the door burst open and armed police appeared and mr abbas smiled at him and said the name is aldaini monsieur rochman my colleagues and i have some questions for you angel and louis had stayed with me at my house and i suspected that neither of them had slept simultaneously that night conscious that a move might be made against us at any time the next morning i spent an hour with them going back over everything that i knew about joel tobias he was the principal link and it was a useful exercise the fact that he had served in the military helped since it meant the existence of an official paper trail for a big chunk of his life it all seemed pretty straightforward he had signed up in straight out of high school in bangor and had trained as a truck driver hed been invalided out early in after an ied exploded while he was escorting medical supplies to the green zone in baghdad removing part of his left calf and two fingers on his left hand when he returned to maine later that year he applied for a maine commercial drivers license after passing the written exam eye exam and road exam he had also received a hazmat endorsement after putting his fingerprints on record and passing the requisite transportation safety administration background check so far his license was clean i found an obituary notice for his mother in the bangor daily news of july and another for his father who had served in vietnam in april it mentioned that his son joel was also serving in the military and was recuperating after being injured in the line of duty there was even a picture of tobias at the graveside he was in full dress uniform and was supporting himself on crutches there were no siblings joel tobias was an only child i felt an unwelcome pang the guilt of someone who had not made sacrifices for his country now faced with someone who had it seemed on the surface that tobias had served honorably and had suffered for it i had never even considered the military as an option when i left school but i respected those who had i wondered what had made tobias sign up was it family history a belief that he should follow in his fathers footsteps then again his father had not been a career soldier the obit made it clear that he had been drafted a lot of guys had come back from vietnam with a burning desire to ensure that their kids didnt have to go through what they had i supposed that since tobias had signed up willingly he was either rebelling against his old man or seeking his approval i then opened up the file on bobby jandreau who had gone to the same high school in bangor as tobias although more than a decade separated them during jandreaus final tour in iraq hed been seriously injured in a gun battle in gazaliya the first bullet had hit him in the upper thigh and while he was lying in the dirt the shia militiamen who had attacked his convoy continued to fire shots at his legs in an effort to draw his comrades into a rescue and inflict further injuries on the squad jandreau had eventually been pulled to safety but his legs were ruined amputation had been judged the only option i knew all this because his name had been mentioned in a newspaper article on wounded maine veterans who were trying to cope with life outside the military damien patchett was named as the fellow soldier who had saved jandreaus life but if damien had been asked to comment he had declined in the course of the article jandreau admitted that he was struggling he spoke of an addiction to prescription medication which he was overcoming with the help of his girlfriend as the reporter noted jandreau stares out of the window of his bangor home his hands clutching the arms of his wheelchair i never really thought id end up like this he says like most guys i knew that there was a chance that it could happen but i always believed that it would be someone else whod get hurt not me im trying to find some positive aspect to it but there isnt one not that i can see it just sucks his girlfriend mel nelson strokes his hair tenderly there are tears in her eyes but jandreaus are dry it is as if he is still in shock or as if he has no more tears left to shed tough break said angel louis who was also reading from the screen said nothing i couldnt find an address for a bobby jandreau in bangor but the newspaper article had mentioned that mel nelson worked as an office manager in her fathers lumber company in veazie she was at her desk when i called and we had a long conversation sometimes people are just waiting for the right call it turned out that she was no longer bobbys girlfriend and she wasnt happy about the situation she cared about him and she loved him but he had driven her away and she couldnt understand why when i hung up i had bobby jandreaus address and phone number and a sense of admiration for mel nelson carrie saunders called while we were eating breakfast it would be untrue to say that she sounded enthused at the prospect of meeting me but i had learned not to take that kind of response personally i told her that i was working for bennett patchett damiens father and she simply confirmed an appointment at her office in the togus va medical center up in augusta at midday before hanging up louis and angel shadowed me all the way up to augusta i was interested to see what might emerge as we drove north but they detected no sign of pursuit carrie saunderss office was located close to the mental health service her name simply dr saunders was etched on a plastic plate by her door and when i knocked the door was opened by a woman in her midthirties with short blond hair and the build of a lightweight boxer she was wearing a dark tshirt over black business slacks and the muscles on her forearms and shoulders were clearly defined she was about fiveseven and sallow skinned her office was small and maximum use had been made of all available space there were three filing cabinets to my right and to my left there were bookshelves lined with assorted medical texts and cardboard document storage boxes on the walls was framed evidence of qualification from the uniformed services university of the health sciences in bethesda maryland and from walter reed one impressive piece of paper indicated a specialization in disaster psychiatry the floor was covered in hardwearing gray carpet her desk was neat and functional there was a disposable coffee cup beside the phone and the remains of a bagel i eat when i can she said clearing away what was left of her lunch if youre hungry we can get something at the canteen i told her that i was fine she gestured to the plastic chair at the opposite side of her desk and waited for me to sit before doing so herself how can i help you mr parker i understand that youre conducting research into posttraumatic stress disorder thats right with a particular emphasis on suicide on suicide prevention she corrected may i ask who told you about me it was probably my natural antipathy toward authority especially the kind of authority represented by the military but it seemed a good idea to keep ronald straydeer out of this for now id prefer not to say i replied is that a problem no just curious i dont often get private detectives requesting to see me i noticed that you didnt ask what this was about when we spoke on the phone i did some checking up on you youve got quite the reputation i could hardly turn down the prospect of meeting you my reputation is inflated i wouldnt believe everything that you read in the papers she smiled i didnt read about you in the papers i prefer to deal with people then we have that in common it may be the only thing tell me mr parker have you ever been in therapy no grief counseling no are you hustling for business as you noted im interested in posttraumatic stress and i seem like a candidate well wouldnt you agree i know about what happened to your wife and child it was appalling almost beyond countenance i say almost because i served my country in iraq and what i saw there what i endured there changed me every day i deal with the consequences of violence you might say that i have a context into which to place what youve gone through and what you may still be going through is this relevant it is if youre here to talk about posttraumatic stress whatever you learn today will be dependent on your understanding of the concept that understanding may be commensurately greater if you can relate to it personally however peripherally are we clear so far her smile hadnt gone away it managed to stay just the right side of patronizing but it was a closerun thing very good my research here is part of an ongoing effort on the part of the military to deal with the psychological effects of combat both on those who have served and have been invalided out and on those who have left for reasons unrelated to injury thats one aspect of it the other relates to preempting trauma at the moment we are phasing in emotional resiliency programs designed to improve combat performance and minimize mental heath difficulties including ptsd anger depression and suicide these symptoms have become increasingly recognizable as soldiers undertake repeated deployments not every soldier who experiences trauma will suffer from posttraumatic stress just as individuals in civilian life react differently to say assault rape natural disasters or the violent death of a loved one there will be a stress response but ptsd is not an automatic consequence psychology genetics physical condition and social factors all play a part an individual with a good support structure family friends professional intervention may be less likely to develop ptsd than say a loner on the other hand the longer the delay in developing ptsd then arguably the more severely it will be experienced immediate posttraumatic stress usually begins to improve after three to four months delayed ptsd may be more longterm up to a decade or more and is therefore harder to treat she paused okay thats the lecture part over with for now any questions none yet good now you get to participate and if i dont then you can leave this is a tradeoff mr parker you want my help im prepared to give it but only in return for something in this case its your willingness to acknowledge when and if any of the symptoms im about to detail are familiar to you you need answer only in the most general of terms there are no records of this conversation being kept if at some point in the future you would consider offering some deeper insights into what youve been through then i would be grateful you might even find it beneficial or therapeutic in any event it goes back to what i said at the start youre here to find out about ptsd this is your chance i had to admire her i could leave but i would have learned nothing except not to underestimate women who look like boxers and id figured that out long before i met carrie saunders go ahead i said i tried to keep the resignation out of my voice i dont think that i succeeded there are three main categories of posttraumatic stress disorder the first involves flashbacks the reexperiencing of the event that may have sparked the disorder or less severely and more commonly a series of unwanted intrusive thoughts that may feel like flashbacks but arent were talking about dreams and bad memories on one level or making associations with the event from unrelated situations youd be surprised at how many soldiers dislike fireworks and ive seen traumatized men hit the deck at the sound of a door banging even a child shooting a toy gun but on another level there may be an actual reliving of what occurred to the extent that it feels real enough to disrupt ordinary daytoday functioning one of my colleagues calls it ghosting i dont like the term myself but ive spoken to sufferers whove seized on the concept there was silence in the room a bird flew by the window and the sunlight caused its shadow to flit across the room an unseen thing separated from us by glass and brick by the solidity of the actual making its presence felt to us there were flashbacks intrusive thoughts or whatever you want to call them i said at last severe yes frequent yes what would bring them on blood the sight of a child a girl on the street with her mother or alone simple things a chair a blade advertisements for kitchens certain shapes angled shapes i dont know why as time went on the images that would cause problems for me became fewer and now theyre rare i still have bad dreams but not so often why do you think that is i was conscious of trying not to pause too long before my replies of not giving the impression to saunders that she might have hit on an interesting avenue to explore the possibility that i believed myself to have been haunted by my wife and child or some dark version of them that had since been replaced by forms less threatening but equally unknowable would have qualified as an interesting avenue even if id been in group therapy with hitler napoleon and jim jones under the circumstances i was pleased that my reply to her last question was virtually instantaneous i dont know time it doesnt heal all wounds thats a myth maybe you just get used to the pain she nodded you might even miss it when its gone you think so you might if it gave you purpose if she wanted another response she wasnt going to get it she seemed to realize it because she moved on then there are avoidance symptoms numbness detachment social isolation not leaving the house it may not be that literal it could be just staying away from people or places associated with the incident family friends former colleagues sufferers find it hard to care about anything they may feel that theres no point that they have no future there was some detachment i admitted i didnt feel part of ordinary life there was no such thing there was just chaos waiting to break through and colleagues i avoided them and they avoided me friends i thought of angel and louis waiting outside in their car some of them didnt want to be avoided were you angry at them for that no why not because they were like me they shared my purpose which was to find the man who killed my wife and child to find him and to tear him apart the answers were coming more quickly now i was surprised even angry at myself for letting this stranger get beneath my skin but there was a pleasure in it too a kind of release perhaps i was a narcissist or perhaps i had simply not been so clinically incisive with myself in a very long time if ever did you feel that you had a future an immediate one that lay in killing this man yes she was leaning forward slightly now a white light in her eyes i couldnt figure out where it was coming from until i realized that i was seeing my own face reflected in the depths of her pupils arousal symptoms she said difficulty concentrating no exaggerated responses to startling stimuli like gunshots perhaps no my responses to gunshots werent exaggerated anger irritability yes sleeping difficulties yes hypervigilance justified a lot of people seemed to want me dead physical symptoms fever headache dizziness no or not excessively so she sat back we were nearly done survivor guilt she said softly yes i said yes all the time carrie saunders stepped from her office and came back with two cups of coffee she took some sachets of sugar and creamer from her pocket and laid them on the desk you dont need me to tell you do you she said as she filled her cup with enough sugar to make the spoon stand upright without a hand to support it no but then youre not the first one to try i sipped the coffee it was strong and tasted bitter i could see why she was adding so much sugar to it how are you doing now she asked im doing okay without treatment i found an outlet for my anger its ongoing and therapeutic you hunt people down and sometimes you kill them i didnt reply instead i asked where did you serve in baghdad i was a major initially attached to task force ironhorse at camp boom in ba qubah camp boom because there were so many explosions its called camp gabe now after a sapper dan gabrielson who was killed at ba qubah in it was basic as anything when i got there no plumbing no ac nothing by the time i left there were chews central water for the showers and latrines a new power grid and theyd begun training the iraqi national guard there chews i said i felt as though i were listening to someone speaking pidgin english containerized housing units big boxes to you must have been hard being a female soldier out there it was this is a new war in the past female soldiers didnt live and fight alongside men not the way they do now its brought its own problems technically were barred from joining combat units so instead were attached to them in the end we still fight and we still die just like men maybe not in the same numbers but over a hundred women have died in iraq and afghanistan and hundreds more have been injured but were still called bitches and dykes and sluts were still open to harassment and assault by our own men were still advised to walk in pairs around our own bases to avoid rape but i dont regret serving not for one minute thats why im here there are a lot of soldiers who are still owed something you said you started at camp boom what about after that i was seconded to camp warhorse and then to abu ghraib as part of the restructuring of the prison you mind if i ask what your duties there involved initially i dealt with prisoners we wanted information and they were naturally hostile to us especially after what happened in the prison in the early days we needed to find other ways to get them to talk when you say other ways you saw the photographs humiliation torture simulated and otherwise that didnt help our cause those idiots on talk radio who laughed about it had no understanding of the impact it had it gave the iraqis another reason to hate us and they took it out on the military american soldiers died because of abu ghraib just a few bad apples getting out of line nothing happened in abu ghraib that wasnt sanctioned from above in general if not in detail and then you arrived with a new approach i and others our maxim was simple dont torture torture a man or woman for long enough and youll be told exactly what you want to hear in the end all they want is for the torture to stop she must have seen something in my face because she stopped talking and eyed me intently over her coffee youve been hurt in that way i didnt answer ill take that as a yes she said even moderate pressure and by that i mean physical pain that doesnt leave one in fear of death is scarring in my view someone who has endured torture is never quite the same again it removes a part of oneself excises it entirely call it what you will peace of mind dignity sometimes i wonder if it even has a name anyway in the short term it has a profoundly destabilizing effect on the personality and in the long term well in your case how long has it been since the last time theres been more than one yes jesus if i was dealing with a soldier in your position id be making sure that he was undergoing intensive therapy thats reassuring to know to get back to you after my time in abu ghraib i moved into counseling and therapy it became clear at a very early stage that there were problems with stress levels and those increased when the military instituted repeated deployments stoploss and began calling up weekend warriors i became part of a mental health team working out of the green zone but with particular responsibility for two fobs arrowhead and warhorse arrowhead thats where the third infantry is based right some brigades yes you ever encounter anyone from a stryker unit while you were there she set her cup aside her expression changed is that why youre here to talk about the men of stryker c i didnt mention stryker c you didnt have to she waited for me to proceed from what i can tell three members of stryker c all known to one another have died at their own hands i said one of them took his wife with him that sounds like a suicide cluster to me which would probably be of interest to you it is did you speak to any of those men before they died i spoke to all of them but damien patchett only inform ally the first was brett harlan hed been attending the veterans outreach center in bangor he was also a drug addict for him it helped that the needle exchange program was based next to a veterans center i couldnt tell if she was joking what did he tell you thats confidential hes dead he doesnt care any longer im still not going to reveal the substance of my discussions with him but clearly you can take it that he was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder although she stopped i waited he was experiencing auditory phenomena she added slightly reluctantly so he was hearing voices that doesnt fit with the diagnosis criteria for ptsd thats closer to schizophrenia did you investigate further he discontinued treatment and then he died was there a specific event that triggered his problem she looked away it was nonspecific as far as i could ascertain what does that mean there were nightmares and he was having trouble sleeping but he couldnt relate it to a specific occurrence thats all im prepared to say was there any indication that he might have been about to murder his wife none do you seriously think that we wouldnt have intervened if we thought that there was such a risk come on is it possible that the same stimulus could have led all three to act as they did im not sure what you mean could something have happened in iraq that led to a form of collective trauma her mouth twitched slightly in amusement are you making up psychiatric terms mr parker it sounded right i couldnt think of any other way to explain what i meant well its not a bad effort i dealt with bernie kramer twice shortly after he returned he displayed mild stress symptoms at the time similar to those being experienced by brett harlan but neither referred to any common traumatic occurrence in iraq kramer declined to continue treatment damien patchett i encountered briefly after bernie kramer died as part of my research and again he spoke of nothing that might correspond to what youre suggesting his father didnt mention that he was receiving counseling thats because he wasnt we talked for a time after kramers funeral and met subsequently once but there was no formal therapy actually id have said that damien appeared very well adjusted apart from some insomnia did you prescribe drugs for any of those men its part of my job when necessary im not a fan of heavily medicating troubled individuals it just helps to mask the pain without dealing with the underlying problem but you did prescribe drugs trazodone for damien patchett no just for kramer and harlan i advised damien to consult his own physician if he was having trouble sleeping but that wasnt the limit of his problems apparently not it may be that kramers death was the catalyst for the emergence of damiens own difficulties to be honest i was surprised when damien took his life but i approached a number of kramers former comrades at the funeral damien included and offered to help facilitate counseling services for them if they chose to avail themselves of them with you yes because it would have helped with your research for the first time she got angry no because it would have helped them this isnt merely some academic exercise mr parker its about saving lives it doesnt seem to be working out so well for the stryker c i said i was goading her and i didnt know why i suspected that it was resentment at myself for opening up to her that i was now trying to throw back whatever the reason i needed to stop she precipitated it by standing indicating that our time together was over i stood and thanked her for her input then turned to leave oh one last thing i said as she began to open folders on her desk and return to her work yes she said she didnt look up you attended damien patchetts funeral yes well i went to the church i would have gone to the cemetery too but i didnt can i ask why it was communicated to me that i wouldnt be welcome by whom thats none of your business joel tobias her hand froze for an instant and then continued turning a page goodbye mr parker she said if youll take some professional advice you still have a lot of issues to work out id speak to someone about them if i were you someone other than myself she added does that mean you dont want me to be part of your research now she looked up i think ive learned enough about you she said please close the door on your way out bobby jandreau still lived in bangor a little over an hour north of augusta in a house at the top of palm street off stillwater avenue once again angel and louis stayed with me all the way there but we reached jandreaus place without incident it didnt look like much from the outside singlestory paintwork that flaked like bad skin a lawn that was trying its best to pretend that it wouldnt soon be overrun by weeds the best that could be said about the exterior was that it didnt raise any expectations that the interior of the house couldnt live up to jandreau answered the door in his wheelchair he was dressed in gray sweat pants pinned at the thighs and a matching tshirt both of which were stained he was building up a gut that the shirt didnt even attempt to conceal his hair was shaved close to his skull but he was growing a rough beard the house smelled stale in the kitchen behind him i could see dishes piled up in the sink and pizza boxes lying on the floor by the trash can help you he said i showed him my id he took it from me and held it on his lap staring at it the way someone might examine the photograph of a missing child that had been presented to him by the cops as though by gazing at it for long enough he might remember where hed seen the kid when he had finished examining it he returned it to me and let his hands fall between his thighs where they worried at each other like small animals fighting did she send you did who send me mel no i wanted to ask him why she might have wanted to send a private detective to his home because shed given no indication of that level of trouble when we talked but it wasnt the time for that not yet instead i said i was hoping to talk to you about your army service i waited for him to ask me why but he didnt he just wheeled his chair backward and invited me inside there was a wariness to him a consciousness perhaps of his own vulnerability and the fact that until he died he would always be destined to look up at others his upper arms were still strong and muscular and when we went into the living room i saw a rack of dumbbells over by the window he saw where i was looking and said just because my legs dont work no more doesnt mean i have to give up on the rest of me there was no belligerence or defensiveness to his words it was simply a statement of fact the arms are easy the rest he patted his belly is harder i didnt know what to say so i said nothing you want a soda i dont have anything stronger ive decided that its not good for me to have certain temptations around im fine you mind if i sit down he pointed at a chair i saw that my first impressions about the interior had been wrong or at least unfair this room was clean if a little dusty there were books mainly science fiction but history books too most of them relating to vietnam and world war ii from what i could see but also some books on sumerian and babylonian mythology and todays newspapers the bangor daily news and the boston globe but there was a mark on the carpet where something had splattered recently and had been imperfectly cleaned up and another on the wall and floor between the living room and the kitchen i got the sense that jandreau was trying his best to keep things together but there was only so much that a man in a wheelchair could do about a stain on the carpet not unless he was going to tip himself out of his chair to deal with it jandreau was watching me carefully gauging my reactions to his living space my mom comes around a couple of times a week to help me with the stuff i cant do for myself shed be around here every day if i let her but she fusses you know how they can be i nodded what happened to mel you know her i didnt want to tell him that id spoken with her until i was ready i read the interview with you in the newspaper last year i saw her picture she went away can i ask why because i was an asshole because she couldnt deal with this he patted his legs then reconsidered no because i couldnt deal with this why would she hire a detective what you asked if mel had sent me im just wondering why you might have thought that we had an argument before she left a disagreement about money about ownership of some stuff i figured maybe shed hired you to take it further mel had mentioned some of this in our conversation the house was in both their names but she hadnt made any effort yet to seek legal advice about her position the breakup was still new and she hoped that they might yet be reconciled still something in jandreaus tone gave the lie to what he just said as though he had greater concerns than domestic issues and you trusted me when i told you that she hadnt sent me yeah i guess you dont seem like the kind of man whod try to beat up on a cripple and if you were well his right hand moved very fast the gun was a beretta hidden in a makeshift holster attached to the underside of the chair he held it upright for a couple of seconds the muzzle pointing to the ceiling before he restored it to its hiding place are you worried about something i asked even if it seemed like a redundant question to ask a man with a gun in his hand im worried about lots of stuff falling over while using the john how im going to manage when winter comes around you name it ive got a worry for it but i dont like the idea of someone finding me an easy mark that at least i can do something about now mr parker how about you tell me why youre interested in me not you i said joel tobias suppose i told you that i dont know any joel tobias then id have to assume that you were lying since you served together in iraq and he was your sergeant in stryker c you were both at the funeral of damien patchett and later you got into a fight with tobias in sullys so you still want to tell me that you dont know any joel tobias jandreau looked away i could see him sizing up his options debating whether to talk to me or simply send me on my way i could almost feel the suppressed anger rolling off him waves of it breaking on me on the furniture on the stained walls the spume of it splashing back on his own maimed body anger grief loss his fingers created intricate patterns from themselves interweaving and then coming apart forming constructions that only he could understand so i know joel tobias he said at last but were not close never were why is that joels old man was a soldier so joel had it in his blood he liked the discipline liked being the alpha dog the army was just an extension of his nature and you he squinted at me how old are you forties they ever try to recruit you no more than they tried to recruit anyone else they came to my high school but i didnt bite but it wasnt the same then we werent at war yeah well we are now and i bit they promised me cash money for college promised me the sun the moon and the stars he smiled sadly the sun part was true saw a lot of that sun and dust ive started working for veterans for peace now im a counterrecruiter i didnt know what that was so i asked him army recruiters are trained only to answer the right question he said you dont ask the right question then you dont get the right answer and if youre a seventeen or eighteenyearold kid with poor prospects faced with a guy in uniform whos so slick you could skate on him then youre going to believe what youre told and youre not going to examine the small print we point out the small print such as such as that your college fees arent guaranteed that the army owes you nothing that less than ten percent of recruits get the full amount of bonuses or fees that they were promised look dont get me wrong here its honorable to serve your country and a lot of these kids wouldnt have any kind of career at all if it wasnt for the army i was one of them my family was poor and im still poor but im proud that i served id have preferred not to end up in a wheelchair but i knew the risks i just think the recruiters should be more upfront with the kids about what theyre getting themselves into its the draft in all but name you target the poor the ones who got no job no prospects the ones who dont know any better you think rumsfeld didnt know that when he inserted a recruiter provision into the no child left behind act you think he made it compulsory for public schools to provide the military with all of their student details because it would help the kids read better there are quotas to be filled you gotta plug the gaps in the ranks somehow but if the recruiters were completely honest then whod join up shit id still have signed on the dotted line id have done anything to get away from my family and this place all that was here for me was a minimum wage job and beers after work on friday and mel that gave him pause i guess i still got the minimum wage job four hundred dollars a month but at least they threw in health care and i saw most of my bonus he grimaced lot of contradictions huh was that why you fought with joel tobias because of your work with veterans for peace jandreau looked away no it wasnt he tried to buy me a beer to quiet me down but i didnt want to drink on his dime again why but jandreau skirted the question as he himself had said he was a man of contradictions he wanted to talk but only about what interested him he appeared polite but there was ferocity beneath the veneer i knew now what ronald straydeer meant when he said that jandreau was a man who looked like he was on the way down if he didnt use that gun on someone else there was a chance that he might use it on himself just like his buddies whats your interest in joel tobias anyway he asked i was hired to find out why damien patchett killed himself i heard about the altercation at the funeral i wanted to know if there was any connection between a bar fight and a suicide youre full of shit that or a really bad detective there was a pause and then for the first time jandreau laughed at least youre honest the laughter ceased and the smile that followed was sad damien shouldnt have killed himself i dont mean that in a religious way or a moral way or because it was a waste of a life i mean that he wasnt the kind he left his grief in iraq or most of it he wasnt traumatized or suffering i spoke to a shrink in togus who said the same thing yeah who was that carrie saunders saunders give me a break shes got more questions than alex trebek but none of the answers youve met her she interviewed me as part of her study didnt impress me at all as for damien i served with him i loved him he was a good kid i always thought of him like that as a kid he was intelligent but he had no smarts i tried to look out for him but he ended up taking care of me in the end saved my life his fist tightened on the arm of his chair fuckin joel tobias he whispered and it sounded like a shout tell me i said im angry with tobias doesnt mean im going to rat him out him or anyone else i know that hes running an operation hes smuggling and i think he might have promised some of the proceeds to you you and men and women like you jandreau turned away and wheeled himself to the window who are the guys outside he asked friends your friends dont look like the friendly type i felt like i needed some protection if they looked too inviting it would defeat the purpose protection who from maybe from the same people whove given you cause to carry that gun your old buddies led by joel tobias he still hadnt turned back to me but i could see his reflection in the glass why would i be frightened of joel tobias frightened it was an interesting choice of words its very use was an admission of sorts because youre worried that they think youre a weak link me im a regular standup guy he laughed again and it was a terrible sound i think you were worried about damien patchett you owed him and you didnt want anything to happen to him maybe he was in too deep or he didnt listen but when he died you decided to take action or perhaps you had to wait for what happened with brett harlan and his wife before you began to discern a pattern i dont know what youre talking about i think you spoke to your cousin you called foster jandreau because he was a cop but a cop that you could trust because he was family you probably fed him a little and hoped that hed find out the rest for himself when he started making inquiries they killed him and now you believe thats its just a matter of time before they come for you does that sound about right he spun the chair quickly and the gun was back in his hand you dont know that you dont know anything this has to be stopped bobby whatevers happening people have begun to die and no amount of money can be worth that unless your conscience is up for bids get out of my house he shouted get out behind him i could see angel and louis starting to run as they heard the noise from the house if i didnt defuse the situation bobby jandreaus door would be lying in his hallway and he might have cause to use that gun if he was fast enough i made my way to the door opened it and let angel and louis see that i was okay but bobby jandreau chose that moment to wheel himself onehanded into the hallway for a moment i was trapped between three guns take it easy everyone easy slowly i dipped two fingers into my jacket pocket and removed one of my cards i placed it on the table next to the door you owed damien patchett bobby i said hes gone but your debts still in play now his fathers holding it you think about that get lost he said but the anger was already disappearing and he just managed to sound tired his voice quavered on the word lost a recognition that he was the one who was drifting on dark unknown seas and one more thing i said following up my advantage on a crippled veteran go make up with your girlfriend i think you forced her away because youre scared of whats coming and you didnt want her to be hurt if they did come after you she still loves you and you need someone like her in your life you know it and she knows it you have my card you need any more counseling i walked away angel and louis still watching my back i heard the door close and then they were beside me let me get this straight said louis as we reached the cars man pulls a gun on you and you give him relationship advice somebody had to yeah but you dodo eggs got laid more recently than you i ignored him as i got in my car i saw bobby jandreau at his window watching me you think hell come around asked angel about his girlfriend or tobias both he has to on both if he doesnt hes dead without her hes dying already he just hasnt admitted it yet tobias and the others will just finish what hes started himself wow said angel you think theres a hallmark card for that shape up or die we drove away angel and louis behind me but only as far as the next street they looked puzzled when i pulled over and then walked back to them i want you to stay here i said why asked angel because theyre going to come for bobby jandreau you seem pretty sure of that i walked to the mustang and pointed out the gps tracker on the rear fender this will bring them thats why its staying here with you while i take your car your car stays here said louis and theyll think jandreau is giving you chapter and verse so theyll try to take you both out except they wont i said because youre going to kill them when they move on jandreau and then jandreau will talk thats the plan and where are you going to be asked angel over by rangeley whats in rangeley a motel so we skulk in the bushes while you stay in a motel something like that yeah good deal we switched cars but not before louis and angel emptied the rest of their toys from the compartment in the trunk as it turned out theyd traveled light for them two glocks a couple of knives a pair of semiautomatic machine pistols and some spare clips louis found a position in the woods with a clear view of jandreaus house and they settled in to wait you got any questions you want us to ask before we kill them asked louis assuming we got to kill them i thought of the barrel of water in the blue moon and the feel of the sack pressed hard against my nose and mouth if you dont have to then dont but i dont much care either way as for questions you can ask them what you want what would we have to ask them asked angel louis thought about the question eyes open or eyes closed he said all was movement the pieces were on the board and that night the game would reach its conclusion from her bedroom window karen emory watched joel tobias leave he had said a cursory goodbye to her and kissed her with dry lips upon the cheek she had held him tightly even as she felt him pull away from her and before she let him go her fingertips touched against the gun at his back tobias took the silverado and drove north but only as far as falmouth where the others were waiting with the van and two motorcycles vernon and pritchard the exmarines constituted the main sniper team beside them stood mallak and bacci vernon and pritchard were both big men and even though the former was black and the latter white they were brothers beneath the skin tobias didnt care for either of them but that was at least as much about the mutual antipathy that existed between soldiers and marines as it was about vernons seeming inability to open his mouth without asking a question and loading it with attitude where are twizell and greenham asked vernon referring to the second sniper team theyll join us later said tobias they have something else to do first shit said vernon in reply dont suppose you feel like sharing the details with the troops no said tobias and held vernons gaze until the other looked away mallak and bacci who had served in tobiass squad in iraq exchanged a glance but didnt intervene they knew better than to take sides in the ongoing pissing competition between vernon and the sarge mallak had come home a corporal and never questioned orders even though he recognized that there was now a growing distance between tobias and him tobias had grown strange in recent weeks and pragmatic to the point of cruelty it was tobias who had suggested that the detective parker should be disposed of entirely and not simply questioned to find out what he knew mallak had argued for discretion and had subsequently taken responsibility for the detectives interrogation he wasnt in the business of killing americans on home soil or anywhere else the climbdown over parker was a small victory and nothing more mallak had decided to pretend that he knew nothing about the death of foster jandreau or any other actions bacci meanwhile was a bald thug who just wanted his money and was lucky that tobias had not yet punched his lights out for the way he looked at karen emory were just one big happy family thought mallak and the sooner all this is over the better all right said tobias lets move out meanwhile two men headed north in an anonymous brown sedan passing lewiston and augusta and waterville bangor slowly drawing nearer one of them the passenger had a computer on his lap occasionally he would refresh the map screen but the blinking dot never moved that thing still working asked twizell looks like it said greenham he kept his eye on the blinking dot it stayed close to the intersection of palm and stillwater not far from the home of bobby jandreau weve got a sitting target he confirmed and twizell grunted in satisfaction as greenham and twizell passed lewiston rojas still a little fuzzy from some recently administered dental anesthetic and his teeth now aching was sitting at a table working on the slab of red oak that would serve as a platform for the ornate seals they lay beside him on a piece of black cloth as he worked their presence a source of comfort to him a reminder of the potential for beauty in this world and herod drove north drawing closer and closer to rojas grateful for the captains absence grateful that his pain was tolerable for now and as he went another closed in on him for the collector too was on the move iii q what were you firing at a at the enemy sir q at people a at the enemy sir q they werent even human beings a yes sir q were they men a i dont know sir testimony of lieutenant william calley the my lai courtsmartial the rangeley lakes region of the state northwest of portland east of the new hampshire state line and just south of the canadian border was not one with which i was very familiar it was best known as a sportsmans paradise and had been since the nineteenth century i had never had much cause to go there although i had a vague recollection of passing through it as a boy my parents in the front seats of my fathers beloved lesabre on our way to somewhere else canada perhaps because i cant imagine my father going all that way to visit eastern new hampshire he always regarded new hampshire as suspect for some reason that i never fully grasped but it is so long ago now and my parents are no longer around to ask i did have one other memory of rangeley and that came from a man named phineas arbogast who was a friend of my grandfather and sometimes hunted in the woods around rangeley where his family had a cabin and it seems had always had a cabin for phineas arbogast was old maine and could probably have traced his ancestry back to the nomads who crossed from asia into north america eleven thousand years before over the spit of land that is now the bering islands or at least to some pigheaded pilgrim who had headed north to escape the worst rigors of puritanism as a boy i had found his speech almost unintelligible for phineas could have drawled for his country he could even find ways to lengthen a word that didnt have any vowels to lengthen he could have drawled in polish my grandfather was fond of phineas who if he could be pinned down and understood was a mine of historical and geographical knowledge as he grew older some of that knowledge inevitably began to leach from his brain and he tried to put it down in a book before it all trickled away but he didnt have the patience for the task he was part of an older oral tradition he told his stories aloud so that others might remember them and pass them on in turn but eventually the only ones who would listen to him were people nearly as old as he was young people didnt want to hear phineass stories not then and by the time some people from one of the universities came looking for people like him to record their tales phineas was telling his stories late at night to his neighbors in the churchyard so the memory i have is of phineas and my grandfather sitting by the fire phineas talking my grandfather listening my father was dead by then my mother elsewhere that night so it was we three only warming ourselves by the winter logs my grandfather had asked phineas why he didnt go to his cabin so much anymore and phineas had paused before answering it wasnt his usual pause a moment to draw breath and compose his thoughts before starting out along a rambling anecdotal path no there was uncertainty and could it be an unwillingness to proceed so my grandfather waited curious and so did i and eventually phineas arbogast told us why he no longer went to his cabin in the woods near rangeley he had been hunting squirrel with his dog misty a mutt whose ancestry was as complex as that of some royal families and who duly carried herself like a bastard princess phineas had no use for the squirrels that he shot he just didnt care much for squirrels misty as usual had gone racing ahead and after a time phineas could no longer see or hear her he whistled for her but she didnt return and misty despite her airs was an obedient dog so phineas went searching for her moving deeper and deeper into the woods and farther and farther from his cabin it began to grow dark and still he searched for he was not going to leave her alone in the forest he called her name over and over to no reply he began to fear that a bear might have taken her or a lynx or bobcat until at last he thought that he heard misty whining and he followed the sound grateful that he still had most of his hearing and more of his eyesight even at seventythree he came to a clearing and there was misty now barely visible as the moon appeared in the sky briars had wound themselves around her legs and her muzzle and as she had struggled against them the briars had tightened on her so that all she could do was whimper softly phineas drew his knife preparing to free her when there was movement to his right and he turned his flashlight in that direction a little girl of perhaps six or seven stood at the edge of the clearing her hair was dark and she was very pale she wore a black dress of coarse cloth and simple black shoes on her feet she didnt blink in the strong beam of the flashlight nor did she raise her hands to shield her eyes in fact phineas thought the light seemed to make no difference to her whatsoever it was as if she merely absorbed it into her skin for she appeared to glow whitely from within honey said phineas what are you doing way out here im lost said the girl help me her voice sounded strange as though it were coming from inside a cave or the hollowedout trunk of a tree it echoed when it should not have done so phineas moved toward her already shrugging his coat off to put it over her shoulders when he saw misty tugging at the briars again her tail now wedged between her back legs the effort clearly caused her pain but still she was determined to break free when her attempt continued to prove fruitless she faced the girl and growled phineas could see the dog trembling in the moonlight and the hackles on her neck were raised when he looked back the girl had retreated a couple of feet moving a little deeper into the woods help me she repeated im lost and im lonely phineas was wary now although he could not have said why beyond the girls pallor and the effect her presence was having on his dog yet still he walked toward her and as he did so she moved a little farther away until at last the clearing was at his back and there was only forest before him forest and the dim form of the girl among the trees phineas lowered his torch but the girl did not fade into the shadows of the forest instead she continued to luminesce faintly and although phineas could see his own breath pluming thickly before him no such cloud emerged from the girls mouth not even as she spoke again please im lonely and im scared she said come with me now she raised her hand beckoning to him and he saw the dirt beneath her fingernails as though she had clawed her way out of some dark spot a hiding place of earth and worms and scuttling bugs no honey said phineas i dont think ill be going anywhere with you without taking his eyes from her he backed away until he was beside misty and then he squatted and began to hack at the briars they came away reluctantly and they were sticky to the touch even as he cut at them he thought that he felt others begin to curl around his boots but later he told himself that it was probably just his mind playing tricks on him as if that one small detail might make up for the far greater trick of a girl glowing in the forest depths asking an old man to join her in her forest bower he felt her anger and her frustration and yes her sadness for she was lonely and she was scared but she didnt want to be saved she wanted to visit her loneliness and fear on another and phineas didnt know what would be worse to die in the woods with the girl for company until eventually the world faded to black or to die and then wake up to find himself like her wandering the woods looking for others to share his misery at last misty was freed the dog shot away then paused to make sure that her master was following her for even in her relief to be free she would not abandon him in this place just as he had not abandoned her slowly phineas went after her his eyes fixed on the little girl keeping her in sight for as long as he could until she was visible no longer and he found himself once again on familiar ground and that was why phineas arbogast stopped going to his cabin in the rangeley woods where the ruins of it may still be visible somewhere between rangeley and langdon bound with sticky briars as nature claims it as her own nature and a little girl with pale glowing skin seeking in vain for a playmate to join her in her games i still had an old edition of a brochure called maine invites you given to me by phineas it was published by the maine publicity bureau sometime in the late s or early s as the letter of greeting inside the front cover was written by governor lewis o barrows who was in office from until barrows was an oldschool republican of the stripe that some of his more rabid descendants would cross the street to avoid he balanced the budget improved state school funding and reinstated oldage benefits payments all while reducing the state deficit rush limbaugh would have called him a socialist the brochure was a touching tribute to a bygone era when you could rent a highend cabin for thirty dollars per week and eat a chicken dinner for a dollar most of the places mentioned in it are long gone the lafayette hotel in portland the willows and the checkley out at prouts neck and the writers managed to find something kind to say about almost everywhere even those towns whose own residents had trouble figuring out why theyd stayed in them never mind why anyone else might want to travel there on vacation the town of langdon midway between rangeley and stratton had a page all to itself and it was interesting to note how many times the name proctor appeared on the advertisements among others there was a proctors camp and the bald mountain diner run by e and a proctor and r h proctors lakeview fine dining restaurant clearly the proctors had langdon pretty much all sewn up back in the day and the town was enough of a draw for tourists or the proctors felt that it might be to justify taking out a series of topend ads each one adorned with a photograph of the establishment in question whatever appeal langdon might once have had for visitors was no longer apparent if it had ever been anything more than a figment of the proctors own ambitions to begin with it was now merely a strip of decrepit houses and struggling businesses closer to the new hampshire border than the canadian but easily accessible from either the bald mountain diner was still there but it looked like it hadnt served a meal for at least a decade the towns only store bore a sign announcing that it was closed due to a bereavement and would reopen in a weeks time the notice was dated october th which suggested the kind of mourning period usually associated with the deaths of kings apart from that there was a hairdressers a taxidermists and a bar named the belle dam which might have been a clever pun on rangeleys own dams or as seemed more likely on closer inspection the result of the loss of a letter e from the sign there was nobody on the streets although a couple of cars were parked along it ironically only the taxidermy showed any signs of life the front door was open and a man in overalls came out to watch me as i took in the bright lights of langdon i figured him for sixty or more but he might just as easily have been older and holding off the predations of the years maybe it had something to do with all of the preservatives with which he worked quiet i said i guess he replied in the manner of one who wasnt entirely convinced that this was the case and even if it was he sort of liked it that way i looked around again it didnt seem like there was much room for argument but maybe he knew something that i didnt about what was going on behind all of those closed doors hotter than a methodist hell and all he added he was right i hadnt noticed while i was in the car but i had begun to perspire as soon as i stepped from it the taxidermist meanwhile wasnt so much sweating as selfbasting noseeums hovered around us both your name wouldnt be proctor by any chance i asked him no im stunden you mind if i ask you some questions mr stunden you already are far as i can tell he was grinning crookedly but there was no malice in it he was just breaking the monotony of daily life in langdon he detached himself from the frame of his door and indicated with a nod of his head that i should follow him inside the interior was dark antlers tagged and numbered lay on the floor or hung from the old rafters a recently stuffed and mounted largemouth bass was propped on top of a freezer to my left and to the right were shelves lined with jars of chemicals paint and assorted glass eyes blood had dripped down the side of the freezer hardening and then corroding the metal the room was dominated by a steel workbench upon which currently lay a deer hide and a roundbladed shaver piles of discarded meat lay on the floor beneath the bench i could see that he knew his business he was being careful to scrape the hide down to the dermis leaving no trace of fat that might turn to acid and cause the hide to smell or the hair to fall out nearby was a foam mannequin of a deer head waiting for the skin to be applied to it the whole place stank of dead flesh i couldnt help but wrinkle my nose sorry about the smell he said i dont notice it anymore id talk to you outside but i got this deer hide to finish and im working on a couple of ducks for the same guy he pointed at two clear containers of ground corncob in which he was degreasing the duck carcasses cant shave a duck he said the skin wont take it since shaving a duck had never struck me as something id feel the inclination to do i contented myself with observing that it wasnt yet hunting season this deer died of natural causes said stunden tripped and fell on a bullet and the ducks they drowned as he worked the shaver he began to sweat even more looks like hard grind i said stunden shrugged deer are hard waterfowl not so much i can take care of a duck in a couple of hours and i get to indulge my artistic side you have to be careful with the colors else it wont look right ill get five hundred dollars for those ones i know the guy will pay too and thats not always the case times are hard i take deposits now and i never had to do that before he continued shaving the deer the sound was faintly unpleasant so what brings you to langdon im looking for a man named harold proctor he in trouble why do you ask no disrespect but alst i know is that you look like the kind of man calls about trouble my names charlie parker im a private investigator doesnt answer my question is harold in trouble he might be but not from me he coming into money again he might be but not from me stunden glanced up from his work he lives out by the family motel about a mile west of here hard as a snowsnake to find though if you dont know the road the motel still in business the only thing still in business here is me and i dont know how long more ill be able to say that the motels been closed for a decade or so now before that it was a camp but motels seemed to be the way to go or so the proctors thought harolds momma and poppa used to run it but they died and the motel closed never made much money anyway poor location out in the williwigs for a motel harolds the last of the proctors hard to believe they used to run half this town and the other half paid them rent but they werent big breeders the proctors or lookers come to think of it which might have something to do with it the proctor creatures were kind of homely i seem to recall and the men well i wasnt looking at the men so i cant rightly say his eyes twinkled in the gloom and i guessed that mr stunden might have been quite the heartbreaker in his time had there been anyone apart from homely proctor women on whom to test his charms when they started dying out the town died with them now we get by on what we can make from rangeleys overflow which aint much i waited as he completed his work on the hide he switched off the shaver and used dish soap to clean the grease from his hands i ought to tell you that harolds not too sociable he said he was never what you might call outgoing but he came back from iraq the first war not this one with a troubled disposition he keeps himself to himself out there mostly i pass him on the road from time to time and i see him at our lady of the lakes in oquossoc on sundays but thats it best i can get out of him now is a nod like i said hes never been exactly friendly but until recently hed always give you the time of day and a word or two on the weather he used to come into the belle dam and if he was in the mood wed talk he pronounced it belle dayme in case youre wondering i own that too during hunting season i make a few bucks on it the rest of the year its just something to do in the evenings did he talk to you about his time in iraq generally he preferred to drink alone hed buy his liquor in new hampshire or over the border in canada and bring it back to his place but once a week hed come out of the woods and relax some he hated it over there said he spent most of his time either bored or scared shitless but you know he stopped speaking but continued drying his hands as he sized me up why dont you tell me your interest in harold before i go any further you seem protective of him this is a small town and barely that if we dont look out for one another who will and yet youre worried enough about harold to talk with a stranger who says im worried you wouldnt be talking to me otherwise and i can see it in your eyes i told you i dont mean him any harm for what its worth im working for the father of a former soldier who served in iraq this time round his son committed suicide after he returned home it seems that the boys behavior had changed in the weeks before his death and his father wants to know what might have brought that on harold knew the boy some i think because he attended the funeral i just want to ask him some questions stunden shook his head in sadness thats a hard burden to bear you got kids that question always gave me pause yes i have a daughter and once i had another one i said a girl i got two boys fourteen and seventeen he must have seen something in my face because he said i married late in life too late i think i was set in my ways and i never could get my head around girlin my boys live with their mother down in skowhegan now i wouldnt want them to join the military if one of my sons wanted to join up then id let them know how i felt about it but i wouldnt try to stop him still if i had a boy over in iraq or afghanistan id spend every hour just praying for him to be safe i think it would cost me some of the years left to me he leaned back against his workbench like i said harolds changed he said i dont mean just because of the war and his injury i think hes sick inside he tapped the side of his head just in case i was under any illusions about the nature of proctors troubles the last time he came into the bar which was oh must be two weeks ago he looked different like he wasnt sleeping right id have said that he was frightened i had to ask him what was wrong it was so obvious to me what did he say well hed had a skinful by then and that was before he even got as far as the dame but he told me that he was being haunted he let the word hang in the air for a moment waiting for the dead flesh and old hides to cover it and give it form he said that he was hearing voices that they were keeping him from his sleep i told him he should go see a military doctor that maybe he was suffering from that stress thing posttraumatic whatever what were these voices saying he couldnt understand them they didnt speak english that was when i became sure that it was something to do with what happened to him over there we talked about it some more and he said that he might give someone a call and did he i dont know that was the last time he came into the bar but i was concerned about him so a week after that i took a ride out to his place to see how he was there was a car parked outside his cabin so i figured that he had visitors and decided not to disturb him as i was reversing back down the hill the cabin door opened and four men came out harold was one of them i didnt recognize the other three they just watched me go but later the three visitors came here and stood where youre standing now they asked me what i was doing out at harolds place the colored one who did most of the talking was real polite about it but i could tell that he didnt like the fact id driven out there i told them the truth that i was a friend of harolds and i was worried about him that he hadnt seemed himself of late that seemed to satisfy him he told me they were old army buddies of harolds and that harold was doing just fine you had no cause to disbelieve them they were military men for sure they had that bearing about them the other one limped some and was missing fingers from here stunden held up his left hand i took it for a war wound joel tobias and the third he didnt say much big guy bald head i didnt care for him that was bacci i thought remembering ronald straydeers annotated photograph karen emory didnt like him either i wondered if he was the one who had first suggested raping me at the blue moon anyway the bald guy asked if id be able to preserve a person and made some joke about trophies for his wall said stunden haji thats the word that he used haji trophies for his wall i guess he meant terrorists the other guy his friend with the damaged hand told him to shut his mouth and you havent spoken to harold since that night at the bar no seen him once or twice in passing but he hasnt been back at the dame stunden had nothing more to add i thanked him for his time he asked me not to tell harold proctor that wed spoken and i gave him that promise as we walked to the door stunden said this boy the one who killed himself you say his father thought that hed changed before he died thats right changed how you mind me asking cut himself off from his friends became paranoid had trouble sleeping like harold yes like harold maybe after youve talked to him ill go out there and see how hes doing could be i can convince him to see someone before he trailed off i shook his hand i think that would be a good thing to do mr stunden ill try to call by before i leave let you know how it all went id appreciate that he said he gave me directions to proctors place then raised a hand in farewell as i drove away i did the same and the fragrance from the soap that stunden had used to clean himself and which had passed to me from his hand wafted through the car it was strong but not strong enough for underlying it was an animal smell of flesh and burnt hair i opened the window despite the heat and the bugs but it would not disperse it was on my skin and it stayed with me all the way to the proctor motel despite stundens directions i still managed to miss the turn for the motel on my first pass he had told me that the remains of a big sign were just about visible across from the entrance road but the forest had grown thickly around it and it was only by chance on the return run that i caught a glimpse of it through the foliage some faded red letters were barely discernible on the rotting wood along with what might have been deer antlers but a green arrow that would once have stood out against the white of the sign was now merely another shade in summers paintbox its origins as a camp were clear as it lay at the top of a curving trail that ran west through thick woods the trail was pitted and the undergrowth had not been cut back for so long that it scraped at the side of my car but i spotted broken branches and crushed vegetation in places and the tracks of a heavy vehicle were clear in the dirt like the slowly fossilizing footprints of a dinosaur eventually i emerged into a clearing to my right was a small cabin its doors and windows firmly closed despite the heat it was probably a relic of the original camp it certainly looked old enough i could see part of what appeared to be a more modern extension at the back where the cabins living area had been expanded for longterm habitation between the cabin and where i was parked stood a red dodge truck another dirt track led from the cabin to the motel it was a standard lshaped structure with the office at the angle where the two arms met and a vertical neon motel sign long out of use pointing up at the sky i wondered if it had even been visible from the road since the motel was located in a kind of natural hollow maybe the cabins had proved too difficult to maintain and the proctors believed that their customers would remain loyal to them even after they went with the times and changed to a motel but it was clear that stunden had been right nothing about the proctor motel suggested that it had ever been a good idea to build it now the doors and windows of every unit were boarded up the grass had grown through the cracked stone of the parking lot and ivy was creeping up the walls and along the flat roof if it stayed standing for long enough it would join the ranks of the other phantom towns and abandoned dwellings that were so much a part of this state i sounded the horn and waited nobody emerged from the cabin or the surrounding woods i recalled what stunden had said about proctor a veteran living out here in the wild was likely to have a gun and if proctor was as disturbed as stunden had intimated then i didnt want him taking me for a threat his truck was still there so he couldnt have gone far i hit the horn again then left the car and began to walk to the cabin as i did so i glanced into the cab of the truck an open pack of doughnuts lay on the passenger seat it was crawling with ants i knocked on the cabin door and called proctors name but there was no reply i peered through a window the television lay busted on the floor and i could see pieces of a phone scattered beside it the bed was unmade a yellowed sheet coiled upon the floor like melted ice cream i returned to the door halfexpecting to see an irate proctor emerge from the woods waving a gun and muttering about ghosts then tried the handle it opened easily flies buzzed and there were more ants moving in columns across the linoleum floor the whole place stank of cigarette smoke i checked the refrigerator the milk was still in date but it was as close as proctor was likely to come to a healthy diet because otherwise the refrigerator was filled with the kind of food that would sap a dieticians will to live cheap ready meals microwaveable burgers processed meats there was no sign of fruit or vegetables and at least half of the storage space was devoted to bottles of regular cola the trash bag in the corner was packed with discarded french fry cartons chicken buckets burger wrappers from fast food joints crushed red bull cans and empty bottles of vicks nyquil apart from canned soups and beans proctors kitchen shelves showed mainly candy and cookies i also found a couple of big jars of coffee and half a dozen bottles of cheap gin and vodka the sleeping area contained more bottles of nyquil a bunch of antihistamines and some sominex proctor was living on stimulants sugar energy drinks caffeine nicotine and then using mostly overthecounter medicines to help him sleep there was also an empty package of clozapine recently prescribed by a local physician which meant that proctor had been desperate enough to seek professional help clozapine was an antipsychotic used as a sedative and also as a means of treating schizophrenia i thought back to my conversation with bernie kramers sister and the fact that kramer had been hearing voices before he took his own life i wondered what voices harold proctor was hearing on the bed lay the keys to the truck and an empty holster i continued searching the place which was how i found the envelope of cash it had been placed beneath the mattress unsealed and contained dollars in twenties and fifties all neatly arranged faceup even out here it didnt make much sense for a man to leave money like that under his mattress but then none of this made any sense proctor clearly hadnt been in his trailer or his truck for some time if hed intended to leave hed have taken the money and the truck if there was a problem with his truck hed still have taken the money i looked at the envelope again it was clean and new it hadnt been under the mattress for very long i put the money back where i found it and walked down to the motel only the office was not boarded up the door was unlocked so i took a look inside proctor had clearly been using it for storage there were cans of food stacked in one corner beans chili and stews mostly along with big packs of toilet paper and some old window screens a faint whirring sound was coming from somewhere behind the reception desk was a closed door presumably leading into an office i lifted the hatch on the counter and stepped inside the sound was louder now i pushed the door open with my foot before me was a wooden console with sixteen small bulbs arrayed in lines of four each marked with a number the sound was coming from a speaker beside the console i guessed that it was an old intercom system enabling guests to communicate with the front desk without using a phone id never seen anything like it before but it might be that the proctors hadnt bothered with phones in all the rooms when the motel opened or they had first opted for a quainter system and then retained it as a conversation piece the console didnt have a makers name on it and i thought that it might have been hand built by the proctors clearly though there was still power running in the motel the sound was making me uneasy it might simply have been a malfunction but why now anyway power or no power the system shouldnt even have been working after all these years then again they used to build things to last and it was depressing how easily we were surprised by good workmanship these days i checked the console tapping the bulbs as i went when i tapped the bulb for room fifteen it began to blink redly i drew my gun and went back outside following the doors along the right when i came to fourteen i saw that the screws had been removed from the board on its door and the board itself now simply lay against the frame when i reached room fifteen though its board was still firmly in place nevertheless i could hear an echo of the intercom buzzer from inside i leaned against the wall between the two rooms and called out mr proctor you in there there was no reply quickly i pushed away the board from in front of room fourteen the door behind it was closed i tried the handle and it opened easily daylight shone on the frame of a bare bed that had been pushed upright against the wall leaving the floor space largely clear two bedside lockers had been stacked in a corner otherwise the room was unfurnished there were white strands on the carpet which smelled of mold i picked up one of the strands and held it to the light it was a wood shaving beside the lockers lay a couple of foam chips i ran my hand across the carpet and felt the marks left by boxes of some kind carefully i approached the small bathroom at the back but it was empty there was no connecting door between rooms fourteen and fifteen i was about to leave when i noticed marks on the wall i had to use my flashlight to see them properly they looked like handprints but they seemed to have been burnt into the paint work ash and blistered paint fell away when i touched my fingers to them i had an uncomfortable sense of contamination and although the bed was bare and the room was damp i felt that it had been occupied recently so recently that i could almost hear the fading echo of a conversation i went outside again and examined the boardedup entrance to room fifteen it should have been held in place by screws just like the other doors that i had passed but no heads were visible with no great expectation of success i managed to slip my fingers into the gap between the board and the door frame and tugged the board came away easily almost knocking me backward as it did i saw that it had been held loosely in place by a single long screw drilled through the frame into the board the screw had been driven in from inside not out this time when i tried the door handle it did not open i kicked at it but it was sealed tight i went back to my car and retrieved a crowbar from the trunk but even with it i had no luck the door had been firmly secured from within instead i began to work on the board covering the window that was easier as it had been nailed not screwed into the frame when it came away it revealed filthy thick glass cracked but not shattered by a pair of bullet holes the drapes were drawn inside the room it took a little effort but i managed to smash the thick glass with the crowbar shielding myself with the wall just in case whoever was in there was still together enough to take a shot at me but no sound came as soon as i smelled the odor coming from inside i knew why i pushed the drapes aside and climbed into the room the bed had been broken up and its boards nailed to the door frame sealing it shut more long nails had been driven through the door and into the frame at an angle although some of them had come away either partially or entirely as though whoever had put them in place had then reconsidered and begun removing them again that or they were so long that theyd penetrated right through and someone from outside had started hammering them back although i could see no damage to the ends there was more furniture in this room than in its neighbor a long chest and a tv stand in addition to twin beds and two bedside lockers it had all been stacked in one corner the way a child might have constructed a fortress at home i moved closer a man lay slumped in the corner behind the furniture his head resting against the intercom button on the wall there was a cloud of blood and bone behind his head and a browning hung loosely from his right hand the mans body was swollen and so colonized by maggots and insects that they gave it the impression of movement and life they had quarried in his eyes leaving them hollow i covered my mouth with my hand but the smell was too strong i leaned out of the window gasping and tried not to throw up once id recovered i took off my jacket and pressed it against my face then made a cursory examination of the room there was a tool kit beside the body along with a nail gun there was no sign of food or water i ran my fingers over the metal backing of the door and felt the marks of more bullet holes i turned the flashlight on them and picked out more in the walls i counted twelve in all the brownings magazine held thirteen he had saved the last one for himself there was a bottle of water in the lexus i used it to wash the taste of decay from my mouth but i could still smell it on my clothes i now stank of soap and dead deer and dead men i called and waited for the police to come the names still haunted him there was gazaliya just about the most dangerous neighborhood in baghdad where it had all come to an end and dora and sadiya places where they killed the trash collectors so that the streets piled up with filth and it became impossible to live there there was the um alqura mosque in western baghdad headquarters of the sunni insurgency which in an ideal world they would simply have wiped off the face of the earth there was the amiriya racetrack where kidnap victims were bought and sold from the racetrack a road led straight to garma controlled by the insurgents once you were taken to garma you were gone in aladhamiya the sunni stronghold in baghdad close to the tigris river the shia death squads dressed as policemen and set up false checkpoints to catch their sunni neighbors the shias were supposed to be on our side but nobody was really on our side as far as he could tell the only difference between the sunnis and the shias lay in the way that they killed the sunnis beheaded one evening he and a couple of the others had watched a beheading on a dvd given to them by their interpreter theyd all wanted to see it but hed regretted asking as soon as it started there was the man cowering not an american because they didnt want to watch one of their own die but some poor bastard shia whod chosen the wrong turn or stopped when he should have put the foot down and taken his chances with the bullets what struck him was how matteroffact the executioner had been how seemingly removed from the task at hand the cutting had been methodical grim practical like the ritualistic killing of an animal an appalling death but one without sadism beyond the actual act of killing itself afterward they had all said the same thing dont let them take me if theres a chance of it and you see it happening kill me kill us all the shias meanwhile tortured they had a particular fondness for the electric drill knees elbows groin eyes that was it sunnis behead shias torment and they all worship the same god except there was some dispute about who should have taken over the religion after the prophet mohammed died and that was why they were now hacking heads and drilling bones it was all about qisas revenge it didnt surprise him the first time the interpreter told him that according to the islamic calendar it was still only the fifteenth century or something like it when he arrived in iraq that made a kind of sense to him because these people were still behaving like it was the middle ages but now they were part of a modern war a war fought with nightvision lenses and heavy weapons they responded with rpgs and mortars and bombs hidden inside dead dogs when they didnt have those they used stones and blades they answered the new with the old old weapons and old names nergal and ninazu and the one whose name was lost they set the trap and waited for them to come the first to arrive at the proctor place were two state troopers out of skowhegan id never met them before but one of them knew my name after some cursory questioning they let me sit in the lexus while we waited for the detectives to arrive the cops made small talk among themselves but left me alone until after about an hour the detectives showed up by then the sun was setting and they broke out the flashlights for the examination as it turned out id met one of them before his name was gordon walsh and he looked like a real bruiser as he stepped from his car his big sunglasses giving the impression that a large bug had evolved to the point that it could wear a suit he was a former college football player and hed kept in shape he had four or five inches on me and a good forty pounds a scar ran across his chin where someone had had the temerity to slash him with a bottle when he was still a trooper i hated to think of what might have happened to the assailant they were probably still trying to extract the bottle surgically from wherever walsh had stuck it beside him was a smaller younger detective whom i didnt recognize he had that rookie look to him a veneer of severity that couldnt quite disguise his uncertainty like a young colt trying to keep up with the stallion that had sired it walsh glanced up at me but said nothing then followed one of the troopers down to the room in which proctors body lay before he entered he smeared some vicks vaporub under his nose but he still didnt stay in there for long and he took some deep breaths when he emerged then he and his partner went up to the cabin and spent some time poking around inside after that they examined the truck all the while studiously ignoring me walsh had obviously found the keys and reached in to turn on the ignition the truck started first time he killed the engine then said something to his partner before both of them at last decided to pass the time of day with me walsh sucked on one arm of his shades and tuttutted as he approached me charlie parker he said as soon as i heard your name i knew my day was about to get more entertaining detective walsh i replied i heard evildoers tremble and knew that you were near i see youre still subsisting on raw meat mens sana in corpore sano and vice versa thats latin benefits of a catholic education this is my partner detective soames soames nodded but didnt say anything his mouth was rigid and his jaw jutted in a dudley doright manner i bet he ground his teeth at night did you kill him asked walsh no i didnt kill him damn i was hoping we could get this thing all tied up by midnight if you confessed id probably be given a medal for putting you behind bars at last and i thought you liked me detective i do like you imagine what the ones who dont like you say about you so if youre not prepared to break down and confess you want to tell me something useful said walsh his name is harold proctor or i assume thats who he is or was i said ive never met him so i cant say for sure what brings you to his neck of the woods im looking into the suicide of a young man down in portland a former soldier who for the boys father whats his name the fathers name is bennett patchett he owns the downs diner in scarborough where did proctor fit in damien patchett the son might have met him at some point proctor attended patchetts funeral i thought he might have some insights into damiens frame of mind before he took his own life insights huh you do talk nice ill give you that any doubts about how this patchett boy died none that i can tell he shot himself out in the woods near cape elizabeth so how come his father is paying you good money to investigate his death he wants to know what made his son kill himself is that so difficult to understand behind us the forensics unit appeared picking its way up the trail walsh tapped his partner on the arm elliot go give them a headsup point them in the right direction soames did as he was told but not before a slight crease of unhappiness furrowed his otherwise unlined brow at being shooed away while the grownups talked maybe he wasnt as wet as he appeared new boy i said hes good ambitious wants to solve crimes you remember when you were young like that i was never good and if i was ambitious id be somewhere else by now still like to solve crimes though gives me a sense of purpose otherwise i dont feel like im earning my wage and a man should earn his wage kind of brings us back to this patchett thing he took a look over his shoulder to where soames was talking to a man who was pulling on a white protective suit my partner likes things to be official he said he types reports as he goes along neatly he turned back to me i on the other hand type like one of bob newharts monkeys and i prefer to write my report at the end not the beginning so it seems to me unofficially that youre looking into the suicide of a veteran and it brings you out here where you find another veteran who also appears to be the victim of a selfinflicted gunshot wound except before he killed himself he managed to loose off most of a mag at someone outside before popping one more into his own skull am i reading this right outside that word gave me pause if the threat was outside why had proctor been firing at the walls of the room he was exmilitary so poor shooting couldnt have been the excuse but the room was sealed up from the inside so the threat couldnt have been in there with him could it i kept those thoughts to myself and contented myself with so far how old was the patchett boy twentyseven and proctor fifties id say early fifties he served in the first iraq war he a sociable man would you have said i never had the pleasure but he lived up here and patchett lived in portland scarborough lot of miles between here and there i suppose is this an interrogation detective interrogations involve bright lights and sweaty men in shirtsleeves and people trying to lawyer up this is a conversation my point is how did proctor and patchett come to be acquainted does it matter so much it matters because youre here and because theyre both dead come on parker give a guy a break there wasnt much point in holding back all that i knew but i decided to keep some of it for luck at first i thought proctor might have been one of the veterans assigned to meet soldiers when they return from active duty and he and patchett might have met up that way but now i think patchett and proctor may have been involved in a business venture together patchett and proctor sounds like a firm of lawyers what kind of business venture i dont know for sure but this place is near the border and its been used for storage recently there are wood shavings and foam pellets in the room next to the body and marks on the floor that look like they could have been left by packing cases might be worth getting a sniffer dog in there you figure drugs its possible you take a look inside his cabin just to see if he was there you search it that would be illegal thats not answering the question but ill assume that you did i would have and youre at least as unscrupulous as i am and since youre good at what you do youd have found an envelope filled with cash under the mattress would i how interesting walsh leaned against my car and looked from the trailer to the truck then to the motel and back again his face grew serious so hes got cash food in the refrigerator enough booze and candy to stock a convenience store and his truck appears to be running fine yet somehow he ends up barricading himself inside a motel room firing shots off at the door and window before sticking the gun in his own mouth and pulling the trigger his phone tv and radio were all broken up i said i saw that by him or by someone else the trailer wasnt trashed all of the books were on the shelves his clothes were still in his closet and the mattress was still on the bed if someone was serious about taking the place apart then theyd have found the money assuming they wanted it to begin with i spoke to a man named stunden down in langdon hes the taxidermist but he also runs the local bar you gotta love small towns said walsh if he could add undertaker to his list of accomplishments hed be indispensable stunden told me that proctor was troubled he felt that he was being haunted haunted that was the word he used to stunden but stunden seemed to think that it might be a symptom of posttraumatic stress as a consequence of his time in iraq he wouldnt be the first soldier to come back with mental as well as physical scars like your clients son two suicides each known to the other that strike you as odd i didnt reply i wondered how long it would take walsh to connect the deaths of proctor and damien with the earlier suicide of bernie kramer up in quebec and the murdersuicide involving brett harlan once he did so hed probably come up with joel tobias as well i made a mental note to ask bennett patchett to keep tobiass name out of any conversations he might have with the state police at least for now four soldiers three from the same squad and one peripherally connected to the others all dead from what appeared to be selfinflicted wounds along with a wife who had been unfortunate enough to encounter her husband with a bayonet in his hand id gone back to the newspaper reports on the killings and it wasnt hard to read between the lines and figure that both brett and margaret harlan had met terrible ends increasingly i was starting to believe that something very bad had occurred over in iraq an experience that the men of stryker c had shared and brought back with them even if carrie saunders had nixed that idea i still couldnt grasp how it might tie in with what jimmy jewel suspected of joel tobias that he was running a smuggling operation via his trucking business but there were the marks on the floor of room fourteen to consider and the traces of packing materials alongside them and the fact that if stunden was right then proctor had apparently been visited by some of the men from stryker c before he died then there was the cash under the mattress which suggested that proctor had recently been paid for something storage facilities i guessed which raised the question of what was being stored drugs still seemed the likeliest option but jimmy jewel hadnt been convinced and it would have taken a lot of very heavy drugs to leave those marks on the carpet anyway from what i knew of the international drug trade afghanistan was more likely to provide a source of wholesale drugs than iraq and tobiass squad hadnt served in afghanistan soames called to walsh and he left me to my thoughts i wondered what was happening over in bangor if bobby jandreau didnt see the wisdom of talking soon it would be time at last to put significant pressure on joel tobias darkness closed in but the air did not cool insects bit and i heard movements in the undergrowth of the forest as the night creatures came out to feed and to hunt the medical examiner arrived and klieg lights illuminated the motel as harold proctors body was removed ready to be taken to the maine medical examiners office down in augusta his would be the sole body down there but not for long soon he would have plenty of company they came at nightfall a soft breeze brought movement to the woods hiding their approach but angel and louis had been waiting for them knowing that they would come they had exchanged positions every hour to keep each other alert and it was angel who was watching the mustang when the figures appeared his sharp eyes picking up the slight change in the shadows cast by the swaying trees he touched his partners sleeve and louis turned his attention from the house to the car silently they watched the two men descend their arms unnaturally extended by the guns in their hands the suppressors like swollen tissue about to burst they were good that was louiss first thought there must be a vehicle nearby but he hadnt heard it and angel hadnt picked them up until they were almost on top of the car anyone in the mustang would have been dead before he realized what was happening the two men melted back into the shadows again as they realized the mustang was unoccupied and even louis had to strain to follow their progress they wore no masks which meant that they werent concerned about witnesses because they would only be seen by whomever was in the house and then for only as long as it took their victims to die victims that was the other matter the situation at bobby jandreaus house had been complicated by the arrival of mel nelson his estranged girlfriend two hours earlier incredible as it seemed the spontaneous relationship advice offered that afternoon seemed to have made an impression louis had regarded the couple impassively as they talked in the living room for a time before mel walked slowly over to bobby then knelt before him and embraced him after that they had retired to what louis presumed was the bedroom and they had not been seen since more distorted shadows the gunmen were at the rear of the house now where there was no chance of being seen by a neighbor at a window or by someone taking a dog for a bedtime walk one at either side of the door a nod breaking glass a figure poised to provide cover the gun raised as the other reached in through the hole to open the lock movement inside the house in response to the intrusion a scream the slamming closed of a bedroom door louis took the first man with two shots to the back and a third the killing shot to the base of the skull there was no warning no invitation to turn with his hands held high no chance to surrender such gestures were for the good guys in westerns the ones who wore white hats and got the girl at the end in real life good guys who give chances to killers end up dead and louis who had no idea if he was truly good or not and could not have cared less had no intention of dying for a romantic ideal as the slain man fell louiss gun was already swinging right the second of the wouldbe killers was struggling to drag his hand back through the broken pane his sleeve snagged on a jagged edge his own body preventing him from responding to the approaching threat but now there were two guns on him and he froze for an instant as he acknowledged the impossibility of his own survival there was sudden pain and then fast upon it sound and he slumped against the wood his left arm still hanging above his head the glass erupting through the material of his jacket he had just enough strength left to raise his gun but it was pointing at nothing and then nothing was all that there was the bedroom door remained closed angel called out to jandreau as louis began to detach the impaled man from the door bobby jandreau can you hear me he said my name is angel my partner and i were here earlier with charlie parker i hear you said jandreau i have a gun well thats great said angel go you in the meantime we got two bodies out here and you and your girlfriend are only alive because of us so do whatever you have to do because were moving you out there was the sound of whispered conversation from inside moments later the door opened and bobby jandreau appeared in the gap seated in his wheelchair and wearing only a pair of boxer shorts his beretta held uncertainly before him he looked at louis who was dragging in the first of the bodies while angel kept watch it left a bloody trail along the pine floor we need trash bags and duct tape said louis a mop and water too unless you think red goes well with the walls mel peered around the door she seemed to be naked apart from a strategically placed towel maam said angel nodding his head in acknowledgment of her you might want to put some clothes on playtimes over by the time jandreau and his girlfriend were dressed and had packed some clothes and toiletries into a bag the two bodies were trussed in black garbage sacks and wrapped with tape jandreau stared at them from his chair he had identified them instantly even as death wrought its changes on them twizell and greenham both exmarines they were sta he said surveillance and target acquisition eightyfour fiftyone military occupational specialty angel stared at him blankly scout snipers explained louis they were slumming it tonight they were one of two marine sniper teams that we inserted into aladhamiya continued jandreau it was just before well that was it that was the story bobby jandreau wanted to talk now he wanted to tell it all because his buddies had turned on him at last but angel told him to save it for later mel nelson drove a big old truck with a cabin back so they had her bring it around behind the house and they threw the bodies inside then they put jandreau and mel into the mustang first taking care to remove and disable the gps and angel drove them to a motel just outside bucksport while louis following jandreaus directions took the truck to a disused granite quarry near frankfort there using rope and chains from jandreaus garage he weighted the bodies and dropped them into dark water he was about to dump the gps tracker in the penobscot when he reconsidered it really was a neat piece of gear better than he could have constructed himself he tossed it in the back of mels truck and joined the others back at the motel and there for want of anything better to do they let bobby jandreau begin to tell his tale walsh kept me sitting around until proctors body had been taken away i think he was punishing me for not being more forthcoming but at least he was talking to me and hadnt come up with some obscure legal reason to put me in a cell for the night since it would take me almost three hours to get to portland and i was tired and wanted to shower i decided to find a place nearby to stay the decision wasnt entirely mine to make forensics wanted to wait until morning to make a full sweep of the property and the sniffer dogs would arrive soon after walsh had suggested that in a spirit of goodwill and co operation i might like to remain in the vicinity just in case a question occurred to him the next day or even during the night i keep a notepad beside my bed expressly for that purpose he said as he leaned his considerable bulk against the car really i said just in case you can come up with awkward questions to ask me thats right youd be surprised at how many cops might say the same thing you know i wouldnt be he shook his head in a despairing way like a dog trainer faced with a recalcitrant animal that refuses to give up its ball some distance away soames was watching us unhappily once again he clearly very much wanted to be part of the conversation but walsh was deliberately excluding him it was interesting i predicted tensions in their relationship had they been a couple walsh would have been sleeping in the spare room that night some might say that we underpaid state cops have a legitimate beef against you given what happened to hansen he continued and i instantly recalled hansen a detective with the maine state police standing in the deserted house in brooklyn in which my wife and child had been killed he had followed me there out of some misguided missionary zeal and he had been punished for it not by me but by another a killer to whom hansen was inconsequential and for whom i was the true prize it doesnt look like hes ever going to work again said walsh and its never been clear just what he was doing in your house on the night that he was hurt are you asking me to tell you about that night no because i know that you wont and anyway i read the official version it had more holes in it than a hobos drawers if you did tell me anything it would be a lie or a partial truth like all that youve told me so far this evening and yet here we are taking in the night air and being civil to each other indeed i bet youre curious as to why that might be go on ill bite walsh hoisted himself from my car found his cigarettes and lit up because even though youre a jerk and believe you know better than everyone else despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary i think youre fighting the good fight well talk tomorrow just in case ive scribbled something brilliant and incisive in my notebook overnight or in case forensics has a question about some part of the crime scene that youve contaminated but after that you can go about your business what i expect in return is that at some point in the near future ill receive a call from you and youll feel compelled to unburden yourself of what you know or what youve learned after that if its not too late to do anything other than view a body given your previous form ill have an answer to what happened here and i may even get a promotion by wrapping it all up how does that sound that sounds reasonable id like to think so now you can get in your fancy lexus and drive out of here some of us have overtime to earn incidentally i never took you for a lexus guy last i heard you were driving a mustang like youre steve mcqueen the mustangs in the shop i lied this is a loaner a loaner from new york dont give me a reason to run those plates well if you cant find a room in rangeley you can just sleep in that car its big enough drive safely now i headed back to rangeley and sought out a room at the rangeley inn the main building its lobby decorated with deer heads and a stuffed bear wasnt yet open for the season so i was given a motel room in the lodge at the rear there were a couple of other cars parked nearby one of them with a map of the area on its passenger seat and a decal for a tv station out of bangor on the dashboard to which had been appended a handwritten sign pleading do not tow i showered and changed my shirt for a tshirt i had picked up at a gas station the smell of proctors decay was still with me afterward but it was mostly remembered not actual more troubling to me was the sense of unease that i had experienced in the room adjoining proctors body it felt as though i had wandered in at the tail end of an argument in time to hear only the echo of the final words all venom and malice i wondered if they were the same words that harold proctor heard before he died i walked over to sarges pub to get something to eat it wasnt a hard choice since it was the only place nearby that seemed to be open sarges had a long curving bar with five tvs showing four different sports and in the case of the final screen behind the bar a local news show the volume on the sports screens had been turned down and a group of men was watching the news in silence proctors death had made the lead as much for the oddness of his passing as for the fact that it was a slow news night suicides didnt usually merit that kind of coverage and the local news stations generally tended to be pretty sensitive to the feelings of the relatives of the deceased but some of the details of proctors death had clearly caught their attention a man sealed up from the inside in a room of a disused motel his life ended by an apparently selfinflicted wound the report didnt mention the shots that he had fired at someone outside the room before he killed himself i heard muttered words as i took a seat away from the bar and a couple of heads turned in my direction one of them belonged to stunden the taxidermist i ordered a burger and a glass of wine from the waitress the wine arrived quickly closely followed by stunden i cursed myself quietly i had forgotten all about my earlier promise to him the least i had owed him both for the information he had provided and because of his concern for harold proctor was a personal visit and some clarification of what had occurred those who had stayed in their seats were all looking in my direction stunden smiled apologetically and shot a quick look at the men behind him as if to say well you know how small towns are to their credit those at the bar were clearly trying to balance embarrassment with curiosity but curiosity was ahead by a neck sorry to bother you mr parker but we hear that it was you who found harold i gestured to the seat across from me and he sat theres no apology necessary mr stunden i should have paid a courtesy call to you after the police let me go but it had been a long day and i forgot im sorry for that stundens eyes looked red hed been drinking some but i thought that he might also have been crying i understand it was a shock for all of us i couldnt open the bar not after what happened thats why im here i thought somebody might know more than i did and then you came in and well i cant tell you much i said and he was smart enough to pick up on the dual meaning of the words if youd just tell me what you can that would be enough is what theyre saying about him true is what whos saying true stunden shrugged the tv people nobody here has heard anything official from the detectives closest thing we have is the border patrol the story is that harold committed suicide it looks that way if there had been a cap in stundens hand he would have twisted it awkwardly one of the border cops told ben here he jerked a thumb at an overweight man in a camo shirt his belt so weighted with keys knives phones and flashlights that his pants were almost around his thighs that there was something hinky about harolds death but he wouldnt say what it was there was that word again hinky joel tobias was hinky harold proctors death was hinky it was all hinky ben and two other men from the bar drawn by the prospect of some enlightenment had gravitated toward us i weighed up my options before i spoke and saw that there was no benefit to me in holding anything back from them everything would emerge eventually if not later tonight when some offduty border cop came in for a drink then tomorrow at the latest when the towns own informationgathering resources began to kick into gear but i also knew that while there might be aspects of harold proctors death about which they did not know then equally there would be parts of his life about which i had no knowledge and they did stunden had been helpful some of these men might be helpful too he fired all the bullets in his gun before he died i said he saved the last one for himself everyone probably came up with the same question at the same time but it was stunden who asked it first what was he firing at something outside i said again pushing to the back of my mind the spread of the bullet holes in the room you think he was chased in there asked proctor hard to see how a man being chased would have time to nail himself up in a room i replied hell harold was crazy said ben he never was the same after he came back from iraq there were general nods of agreement if they had their way it would be carved on his headstone harold proctor somewhat missed was crazy well i said you now know as much as i do they began to drift away only stunden remained he was the only one of the men who appeared genuinely distressed at the circumstances of harolds death you ok i asked him no not really i guess i wasnt as close to harold in recent times as i once was but i was still his friend it troubles me to think of him being so he couldnt find the word frightened i said yeah frightened and alone to die that way i mean it just doesnt seem right the waitress came by with my burger and i ordered myself another glass of wine even though id barely touched the glass before me i pointed at stundens glass bushmills he said no water thanks i waited until the drinks appeared and the waitress was gone stunden took a long sip of his drink as i ate my food and i suppose i feel guilty he said does that make sense i feel like had i done more to stay in touch with him to bring him out of his shell to ask him about his problems then none of this would have happened i could have lied to him i could have said that proctors death had nothing to do with him that proctor had been set on a different path a path that led ultimately to a lonely terrified death in a sealed room but i didnt it would have belittled the man before me a man who was decent and honorable i cant say if thats true or not i told him but harold got himself involved in something odd and that wasnt your fault in the end thats probably what got him killed odd he said what do you mean by odd did you ever see trucks go in and out of harolds place i asked big rigs possibly on the way down from canada jeez i wouldnt know if the truck came up from portland or augusta maybe but if they came through coburn gore then theyd get to harolds place before they reached langdon is there someone who would know i can ask around i dont have that kind of time mr stunden look im not the police and you have no obligation to provide me with information but do you remember what i told you earlier today stunden nodded about the boy who killed himself thats right and now harold proctor is dead and it looks like another suicide i could have mentioned kramer in quebec and brett harlan and his wife to clinch the deal but if i did then it would become part of the bar conversation and that in turn would get back to the cops eventually there were any number of reasons why i didnt want that to happen id only just got my license back and despite vague assurances that it was in no danger of immediate revocation again i didnt need to give the state police any excuse to go after me at the very least id incur the displeasure of walsh and i kind of liked him although if we were ever jailed together i wouldnt want to share a cell with him but more than all of that i recognized the old hunger i wanted to explore what was happening to uncover the deeper connections between the deaths of harold proctor damien patchett and the others i knew now that i was a private investigator in name only that the mundane stuff of false insurance claims cheating spouses and thieving employees might be enough to pay my bills but it was no more than that i had come to realize that my desire to join the police and my short less than illustrious career in the nypd were not solely about making recompense for my fathers perceived failings he had killed two young people before taking his own life and his actions had tainted the memory of him and marked me i was a bad cop not corrupt not violent not inept but still bad for i lacked the discipline and patience and maybe the absence of ego that the job required the acquisition of a private investigators license had seemed like a compromise that i could live with a means of fulfilling some vague sense of purpose by acquiring the trappings of legality i knew that i could never be a cop again but i still had the instincts required and the sense of purpose of vocation that marked out the ones who didnt do it solely for the benefits or the camaraderie or the promise of cashing out in twenty and opening a bar in boca raton so i could have handed over everything that i knew or suspected to walsh and walked away after all his resources were greater than mine and i had no reason to believe that his sense of purpose was inferior to my own but i wanted this without it what was i so i would take my chances i would trade when i had to trade and hoard what i could at some point you have to trust your instincts and yourself i had learned something in the years since my wife and child were taken from me and i hunted down the one responsible i was good at what i did why because i had nothing else now i watched stunden as he considered the two suicides i didnt speak for a while i just let the possibility of a connection dangle itself before him like a brightly colored fly while i waited for him to bite theres a guy name of geagan edward geagan said stunden he lives up behind harolds place you wouldnt know it not unless you were looking for him but hes up there all right like a lot of people around here like harold did he keeps himself to himself but hes not weird or nothing hes just quiet if anyone would know edward would i want to talk to him before the cops do he have a phone edward i said he was quiet i didnt say he was a primitive he does something with the internet marketing i think i dont even know what marketing means but hes got more computers up there than nasa and a phone he added call him can i promise that youll buy him a drink you know those old westerns where the hero tells the bartender to leave the bottle stunden blinked ill call edward edward geagan turned out to be from geek central casting he was in his midthirties tall and pale and thin with long sandy hair and rimless glasses dressed in brown polyester pants cheap brown shoes and a light tan shirt he looked like someone had put a wig on a giraffe and run it through the local target this is mr parker the man i told you about said stunden he has some questions hed like to ask you he spoke as though he were talking to a child geagan cocked an eyebrow at him stunds why do you insist on talking to me like im a moron he said but there was no hint of unfriendliness to his voice only vague amusement tinged with a little impatience because you look like you belong in mit not a wood in franklin county said stunden i feel like i should look out for you geagan grinned at him and stunden for the first time that evening grinned back asshole rube as it turned out the bartender declined to leave us with the bottle but he was prepared to keep refilling the glasses as long as stunden and geagan could keep ordering without slurring their words unfortunately for me their tolerance for alcohol was at least as great as their tolerance for each other the bar began to empty at about the same pace as the bottle behind the bar until pretty soon we were the only people left we spent some time making small talk and geagan told me how hed ended up in franklin county having tired of city life down in boston the first winter was hard he said i thought boston sucked when it snowed but up here well you might as well be at the bottom of an avalanche he grimaced i miss women too you know female company these small towns man the ones who arent married have left its like being in the foreign legion it gets better when the tourists come said stunden not much but some damn i might be dead of frustration by then they both stared into the bottom of their glasses as though hoping a mermaid might pop her head out of the booze and flick her tail invitingly at them about harold proctor i said trying to move the conversation along i was surprised when i heard said geagan he wasnt the kind that phrase was starting to recur a little too often bennett patchett had used it about his son and carrie saunders had said much the same thing about both damien patchett and brett harlan if they were all correct there were a lot of dead people who had no business being dead why do you say that he was hard he had no regrets about anything that hed done over there and hed done some pretty hardcore stuff or so he said well i thought it was hardcore but then ive never killed anyone never will i hope you got along with him i drank with him a couple of times during the winter and he helped me when my generator gave out we were neighborly without being close thats the way of things up here then harold grew different i talked to stunds here about it and he said the same harold started keeping his own counsel more than before and he was never what you might call a chatterbox id hear his truck starting up at odd times after dark sometimes well after midnight then the rig started arriving a big truck red i think hauling a trailer a red truck just like joel tobiass did you get a plate number geagan recited it from memory it was tobias all right ive got a photographic memory he said helps with what i do when did this happen four or five times that i can recall twice last month once this month the last time just yesterday i leaned forward the truck came through yesterday geagan looked flustered as though fearful that hed made a mistake i could see him counting back the days yep yesterday morning i saw it coming out as i was heading back to my place from town so i dont know what time it went in i knew from the little that walsh had told me that proctor had probably been dead for two or three days it was hard to tell given the heat in the room and the consequent speed of putrefaction now it seemed that tobias had been at the motel since proctor had died but hadnt taken the trouble to look for him that or he knew proctor was dead but said nothing which sounded unlikely whoever proctor had been firing at it wasnt joel tobias and it was definitely the same truck as before yeah i told you ive seen it a few times harold and the other guy the driver no wait there was one time when i thought there might have been three of them would unload stuff from the back and the truck would drive away again did you ever mention this to harold no why not it wasnt bothering me and i didnt think harold would appreciate me asking he must have known that i might hear or see them but up here it doesnt pay to question other people about their business didnt you wonder what he was doing geagan looked uneasy i thought he might be considering reopening the motel he talked about it sometimes but he didnt have the money he needed to restore it geagans eyes wouldnt meet my face and i said harold liked to smoke a little pot so do i he knew where to get it and id pay him for it not much just enough to keep me going through the long winter months was harold dealing no i dont believe so he just had a supplier but you thought he might have been storing drugs in the motel right it would make sense especially if he was looking to make some money to reopen the place were you tempted to take a look geagan looked uneasy i might have been once when harold wasnt around what did you see the rooms were all blocked up but i could tell that some had been opened recently there were wood chips on the ground and the dirt was all torn up there were grooves in the earth like theyd wheeled something heavy inside you never saw what they were bringing in when you looked out of your window the front of the truck was always facing me if they were unloading anything then it was easiest to keep the back of the truck to the motel i could never quite see what they were moving never quite see but you think that you might have spotted something right its going to sound strange believe me you dont know from strange well it was a statue i guess like one of those greek ones yknow white and from a museum i thought it was a body at first but it had no arms like the venus de milo but male damn i said softly not drugs antiquities joel tobias was just full of surprises have you talked to the police yet no i dont think they even know im up there talk to them in the morning but leave it till late tell them what you told me last thing the police think harold killed himself three days ago give or take did you hear any shots during that time no i was down in boston visiting my folks until the day before yesterday i guess harold killed himself while i was away he did kill himself didnt he i believe he did then why did he lock himself up in that room to do it what was he shooting at before he died i dont know i waved at the bartender for the tab i heard the door open behind me but i didnt look around stunden and geagan looked up and their faces changed brightening after the darkness of our conversation looks like somebodys luck may be about to turn said geagan straightening his hair and i sure hope its mine as casually as i could i tried to glance over my shoulder but the woman was already by my right hand buy you a drink mr parker asked carrie saunders geagan and stunden rose to their feet and prepared to leave looks like im shit out of luck again said geagan beg pardon miss he added no apology necessary said saunders and this is professional not personal does that mean i still have a chance asked geagan no geagan gave an exaggerated sigh stunden patted him on the back come on lets leave them to it im sure i got a bottle somewhere at home that could help you with your troubles whiskey said geagan no said stunden ethyl alcohol you might need to cut it with something though they made their excuses and left although not before geagan cast a final lingering glance in saunderss direction the guy had clearly spent too long in the woods if he didnt get some action soon even moose would be in danger from him your fan club asked saunders once the waitress had brought her a mich ultra some of it its bigger than i expected i like to think of it as small but stable unlike your patient base which seems to be dwindling by the day maybe you should consider an alternative profession or cut a deal with a mortuary she scowled score one for the guy with the chip on his shoulder harold proctor wasnt one of my patients it looks like a local physician was prescribing his meds i contacted him in an effort to have him participate in my study but he didnt want to cooperate and he didnt ask for my professional help and i dont appreciate your flippant attitude toward what i do or toward the former servicemen whove died get off your soapbox dr saunders you were in no hurry to offer me help the last time we met when i was under the misguided impression that we wanted the same thing which was to find out why a small group of men all of whom knew one another were dying by their own hands instead i got the party line and some cheap analysis that wasnt what you wanted to find out no they teach you telepathy at head school too or is that something youve been working on when you get tired of being supercilious she gave me the hard stare anything else yeah why dont you order a real drink youre embarrassing me she broke she had a nice smile but shed fallen out of the habit of using it a real drink like a glass of red wine she said this isnt a church social im surprised the bartender didnt take you outside and beat you with a stick i sat back and raised a hand in surrender she put the mich aside and signaled the waitress ill have what hes having itll look like were on a date i said only to a blind man and then hed probably have to be deaf as well saunders was certainly a looker but anyone seriously considering engaging with her on an intimate level would need to wear body armor to counter the spikes her wine arrived she sipped it didnt appear to actively disapprove and sipped again how did you find me i asked the cops told me that you were in rangeley one of them detective walsh even described your car for me he told me that i should slash your tires when i found it just to make sure you stayed put oh and for the sake of it the decision to stay was kind of forced upon me by the cops they must really love you its tentative but mutual how did you find out about harold proctor i asked the cops found my card in his cabin and it seems that his physician is on vacation in the bahamas its a long way to drive for a man that you didnt know well he was a soldier and another suicide this is my work the cops thought i might be able to shed some light on the circumstances of his death and could you only what i could tell from my sole visit to his home before tonight he lived alone drank too much smoked some pot judging by the smell in his cabin and he had little or no support structure so he was a prime candidate for suicide he was vulnerable thats all why now though hed been out of the military for fifteen years or more you told me that posttraumatic stress could take as long as a decade to undo but fifteen years seems like a long time for it to begin in the first place that i cant explain how did you come to find him as i interviewed former soldiers i asked them to suggest others who might be willing to participate or those whom they felt were vulnerable and could use an informal approach someone suggested harold do you remember who it was no id have to check my notes it might have been damien patchett but i couldnt say for sure it wouldnt have been joel tobias would it she scowled joel tobias doesnt hold with psychiatrists so you tried he conducted the last of his physical therapy at togus but there was a psychological component as well he was assigned to me but our progress was limited she examined me steadily over the lip of her glass you dont like him do you ive barely met him but i dont like what ive found out about him so far joel tobias drives a big rig with a bigger trailer theres a lot of space to hide something in a box that size her eyes didnt even flicker you seem very convinced that there is something to hide the day after i began looking into joel tobias i was worked over very professionally no bones broken no visible marks it might not have been connected to tobias she interrupted listen i appreciate that there may be people out there who dont like me but most of them arent very smart and if they arranged a beating for me theyd be sure to claim a little credit theyre not the anonymous donor type these guys used water and a sack it was made clear that i should stay out of joel tobiass business and by extension theirs from what i hear most of the people who might have had real difficulties with you are no longer in a position to arrange beatings not unless they can contract out from the grave i looked away youd be surprised i said but she didnt seem to hear she was lost in her own thoughts the reason why i declined to help you when we first met was because i didnt believe that you wanted what i wanted my role is to help these men and women where i can some of them like harold proctor and joel tobias dont want my help they may need it but they consider it a sign of weakness to confess their fears to a shrink even an exarmy shrink who spent time in the same dustbowl that they did theres been a lot written in the newspapers about suicide rates among military personnel about how physically and psychologically damaged men and women have been abandoned by their government about how they may even be a threat to national security theyve been fighting an unpopular war and okay its not quite vietnam either in terms of casualties over there or in the animosity toward veterans back home but you cant blame the military for being defensive when you came along i thought you might just be another jackass trying to prove a point and now i still think youre a jackass and that detective out at the proctor place clearly concurs but maybe our ultimate aims arent so different we both want to find out why these men are dying at their own hands she took another sip of wine it stained her teeth tipping them with red like an animal that had fed recently on raw meat look i take this seriously thats why im engaged in this research my study is part of a joint initiative with the national institute of mental health to try to come up with some answers and some solutions were looking at the role that combat and multiple deployments play in suicide we know that two thirds of suicides take place during or after a deployment thats fifteen months in a war zone with barely enough time to decompress afterward before exhausted men and women are sent back into the field again its clear that our soldiers need help but theyre afraid to ask for it in case its recorded and the jacket follows them but the military also needs to change its attitude toward its troops mental health screening is poor and commanders are reluctant to allow military personnel to gain access to civilian therapists theyre hiring more general practitioners which is a start and more mental health care providers but the focus is on troops in combat what happens when they come home of the sixty soldiers who killed themselves between january and august thirtynine of them did so after they returned to this country were letting these men and women down theyre wounded but the wounds dont show in some cases until its too late something has to be done for them someone has to take responsibility she sat back some of the hardness fell away from her and she just looked tired tired and somehow younger than she was as though her distress at the deaths was both professional yet also almost childlike in its purity do you understand now why i was wary when a private investigator and one with respect whose reputation for violence precedes him began asking about the deaths of veterans by their own hands it was a rhetorical question or if it wasnt then i chose to consider it as such i signaled for another round we didnt speak again until it arrived and she had poured the remainder of her first glass into her second and you i asked how does it affect you i dont understand the question she said i mean that it must be hard listening to all of those stories of pain and injury and death seeing those damaged men and women week after week it must take its toll she pushed her glass around the table watching the patterns that it formed circles upon circles like venn diagrams thats why i left the military and became a civilian consultant she said i still experience guilt about it but over there i sometimes felt like king canute trying to hold back the tide alone in iraq i could still be overruled by a commander who needed soldiers in the field the needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few and for the most part all i could do was offer tips on how to cope as if that could help soldiers who had already gone far beyond the possibility of coping in togus i feel like im part of a strategy an attempt to see the bigger picture even if the bigger picture is thirtyfive thousand soldiers already diagnosed with ptsd and more to come that isnt answering the question i said no it isnt is it the name for what youre implying is secondary trauma or contact distress the more deeply therapists involve themselves with victims the more likely they are to experience some of their trauma at the moment mental health evaluations of therapists are practically nonexistent its selfevaluation and nothing more you know youre broken only when you break she drank half of her wine now tell me about harold proctor and what you saw out there she said i told her most of it leaving out only a little of what edward geagan had revealed and the money that was discovered in proctors cabin when i was finished she didnt speak but maintained eye contact if it was some kind of psychiatric trick designed to wear me down and blurt out everything that id kept hidden since childhood it wasnt working id already given away more than i wanted about myself to her and i wasnt about to do it again i had a vision of myself closing a stable door while a horse disappeared over the horizon what about the money she said or did you just forget to mention it clearly the state cops were more susceptible to her wiles than i was when next we met id have a word with walsh about maintaining some backbone and not coming over all giggly when a goodlooking woman patted his arm and complimented him on his weapon i havent figured that part out yet i said youre not dumb mr parker so dont assume that i am let me suggest what conclusions i think you may have come to and you can disagree with me when im done you believe that proctor was storing items in his motel possibly even probably drugs you believe that the cash in his cabin was a payment for his services you believe that some or all of the men who have died might also have been involved in this same operation joel tobias makes runs in his truck back and forth across the canadian border so you believe that hes the likeliest transport link am i wrong i didnt respond so she continued talking and yet i dont think youve told the police all of this i wonder why is it because you feel some loyalty to bennett patchett and you dont want to besmirch his sons reputation unless you absolutely have to do so i think that may be part of it youre a romantic mr parker but sometimes like all romantics you confuse it with sentimentality that explains why youre cynical about the motives of others but youre also a crusader and that fits in with your romantic streak that crusading impulse is essentially selfish youre a crusader because it gives you a sense of purpose not because it serves the larger requirements of justice or society in fact when your own needs and the greater collective need have come into conflict i suspect that youve usually chosen the former over the latter that doesnt make you a bad person just an unreliable one so howd i do close on proctor and tobias i cant comment on the second bout of free analysis its not free youre going to pay for my drinks what have i missed about proctor and tobias i dont think its drugs why not i talked to someone whod know if there was an attempt to increase the local supply or to use the state as a staging post it would involve squaring things with the dominicans and probably the mexicans too the gentleman to whom i spoke would also look for his cut and if the new players just decided to dispense with the niceties then some men with guns might be tempted to dispense with them theres also the question of supply unless theyre growing bud themselves across the border or are importing heroin straight from the source in asia theyd have to deal with the current suppliers somewhere along the line its hard to keep those kinds of negotiations quiet especially when they might threaten the status quo if not drugs then what there might be something in their military records i said avoiding the question ive looked into the records of the deceased theres nothing look closer ill ask you again what are they smuggling i think you know ill tell you when im sure go back to the records there must be something if youre concerned about the reputation of the military then having the cops uncover a smuggling operation involving veterans isnt going to help it would be better if the military could be the instigators of any action against them and in the meantime what are you going to do theres always a weak link im going to find it i paid the tab on the assumption that i could run it past the irs as a justifiable expense if i claimed not to have enjoyed myself which was largely true are you driving back to augusta tonight i asked saunders no im staying in the same place that you are she said i walked with her across the road to the motel whered you park on the street she said id ask you in for a nightcap but i have no booze oh and i dont want to theres that too i wont take it personally i really wish that you would she said and then she was gone back in my room i checked my cell phone there was one message it was from louis giving me the number of a motel and the room in which he was staying i used the room phone to call him the main building was locked up for the night and i wasnt worried about anyone listening in nevertheless we kept the conversation as circumspect as possible just in case we had company he said after angel passed him the phone two for dinner they make it to the main course didnt even last until the appetizers and after they went swimming well at least they did it on an empty stomach yeah cant be too careful now its just the four of us four seems like you have a new career in relationship counseling im not sure my skills are up to helping you with yours we find ourselves in that much trouble well make a suicide pact first in the meantime you need to get over here our friend has turned out to be quite the conversationalist i promised the state cops id hang around until morning well theyll miss you but i think you need to hear this more i told him it would take me a few hours to get there and he said that they werent planning on going anywhere as i drove out of the lot a light still burned in carrie saunderss room but i didnt think that it burned for me iv menelaus we were swindled by the gods we had our hands upon an idol of the clouds messenger you mean it was for a cloud for nothing we did all that work euripides helen ll hed spent too long in just about every vehicle the army had to offer and knew their strengths and shortcomings but he was eventually brought in to fill a vacant spot on tobiass stryker squad there had been a lot of crap tossed at the stryker usually by the kind of shitheads who subscribed to gun magazines and wrote letters to them about the warrior class but soldiers liked the stryker the seat cushions sucked the ac was like the beating of fly wings and there werent enough outlets to run dvd players or ipods for an entire squad but it was superior to the humvees even the uparmored ones the stryker offered integral mm protection from anything the haji could throw at it with additional cover from rpgs provided by a cage of armor eighteen inches from the main body it had the m at the rear and a cal that rocked by comparison the humvee was like wrapping yourself in tissue and waving a and that kind of stuff mattered because against every rule that he had ever been taught about urban warfare the army had them marking the same patrol routes at the same times every day so the haji could set their clocks and by extension their ieds by them by this point it wasnt a matter of if they were going to be hit on a given day but when the upside was that following a hit the vehicle was automatically returned to base for repairs so the squad could rest up for the remainder of the day the transfer to the stryker squad had been tobiass doing tobias and the man named roddam tobias had earned his sergeants stripes and was squad leader he wasnt a jerk though he even scored them some beers and getting busted for drinking was a serious offense you might pull an article for a fistfight or borrowing a vehicle without permission but alcohol and drugs merited judicial punishment tobiass own neck was on the line over the beer but he trusted them by then though he had become familiar with the way tobias operated and he knew that the beers were a way of softening them up tobias had his own unique spin on newtons third law of motion for every action there was an equal or greater reaction expected they would pay for those beers one way or another and roddam was the one who was going to extract the payment roddam was a spook of some kind baghdad was overrun with them both genuine and charlatans and roddam was a little of both he was private not cia and he didnt talk much about what he did like any good spook he said that he worked for a small outfit called information retrieval interpretation services or iris but tobias let it slip that it was basically a oneman operation iriss logo not unexpectedly was an eye with the world as its pupil roddams cards boasted offices in concord new hampshire and pontrouge canada but the pontrouge office turned out to be little more than a tax scam with proximity to an airfield and the concord office was a telephone and an answering machine roddam was exagency though he had contacts and he had influence part of his role in baghdad was to act as the middleman between the army and the smaller contractors the ones who didnt have their own transport networks and were trying to keep their costs down so that they could bank a bigger share of whatever they were overcharging uncle sam to begin with roddam arranged for the transportation of anything on which the big boys like halliburton didnt already have first dibs from a box of obscure screws to weapons that were required for whatever reason to bypass the regular transport channels that paid his bills and more but it wasnt his main area of expertise roddam as it turned out was an expert in interrogation and information analysis which explained the origins of the name iris there were too many iraqis in custody for the regular intelligence guys to process so the little fish were thrown to roddam if you got enough little fish and crossreferenced whatever information could be gleaned from them it was possible that a bigger picture might be constructed from the individual pieces roddam was some kind of genius at analyzing the information coaxed from prisoners sometimes without them even knowing that theyd revealed anything crucial roddam would occasionally deal with prisoners himself usually in an effort to clarify a point or in an effort to make a solid connection between two apparently random pieces of information he wasnt a thumbscrew and waterboarding kind of guy he was patient and softspoken and careful everything he learned went into a computer program that he had created and for which iraq was to be the testing ground it collated key phrases minor operational details even turns of phrase and crossreferenced them in the hope of establishing patterns army intelligence and the agency would feed him their scraps too so that over time roddam came to know more about the daytoday operation of the insurgency than just about anyone else on the ground he was the goto guy trusted as a virtual oracle in return what roddam wanted roddam got he never learned how roddam and tobias managed to hook up he supposed that men like them just inevitably found each other so when tobias brought the beer roddam came with him in fact it was probably roddam who had sourced the beer in the first place by that time the squad had taken some hits lattner was dead and cole edwards and martinez were injured and had been replaced by harlan and kramer and it looked like hale whod been hit by a sniper wasnt going to pull through hed taken one in the head and it would be a mercy if he died the squad had been marked for force protection duties until it could be restored to full strength no patrols just guard shifts in the tower which meant hour after hour of radio checks with front line yankee and replies of lima charlie loud and clear and maybe ducking occasionally when someone in the darkness decided to lob a mortar or send in an rpg or just fire off a couple of rounds to keep you from getting bored that night tobias or roddam had swung it so that they were relieved of fp so there were eight of them in tobiass chew him tobias roddam kramer harlan mallak patchett and bacci after a couple of beers to soften them up tobias began to speak he told them of hale and how the rest of his life was going to be a struggle at best he spoke of other guys that they knew he told of how men were struggling to get money under section welfare the va anything of how the va had denied keys the assistant gunner that patchett had replaced a claim for his leg informing him that he rated only sixty percent disabled keys had gone to the press and his rating got bumped up but only to keep him quiet hed been lucky but there were a lot of other injured men out there who werent so lucky or who didnt have a sympathetic newspaper to take up their cause tobias said that roddam had a proposition for them and if they went along with it theyd be able to help some of their injured brothers and sisters and make life more comfortable for themselves once they got back home he told them to listen up and they did roddam was fifty balding overweight he always wore shortsleeved shirts and a tie his glasses had black frames he looked like a science teacher roddam said that hed come by some information he told them about the looting of the iraq museum in baghdad in and patchett interrupted and said that hed been there in the aftermath and roddam seemed interested later he would take patchett aside to talk with him but for now roddam simply filed this fact away and continued with his story he spoke of gold and statues and ancient seals kramer scoffed some joe radio the army rumor mill occasionally threw up tales of saddams hidden treasures or of gold bars buried in gardens tales usually originating with shadowy iraqis who were looking for dollars to grease palms but who would disappear into the night never to be seen again if someone were dumb enough to pay them anything tobias told kramer to shut his mouth and listen and kramer did by the time roddam had finished speaking they were convinced all of them even kramer because roddam had a quiet serious way about him they told him they were in and roddam left to arrange the details they were his creatures now he had forgotten what it was like to be drunk back home a sixpack would barely have helped him to get a buzz on but here cut off from alcohol for months his mouth always dry his body always warm it was as if he had knocked back a weeks worth of production from the coors brewery his head hurt the next day but he was still aware of the promise that theyd made he was just glad that they were going out in the stryker and not in some makeweight meat wagon even as he began to have doubts about what it was they were doing the night before with a couple of beers under his belt and not enough food in his belly hed been all gung ho like the others but now the reality of their situation was impacting upon him on a regular movement to contact mission the new kinder name for search and destroy the little fbcb screen behind the tcs hatch would start displaying red triangles once the enemy was located and that bitchs voice both lovely and appalling would kick in to announce that there was an enemy in the area but theyd be flying blind and alone on this one tobias treated it like a regular patrol he patted each of them down to make sure that they all had a camelbak of water gloves pads a clean oiled weapon and fresh batteries in the nods the night vision goggles theyd all carried out their own precombat inspection and they had the op order in their heads but whatever his flaws tobias was a stickler for ensuring that everybody knew his appointed task and had the proper equipment to carry it out roddam watched without speaking uncomfortable in his kevlar he was nervous and kept looking at his watch tobias checked the extra ammo for the cal strapped to the right side of the stryker it was hard to get to in a firefight but there was nowhere else to put it and better to have it out there than not to have it at all after the check they performed their own intimate motions touching medals crosses pictures of their families whatever routines had kept them alive in the past they made sure to maintain all soldiers were superstitious it came with the territory it was sunday evening and the sun was going down when they rolled out they all had good food in their bellies because the best food was always served on sundays but theyd skipped the coffee there was enough adrenaline coursing before a raid he remembered the sound his boots made on the dust the grains of sand compacting beneath the sole the solidity of the ground and the power of his legs and then the hollow echo from the floor of the stryker as he stepped to his seat such a simple act the placing of one foot before the other gone now all gone the warehouse was in aladhamiya the old quarter of baghdad a sunni stronghold they rolled down narrow alleyways custom built for ambushes kerosene lamps burning in the windows of the houses as they passed but not a single figure to be seen on the streets two blocks from the target all lights disappeared and there was only a half moon above them to gild the buildings with silver and differentiate their lineaments from the blackness above and below they advanced the last one hundred feet on foot there were two entrances to the warehouse which looked more modern than the buildings that surrounded it and was entirely dark inside one door to the south at the rear and the other on the western wall there were two small windows at ground level protected by bars and so thick with dust and grime that it was impossible to see through the glass the doors were reinforced steel but they blew the locks with c and came in hard and fast through the nods he saw figures moving weapons being raised and even as he fired he thought something about this is not right how can we have taken them by surprise if a fly lands in aladhamiya someone runs to tell a spider one down two he heard a cry of get some to his left a voice that he both recognized and did not recognize a voice transformed by the fury and confusion of combat a television blared its screen almost blindingly bright through the goggles and then the screen exploded and went dark he heard tobias shouting cease fire and it was over over almost as soon as it had begun they searched the building and found no other haji three were dead and one was dying tobias stood over him while the perimeter was secured and he thought that he heard words exchanged between them the squad flipped their goggles as flashlights bounced around the walls revealing crates and cardboard boxes and odd shapes wrapped in linen the dying hajis pupils were dilated and he was smiling and singing softly to himself hes high said tobias artane probably artane was an antipsychotic used to treat parkinsons disease but was popular with the younger insurgents in baghdad it was part of the pharmacopia available at places like the babb alsharq the eastern gate it left the user with a feeling of euphoria and a sense of invulnerability the hajis voice rose in prayer and then there was a single shot as tobias finished him off there would be no policing of the dead tonight no bagging of the bodies to be dropped off at the nearest police station they would stay where they had fallen the dead haji all wore black headbands the mark of shaheed of martyrs he mentioned it to tobias but tobias did not appear interested so what he said if they wanted to be martyrs then they got their wish tobias didnt understand they were waiting for us he wanted to say but they barely fought back if theyd wanted to they could have taken us in the street where we were vulnerable but they didnt they let us come to them and then they let us kill them roddam joined them speaking on a satellite phone minutes later they heard rumbles and saw lights and a buffalo armored vehicle appeared outside lord knew how theyd managed to get it down those streets but somehow they had it was closely followed by a single humvee he didnt recognize the four men who drove the vehicles later he would learn that they were national guardsmen two from calais the other two from somewhere in the ass end of the county more mainers more men who owed tobias a favor three never made it home the fourth was still trying to make his new arms work they rolled two pneumatic lifters out of the buffalo and started moving the heavier crates out of the warehouse tobias formed four of the squad into a line and they piled the smaller items in the hummer and the larger ones into the buffalo it took four hours in all that time nobody approached the warehouse and they were allowed to depart aladhamiya unhindered along the way they picked up two teams of snipers it wasnt unusual that was how the system worked snipers delta blackwater rangers seals marines would be attached to an infantry unit on a cordonandsearch mission when the unit left the snipers would stay and go to ground later a unit would return and pick up the snipers in this case he knew that the snipers mission had been arranged by roddam and only to provide cover for the raid on the warehouse because their squad had dropped off both teams earlier in the week there should have been gunfire he whispered to himself they should have been challenged it made no sense none of it made any sense but it didnt have to because they were rich even now the scale of what roddam managed to pull off astonished him but then roddam was smart he knew how to exploit the chaos of war and iraq was chaos squared what mattered was what was being brought into the country not what was being shipped out half of what they had seized at the warehouse was flown to canada sometimes via the us in otherwise empty planes returning to stock up on more overpriced equipment for the war effort larger items were shipped through jordan and onward by sea where necessary bribes were paid but not in the us or canada even without roddams cia contacts to smooth the way iraq was a goldmine for contractors equipment was needed yesterday at any price and nobody wanted to be accused of interfering with the war effort by quibbling over paperwork over the months that followed they all began to drift home some more intact then others they handed over their weapons filled out their medical questionnaires on palmpilots none of them fessing up to any psychological issues not then which made the army happy they all listened to the same speech from the battalion commander advising them not to hit their wives and girlfriends when they got home or words to that effect and about how the army would welcome them back with open arms a bunch of flowers and forty virgins from the southern states should they choose to return or words to that effect then kuwait then frankfurt passing over bangor maine on their way to mccord afb then back to bangor again and home all except him because by then his legs were ruined he took a different route a black hawk medevac to the cash in the green zone where he was stabilized before transfer to the trauma center at landstuhl regional medical center near frankfurt where they performed the amputations landstuhl to ramstein ramstein to andrews afb on a c starlifter men stacked like kindling in the center of the plane like captives on a slave ship six inches separating each man from the man above him the smell of blood and urine sickening even through the fog of medication the noise of the aircraft deafening despite the earplugs andrews to walter reed the hell of occupational therapy the attempts to fit prostheses ultimately abandoned because of the pain they caused him and hed had enough of pain then the return to maine and the arguments with tobias hed be looked after tobias told him all he had to do was keep his mouth shut but he wasnt concerned solely about himself there had been an agreement the money would be used to help their brothers and sistersinarms the ones who were injured the ones who had lost so much tobias said that had changed he wasnt going to police the consciences of others they could give what they wanted they all could it was complicated they had to be careful jandreau didnt understand and suddenly they started dying it was kramer who told him about the box kramer who discussed the nightmares he was having kramer who led him to delve into the dark corners of sumerian mythology but it wasnt until just after damien patchett died that he found out the truth about roddam roddam was dead he had been found in the iris office in concord one week after tobias and bacci returned home the first of the men involved in the aladhamiya raid to do so it had passed the rest of them by if any of them had even cared because roddam wasnt his real name it was nailon jack nailon hed fallen asleep on the couch in his office with a lit cigar in an ashtray on the couch arm and with too much whiskey in his system and on his clothes he had burned to death they said except that roddam or nailon or whatever his real name was didnt drink that was what he remembered from the beer night at the base when he and roddam had exchanged a couple of words after he had offered roddam a beer roddam was a diabetic and suffered from high blood pressure he couldnt drink alcohol and he didnt smoke he didnt know why that hadnt come up during the investigation into roddams death maybe like everything else about roddam his medical history was uncertain hidden but then he recalled some of the things that tobias had begun to say about roddam before tobias went home roddam was unreliable roddam wasnt one of us roddam was causing trouble in quebec roddam wanted a bigger cut as though he were preparing the way for roddams removal hed brought up roddams death after damiens funeral hed brought up lots of stuff because he was sad and he was drunk and he missed mel and he was sure going to miss damien if roddam wasnt in charge then who was tobias was classic nco material he didnt originate ideas he just put them into action and this was a complicated operation and tobias had told him to keep quiet to mind his own business because a man in a wheelchair was vulnerable and cripples had accidents all the time after that hed started carrying the gun under his chair the collector was now only steps behind herod he felt himself drawing closer to him and as he did so his fears increased herod was an unusual case the collector might even have viewed him simply as an interesting challenge like a hunter who finds that the animal he is pursuing has displayed unexpected depths of cunning had he not become increasingly concerned about the mans ultimate purpose and the imminence of its fulfillment herod had concealed himself well and the collector had only been able to find traces of him deals and threats made lives ruined and bodies left unburied items purchased or taken from the dead it was the nature of these artifacts occult arcane that had first drawn the collectors attention carefully he had tried to discern a pattern there seemed to be no distinct historical period to which herod was attracted and the items themselves were baffling in their variety and relative value the collector had only the peculiar sense that this was the reflection of a consciousness as though herod were furnishing a room in preparation for the arrival of an honored guest so that the visitor might be surrounded by treasures and curios that were familiar or of interest to him or preparing a museum display which would only come together for the viewer when the main exhibit was finally put in place the collector had come close to confronting herod on a number of occasions but the man had always slipped away it was as though he had been forewarned about the collectors approach and had found ways to avoid him even if it meant sacrificing an item that he desired for the collector had made certain to bait his traps well the collector had already decided to dispose of herod some years before herod had killed a child a young boy whose father had reneged on a deal and in the collectors mind herod had damned himself by that action it was one of herods apparent peculiarities that he seemed to regard himself and those with whom he dealt as being bound by some twisted notion of honor the rules of which appeared to be set by herod and herod alone but if the collector had experienced any doubts about the legitimacy of killing herod they had been swept away when he began to learn of herods inquiries into the treasures looted from the iraq museum that had given the collector his first real inkling of what was being sought he had heard rumors about the box but had disregarded them there were so many such tales going right back to the original legend of pandora yet this one was different because herod was interested in it and herod did not embark on fruitless searches herod had an end in sight and everything that he did served it herod had been in contact with rochman in paris anxious to establish the source of the seals that he had acquired rochman had proved uncooperative for herod did not have the funds necessary to engage in a serious bid for the items even had herod been interested in purchasing them which he was not herod in turn had seemed oddly reluctant to threaten rochman in order to force the information from him the collector had noted that herod used violence only against the weak like a playground bully the house of rochman was well established and had influence if herod crossed it he would risk alienating a clique of unscrupulous and wealthy dealers who would at best ostracize him or as was more likely move against him the collector did not doubt that anyone getting into a conflict with herod would suffer for it along the way but a battle with men seeking to protect a billion dollar industry dependent on the secret movement of stolen antiquities could only end with herods annihilation so herod had backed off biding his time now a number of seals had appeared in a town in maine for as soon as rojas began seeking ways to turn gold and jewels into hard cash rumors had spread it was not only the dealers and herod who would be drawn by them the federal government was already taking an interest for rochman had begun to talk in an effort to save himself and his business the seals in his possession had come from locker in the basement of the iraq museum as had the seals currently available for sale in maine rochmans seals were a down payment for his advice on valuations and for his help in sourcing buyers in time he would give all that he knew to the investigators and it would only be a matter of days before they would start to close in on all involved the collector knew of dr aldaini and he believed that the iraqi was ultimately seeking the box even as he set about recovering the other treasures lost in the collector had made inquiries and had learned that aldaini was now on his way to the us he would fly into boston and be taken straight from there to a disused motel in the town of langdon maine the men who were transporting the stolen artifacts from the motel had been careless a pair of small alabaster figures had been found lying in the long grass and had quickly been identified as part of a hoard discovered at tell es sawwan on the left bank of the tigris in and subsequently looted from the iraq museum the body of a man had also been discovered at the motel sealed into a room from the inside dead from a selfinflicted gunshot wound having first apparently fired at some unknown threat the body had been discovered by the detective charlie parker there were no coincidences the collector knew not where parker was concerned he was part of something that he did not understand that in truth the collector did not fully understand either now once again he and parker were circling the same quarry like twin moons orbiting a dark unknown planet the collector made a telephone call to his lawyer he wanted to know where parker was his lawyer an ancient man who disdained computers and cell phones and most of the significant technical innovations of recent years made a call in turn to a gentleman who specialized in matters of triangulation and parkers cell phone was traced to a motel near bucksport bucksport was an hour away the collector began to drive herod stood by his car and gazed upon the rojas warehouse lights burned on both floors and he could see figures moving behind glass on the lower level there were vehicles parked in the front lot rojas brothers trucks a couple of cars and a white suv herod needed his medication and in serious doses the pain had grown worse as the day proceeded and now he wanted all of this to be over with so that he could rest for a while there came a prickling at the base of his neck at first he barely noticed it against the shrillness of his agony it was like trying to pick out a melody from the cacophony of an orchestra tuning its instruments the wound on his mouth throbbed in the warm night air and the insects were feeding on him i reek of decay he thought were i to lie down and wait for death to take my breath they would plant their eggs in my flesh before i passed over there might even be some relief in it he imagined the maggots emerging from the eggs and feasting on his tumors consuming the rotting tissue and leaving the rest to regenerate except that there was no good flesh left and so they would devour him entirely he might have embraced such an end once upon a time for at least it would have been faster and more natural than the manner in which his body was cannibalizing itself instead he had found another outlet for his pain if this was a visitation from the divine a punishment for his sins for herod had sinned and taken joy in his transgressions then herod would inflict punishment on others in turn the captain had given him the means had endowed him with a purpose beyond the simple infliction of hurt in revenge for his own torments the captain had promised him that the world would mourn because of herod before he was pulled back from the darkness back perhaps from one hell of anothers making to the hell of his bodys own capacities the captain had flashed images in his mind the image of a black angel hidden behind a wall a presence trapped within it bodies slowly fading but never dying each with something of the captain within itself and the box the captain had shown him the box but by then it was already missing and so the search had commenced the tingling continued he rubbed at his neck expecting to feel a bloodgorged creature pop beneath his fingers but there was nothing an open field lay between herod and the warehouse at its closest border was a pool of standing water cloudy with bugs herod drew closer to it until he could stare at his reflection his own and that of another behind him stood a tall scarecrow in a black suit wearing a black top hat with a busted crown on its head its face was a sack in which two eyeholes had been crudely cut and it had no mouth the scarecrow was unsupported there was no wooden cross upon which it might rest the captain had returned vernon and pritchard lay on a slight rise their position concealed by briars and lowhanging branches they had a clear line of sight to the houses adjoining the rojas warehouse both were entirely still even up close they seemed barely to be breathing pritchards right eye was close to the night sight of the m the rifle was accurate up to a thousand yards and pritchard was barely eight hundred yards distant from the targets beside him vernon tracked doors and windows through an atn night spirit monocular vernon and pritchard were elite marine scout snipers or hogs in the language of their trade hunters of gunmen they were veterans of the sniper battles in baghdad a largely hidden conflict that had escalated after the loss of two marine sniper teams a total of ten men lost to the hajis they had played cat and mouse games with the near mythical juba an anonymous sniper variously believed to be a chechen or even a collective name for a cell of snipers armed with iraqiproduced tabuk rifles a kalashnikov variant juba was disciplined waiting for soldiers to stand up in or dismount from vehicles looking for the gaps in the body armor never firing more than one shot before melting away vernon and pritchard differed on whether or not juba was one man or many pritchard the better shot of the two inclined to the former view based on jubas preference for shots in the threehundredyard range and his disinclination to fire more than once even when baited vernon disagreed on the basis that while the tabuk was reliable up to about nine hundred yards it was best at three hundred so the juba snipers using tabuks were limited by their equipment vernon had also attributed kills using dragunovs and an izhmash to juba suggesting multiple snipers kills that pritchard preferred to discount in the end both men had been targeted by juba whether one or many like their fellow soldiers they had become adept at cutting squares zigzagging ducking moving back and forth and bobbing their heads in order to provide a more difficult target to hit pritchard called it the battlefield boogie vernon the jihad jitterbug what was odd was that neither man could dance to save his life on a regular dance floor but threatened by an expert killer they had moved like gene kelly and fred astaire vernon and pritchard had known the four men from echo company who had died in ramadi in three of them had been shot in the head a fourth virtually torn apart by bullets in addition one marines throat had been slit the attack had happened in broad daylight within eight hundred yards of the command post later they learned that a fourman hit team had probably been responsible and that the marines had been targeted for some time but the killings had marked the beginning of vernon and pritchards disillusionment with the nature of the conflict in iraq only one of the dead men had been a trained sniper the others had been grunts and that wasnt the way the system was supposed to work no fewer than two trained snipers on any team that was the golden rule when the sixman sniper team of the reserve rd battalion died in hadithah a year later and the remaining snipers were forced to operate according to ever more restrictive rules of engagement vernon and pritchard decided that the marines could go screw themselves subsequently aided by an explosion that had detached the retina in vernons right eye leading to permanent vision loss and a ticket home but by then they had already met tobias and they had been present on the night that the warehouse was raided they were team covering the southern approaches twizell and greenham were team covering the north nobody had questioned the purpose of the mission it was in the nature of sniper units that they planned and executed their own operations and they had announced their insertion into the area days earlier so that units on patrol could work around them only tobias and roddam knew exactly where they would be in the end they had not been required to fire a single shot on the night of the raid which had disappointed them pritchard had left the military shortly after vernon was shipped home which was how he and vernon now came to be lying in the undergrowth ready to kill mexicans instead of hajis both men were quiet patient reclusive as individuals of their calling needed to be they were without remorse when asked if he experienced regret at the lives that he took pritchard would reply that all he ever felt was the recoil this was not entirely true killing gave him a rush that was better than sex yet he was also a moral and courageous man who believed that his vocation was noble and he was intelligent enough to recognize the tension implicit in the desire to take lives in a moral fashion while simultaneously experiencing pleasure in the performance of the act he and vernon wore homemade ghillie suits with holes in the back for ventilation they had doused themselves with mud and water from a nearby creek and as it was a moonlit night their hats bore netting to break up the shape of the human face they were not using laser range finders instead both men automatically performed all of the necessary calculations in their heads range angle to the targets air density wind speed and direction humidity even adding in the temperature of the propellant in the cartridge for a cartridge that is twenty degrees warmer than another will strike a target twenty inches higher at a thousand meters in the past they had used data books calculators loaded with ballistics software and data tables glued to rifle stocks now they knew such details by heart the slant angle was slightly downhill pritchard figured that hed be aiming fifteen feet above the target and to the left to allow for bullet drop all was set the only problem was twizell and greenham they werent in position pritchard had no idea where they were both he and vernon continued to be troubled by the fact that tobias had sent the others somewhere in advance but hadnt bothered to run it by them first vernon had been a staff sergeant an e the highest ranking of the four snipers and he and tobias still butted heads when it came to operational matters he and pritchard should have been consulted now they were down a team and that wasnt good the van was parked in a copse some four hundred feet from the back of the rojas warehouse the drivers door was open tobias concealed by a black ski mask and black fatigues was scanning the warehouse and surrounding buildings through a pair of night vision lenses he started as a noise came from nearby and then there was a low whistle and a figure emerged from the bushes before him four plus rojas said mallak three with mps one with a bigass pump action mossberg roadblocker most likely two glock nines in shoulder rigs one with the shotgun the other with the mp nearest the door no alcohol that i can see tv is on but not too loud remains of food on the table tobias nodded that was good men were more sluggish after food what about rojas theres a stairway against the western wall enclosed no turns ends at a steel door slightly open my guess is that it can be sealed at the first sign of trouble windows are thickened glass on the first floor so no reason to think rojass level is any different theres no outside stairwell but there is a weightactivated ladder on the southern exterior wall accessible from the window above surrounding houses two families at a and b said mallak using his fingers to indicate the buildings in question two female juveniles one adult female two adult males in a one glock belt two adult females one male juvenile one adult male in b one glock belt three males in c two aks one glock shoulder vernon and pritchard have the intel but were still a team down tobias took one more look at the target through the lenses then tossed them on the drivers seat they could wait for greenham and twizell or proceed the longer they stayed in position though the more likely it was that they would be discovered he leaned over the seat and looked into the interior of the van bacci gazed back at him his mask rolled up to his forehead in the heat of the van his face damp with sweat all right said tobias as mallak slouched against the side of the van listen up herod was unarmed his gun was in the car he carried only a pair of manila envelopes the first contained a piece of paper on which a figure was typed this represented the sum of money that herod was prepared to transfer to any account nominated by rojas in return for information on how and from whom he had obtained the seals if rojas refused to provide such information then herod knew where rojass american mistress lived along with rojass illegitimate fiveyearold son herod would take them both if necessary he would kill the woman first to indicate his seriousness to rojas but he did not believe that such action would be required especially not after rojas looked in the second envelope containing photographs of those who had crossed herod in the past for herod had a particular way with women his understanding of their bodies might even have made him a gifted lover but herod was a sexless being neither was he cruel pain and suffering were for him a means to an end and he gained no particular pleasure from their infliction herod was not without empathy and his own sufferings had made him reluctant to prolong the pain of others for this reason he hoped that rojas would take the money he looked again at the captains reflection he felt no unease he liked being in the captains presence he wondered if the captain would come with him to the rojas warehouse he was preparing to find out when on the surface of the pond the captain moved his fingers were made from twigs and they rustled slightly as he raised his hand and placed it on the shoulder of herods reflection herod himself shivered involuntarily at the pressure and the chill of the captains touch feeling it as surely as he felt the warmth of the night air and the biting of the insects but he stayed as he was and together they kept watch on the building before them one side of the first floor of the rojas warehouse was lined from floor to ceiling with crates of rojas brothers fuego sagrado hot sauce if anyone took the trouble to inquire the importation and distribution of the sauce was the reason for the warehouses existence and one of the means whereby antonio rojas made his living rojas had lost count of the number of times the trucks transporting the sauce had been searched by local and federal law enforcement but he didnt mind it distracted them from all of the other trucks and cars transporting far more valuable cargo although if rojas were to be honest he made a very respectable living from the sauce too even if there were those on the other side of the border who regarded the name and the packaging as almost blasphemous it had a distinctive label a red fiery cross on a jet black background and it was marketed as a premium product to gourmet food stores and the better mexican restaurants across new england the markup was nearly as high as on pot or cocaine and rojas was careful to declare all income derived from it to the irs with the help of a creative accountant it appeared as though antonio rojas was making a reasonable if not excessive profit as a purveyor of quality hot sauce it was the sound of one of those hot sauce bottles breaking that alerted rojas he looked up from the papers on his desk and his hand drifted to the gun that was never far away the door to his living quarters was slightly ajar otherwise the insulation on the floor would have masked all the noises from below glass shattering a chair scraping something heavy yet soft falling to the floor rojas stood and made a lunge for the door but he was seconds too late the muzzle of a weapon was thrust through the opening and there was a burst of muffled gunfire that took him across the thighs almost cutting his legs from his torso he collapsed as the door opened fully but even as he fell he had time to squeeze off two shots that hit the darkgarbed figure in the chest the kevlar vest absorbed the impact rocking the man on his heels rojass third shot was higher and a messy splash of blood burst forth from the back of the mans head the aftermath of a pebble dropped in a red pool rojas barely had time to register it before there was more gunfire and he felt the hot punches as the shots tore through his back he lay unmoving and yet he did not die his eyes took in the shiny black boots that surrounded him and registered some of the words that he heard shoot question no choice and dead hes dead rojas chuckled wetly more footsteps receding then drawing nearer once again black knees by his face fingers in his hair raising his head the bag of seals held in gloved hands the display stand that he had been making for them tossed aside splintering on the tiled floor pink lips moving in the gap of the mask white teeth clean and even where are the rest of them no comprendo a knife appeared i can still hurt you no you cant said rojas and he smiled as he died revealing twin rows of ancient gold and precious stones newly embedded in his teeth a burst of gunfire was carried from the rojas warehouse to the hide site but it was not followed by a second shit said vernon hed known that they were unlikely to get in and out of the warehouse entirely without trouble but he had been hoping for the best okay ready up slowly he moved the monocular across the three houses designated curly larry and moe moe doorway bearing right he said picking out the figure of a man carrying an ak i see him breathe exhale take up trigger slack exhale pressure fire vernon watched as the target threw his hands in the air the final wave then fell hit he said curly door range seven hundred fifty yards zero wind no correction come up seven and two this time the gunman was staying inside using the frame of the door for cover as he tried to figure out where the shot had come from shooter up spotter up send it pritchard fired again there was a spray of wood chips from the door and the target ducked back inside uh miss i think said vernon it should keep him pinned though momentarily he shifted his sight to the rojas warehouse from which two of their men were emerging carrying a third between them okay theyre on the move but theyve got a casualty lets there was a burst of white flame from the nearest right side window of curly curly door pritchard fired and vernon saw the shooter leap into the air as the shot took him in the head causing his legs to spasm hit said vernon there was more firing from moe vernon shifted the monocular just in time to see a second man of the assault team fall to the ground ah hell said vernon second man down pritchard adjusted himself as quickly as possible and began pumping shots through the window of the house in a spray and pray concerned only with providing cover while the injured were taken to safety but now there were shouts and lights were going on in the other houses vernon could see the last man on his feet he thought it might be tobias carry one of his fallen team back to the van in a firemans lift and lay him as gently as possible on the floor he then went back for the second man lets go said pritchard they ran to where a pair of harleys were parked by the side of a rutted track on the ground behind him they left a muddied denim jacket taken from a biker in canada a drug mule targeted by vernon and pritchard and left for dead at lacbaker it was a crude piece of framing but they didnt think the mexicans would be concerned with the niceties of a formal investigation they would want vengeance and the jacket combined with the roar of the departing bikes might be enough to throw them off the scent for a couple of days tobias got behind the wheel of the van and pulled out in his side mirrors the rojas warehouse was a dark mass against the night sky the dancing shadows of approaching men visible at either side he was the only one left alive mallak had died at the warehouse and bacci had taken a bullet to the base of his neck as they carried mallaks body away it was a mess that could have been avoided if greenham and twizell had been there but hed made the call and hed have to live with it maybe if fucking pritchard had been faster off the mark the explosion wasnt loud the noise dampened by the thick brick walls of the old building but the purpose of the thermite device twentyfive percent aluminum to seventyfive percent iron oxide was not to blow apart the warehouse itself but to burn everything within leaving the minimum of evidence it would also serve to distract his pursuers with mallak and bacci dead there was no one left to provide covering fire so it would be a matter of hitting the highway and keeping his foot down all the way vernon and pritchard would take their own route to the rendezvous but tobias would have words with them when next they met if only to preempt the snipers inevitable anger there was a message on his phone he listened as he drove and learned that something had gone wrong in bangor greenham and twizell had not reported back and it had to be presumed that the jandreau situation was unresolved the gps tracking device in the detectives car was no longer responding and the detective was still alive it was a mess but at least he now had the missing seals he also had in his pocket as many of rojass teeth as he could knock from his mouth in the time available it was time to get rid of what they had make as much money as they could as quickly as possible and then disappear he did not notice herods car its lights extinguished idling on a side road moments later herod was following the van it was quiet in the motel room mel and bobby sat together on one bed she holding him and stroking his face as though rewarding him for the fact that he had unburdened himself at last of all that he knew angel was by the window watching the lot i sat on the second bed and tried to take in all that i had learned tobias and his crew were smuggling antiquities but if bobby was to be believed theyd brought something else over with them something that was never meant to be discovered and never meant to be opened it had been part of the bait like a dose of poison contained in meat i wanted to believe that jandreau was wrong that it was guilt and stress that was leading these men to take their lives and the lives of others including brett harlans wife and foster jandreau for bobby confirmed that he had approached his cousin about his concerns and that he believed fosters unofficial inquiries had led to his murder it was just a question of who had pulled the trigger my money was on tobias initially but bobby was less sure he had warned his cousin about joel tobias and he couldnt see foster agreeing to meet up with him in the darkened lot of a ruined bar with no witnesses it was then that he told me of his sessions with carrie saunders and of how he had discussed some of his concerns with her carrie saunders it wasnt tobias alone who connected all of these men to one another it was saunders she had been at abu ghraib as had the mysterious roddam or nailon shed been in contact with all of the dead men at one point or another and had a reason to move between them jandreau wouldnt have agreed to meet a potentially dangerous exmilitary man like tobias in a deserted lot but he might have agreed to meet a woman i called gordon walsh and i told him everything that i knew leaving out only tobias tobias was mine he said that hed pick up saunders himself and see what came of it it was louis slouched low in the lexus so that he could watch the approaches to the room who spotted him the raggedy figure strolled across the parking lot a cigarette dangling from his right hand his left empty he wore a black coat over a black suit his shirt wrinkled and open at the neck the jacket and pants bearing the marks of cheap cloth ill used his hair was slicked back from his skull and too long at the back hanging in greasy strands over his collar he seemed simply to have materialized as though atoms had been pulled from the air their constituent parts altered as he reconstructed himself in this place louis had been watching the mirrors as well as the expanse of motel visible through the windshield he should have seen him coming but he had not and louis knew him for who and for what he was this was the collector the man might have been dressed in thrift store clothes his appearance that of one who has been poorly served by life and has chosen to respond in kind but it was all a veneer louis had met dangerous men before and some had died at his hand but the man now walking toward the door to exuded menace the way other people sweated from their pores louis could almost smell it off him as he slipped from the car and moved in that and something more a hint of burnt offerings of blood and charnel houses though louiss approach was silent the collector raised his hands without turning while louis was still fifteen feet away the cigarette had burned down as far as the yellowed skin on the collectors fingers but if it hurt him then he did not show it you can drop that if its bothering you said louis the collector let the cigarette slip from its fingers a shame there was another pull left on it theyll kill you so ive been told maybe ill kill you first and we havent even been formally introduced although i do feel that i know you you might say that ive watched you from afar you and your partner ive admired your work especially since you appear to have developed a conscience i guess i should be flattered huh no you should simply be grateful that i havent had cause to come after you you were on the verge of damnation for a time now you are making recompense for your sins if you continue on that path you might yet be saved are you saved if you are im not sure i want to be keeping that kind of company the collector expelled a breath through his nose the closest he had come to laughter in an eternity no i exist between salvation and damnation suspended if you will a dangling man kneel said louis put your hands on your head and keep them there the collector did as he was told louis advanced on him quickly placed the gun to his head and knocked hard on the door up close the smell of nicotine made his eyes water but it served to mask the other smells me said louis i got company an old friend of yours the door opened and the collector looked up at me he sat in a chair by the door louis had frisked him but the collector was unarmed he examined the no smoking sign by the television frowning as he knitted his fingers across his stomach bobby jandreau stared at him the way one might stare upon waking at a spider suspended above ones face mel had retreated and was sitting in a corner behind angel her eyes fixed on the stranger waiting for him to pounce why are you here i asked i came looking for you it seems that we are working toward similar ends which would be a thin finger the nail the color of rust extended itself and pointed to jandreau let me guess the story so far said the collector soldiers treasure a falling out among thieves jandreau looked as though he might have been about to dispute the use of the word thieves but the collector turned his mocking gaze in the direction of his finger and jandreau remained silent except they didnt know what they were stealing the collector continued they were indiscriminate they took all that they could without wondering why it had been made so easy for them but you paid a high price for it didnt you mr jandreau youre all paying a high price for your sins jandreau started how do you know my name names are my business there was a box was there not a gold box they left it for you to find it was probably in a lead receptacle for they couldnt be too careful but they left it where it wouldnt be ignored tell me mr jandreau im right am i not jandreau just nodded i want the box said the collector thats why im here for your collection i said i thought someone had to die before you got to claim one of their possessions oh someone will die if i have my way and my collection will increase greatly as a consequence but the box will not be part of it it does not belong to me it does not belong to anyone it is dangerous someone is looking for it a man named herod and it is essential that he not be allowed to find it if he does he will open it he has the patience and the skill the one with him has the knowledge whats in it asked angel three entities said the collector simply old demons if you prefer the box is the latest in a series of attempts to contain them but its construction was flawed by the vanity of its creator who forgot that he was forging a prison gold is such soft metal over the years gaps appeared something of what was contained inside found a way to reach out to poison the minds of those who came into contact with it the lead box was an effort to counteract that threat crude but effective like the dull paint used to cover the gold it also served to conceal what was inside why didnt they just dump it in the ocean or bury it somewhere because the only thing worse than knowing where it might be is not knowing the box was watched it had always been watched the knowledge of it transferred from one generation to the next in the end it was hidden away among a jumble of worthless artifacts in a museum basement in baghdad and then the war came and the museum was looted the box disappeared along with much else that was of value but somehow an understanding of its nature however incomplete reached those who had seized it it may even have been that they knew exactly what they had from the moment it appeared for looting is a relative term the items stolen from the iraq museum were carefully chosen for the most part do you know that seventeen thousand items were stolen from the museum over those april days that four hundred and fifty of four hundred and fiftyone cases were emptied but only twentyeight of those cases were broken the rest were simply opened which means that those who stole from them had keys astonishing dont you think one of the greatest museum thefts in history one of the greatest sackings since the time of the mongols and it may have been an inside job but no matter when mr jandreau and his friends came looking for treasure the box was passed on to them perhaps in the hope that they would do exactly what they did transport it back to this country the country of the enemy where it would be opened now you know what it is in return tell me where to find it his eyes scanned every face in the room as though the knowledge that he sought might somehow be read in them before he fixed on mine why should we trust you i said you manipulate truth for your own ends youre just a killer nothing more a serial slayer slaughtering under some divine flag of convenience a light flared in the collectors eyes like twin flares being ignited in an abyss no i am no mere killer i am an instrument of the divine i am gods murderer not all of his work is beautiful he looked disgusted both at me and i believed at some level kept hidden even from his own conscience at himself you must set aside your qualms just as i must set aside mine he said after a moment if i trouble you then you disturb me i dislike being near you you are part of a plan of which i have no knowledge you are bound for a reckoning that will be the death of you and of all who stand alongside you your days are numbered and i do not wish to be close to you when you fall he raised his palms to me and there was a plea in his voice so let us do this one thing for as bad as you may believe me to be the man named herod is worse and he is himself being shadowed by an entity one that he believes he understands one that will have promised him a reward for his service it has many names but he will know it by only one the one that it gave him when first it found a way to worm itself into his consciousness and what do you call it i asked i call it nothing but what it is said the collector it is the darkness evil incarnate it is the one who waits behind the glass herod put his hands beneath the faucet and let the flow of water wash the blood away he watched the patterns that it made the crimson vortex that swirled against the stainless steel like the arms of a distant nebula spiraling into collapse a bead of sweat dripped from his nose and was lost he closed his eyes his fingers hurt and his head ached but at least it was pain of a different kind the pain of hard labor torturing another human being was a wearying business he looked up at his reflection and saw in the glass the man slumped in the chair his hands bound behind his back herod had removed the rag from his mouth so that he could hear what he had to say he had not bothered to replace it when the man had finished talking there was no need he barely had the strength to breathe and soon even that would be gone behind the slouched man stood another figure its hands resting lightly on the back of the chair once again the captain had taken the form of the little girl in the blue dress her hair long and worn in braids that hung between her breasts as before the girl could not have been more than nine or ten but her breasts were surprisingly well developed obscenely so thought herod her face was startlingly pale but unfinished her eyes and mouth were black ovals blurred at the edges as though a dirty eraser had smeared the marks made by a thick pencil she stood very still her head almost on a level with that of the seated man the captain was waiting for joel tobias to die it would not have been true to say that herod was an immoral man neither was he amoral for her admitted the distinction between moral and immoral behavior and was conscious of the necessity for fairness and honesty in all of his dealings he required it of others and demanded it of himself but there existed in herod an emptiness like the hollow at the center of certain fruits once the pit has been removed speeding their decay and out of that emptiness came the capacity for certain types of behavior he had taken no pleasure in hurting the man who was now dying on the chair and as soon as herod had learned all that he wished to know he had ceased working on the interior of the mans body although the damage that had been inflicted was so great that the suffering had continued despite the cessation of violent invasive actions now as the last of the blood was washed away herod felt compelled to bring those sufferings to a close mr tobias he said i believe weve reached the end he picked up his gun from beside the sink and prepared to turn away from the glass as he was about to do so the figure of the girl moved she shifted position so that she was slightly to his right one filthy hand reached out and stroked tobiass face tobias opened his eyes at the touch he looked confused he could feel fingers on his skin and yet he could see nothing the girl leaned closer from out of the dark orb of her mouth a tongue appeared long and thick and lapped at the blood around the dying mans mouth now he tried to turn his head away but the girl responded to the movement clinging to his clothing her legs between his her body pressing against him something in the way that tobiass position had changed allowed him to see his own reflection in the smoked glass of an oven door his reflection and the nature of the being that was forcing itself upon him he whimpered in fear herod walked over to the chair placed the gun against tobiass head and pulled the trigger the captain disappeared and all movement ceased herod took a step away he was aware of the captains presence somewhere nearby he felt his rage he risked a glance at the oven door but could see nothing it was not necessary he said to the listening dark he had suffered enough enough enough for whom for him yes but for the captain there could never be sufficient suffering herods shoulders sank with no other option he was compelled to look again at the window the captain was directly behind him but no longer was he a little girl instead he was a sexless form in a long gray coat his face was a blur a constantly altering series of visages and in them herod saw everyone for whom he had ever cared his mother and his sister now gone his grandmother adored and long buried friends and lovers living and dead each of them was in agony their faces contorted in torment and despair and finally herods face appeared among them and he understood this was how it could be cross the captain again and this was what would come to pass the captain departed leaving herod alone with the body he restored the gun to the holster beneath his shoulder and took one last look at the dead man he wondered how long it would be before his friends discovered him or how many of them might even be left it hardly mattered herod now knew who had the box but he had to move fast the captain had warned him the collector was coming herod had heard stories of the collector long before the mans pursuit of him had commenced of the strange tattered individual who believed himself to be a harvester of souls and hoarded souvenirs of his victims from the captain he had learned yet more the collector would want the box for himself that was what the captain said and herod believed him herod had been careful to hide himself well operating under a variety of aliases using shell companies and lawyers untroubled by scruples and shadowy transporters who cared little for paperwork and customs documents as long as the money was right but the uniqueness of some of his purchases and the inquiries he had made in the course of his searches however discreet had inevitably drawn the collectors interest to him now it was crucial that he remain at one remove from him for it would take time to figure out the intricacies of the boxs locks once the box was opened there would be nothing that the collector or anyone else could do the captains triumph would be herods revenge and he could die at last and claim his reward in the next world herod left the house walking past the bodies of pritchard and vernon where they lay in the yard and got into his car there were sirens in the distance moving closer as he put the key in the ignition he heard the sound of banging from the trunk until it was lost in the roar of the engine when karen emory was a little girl and had only just begun sleeping in her own room albeit with the door open and her mothers bedroom in clear view a man had broken into their house shortly after midnight karen had woken to find the intruder standing in the corner of her bedroom wreathed in darkness watching her he was completely silent she could not even hear his breathing yet his presence had pulled her from her rest a primitive awareness that all was not as it should be and a threat was near she had been unable to scream as she looked at him so terrified was she decades later she could still recall the dryness in her mouth the asthmatic sound that her breath had made as she tried to summon help the sense that some great weight was holding her down on the bed preventing her from moving they were trapped in a stasis these two strangers one unmoving one incapable of movement suddenly the man had shifted his weight as though preparing to leap at her his gloved hands reaching for her and the spell was broken she had screamed then so loudly that for days after her throat hurt and the intruder had bolted for the stairs her mother came out of her bedroom in time to see a figure open the front door and disappear after checking on her daughter she called cars descended on the neighborhood and a search began eventually a drifter named clarence buttle was picked up as he hid in an alleyway behind a dumpster karen had told the policemen that she didnt get a good look at the man in her room and couldnt recall anything about him her mother too claimed only to have seen the mans back in the darkness and had been too tired and shocked to notice anything that might have distinguished it from any number of other backs that she had seen the intruder had entered their home through a window but had left no prints buttle protested his innocence loudly claiming that he had only hidden in the alley because he was frightened of the police and didnt want to be blamed for something that he hadnt done he spoke like a child and seemed reluctant to meet the eyes of the detectives who questioned him they kept him for twentyfour hours he did not ask to see a lawyer as he had not been charged with the commission of any crime he gave them his name and told them that he was originally from montgomery alabama but had been on the road for almost twelve years he wasnt sure about his age but he thought he might have been thirtythree like our lord jesus christ during the period of his incarceration a piece of cloth was found on a nail by karens window it matched perfectly a hole in clarence buttles coat he was charged with forcible entry trespass and possession of a deadly weapon a shiv found tucked into the lining of his coat he was taken to the county jail to await trial and was still there when his fingerprints produced an afis match a year earlier a nineyearold girl named franny keaton had been abducted from her parents home in winnetka illinois after a weeklong search her body was found in a storm drain she had been strangled but there was no sign of sexual assault although the girls clothing had been removed the fingerprint that matched clarence buttles had come from the left eye of the doll found alongside franny keatons body when asked about winnetka clarence buttle had smiled slyly and said ive been a bad bad boy as the years went by karen emory would still wake at least once every month convinced that clarence buttle that bad bad boy had come back to take her down to a storm drain and ask her to play with him but now other nightmares had taken the place of those concerning clarence buttle she had heard the voices whispering again in their strange tongue but this time she believed that they were not trying to communicate with her in fact she sensed their complete disregard even contempt for her instead they were anticipating the arrival of another one who would respond to their entreaties they had been waiting a long time and they were growing impatient this time in her dream she saw joel entering the basement stepping into the darkness and the voices rose in a crescendo of welcome but joel was not here before he had departed he had put a small box on the pillow beside her i was going to keep them for your birthday he said then i thought why wait it was an apology she supposed an apology for striking her and hurting her she had opened the box the earrings were dull gold but intricately carved and so delicate that they seemed more like lace than metal she knew before she touched them that they were old old and valuable where did you get them she asked and as soon as the words were out of her mouth she knew that she had reacted wrongly that her tone was doubtful and not filled with the wonder and gratitude joel had anticipated she thought that he might snatch the box away from her or explode into another fit of rage but instead he just looked hurt theyre a gift he said i thought youd like them i do she said her voice trembling she reached out and lifted them from the box they were heavier than she had anticipated theyre beautiful she smiled trying to rescue the situation theyre really beautiful thank you he nodded well okay then he said he watched as she put them on but his response as she turned her head to let them catch the sunlight filtering through the drapes was distracted she had disappointed him worse she felt that by her actions she had confirmed a suspicion he had of her when she was sure that he was gone she took off the earrings and put them back in the box then pulled the sheet over her head and prayed for sleep to come she so wanted to rest and not to dream eventually she took half an ambien and sleep came and with it the voices it was late afternoon when she woke her head felt fuzzy and she was disoriented she was about to call out for joel and as she recalled his absence she wished even amid their troubles that she was not alone and that he was near he said that he would be gone overnight perhaps even for two nights he had promised to let her know a big deal was about to come good for him he said and they could look for a better place they might even head off somewhere for a while somewhere pretty and quiet she told him that shed like to go away with him but she was happy too just to stay where they were shed be happy anywhere she said as long as he was beside her and as long as he was content tobias said that that was one of the reasons why he liked her so much because she didnt go asking for expensive things because she had simple tastes but that wasnt what she had meant at all and it annoyed her that hed misunderstood her he had patronized her and she hated being patronized just as she hated the stupid secrets he now kept in his basement and the fact that he wasnt telling her everything about the trips he took in his truck and the goods that he delivered and then there were the earrings she rolled over on the bed and opened the box they were beautiful antique too no older even than that antiques were like furniture or jewelry from the s or so she had always thought these earrings though were ancient she could almost feel their age when she had first touched them she got up and ran a bath the day was as good as gone and she decided that she wasnt going to bother getting dressed she would spend the evening in her robe watch some tv and order a pizza with joel absent she rolled a joint from the little stash of pot that she kept hidden in her personal drawer and smoked it in the tub joel didnt approve of drugs and although he had never tried to forbid her from smoking joints he had made it clear that he didnt want to know about it if she did for that reason she only tended to smoke when he wasnt around or when she was with friends after the bath and the joint she felt better than she had in a long time she looked at the earrings again and decided to try them on she piled her hair up on her head wrapped herself in a clean white sheet then stood in front of the mirror just to get a sense of how she might have looked in another time shed felt kind of silly doing it but she had to admit that she appeared elegant the earrings gleaming in the lamplight fragments of yellow light falling like dust motes upon her face there was no way that joel could afford a gift like those earrings she knew not unless he really was lying even more than she suspected about how much he was earning as a truck driver the only conclusion to be drawn was that he was involved in something illegal and the earrings were part of it an exchange perhaps or a purchase with some of the proceeds it took away some from the beauty of them karen had never stolen anything in her life not even a piece of candy or some cheap cosmetics the standard targets for the petty thieves among her high school friends when she was growing up at the diner she never took more than was permitted her under her food allowance it was more than generous anyway and she saw no reason to be greedy even though there were one or two other waitresses who used the allowance as an excuse to take food home and gorge themselves their boyfriends and probably anyone else who happened to be dropping by their place too but the earrings were so beautiful she had never been given anything so lovely so old so valuable now that they were on she did not want to take them off if he could convince her that he had come by them honestly she would keep them but equally she would know if he was lying if he did decide to lie to her about them their relationship would be under real threat she had already decided to forgive him for striking her again because she loved him but it was time for him to be honest with her and maybe with himself too she sat on the bed and turned on the tv what the hell she thought and rolled a second joint she watched a movie some dumb comedy shed seen before but that seemed far funnier now that she was a little high another movie followed an action one this time but she was starting to drowse her eyes closed she heard herself snoring and it woke her up she lay down and rested her head on the pillow the voices came again but this time she had the peculiar sensation that this dream and her nightmares about clarence buttle had become conflated because in the dream she sensed a presence nearby no not in the dream in the house her eyes opened joel she called thinking that he might have come back earlier than expected is that you there was no reply but she sensed that her words had caused a reaction elsewhere in the house stillness where there had formerly been movement silence where there had been sound she sat up her nostrils twitched there was an unfamiliar smell musty but also faintly perfumed like an old church vestment still suffused with the scent of incense she found her gown and slipped it on covering her nakedness and was about to walk to the bedroom door when she reconsidered she returned to her own bedside table and opened the drawer inside was a lady smith in a special joel had insisted that she keep a gun in the house and he had taught her how to shoot out in the woods she didnt like the gun and had largely agreed to have it just to placate him but now she was glad that with joel absent she was not entirely defenseless she waited at the top of the stairs but heard nothing not at first then slowly she became aware of it the whispering had started again and this time she was not asleep karen stood at the basement door and listened she felt like a sleepwalker for her mind was still fuzzy from the sleeping pill and the pot and the aftereffects of napping through the day everything was slightly off kilter when she turned her head it seemed to take a split second for her eyes to follow the movement and the consequence was a dizzying blurring of her vision now tentatively she placed the palm of her hand against the basement door then knelt until her ear was close to the keyhole strangely it made no difference to the volume of the voices she was hearing even though she was certain that the whispering originated from behind the door the voices were at once inside her and beyond her resulting in an alteration in perception that she visualized in almost mathematical terms an equilateral triangle with her at one apex the source of the voices at another and the transmitted sound of them at a third she was overhearing a conversation either carried on with no awareness of her presence or more correctly with an awareness of its inconsequentiality it reminded her of when she was a very young girl and her father and his friends would gather on a sunny day and sit around the table in the garden drinking beers while she sat in the shade of a tree watching them and picking up on certain words and phrases but unable to follow or fully understand the substance of their discussions despite her dislike of dark spaces and her concern at how joel might react if he found that she had trespassed in his basement for she knew that was how he would view it if he discovered that she had entered it without him she wanted to see what was down there she was aware that he was storing something new there for she had seen him moving the last of the boxes from his truck when she had returned from work the previous day she experienced a frisson of excitement at the thought of such an incursion spiced by a degree of apprehension even fear she began to search for the key to the basement while joel kept one on a chain with his other keys she guessed that there had to be a spare nearby already she knew her way around all of the shared areas in the house one of the kitchen drawers contained a jumble of old junk including stray keys combination locks and screws she went through it all but could find no key that looked like it would fit the basement lock after that she searched in the pockets of joels coats that hung in the hall but discovered only dust a couple of coins and an old receipt for gas finally aware that she was about to cross a line she went through joels personal closet her fingers probed in suit pockets and shoes beneath piles of tshirts and through stacks of socks and underwear everything was clean and neatly folded a hangover from joels time in the military halfway through she began to forget about the key and started enjoying the intimate nature of her search and what it revealed about the man she loved she discovered photographs from his time in the military and letters from a former lover only a few of which she read finding herself distressed by the possibility that someone could have thought that she loved joel as much as she karen did and irritated by the fact that he had kept these letters she flipped through them until she found the one that she sought a simple dear john letter advising joel that their continued enforced separation because of his military service was too difficult for her to bear and she wished to end their relationship the letter was dated march karen wondered if the woman whose name was faye had found someone else before she wrote that letter some sixth sense told her that she had in a steel case on the floor of the closet was a ruger pistol and a number of bladed weapons including a bayonet the sight of the knives made her shiver the dreadful intimacy of their penetrative capacity the potential for a brutal connection between victim and killer separate entities briefly joined by a shard of metal beside the knives lay what looked like a key to the basement door she carried it downstairs and placed it in the lock she twisted the key with her left hand the little lady smith held in her right the key moved easily and the door unlocked she opened it and was suddenly aware of the silence in the house the whispering had stopped before her the basement stairs stretched down into darkness only the first three illuminated by the light from the hall her fingers found the pull cord that dangled from the ceiling she yanked it and the overhead light came on so that now she could see as far as the bottom of the stairs down there was another pull cord that lit the rest of the basement she took the steps slowly and carefully she didnt want to trip not here she wasnt sure which possibility was worse that joel might come in and find her on the floor her leg broken or that joel might not come back and she would be left there waiting for the voices to resume their whispering alone in their presence she brushed the thought from her mind it wasnt going to help her nerves any at the second to last step she stretched up on her toes holding on tightly to the rail and tugged the second cord nothing happened she tried again pulling once then twice there was still only darkness before her and darkness behind and to her left where the basement stretched to most of the width of the house hell she thought then remembered that joel always practical kept a flashlight on the shelf immediately beyond the last step in case of just such an eventuality she had seen it when he had first shown the basement to her the day she had moved in with him she trailed her fingers along a steel joist surprised at how cold the metal felt then allowed her hand slowly to run horizontally along the shelf worried about dislodging the flashlight and knocking it to the ground eventually her grip closed upon it she twisted the head and a beam shone on the ceiling catching cobwebs and sending a spider scuttling into a corner the beam was weak though the batteries needed to be replaced but she would not be down here for long just for long enough she spotted the new additions almost immediately joel had stacked the wooden crates and cardboard boxes in the far corner she padded over to them in her slippered feet shivering at the cold of the basement all of the boxes were open and filled with packing material straw in most cases foam chips in the rest she reached into the nearest and felt a small cylindrical object protected by bubble wrap she withdrew it from the box and unwrapped it in the flashlights beam it shone on the two gemstones inlaid into the gold disks at either end and the unfamiliar signs carved into what she was certain was ivory she searched in the box again and found another of the tubes and a third each was slightly different from the last but all had gold and gemstones in common there were more of the cylinders down there two dozen or more and at least as many old gold coins in individual plastic sheaths she rewrapped the cylinders that she had removed and restored them to their place then moved on to the next box this one was heavier she cleared away some of the straw packing to reveal a beautifully decorated vase beside it in a crate previously used to transport wine was the gold head of a woman with lapis lazuli for eyes she ran her fingers across its face so lifelike so perfect in appearance although she was not someone who generally troubled museums with visits here in this musty basement she began to understand the appeal of such artifacts the beauty of something that had survived for so long a link to civilizations now long vanished it made her think again of her earrings where joel had got them from she had no idea but she knew now that this was the big score about which he had spoken and in these items lay his hopes for both of their futures she felt angry at him yet also strangely relieved if it had been drugs that she had found or counterfeit money or expensive watches and gems stolen from a jewelry store she would have been disappointed in him but these objects of beauty were so unusual so unexpected that she was forced to reconsider her opinion of him he didnt even have pictures hanging on his walls until she came to live with him yet this was what he stored in his basement she wanted to laugh it bubbled up from deep inside her and she covered her mouth to stop it and in doing so she was reminded of the sight of joel seated crosslegged by the basement door speaking intently to someone on the other side of it and in that moment she recalled the reason she had come down here the smile disappeared from her face she was about to move on to the other crates when a shape on the shelf to her left caught her eye it was clearly a box loosely covered in bubble wrap and it stood incongruously amid paint cans and jars of nails and screws yet even disguised as it was and in such undistinguished surroundings she was drawn to it as she touched it she felt it vibrate against her fingers it reminded her of a cat purring she laid the flashlight on the shelf and began to undo the wrapping she had to lift the box to do so and something inside seemed to shift slightly any concern she had that joel might discover she had been down there was gone she felt a burning desire to view the box to open it understanding the moment she touched it that this was what she was seeking that this was linked to the voices in her nightmare to the sensations of confinement and imprisonment to joels nocturnal conversations when the bubble wrap stuck she tore at it with her fingers hearing it pop as she shredded it until at last the box was fully revealed to her she stroked it caressed it marveling at the detail of its carvings she lifted it and was surprised by its weight she couldnt begin to imagine how much the gold that went into its construction might be worth alone regardless of the age of the box itself with the tip of a finger she examined the intricate series of locks shaped like spiders that held the lid fixed to the base there were no keyholes that she could see merely clasps that would not move she grew increasingly frustrated picking with her fingernails at the metal all sense of reason and patience gone then one of her fingernails broke and the pain of it brought her back she dropped the box as though it had suddenly grown hot in her hands she was overcome by a profound sense of evil a feeling that she was close to an intelligence that wished her only harm that resented her touch she wanted to run but she was no longer alone in the basement for there was movement in the corner to her left directly across from the stairs joel she said her voice trembled he would be so angry at her she could already see the confrontation playing out his fury at her trespass hers at his hoarding of stolen artifacts in the basement of their home they were both in the wrong but her transgression was minor compared to his except she knew that he would not see it that way she did not want him to hit her again sense began to return to her this was a serious criminal enterprise in which joel was engaged and that was bad enough but the box the box was another matter entirely the box was foul she had to get away from it they both did if joel would not come with her she would leave alone if he lets me leave she thought if it stops at just hitting when he finds out what ive been up to her mind went back to the weapons in his closet and the bayonet in particular joel had shown it to her once before when she found him slumped in the corner of the room his eyes red from weeping for his lost comrade brett harlan it was an m bayonet just like the one harlan had used on his wife before cutting his own throat because the box made him do it she shuddered at the imaginative leap that she had just made even as she strained to peer into the darkness before remembering the flashlight she grasped it and pointed its beam at the corner shadows moved the outline of garden tools and stacked bottles the frames of the shelves and one other a figure that danced away from the light melting into the blackness beneath the stairs a deformed shape distorted by the action of the beam but also she knew unnatural in its essence contorted in its physicality she could almost smell it musty and aged with an acrid edge like old cloth burning this was not joel this was not even human she tried to follow its progress with the flashlight her hands were shaking so she gripped the maglite with both hands holding it close to her body she shone it under the stairs and the shape danced away again a shadow without a form to cast it like smoke rising from an unseen flame now there was movement to her right as well she swung the beam and briefly a figure was framed against the wall its body hunched its arms and legs too long for its torso the crown of its skull misshapen by outgrowths of bone it was both real and unreal the shadow seeming to stretch from the box itself as though the essence of whatever was contained within it were seeping out like a bad smell and the whispering had started again the voices were speaking about her they were disturbed angry she should not have touched the box they did not want her desecrating it with her fingers with her womans hands filthy unclean blood she was having her period it had started that morning blood tainted blood they knew they smelled it on her she retreated trying to get to the stairs aware now of three figures circling her like wolves moving to stay out of the reach of her light even as they closed upon her she waved the flashlight like a flaming torch using it to probe at the darkness to keep them at bay her back to the shelves then the wall until at last she was facing the basement and her foot was on the first step slowly she ascended not wanting to turn her back halfway up the bulb above her head flickered and went dark and then her flashlight too gave up the ghost theyre doing it they like the darkness now she turned stumbling up the final steps and as she reached the door and slammed it closed she caught a final glimpse of them ascending toward her shapes without substance bad dreams conjured from old bones she turned the key and pulled it from the lock tripping as she did so and falling painfully on her coccyx she watched the handle of the door expecting it to turn like it did in those old horror movies but it did not there was only the sound of her breathing and the beating of her heart and the rustle of her robe against her skin as she pushed herself along the floor and came to rest against an armchair the doorbell rang the shock of it made her squeal she saw the figure of a man outlined against it by the night light she looked at the clock on the wall it was after three where had the hours gone rubbing the base of her spine where she had landed so awkwardly she walked to the door and pulled the drape to one side so that she could see who was there a man in his sixties stood in profile on the step he wore a black hat which he raised politely revealing a bald cone misted by wisps of gray hair she opened the door relieved at the presence of another human being even a stranger but she still kept the security chain on hello said the man were looking for karen emory he still had not turned toward her so she could see only one side of his face shes not here said karen the words emerging before she even realized that she had spoken them i dont know when shell be back its late so she probably wont be home until morning she didnt know why she was lying and was conscious of the weakness of the falsehoods she was uttering the man looked unthreatening but her survival instincts had been shocked into action by what she had seen in the basement and he was making her skin crawl she had been wrong to open the door to him and now it was crucial that she lock it against him as soon as possible she wanted to scream she was trapped between this man and the entities in the basement she willed joel to return even as she understood that this was his fault that the man was here because of him and what was stored in the basement because why else would such an individual be on their doorstep at three in the morning joel would know what to do shed take her chances with his anger if hed only return to help her we can wait said the man im sorry that wont be possible anyway i have company lies were piling up on lies and she sounded unconvincing even to her own ears then she thought about what the man on the doorstep had just said were looking for karen emory we can wait no said the man we dont think you have company at all we think youre alone now she looked around to see if there was anyone else outside but there was only this odd creepy man with his hat in his hand and she had left the gun in the basement go away she said go away or ill call the police now his head turned and she saw how ruined he was how damaged and she felt that this was as much a spiritual as a physical decay she tried to close the door but his foot was already jammed in the gap nice earrings said herod old and too good for one such as you he reached through the gap his hand a white blur and ripped out one of the earrings tearing the lobe blood sprayed on her robe and she tried to scream but his hand was on her throat his nails digging into her skin his shoulder struck the door with massive force and the chain came away from the frame she fought against him scratching at him with her fingers until he slammed her head against the wall once dont twice tell the third time she hardly felt it at all lies karen did not lose consciousness not entirely so she was aware of being dragged by her hair across the floor and thrown in a corner her ruined earlobe burned with pain and she felt blood dripping from the wound she heard the door locking and saw the drapes being partially drawn on the windows but she felt nauseated and she was having trouble with her vision because when the man walked to the window she thought that she saw two reflections in the glass one was the intruder and the other the other was clarence buttle there was something about his gait and posture that had ingrained itself upon her memory even had the reflected figure not been wearing the shabby dark jacket that clarence had been wearing that night in her bedroom with the redandblack checked shirt beneath it tucked into baggy jeans that looked like they belonged more properly on a fatter person clarences jeans had been held up with a brown leather belt its battered silver buckle shaped like a cowboy hat that was how she remembered him because that was how he looked in the photographs that were taken of him as his true nature was revealed by the police investigation but clarence buttle was dead he had died in prison taken by stomach cancer that had eaten away at his insides the reflected clarence certainly looked like someone whod been eaten away except it was his face that had been consumed because the clarence that she glimpsed in the glass before the drapes closed had holes where his eyes should have been and his lips were gone revealing black gums and the stumps of rotted teeth but in those final seconds his lipless mouth had moved and she heard the words and smelled the foulness of his insides polluting the room ive been a bad bad boy said the reflection both clarence and notclarence and karen struggling to hold back her bile knew deep down in the special hidden place where she kept all that was truly herself that what she was seeing was the entity that had made clarence buttle what he was the voice that had spoken to him of the pleasures of playing with little girls in old storm drains the malign visitor that had put karen emorys name into clarences mind shell play with you clarence she likes boys and she likes dark places and she wont scream she wont scream no matter what you do to her because shes a good good girl and a good good girl needs a bad bad boy to bring out the best in her the intruder was looking at her in amusement and she knew that he had seen something of what she had glimpsed because he was rotting too inside and out and she wondered if the entity brought the cancer with it if that degree of spiritual and mental decay somehow had to find a physical expression after all evil was a kind of poison an infection of the soul and other poisons if absorbed slowly over time brought changes to the body nicotine yellowed the skin and blackened the lungs alcohol damaged the liver and the kidneys and scoured the face radiation made your hair fall out lead asbestos heroin they all affected the body bringing it closer to its final ruination was it not possible that evil in its purest form the quintessence of it might do the same because the sickness had been in clarence just as it was in the man who now held her in his power what was his name he asked and she felt compelled to reply clarence she said his name was clarence did he hurt you she shook her head but he wanted to oh yes clarence had wanted to play and clarence played rough when it came to little girls karen drew her knees up beneath her chin and wrapped her arms around them although the reflection was no longer visible she was afraid of what had created it it was in here she could feel it she could feel it because there was a connection between her and clarence buttle she was the one that escaped him worse she was the one who got him caught and he would never forgive her for that never forgive her for leaving him to rot painfully in a prison hospital with nobody to visit him no one to care about him when all hed wanted to do was play the intruder approached her and she shrank from him my name is herod he said you dont have to be afraid of me im not going to hurt you again not as long as you answer my questions honestly but she was looking past him her eyes flicking around the room her nostrils twitching alert for the approach of notclarence and his cancerous breath and his filthy probing fingers the old man peered at her curiously but youre not frightened of me are you he said because youve seen him and thats quite the thing quite the thing oh you can call him clarence if you like but he has lots of names to me hes the captain he put a hand on her head and stroked her hair and she trembled at his touch because whatever had been in clarence was also in him though you dont have to be scared of the captain either not unless youve done something wrong something very very wrong he shifted his hand from her head to her shoulder and dug his nails in hard causing her to wince and look him in the face her eyes drawn to the arrowshaped decay in his upper lip and the virulence of its infection but i suspect that even a little whore like you all warm breath and hot britches has no cause to worry because the captain has more pressing concerns youre inconsequential girly and as long as you stay that way then the captain will mind his distance and if you dont well he cocked his head as though listening to a voice that only he could hear then grinned unpleasantly the captain says to tell you that theres a storm drain with your name on it and a friend there whos just aching for someone to join him he winked the captain says that old clarence always did like warm wet places and the captain saw him right on that score because the captain always keeps his word clarence now has a deep dark damp hole all to himself where he waits for the girl that got away but thats the thing about the captains promises you have to read the small print before you sign on the dotted line clarence didnt understand that which is why hes been alone for so long but i do the captain and i were real close we speak with one voice you might say he stood his grip still tight upon her so that she was forced to her feet now i have some bad news for you but youre going to take it like a trooper your boyfriend joel tobias isnt going to be the meat in your bun again anytime soon he and i we tried to have a talk but he was a reluctant conversationalist and i was forced to exert a little pressure on him he placed his left hand upon her cheek and pinched it gently his skin was chill to the touch and she let out a little animal whine i think you know what im talking about to be honest it was a blessing for him when the end came her legs went weak she would have fallen had herod not held on to her she tried to push him away but he was stronger than her she began to weep but suddenly his hand was in her hair again pulling her head back so far that she heard her neck crack none of that said herod no time to grieve now im a busy man and time isnt on my side we have things to do and then you can mourn him all you like he led her to the basement door he reached out his right hand and placed it against the wood you know whats down there karen shook her head she was still crying but there was a numbness to her grief like pain fighting to break through the diminishing effect of an anesthetic youre lying again said herod but in a way youre also telling the truth because i dont think that you do know whats down there not really but you and i were going to find out together wheres the key slowly she reached into the pocket of her robe and handed the key to him i dont want to go back in the basement she said she thought that she sounded like a little girl sobbing and wheedling well missy i cant very well leave you up here all alone can i he replied he spoke reasonably even kindly but this was the same man who had called her a whore earlier who had left marks in her skin where his fingers had dug into her shoulder who had torn her earlobe who had killed joel and left her alone again but you dont need to worry not when youve got me to take care of you he handed the key back to her now go ahead and open it ill be right behind you to encourage her further he showed her his gun and she did as she was told her hand trembling only slightly as she inserted the key in the lock he stepped back as she opened the door revealing the darkness beyond wheres the light he asked it doesnt work she said it broke when i was down there they broke it she almost added they wanted me to trip and fall so that id be forced to stay down there with them herod looked around and saw the flashlight lying on the floor he bent to retrieve it and as he did so she kicked him hard on the side of the head sending him to his knees she ran for the front door but she was still fumbling for the latch when he was on her she cried out and he covered her mouth with his hand and pulled her backward then tossed her to the floor she landed on her back and before she could raise herself up he was kneeling on her chest his hand reached into her mouth and grabbed her tongue so hard she thought that he was going to rip it out she couldnt speak but her eyes begged him not to do it last warning he said the wound on his lip had torn and was starting to bleed i dont cause pain without reason and i have no desire to hurt you more than i have already but if you make me do it then i will cross me again and ill feed your tongue to the rats then leave you to choke on your own blood do you understand karen gave the faintest of nods fearful of moving her head too much and tearing her tongue he released his grip and she tasted him in her mouth sharp and chemical she got to her feet and he turned on the flashlight seems to be working fine now he said and gestured for her to go ahead of him you first he said keep your hands away from your body dont touch anything but the stair rail if you make any sudden moves while were down there it will go hard on you reluctantly she moved forward the beam of the flashlight illuminated the stairs herod let her get three steps ahead of him then followed when she got halfway down she paused and looked to her left where the darkness was deepest and the gold box rested on its shelf why have you stopped asked herod its back there she said what is the gold box thats what youre looking for isnt it the gold box youre going to show me exactly where it is there are things down there she said i saw them i told you youre in no danger keep going she continued descending until she reached floor level herod joined her the flashlight searching the corners of the basement shadows jumped but they were caused by the beam and she might almost have been persuaded that she had imagined the earlier forms were it not for the fact that the whispering had returned this time it sounded different puzzled perhaps but expectant she led him to where the treasures lay but he showed no interest in the exposed seals or the beautiful marble head he had eyes only for the box he allowed the light to play upon it for a time tutting softly at some of the damage that it had incurred the small dents and scuffs that marred the decoration on its sides then pointed to a canvas bag that lay on top of some old suitcases stacked beside the shelf pick it up and put it in that bag he told her and be careful she didnt want to touch it again but equally she wanted all of this to be over he would leave when he had the box if he was a man of his word he would let her live despite her fear of him she believed that he did not want to kill her had he wished to do so she would be dead already what is it she asked whats in there what did you see when you were down here herod replied i saw shapes they were deformed like men except not men no not men said herod have you heard of pandoras box she nodded it was a box that contained evil and it was opened and all of that evil escaped into the world very good said herod except it was a pot a pithos not a box the term pandoras box derives from a mistranslation into latin he was glad that there was someone with him now that he had that for which he had long been searching he wanted to explain he wanted someone else to understand its importance this he continued is a true pandoras box a prison of gold seven chambers each with seven locks symbolizing the gates to the netherworld he pointed to the arachnid clasps the locks are shaped like spiders because it was a spider that protected the prophet mohammed from assassins by weaving a web in front of the mouth of the cave in which he was hiding with abu bakr the men who constructed the box hoped that the spider might protect them in turn as for what the box contains well lets call them ancient spirits almost as old as the captain himself almost theyre bad said karen she shuddered i felt it from them oh that they are said herod theyre very bad indeed but what are you going to do with it im going to open it and set them free said herod speaking as if to a child karen stared at him why would you do that because thats what the captain wants and what the captain wants the captain gets now pick up the box and put it in the bag she shook her head herod drew his gun and placed it against her lips i have what i want he said i can kill you or we can both live its your choice reluctantly she lifted the box once again she felt it vibrate in her hands there was a tapping from inside it as though a rodent were trapped in there scratching vainly at the lid it very nearly caused her to drop the box herod hissed in vexation but said nothing carefully she placed it in the canvas bag then pulled the zipper closed she tried to hand it to him but he shook his head ill let you carry it he said go on were nearly done she led the way up the stairs herod close behind her this time one hand resting lightly on her shoulder and the gun at her back when she reached the living room she stopped keep herod began to say before he saw what karen had seen there were three men in the room all armed their guns now pointing at his head let her go i said if herod was surprised to find us waiting for him he hid it well he pulled karen emory in closer to him using her body as a shield his gun pressed hard against the side of her neck pointing upward into her brain only the right side of his head was visible to us and even louis wasnt going to take that shot blood was coursing from the terrible wound on herods upper lip staining his lips and his chin are you okay karen i asked she tried to nod but she was so afraid of the gun that the movement was little more than a tremor herods eyes gleamed he paid no attention to angel and louis his gaze was fixed on me i know you said herod i saw you at the bar you should have introduced yourself we could have saved a lot of time and energy oh i dont think so the captain wouldnt have liked it whos the captain but i recalled the second figure that i thought i had glimpsed in the car a wraith with a clowns face the captain is very curious about you and it takes a lot to pique the captains interest after all hes seen so much that theres little left to rouse him from his torpor hes screwing with you said louis am i said herod he cocked his head as though listening to a voice that only he could hear dominus meus bonus et benignitas est ring any bells mr parker i shifted my grip on the weapon in my hand i had heard that phrase before it functioned on a number of levels as a coded greeting as a dark joke a declaration of faith in an entity that was far from benign and as a naming of sorts my master is good and kind good and kind goodkind or mr goodkind that was what his followers called him or some of them but now here was herod implying that goodkind and the thing that he called the captain were one and the same it doesnt matter i said ive no interest in your ghost stories whats in the bag another ghost story said herod the prison box i intend to leave with it and youre going to let me i dont think so it was angel who spoke he was resting almost languidly against the frame of the door you may not have noticed but there are three guns pointing at you and i have one pointing at ms emorys head replied herod you kill her and we kill you said angel and then you dont get to play with your box you think that you have all the moves worked out mr parker you and your friends said herod it pains me to disabuse you of that notion ms emory reach very slowly into the outside left pocket of my coat and take out what you find there do it gently now or you wont get to discover how this particular story ends karen fumbled in his pocket then threw something on the floor between us it was a womans pocketbook go ahead said herod take a look inside it had landed close to louiss left foot he kicked it back to me never taking his eyes from herod i opened it it held cosmetics some pills and a wallet the wallet contained carrie saunderss driving license i buried her said herod oh not too deep the box is steel military in construction i expect i found it in her basement but i didnt want it to buckle under the weight of the dirt she has air too courtesy of a hole and a plastic breathing tube but it cant be pleasant being trapped in the darkness and who knows what might happen if her tube became blocked a falling leaf would be enough or a clod of dirt dislodged by a passing animal by now she must be close to panic and if she does panic well her hands are tied if she doesnt keep her lips on that tube shell probably only have fifteen minutes to live at most they will be fifteen very long minutes though why her i said i think you know why and if you dont then youre not as clever as i thought you were id love to stay here and fill you in on all of the details but suffice it to say that mr tobias and his friends were very busy earlier killing mexicans and when they were done they went to ms saunderss house to regroup i learned a lot from mr tobias before he expired about a jimmy jewel and how he died and someone called foster jandreau it appears that ms saunders could be quite the seductress when she put her mind to it i guess you could call her the brains of the operation she killed them all roddam jewel jandreau maybe youll have the opportunity to question her yourself if you let me go the longer you prevaricate the lower her chances of survival become everything is an exchange everything is a negotiation i am an honorable man and i keep my promises i promise you the life of ms emory and the location of carrie saunderss makeshift coffin in return for the box we both know that youre not going to let ms emory die youre not the kind of man who could easily live with that knowledge i looked again at the license and at karen emorys terrified face how do we know that youll keep your part of the bargain i said because i always keep my bargains i gave it a couple of seconds before nodding my assent youre not serious said angel youre going to take that deal what choice do we have i said put your guns down let him leave both angel and louis hesitated for a moment then louis slowly lowered his weapon and angel did the same you have a cell phone asked herod yes give me the number i did so then said you want me to write it down for you no thank you i have an exceptional memory in ten minutes i will drop ms emory at a pay phone and ill tell her where carrie saunders is buried ill even give ms emory the money to make the call then you can ride to her rescue and our business will be concluded if you renege ill hunt you down you and your captain oh you have my word i dont kill unnecessarily i already have enough stains on my soul to last a lifetime and the box im going to open it you think you can control whats in there no i dont but the captain can goodbye mr parker tell your friends to step away id like all three of you in the far corner please if i see any of you emerge from the house or if you try to follow me our arrangement is off i will kill ms emory and carrie saunders can take her chances in her own prison box do we understand each other yes i said i dont believe that were going to meet again said herod but you and the captain thats another matter in time im sure that you and he will have the chance to become more intimately acquainted angel stepped away from the door and he louis and i moved into the corner of the room diagonally opposite the front door still keeping karen as a shield herod backed out of the house karen closing the door behind them at his instruction i had one last sight of her and then they were gone moments later there was the sound of a car starting up and driving away louis made a move to the door but i stopped him no i said you trust him in this yes i said i wasnt talking about herod neither was i i dont know if carrie saunders panicked i dont know if the tube slipped from her mouth and trapped as she was she was unable to reach it again sometimes i find myself imagining her final moments and always i see herod tossing aside his spade and staring down at the compacted dirt then gently tugging the breathing tube from the mouth of the woman buried below he did it because she had breached some unwritten contract with him but also because it pleased him to do so for all his talk of honor and negotiations and promises i believed that herod was a cruel man he kept his word about releasing karen emory and he told her where carrie saunders was buried before he left her but the autopsy concluded that carrie saunders had been dead for hours when she was found i do know this carrie saunders killed jimmy jewel and she killed foster jandreau a gun a glock was found in her house the bullets matched those used to kill jimmy and jandreau and her fingerprints were the only ones found on the weapon as for roddam there was no way of knowing for certain if she was responsible for his death but herod had told the truth about her involvement in the other killings so there was no reason to believe that he had been lying about roddam after saunderss body was found there was some speculation that the man responsible for her death might have framed her for the other killings but it was dismissed when bobby jandreau came forward and told of how he had spoken with his cousin foster about his belief that the death of damien patchett and those of bernie kramer and the harlans were linked to a smuggling operation being run by joel tobias although he had no formal evidence to offer in support foster jandreau was ambitious but he hadnt advanced fast enough for his liking and had stalled if he could find evidence of illegal dealings on the part of joel tobias he might have been able to resuscitate a moribund career but bobby jandreau had made the mistake of discussing the matter with carrie saunders during one of their therapy sessions and then she had killed foster to stop him delving further into the operation and sullied his reputation with drug vials whether or not she did so with joel tobiass knowledge and consent i could not say and those who might have been able to tell me were all dead i remembered what others had said about tobias he was smart but not that smart he was not capable of running an operation potentially involving millions of dollars worth of stolen antiquities but carrie saunders was in paris rochman revealed that his contact for the purchase of the ivories and the seals had been a woman who used the pseudonym medea and that the money had been wired to a bank in bangor maine rumors emerged that saunders and roddam might have been lovers during their time together at abu ghraib but they were an unlikely couple war created such odd unions but it was probable that roddam and saunders were using each other and saunders had come out on top because roddam had died saunders and tobias had gone to the same high school in bangor saunders graduating the year after tobias they had known each other for a long time but if she had been the guiding intelligence behind the operation she wouldnt have required the permission of joel tobias or anyone else to do whatever she had to in order to ensure its success i was there when they broke open the lock on the box and i saw carrie saunderss face whatever she might have done she did not deserve to die in that way shortly after the discovery of the body i gave my statement to the police with two agents from ice the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement in attendance behind them hovered a small man with a beard and dark skin who introduced himself as dr aldaini late of the iraq museum in baghdad the agents were part of the jiacg the joint interagency coordination group a grab bag of military fbi cia treasury ice and anyone else who happened to be passing and had an interest in iraq and how terrorists might be financing their operations they had been drawn to the looting of the iraq museum by concerns that the stolen items were being sold on the black market to raise funds for the insurgency the man who had interrogated me at the blue moon was lying both to me and to himself people were being hurt by what they were doing but they were dying on the streets of baghdad and fallujah and anywhere else in iraq that american soldiers were being targeted i told the agents and dr aldaini everything with only one detail concealed i did not tell them of the collector dr aldaini seemed to sway slightly at the news of the loss of the box but he said nothing when we were done i got in my car and drove south herod sat in his study surrounded by his books and his tools there were no mirrors no reflective surfaces he had even placed his computer in another room so that there was no chance of a face being glimpsed the captain was a distraction his desire to see the box opened so compelling that herod had been forced to banish him from its presence by covering every reflective surface he needed peace in which to work to have done so in the presence of the captain would have driven him insane figuring out the mechanisms of the locks would take time days perhaps they had to be opened in a certain combination for there were cells within cells it was a puzzle box an extraordinary construct whatever relics had been concealed in the final chamber were bound with wire and the wire was connected in turn to every lock simply to have broken the locks by force would have torn the presumably fragile relics apart and if someone had gone to such efforts to secure them then it meant that it was important that the relics remain intact the box stood on a white cloth it no longer vibrated and all of the voices within had ceased their whispering as though wary of imposing on the concentration of the one who might free them herod was not afraid of them the captain had told him of what lay in the box and the nature of the bonds that restricted them they were beasts but chained beasts once the box was opened they would be revealed yet still constrained they would have to be made to understand that they were the captains creatures he was about to prise off the first spider and reveal the mechanism of the lock when the house alarm went off shocking him with its suddenness herod did not even pause to assess the situation he hit the locks on the safe room sealing himself inside he then picked up the phone pressed the red button on the handset and was immediately connected with the security company responsible for monitoring the alarm he confirmed a possible intrusion and notified them that he had locked himself in the safe room he walked to a closet and opened it to reveal a bank of monitor screens each revealing one aspect of the house both internal and external and its grounds he thought that he now caught the captains reflection on the screens and felt his intense curiosity as he tried to glimpse the box but herod ignored him there were more pressing issues for now he could see no evidence of intrusion and the gates to the property remained closed it might well have been a false alarm but herod was disinclined to take chances with his personal safety or with his collection especially when such a valuable and rare addition had just been made to it after four minutes an unmarked black van appeared at the gates a numerical security code changed weekly as an added safeguard was entered on the pad by the gatepost which herod duly confirmed the gates opened and the van entered the property the gates immediately closing again behind it once the van reached the front of the house its doors opened and four armed men appeared two of them immediately moving to check the sides and rear of the building one man training his weapon on the grounds while the last approached the door and activated the main intercom dürer said a voice like the numerical code the word confirming the security teams identity was also changed weekly dürer repeated herod he remotely activated the front door lock opening it and allowing the security guards access to the main house one of them the one who had given the code word immediately entered the man who had been watching the grounds moved to the door but remained outside until the main search team had joined him after confirming that the rest of the house was secure at which point he too entered the house leaving them outside herod tried to follow their progress from screen to screen as they deactivated the main alarm and checked the log then proceeded to move through the house ten minutes after the search had commenced the intercom buzzed in herods office youre clear sir looks like it was something in zone two dining room window theres no sign of attempted entry though might be a fault we can send out a technician in the morning thank you said herod you can leave now he watched the fourman team leave when they were gone and the gates had closed behind them he deactivated the locks on the study door and hid the screens and the captain from sight although the room was well ventilated and he often worked with the door closed herod disliked keeping it locked the thought of imprisonment or longterm confinement of any kind terrified him he thought that was why he had enjoyed inflicting it on the saunders woman it was a kind of transference but also a punishment he had offered both her and tobias a deal their lives for the location of the trove but they had been greedy and had commenced a negotiation for which he had neither the time nor the inclination the second deal was offered to tobias alone he could die slowly or quickly but he was going to die tobias had trouble believing that at first but herod had managed to convince him in the end as he opened the door of his study he was still mildly troubled by what might have caused the alarm activation and was not concentrating fully on the room beyond so that the captains voice sounded like a siren in his ears as soon as he began to emerge an incoherent burst of anger and warning and fear before he could respond there was movement in front of him there were two men both armed one of them smelled so strongly of nicotine that his presence in the room seemed immediately to pollute the air he pushed herod to the ground and placed a blade against his neck herod stared up at the face of the collector behind him was the detective parker neither man spoke but herods head was filled with noise it was the sound of the captain screaming i kept herod under my gun as his eyes moved back and forth between the collector and me as though uncertain as to which of us posed the greater threat herods own gun had been tossed to the floor by the collector and now lay out of reach the collector meanwhile was examining herods shelves picking up items and examining them admiringly before restoring them to their place you possess an impressive array of treasures said the collector books manuscripts artifacts i have been following your progress for some time but even i had not imagined that you were so assiduous and possessed such exquisite taste i am a collector like you said herod no not like me came the reply my collection is very different how did you find me technology your car was fitted with a tracking device while you were in ms emorys house i believe it might have been cobbled together by the late joel tobias which is ironic under the circumstances you were outside his house all the time yes you could have taken me then mr parker was anxious to ensure the safety of ms emory and i wanted to see your collection and how did you get in sleight of hand its hard to keep track of so many men moving through ones house across different screens especially once the alarm system has been deactivated you intercepted the security detail yes you may sit but keep your hands on the desk if they disappear from sight mr parker will shoot you herod did as he was instructed laying the palms of his hands flat on either side of the box youre trying to open it said the collector yes why because im curious to see what is inside such trouble youve gone to all for the sake of idle curiosity not idle never idle so this is purely a matter of personal interest herod considered the question i think you already know the answer to that the collector pulled up an armchair and settled himself into it his hands clasped in his lap the fingers intertwined and the thumbs crossed as though he were about to pray do you even know who it is that you serve he said do you one corner of the collectors mouth raised itself in a smile i settle accounts i collect debts but for whom i will not name him here in the presence of this thing his fingers unfolded themselves as he indicated the box he reached into a pocket and produced a gunmetal cigarette case and a matchbook do you mind if i smoke yes thats a shame it seems that i am set to impose still further on your hospitality the collector put a cigarette between his lips and struck the match soon a foulsmelling gray smoke curled toward the ceiling herods face tightened in distaste i have them specially made said the collector i used to smoke generic brands but i found their ubiquity crass if im going to poison myself id prefer to do so with a modicum of class how admirable said herod do you mind if i ask where you plan to put the ash oh these are slow burning said the collector by the time it becomes an issue youll already be dead the atmosphere in the room changed some of the oxygen seemed to be sucked from it and i heard a highpitched whine in my head by your hand or by your friends said herod softly neither herod looked puzzled but before he could pursue the matter further the collector spoke again what name does he go by the one whom you serve herod shifted slightly in his chair i know him as the captain he replied but he has many names im sure the captain the one who waits behind the glass mr goodkind it hardly matters does it he is so old that he has no name of his own they are all the constructs of others the collectors right hand moved gently taking in the room smoke trailing from his fingers no mirrors here no reflective surfaces one might think you were tiring of his presence it must be wearying i admit all of that anger all of that need to work with it in your head would be next to impossible he leaned forward and tapped the box and now he wants this opened to add a little more chaos to an already troubled world well no sense in disappointing him is there the collector rose he placed his cigarette carefully on the arm of the chair then leaned over the desk and began moving his fingers along the locking mechanisms the tips dexterously exploring the spider legs the twisted bodies the gaping mouths he did not look at the box as he did so instead his eyes never left herods what are you doing said herod these are complex mechanisms they need to be examined their order needs to be established but even as he spoke a series of clicks and whirrs began to sound inside the box still the collectors fingers moved and as they did so the mechanical noises were drowned out by another it was a whispering that seemed to fill the room rising in terrible joy voices clambering over one another like insects in a nest one lid opened then another and another a shadow appeared against one of the bookcases hunched and horned and quickly it was joined by two others a prelude to what was about to be revealed stop i said you cant do this i moved to my right so that the collector could see me and i shifted the muzzle of the gun from herod to him dont open that box the collector lifted his hands in the air not in a gesture of surrender but of display like a magician at the end of a particularly fine conjuring act too late he said and the final lid sprang open for a moment all was still in the room the shadows on the wall ceased to move and what had for so long been without substance assumed concrete form the collector remained standing his hands still raised a conductor waiting for the baton to be placed between his fingers so that the symphony might begin herod stared into the box and his face was illuminated by a cold white light like sunlight reflected from snow his expression changed altering from fear to wonder at what was revealed to him but concealed from the collector and from me and then herod understood and he was lost the collector spun away diving toward me in the same movement forcing me to the ground yet i was compelled to look i saw a black back curved like a bow its skin distorted and torn by the eruption of sharp spinal bones i saw a head that was too large for the torso that supported it the neck lost in folds of flesh the top of its skull a fantasy of twisted yellow bones like the roots of an ancient tree stripped of bark i saw yellow eyes glitter i saw dark nails i saw sharp teeth one head became two then three two descended on herod but one turned to me then the collectors fingers were pressing into the back of my head forcing my face to the floor dont look he said close your eyes close your eyes and pray there was no sound from herod that was what struck me most he was silent as they worked on him and though i was tempted to look again i did not not even when the collectors grip upon me eased and i felt him stand i heard a series of mechanical clicks and the collector said it is done only then did i open my eyes herod sat slumped in his chair his head tilted back his eyes and mouth open he was dead but appeared uninjured except for a thin trickle of blood that ran from his left ear and the fact that every capillary in his eyes had exploded turning his corneas red the box on his desk was closed once more and i heard the whispering return now filled with rage like a hive of bees shaken by an outside force the collector picked up his cigarette from the arm of his chair a long finger of ash hung from the tip like a building about to fall he tapped it into herods open mouth then returned the cigarette to his own mouth and drew lengthily upon it if youre going to taunt the dogs always check the length of the chain he said he picked up the box and tucked it under his arm youre taking it i said temporarily its not mine to keep he wandered over to one of the shelves and removed a tiny ivory statue of a female demon it looked oriental but i was no expert a souvenir he said to add to my collection now i have one more task to accomplish let me introduce you to someone we stood in front of the ornate mirror outside herods study at first there was only my reflection and that of the collector but in time we were joined by a third initially it seemed little more than a blur dark gray absences where eyes and a mouth should have been but then it formed itself into recognizable features it was the face of susan my dead wife but with holes burnt into her skin where her eyes once were then like a rattle being shaken the face blurred again and it was jennifer my murdered daughter but also eyeless her mouth filled with biting insects more faces now enemies from the past changing faster and faster the traveling man the one who had torn susan and jennifer apart the killer of women caleb kyle pudd his face wreathed in old spider webs and brightwell the demon brightwell the goiter on his neck swollen like a great womb of blood for he was in all of them and they were all of him finally there was just the figure of a man one in his early forties of a little more than average height there was gray seeping into his dark hair and his eyes were troubled and sad beside him was his twin and next to him was the collector then the collector stepped away the two reflections became one and i stared back only at myself what did you feel asked the collector and there was an uncertainty to his voice that i had not heard before what did you feel when you looked upon it rage and fear it was afraid the answer came before i had even become aware of the thought afraid of you no said the collector not of me i saw thoughtfulness in his face but there was something else for the first time i felt the collectors own fear of me epilogue i wish i lived in my house with only a third part of all these goods and that the men were alive who died in those days in wide troy land homer the odyssey book the warehouse in queens was known as the fortress an art storage facility guarded by the us government the fortress had already seen many antiquities from the iraq museum pass through its doors it was there that the headless stone statue of the sumerian king entemena of lagash had been taken after it was retrieved and there that items from the museum seized by us customs at newark airport in were brought for authentication now in the fortresss gloomy confines dr aldaini began the process of cataloging what had been recovered during the raids in maine and quebec even as he mourned that which he had mostly fervently sought and which had now been lost to him again when he found himself tiring he left the fortress and wandered to a nearby coffee shop where he ordered soup and read an arabic newspaper that he had bought that morning later he would say that he smelled the man who sat down opposite him before he saw him for dr aldaini did not smoke and the stink of nicotine had tainted his soup dr aldaini looked up from his newspaper and his meal and stared at the collector excuse me but do i know you he asked the collector shook his head we have moved in similar circles thats all i have something for you he laid a box wrapped in string and brown paper upon the table and dr aldaini felt his fingertips vibrate in tune with the box as he ran them over the parcel then glanced around him before he used his knife to cut the string he pushed aside the paper before opening the top of the long white box that was before him gently he examined the locks he frowned the box has been opened yes said the collector the results were most interesting but they are still trapped in there cant you feel them dr aldaini nodded and closed the top of the white box for the first time in many years he felt that he might sleep well who are you he asked i i am a collector he slipped two pieces of paper across the table to dr aldaini but there is a price to be paid for relinquishing such a unique item to the proper authorities dr aldaini examined the papers on each was the image of a small cylindrical seal consider them destroyed or irretrievably lost dr aldaini was a man of the world agreed he said for your own collection no said the collector as he stood to leave in recompense the air was still rain had fallen earlier in the day and the grass in the maine veterans memorial cemetery gleamed in the sunlight bobby jandreau was beside me his girlfriend waiting on the path behind us we were alone among the dead he had asked that i meet him in this place and i had been happy to do so for a long time i wanted to be here said bobby i wanted it all to end and now im with her he looked back at mel and she smiled at him and i thought she will be buried here next to you theyll save a place for you both no need to hurry he nodded this is our reward he said to lie here with honor there is nothing more not money not medals this is enough his gaze was fixed on the nearest stone a husband and wife were buried there side by side and i knew that he was seeing his name alongside mels just as i had their intentions were good he said at the start most of the bad situations ive encountered began with the best of intentions i replied but they were right in a way the injured the scarred they deserve better than what theyre getting i guess there was so much money that in the end they couldnt bear to give any of it away i guess so he reached out to me and i shook his hand when we were done there were two small cylinder seals in his palm each decorated with gold and gemstones a fragment of paper was bound to one with a rubber band what are these souvenirs i said a man named dr aldaini has crossed them off his list of stolen items in return for a certain gold box on the paper is the name of someone wholl pay a high price for them with no questions asked im sure you can find a way to put the money to good use bobby jandreau closed his fist upon the seals there are men and women worse off than i am i know that thats why theyve been given to you because youll do the right thing you need any advice talk to ronald straydeer or just ask your girlfriend they left before i did i stayed for a time among the dead and then as the shadows lengthened i crossed myself and left the fallen to their own here the dead lay down their burdens for a time here are names etched in stone and bouquets on cut grass here husband lies next to wife and wife next to husband here is the promise of peace but only the promise for the dead alone can speak of what they have endured and just as sleep may be punctuated by restless dreaming so too the final repose is sometimes uneasy for those who have seen too much who have suffered too much the dead know what the dead know and soldiers know what soldiers know and they can share their torments only with their own kind at night figures emerge from the shadows and dark forms move in sheltered glades one man sits beside another on a stone bench listening quietly to his comrade as a bird sings lullabies above their heads three men walk softly through the first fallen leaves disturbing none leaving no trace of their passing here soldiers gather and speak of war and of what was lost here the dead bear witness and witness is borne in return and the night air carries whispers of consolation
