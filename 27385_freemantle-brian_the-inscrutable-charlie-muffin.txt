the inscrutable charlie muffin brian freemantle the fire boats had been placed so that their sprays created a paperchain of rainbows for the pride of america to sail through when she left new york for the last time every vessel in the harbour set up a cacophony of farewell sirens and the streamers hung like justwashed hair over the ships side and from pier and several other jetties by which she slowly passed lights in the twin towers of the trade center windows had been specially illuminated so that the message read farewell matching the word spelled out over the manhattan skyline by the skywriting plane which arced and circled above its purple smoke streaming behind the waterside was jammed with people and the circle line boats had arranged special ferry trips to remain alongside until the liner reached the statue of liberty a vantage point crowded with more sightseers it was here that mr l w lu called the major press conference on board the ship to enable the film and television crews and journalists who would not be remaining for the entire voyage to hong kong to be conveniently airlifted back to la guardia in helicopters waiting on the cleared observation deck there had been press flights from england and every major european country and over two hundred people crowded into the former observation bar not since onassis had there been a shipowner more internationally known so the presskit was hardly necessary but lu was a consummate publicist as each of the pressmen had entered the room they had been handed a bulging file setting out the already familiar history of an orphan boy born into poverty who had risen from junior shippingoffice clerk to speculative investor on the hong kong stock market to tanker magnate asian oil millionaire free enterprise entrepreneur and benefactor of three fully supported orphanages and two hospitals he sat on a raised dais the panoramic view from the ship behind him patiently waiting amid the chaos that precedes any such gathering by his side as always sat his son there was a remarkable physical resemblance between the two men the father was a buddhaplump benignlooking man the harsh klieg lights of the cameras glistening against his polished face and silk suit and occasionally when he extended his almost constant smile picking up the gold in his teeth john lu was slightly thinner and unlike his father wore spectacles he had no gold in his teeth either but that was difficult to establish because john lu was a man who hardly ever smiled it was the younger man who stood first holding out his hands for silence my name is john lu he said i would like you to welcome my father who wishes to begin this conference with a statement there was a surprising but isolated burst of applause from the asian journalists present and lu smiled in appreciation he didnt stand he merely leant forward upon the table that had been set with microphones and radio equipment tapped the mouthpiece to ensure he had selected the right amplifier and said in an ordinary conversational tone thank you all for coming the microphone picked up the sibilant blur in his voice and there was an immediate response the room quietening within seconds lus smile widened slightly at the reaction there has been i know much speculation about my reasons for purchasing this still magnificent liner the man was very aware of the seating arrangements for the conference and turned fractionally towards the section he knew to be occupied by americans i have always felt it a tragedy that a vessel like the pride of america still the holder of the blue riband for the fastest crossing of the atlantic should because of a change in world travelling preference be mothballed and left to lie almost forgotten if not abandoned off the coast of virginia he paused imperceptibly a glass of water appeared at his elbow from the attentive son the chinese sipped at it smiling out at people he could no longer see because of the fierceness of the lights he made almost an affectation of politeness and so he resumed i have found for it a function that will maintain the liner not only in its former glory but put it to a purpose that will make it perhaps more famous than it ever was as a sea link between europe and america the millionaire paused again to achieve effect we are bound as you know for hong kong once there it will be necessary to carry out some alterations and modifications for that role a role best explained by the new name which will appear on its hull the university of freedom there was another pause this time forced upon him by the sudden burst of noise from the assembled journalists lu raised his hand silencing the room again then gestured to a bank of seats upon which a group of people had assembled minutes before the opening of the conference you see behind me he announced professors who have agreed to take chairs at this university and who have joined me from the sorbonne heidelberg oxford yale and harvard there was a fresh outburst of noise from the journalists and a slight shift in the lighting at the sudden demand for identification lu gestured again some of you may recognise professor james northcote from harvard recipient of last years nobel prize in physics the lights and cameras wavered and a bonily thin balding man shuffled awkwardly into a halfstanding position and nodded his head an indication took up lu bringing the attention back to himself of the level of teaching which will be available at my university he indicated the man who had opened the conference under the personal control and organisation of my son i intend to provide perhaps the best education in the world for students of any nationality he made a deprecatory gesture with his hands there are some of you who may already know a little about me he said pausing for the laughter that came from the room and smiling with it those that do will be aware of the steadfast conviction and belief that i have advanced whenever possible a conviction and belief that the free democratic world is growing increasingly blind to the dangers of communism he sipped from his water glass i believe there is a need for that warning to be repeated over and over again until people at last begin to take proper notice so upon the university of freedom i will provide something more than a superior education every undergraduate no matter what subject he reads will compulsorily attend daily lectures at which will be fully debated and explained the dangers of the evil pernicious regime which exists upon the mainland of china lu rose for the first time waving his hands to quell the clamour a pernicious regime he repeated the hiss in his voice more obvious because he had to shout which because of its growing acceptance by the free world endangers the very existence of democracy lu remained standing very aware of his stance and the sound of the cameras recording it refusing any questions at last the sound died the university of freedom will be permanently anchored off a small island in the hong kong archipelago he enlarged we will be less than five miles from the chinese mainland a constant and visible reminder to peking of the truth it tries so hard to suppress lu sat nodding to his son it took fifteen minutes to achieve adherence to the system of questioning upon which lu insisted receiving queries first from the american section and then from the european press two hours had been set aside for the conference but it overran by a further two so that the liner had to slow and finally turn back in a meandering arc upon itself to enable the helicopters to get away just before nightfall the discussions with the assembled academics had been purposely shortened to guarantee coverage from the journalists travelling in the liner down the east coast to the panama canal the pride of america stopped at hawaii during its crossing of the pacific and lu chartered another plane to fly in journalists demanding access as the result of the concerted publicity during the voyage the arrival in hong kong was even more dramatic than the departure from new york lu had instructed his tanker and liner fleet to assemble and the pride of america sailed along a fivemile avenue of welcoming hooting vessels all the time it was preceded by two helicopters between which was supported a massive pennant spelling out its new name and on the final mile it had to negotiate fire boats which had introduced dye into their water tanks creating technicolor fountains of greeting it was midmorning before the chinese millionaire and son reached their house on the far side of the peak immediately they entered the sunken lounge a servant brought in tea but it was john lu who solicitously poured it for his father standing back and waiting for an indication of approval very nice said the older man john smiled gratefully the attitude one of constant deference the publicity has been fantastic he said he spoke hopefully anxious his father would agree with the opinion lu nodded its a matter of organisation surely you didnt expect this amount of coverage no admitted lu not even i had expected it to go so well lets hope everything else is as successful said the younger man his father frowned at the doubt without an audience lu rarely smiled surely thats been even more carefully organised it was a reminder not a question yes said john hurriedly of course then weve nothing to worry about i hope not so do i said lu i hope that very much johns nervousness increased at the tone of his fathers voice you mustnt forget continued lu that the whole thing is being done for you i wont forget said the son or be allowed to he knew jenny lin lee had become quiet as the car moved up the winding roads through hong kong heights actually passing the lu mansion and she had realised their destination by the time robert nelson parked outside the repulse bay hotel she was sitting upright in the passenger seat staring directly ahead not here why not you know why not everyone comes here on sunday exactly so why shouldnt we chinese whores arent welcome thats why nelson gripped the wheel not looking at her you know i dont like that word because its the correct one not any more they dont know that she said moving her head towards the open bougainvillaeahedged verandah and the restaurant beyond who gives a damn what they know i do why because i dont want to shame you in their eyes he reached across for her hand but she kept it rigidly against her knee she was shaking he realised i love you jenny he said i know what you were and it doesnt offend me doesnt even interest me any more than what they think interests me she gestured towards the hotel again an angry movement he wasnt a very good liar she decided the rules dont allow it she said what rules he demanded trying to curb the anger the rules by which the british expatriates live she said he laughed trying to relax her she remained stiff in the seat beside him dont be silly he pleaded i know them she insisted had them sweating over me at night and shoving past me in the street with their wives the following morning contemptuous that i exist come on he said determinedly getting out of the vehicle he walked around to the passenger side opening her door she stayed staring ahead come on he repeated she didnt move please he said he had begun to enunciate clearly a man intending to show his words and judgment were unaffected by the midmorning whisky back at the apartment she looked up at him still unable to gauge the effect of drink upon him but with a professional awareness of its dangers its a mistake she warned him no its not he said reaching out for her reluctantly she got out of the car he took her arm leading her to the verandah gazing around defiantly for seats there were two at the end with a poor view of the sunsilvered bay and the township of aberdeen beyond but he hurried to them ahead of another couple who emerged from inside the hotel the waiter was not slow in approaching them but nelson began waving his hands clapping them together for attention and when the drinks were finally served jenny spilled some of hers in the contagious nervousness and then used too much water trying to remove the stain it meant there was a large damp patch on her skirt when they finally walked to the buffet line and then to the table he had reserved conscious of it she walked awkwardly at the table she ate with her head bent over her plate rarely looking up when he tried to speak to her they know she said its like a smell to them no one has even looked at us he tried to reassure her of course not she said they know but to them i do not exist the man whose job it had been to prevent jenny lin lee setting up home with robert nelson and who had failed to frighten her was tied that night beneath the red star ferry that crosses the harbour from kowloon to hong kong island in such a way that by straining upwards he could just keep his mouth free of the water but not far enough for his shouts for help to be heard above the noise of the engine it took several hours before he became completely exhausted and collapsed back into the water to drown and several days before the ropes slackened releasing the body some time later already partially decomposed and attacked by fish it surfaced against the sampans and junks that cling like seaweed to the island side of the harbour knowing it not to be one of them because sampan people never fall into the water and with the gypsies suspicion of the official enquiries it would cause they poled the corpse along from craft to craft until it caught in the currents of the open water near kai tak airport and disappeared out to sea the mans disappearance was never questioned nor wondered at nor reported either seven thousand miles and eight hours apart there was another lunch that sunday as unsuccessful as that of jenny lin lee and robert nelson charlie muffin drove carefully habitually watchful for any car that remained too long behind he was unused to the road too and was looking for the pub accorded three stars in the guide book he hoped to christ it was better than the one the previous week cottage pie made from saturdays meat scraps overwarm beer a bill for and indigestion until wednesday at least it had given him something to think about he sighed annoyed at the increasingly familiar selfpity last time it had almost killed him he glanced behind at the thought checking again and nearly missed what he was looking for the saxon warrior lay back from the road an instant antique of sculpted thatch over mocktudor beams inside he knew there would be mahoganied plastic fruit machines in every bar and men wearing blazers and cravats solving britains economic ills while they felt the milled edges of the coins in their pockets to decide if they could buy the next round of drinks shit said charlie fervently he pulled into the car park and looked at his watch he hadnt time to find an alternative not if he wanted to eat all he had at the flat was cold beef few people saw charlie enter because he didnt want them to and had long ago perfected being unobtrusive he reached the bar between a group of men to his left reallocating britains oil wealth and a circle to his right undermining communist influence in africa the fruit machine was by the toilets the people around had formed a kitty in an effort to recover their money before closing time the barmaid was a blonde tightly corseted woman with the bright smile that barmaids share with politicians charlie estimated she was about twenty years older than the pub whisky said charlie unwilling to risk the beer there would be no danger provided he restricted himself to two and lunch he said when the woman returned with the drink theres mince she offered doubtfully looking behind her to the serving hatch no said charlie at least last week theyd disguised it with instant mashed potato bread and cheese no beef salad the guide book said three stars trouble in the kitchen bad day then afraid so beef salad said charlie resigned hed overcooked the meat at home anyway the barmaid retreated to the kitchen hatch and charlie looked around the bar sipping his drink there were pictures of men in flying gear standing alongside battle of britain aircraft a propeller mounted over the bar and near the counterflap a man who was obviously the landlord stood frequently touching the tips of a moustache that spread like wings across his face mechanic guessed charlie hed never met a world war ii pilot who wore a moustache like that something to do with the oxygen mask professional as the barmaid the landlord isolated a new face and detached himself from the african group moving down the bar as the man approached charlie was aware of the critical examination the man kept any expression of distaste from his face charlie resolved to get his suit pressed and perhaps a new shirt afternoon afternoon sorry about the food fire in the kitchen cant be helped said charlie repaired by next weekend afraid i wont be here then said charlie didnt think i recognised you just passing through just passing through agreed charlie as always never the same place twice always polite but distant in any conversation nice part of the country very attractive been here since said the landlord hand moving automatically to his moustache straight after the war then said charlie joining in the performance why not he thought more or less you serve bit too young said charlie berlin airlift was around my time not the same dismissed the man so ive heard had a good war said the landlord bloody good war charlie avoided any reaction to the cliche it sounded as obscene now as it had when he first heard it the bastard who had taken over the department had had a good war and tried to continue it by setting him up to be killed there were a lot who didnt said charlie the landlord looked at him curiously alert for mocker then relaxed sorry for them he said insincerely i enjoyed my time his glass was empty charlie saw he pushed it across to halt the reminiscence could i have another large certainly charlie knew the man would expect to be bought a drink but he decided against it even though it was the first conversation he had had for more than twentyfour hours he wondered how the man would react to know he was serving whisky to someone technically a traitor to his country the landlord returned with the drink and waited expectantly thank you said charlie there was an almost imperceptible shrug as the man took the money and returned charlie his change what line of business are you in then he asked lapsing into the pub formula traveller said charlie it seemed the best description of the aimless life he now led even before edith had been killed they had done little else but move nervously from one place to another interesting said the publican as automatically as he fingered the moustache sometimes agreed charlie the woman returned with the salad the meat had been carefully cut to conceal the dried edges looks very nice said charlie insincerity appeared to be infectious then again it was always dangerous to draw attention to himself even over something as trivial as complaining about a bad meal in a country pub he manoeuvred himself on to a barstool and the landlord nodded and walked back to his group charlie sawed resolutely at the meat examining his attitude what right had he to criticise a man for whom the war had been the biggest experience of his life or feel contempt for opinionated sunday lunchtime drinkers charlie was always honest with himself because now there was no one else with whom he could share the trait and he knew bloody well that he would have gladly handed over the fortune he possessed to change places with any one of them walking stiffkneed back to their detached whitepainted executivestyle homes to worry about their mortgages and their school fees and their secretaries becoming pregnant his attitude wasnt really contempt he recognised it was envy envy for people who had wives and mistresses and friends there was only one person whom charlie could even think of as a friend and there had been no contact from rupert willoughby for over a year so perhaps he was even exaggerating that association he pushed away the meal halfeaten and immediately the barmaid took his plate like that she said very nice said charlie it was nearly closing time she would be in a hurry to get away he hesitated decided against another drink and paid his bill another and he was regarded as someone who had stolen money back in the car he sat for a moment undecided if he took the b roads and drove slowly it would be at least seven before he got back to london on the balcony of his apartment high on the islands middle level robert nelson stood glass in hand fantastic he said looking down at the pride of america the liner was an open jewelcase of glittering lights because it was late the slur was more noticeable in his voice beside him jenny lin lee said nothing ive taken six million of the cover he announced suddenly what she asked turning to him he smiled at her wanting to boast lu put the insurance out on the open market christ you should have seen the scramble but you got of it yes he said missing the urgency in her voice beat the bloody lot of them he frowned at her lack of reaction i thought youd be pleased he complained petulant in his drunkenness no one else got anything like that much theres already been a cable of congratulation from london signed by willoughby himself even promised a bonus on top of the commission if its important for you then im pleased she said turning away from the balcony and the view of the floodlit ship shifting slowly at anchor he followed her into the room sometimes he said i find it completely impossible to understand you she stood in the middle of the room a slim almost frail figure the hair which she constantly used for dramatic effect cascading to her waist because she knew he liked it worn that way and it was inherent in her to please the man she was with she walked to him smiling for the first time cupping his head and pulling his face to hers i love you robert she said really love you he held her at arms length looking at her why tell me that he asked because i wanted you to know the noise of the explosion woke nelson and the girl four nights later as it woke nearly everyone on the island and the kowloon waterfront by the time nelson got to the balcony the flames were already spurting from the stem and as he watched there was a noise like a belch and the blaze gushed through the main funnels of the pride of america a gradual glow in the stern was the first indication that there was fire there too then one of the plates split and huge orange gouts burst out like a giant exhaust oh my god said nelson softly he was very sober beside him the girl remained silent because it was dark neither could see that the water with which the fire boats were already attacking the blaze was still stained with the welcoming dye it looked like blood lu had wanted to hold his press conference on the pride of america but the engineroom explosions had blown away plates below the waterline settling the liner to topdeck level in the water and the harbour surveyors forbade the meeting as too dangerous instead the shipowner led a small flotilla of boats out to the still smoking blackened hull wheeling around and around in constant focus for the cameras the customary silk suit concealed beneath protective oilskins and the hardhat defiantly inscribed the university of freedom john lu was by his side the millionaire waited four days after the fire for the maximum number of journalists to gather and then took over the main conference room in the mandarin hotel to accommodate them he entered still carrying the hat and put it down on the table so that the title would show in any photographs he was more impatient than at previous conferences striding up and down the specially installed platform calling almost angrily into the microphone for the room to settle finally disregarding the noise he began to talk not a fortnight ago he said i welcomed many of you aboard that destroyed liner out there he swept his hand towards the windows through which the outline of the ship was visible and i announced the purpose to which i was going to put it the room was quiet now the only movement from radio reporters adjusting their sound levels properly to record what lu was saying this morning he started again you have accompanied me into the harbour to see what remains of a once beautiful and proud liner he turned to the table taking a sheet of paper from a waiting aide this he declared is the surveyors preliminary report copies will be made available to you individually as you leave this room but i can sum it up for you in just two words totally destroyed he turned again throwing the paper on to the table and taking another held out in readiness for him this time by john lu this is another report that of investigators who have for the past four days examined the ship to discover the cause of the fire continued lu this will also be made available but again i will summarise it he indicated behind him to where two men in uniform sat files on their knees and i have asked the men who prepared the report to attend with me today should there later at this conference be any questions you might like to put to them their findings are quite simple the pride of america has been totally destroyed as the result of carefully planned carefully instigated acts of arson he raised his hand ahead of the reaction to the announcement arson he went on devised so that it guaranteed the pride of america would never be put to the use which i intended he referred to the report in his hand large quantity of inflammable material spread throughout cabins in the forward section he quoted sprinkler system disconnected and inoperative and fire doors jammed to prevent closure debris of two explosive devices in the engine room together with more inflammable material ensuring immediate and possibly uncontrollable fire kerosene introduced into the sprinkler system at the rear of the vessel so that the fire would actually be fed by those attempting to extinguish it he looked up for what he was saying to be assimilated provable incontrovertible facts he said as provable and as incontrovertible as this again the aide was waiting handing to lu a length of twisted apparently partially melted metal about a foot long the millionaire held it before him turning to the photographers shouted requests there is some lettering upon the side he said indicating it with his finger and once more holding the metal for the benefit of the cameramen a translation will be made available together with all the other documents to which ive referred today but again i will summarise it for you this is part of the outer casing of an incendiary device it was found together with other evidence still in the possession of the hong kong police in the engine room the lettering positively identifies it as manufactured in the peoples republic of china lu returned the casing to the table behind him happy now for the noise to build up arson he shouted above the clamour arson committed by a country frightened of having the free world constantly reminded of the evils of its doctrine he snatched again for the incendiary casing their former leader mao tsetung once preached that power comes from the barrel of a gun this is the proof of that doctrine he slumped back against the table reaching out for the instantly available glass of water and throughout the room more aides began moving with microphones so that questions would be heard by everyone do you feel fully justified in making the accusations that you have today was the first from an unseen woman at the back lu led the mocking laughter that broke out ive rarely felt so justified in doing anything in my life he said is it possible for a country to sue someone for defamation of character if it is then i shall be happy to accept any writ from the peoples republic of china will you attempt to buy another vessel to create another university of freedom asked the new york times correspondent and have it burned out within days that blackened hulk out there can speak as eloquently as any political lecturer of the dangers i wanted to publicise what about the professors whom you had already engaged demanded the same questioner they were employed upon a years contract in every case that contract has been honoured in full and firstclass air fares made available to return them to whichever country they choose how much has all this cost i have never made any secret of the fact that i purchased the pride of america for does that mean youve lost that amount of money queried an englishman representing the far east economic review of course not international maritime regulations insist that all vessels be properly insured so the is recoverable certainly i shall eventually be reimbursed for the purchase of the vessel but that gentlemen isnt important what is important is for the world to recognise the flagrant reaction of a country terrified of the truth and the lengths to which it is prepared to go to prevent that truth who were the insurers asked the englishman the cover was spread amongst a syndicate of lloyds of london is the claim already submitted probably said lu dismissively ive left the matter in the hands of my lawyers two days after lus heavily publicised conference an announcement was made in the name of chief superintendent sydney johnson of the hong kong police as a result of intensive enquiries since the arson aboard the pride of america it said hong kong detectives had arrested two chinese who had been employed aboard the vessel for its modification refit investigation had shown them to be mainland chinese who had illegally crossed the border into hong kong only six months previously their families still resided in shanghai on this occasion lu did not summon a conference instead he issued a brief statement without wishing to prejudice any court hearing it said the police announcement was regarded as proof of every claim made by mr l w lu who looked forward with interest to a full judicial examination of the arrested men both men were hesitant each unsure of the other i wasnt sure if youd come said rupert willoughby charlie muffin walked farther into the underwriters office taking the outstretched hand never thought id get past the secretary said charlie indicating the outer office shes a little overprotective at times apologised willoughby it was easy to understand his secretarys reluctance charlie wore the sort of concertinaed suit he remembered from their every encounter like a helper behind the secondhand clothes stall at a salvation army hostel the thatch of strawish hair was still disordered about his face and the hush puppies were as scuffed and downatheel as ever your call surprised me said charlie willoughby was the only person who possessed his telephone number or the knowledge of what he had once been and done i had decided youd never call he added i almost didnt admitted willoughby so youre in trouble big trouble agreed willoughby i dont see any way of getting out which makes me the last resort yes said the underwriter i suppose it does rupert willoughby was a tall ungainly man constantly selfconscious about his height he took great care with his tailoring trying to minimise his stature but then defeated any effort of his tailor in an attempt to reduce it even further by hunching awkwardly he crouched now untidy his blond hair flopping over his forehead as he bent over his desk occasionally referring to a file as he outlined the details of the pride of america cover every so often jerking up to the other man as if in expectation of some reaction beyond the desk charlie sat with his legs splayed before him head sunk upon his chest by twisting his left foot very slightly charlie could see that the repair hadnt worked and that the sole of his left shoe was parting from the uppers which was a bloody nuisance it meant a new pair and those he was wearing were at last properly moulded to his feet it always seemed to happen like that just when they got comfortable looked like rain too and so concluded willoughby my proportion of the syndicate makes me liable for yes said charlie it appears you are how much the man resembled his father thought charlie nostalgically practically an identical style of setting out a problem an orderly collection of facts from which any opinion or assessment was kept rigidly apart so that no preconceptions could be formed sir archibald willoughby who had headed the department during almost all of charlies operational career and whom charlie realised without embarrassment he had come to regard as a fatherfigure had obviously groomed his real son very carefully its a lot of money to lose said the underwriter the figure was too large to consider seriously decided charlie he looked sideways how much space in the room would occupy he wondered idly the whole bookcase and the sidetable certainly probably overflow on to the couch as well and you want to avoid paying out willoughby stared across the desk his hand was twitching charlie saw it might be difficult said the underwriter hurriedly the admission embarrassed him and he actually blushed you havent got your share demanded charlie no christ its only temporary said willoughby defensively weve had a very bad two years whole series of setbacks but why take the risk in the first place i had to insisted willoughby a firm can be wiped out in a creditors rush by no more than a city rumour that its in financial difficulties besides which there seemed no risk youre a bloody fool said charlie that knowledge doesnt help either said willoughby your father left a fortune remembered charlie already gone loans then theres hardly a bank where i dont have an overdraft and where i havent gone over the limit so so unless theres a nearmiracle theres nothing that can stop me being drummed out of the exchange nobody knows nobody yet but it wont take long this sort of news never does whats the legal opinion of lus claim we are completely liable said willoughby no room for manoeuvre willoughby shook his head we might have had a chance had we included a political sabotage clause the sort of thing thats been introduced into aircraft cover since hijacking started why didnt you because its not normal in case of ship cover and i was in too much of a hurry to sign the policy why nelson managed to negotiate a per cent premium for lloyds thats very high i needed the liquidity whos nelson our hong kong agent good he got more of the cover than anyone else when it was put on the hong kong market why why what why more than anybody else and at such a good premium because hes better i suppose or because he tried harder whats he like unusual chap remembered the underwriter ive only met him three times colonial through and through born in india father a governor of a minor state there before independence only time spent in england was at school eton and then cambridge hes so out of place here that two years ago he cut short the paid home leave that we allow our overseas men made some excuse about the climate reliable absolutely what does he say willoughby paused at the staccato questioning its so straightforward that he doesnt even see the need for an investigation he said but you do willoughby leaned towards him ive got to try he said ive got to try anything the soulbaring would be difficult for the man charlie knew hed hate admitting to being anything less than his father had been how long before youve got to pay asked charlie willoughby made a movement of uncertainty lus lawyers have already filed an intention to claim we could probably delay until the two men who have been arrested are found guilty but even to attempt that might create a dispute i gather theyve made a full admission so you havent much time i havent much of anything said willoughby time least of all the last resort repeated charlie there was no point in buggering about and willoughby appeared to appreciate honesty anyway yes agreed the underwriter would you have avoided contacting me if you could willoughby paused then he admitted yes if i had had a choice i wouldnt have made the call most people would have lied recognised charlie unoffended the man was trying to retain his integrity anxious though he was well said willoughby he couldnt keep the plea out of his voice so much of his life had been spent getting hold of the shitty end of the stick that nobody else wanted to touch reflected charlie how he wished the approach had come through friendship reminiscent of the mans father rather than desperation why should i he said why make people crawl charlie why bully the part of him that had always embarrassed edith most he remembered the part his wife didnt like and was always trying to correct willoughby winced imagining a refusal no reason he accepted the sort of things you once did he paused recalling what charlie had done it was silly of me he said i should have realised you couldnt do it that it would be too dangerous for you because of what happened you expect me to because of my relationship with your father i hoped youd try to help as the last resort please said willoughby charlie stopped suddenly angry with himself he shouldnt do it certainly not to a man whose father had befriended him to the degree that sir archibald had inverted snobbery another of ediths accusations almost correct too sir archibald had recognised it properly warned him about it even inferiority complex charlie not the confidence everyone imagines why charlie and charlie couldnt answer because he hadnt known himself not then not until it was too late im sorry he said youve a right to be offended willoughby accepted it was madness of me to think of you after all youve been through not really said charlie you didnt put up barriers when i asked you for help once that had been after charlie was stupid enough to make a pilgrimage to sir archibalds grave british intelligence had picked him up there and started the pursuit what logic said it had been all right for them to set him up to be killed in east berlin then label him a renegade to be hunted and assassinated because he had fought back and exposed them for their stupidity only willoughby had understood because the same men had caused his fathers suicide so only willoughby had helped not true he corrected himself edith had helped as she had always done and now edith was dead believing he had been rejected willoughby said id appreciate your not mentioning this to anyone i havent said i wont help said charlie willoughby blinked his eagerness almost childishly obvious in his face you could get to hong kong he asked hurriedly i mean there wouldnt be any difficulty with about your identity charlie smiled at the other mans renewed embarrassment the passport is genuine enough he said it was the documents that obtained it that were phoney work again thought charlie different from what hed been used to but still work it would be good to get back and to end those aimless sunday drives id need the full authority of your company said charlie id never get official help without it of course willoughby assured him and ill let nelson know youre coming ask him to give you every assistance charlie stood and thank you said willoughby theres no guarantee that ill find anything to help you warned charlie it seems as straightforward as nelson has said but you might said the underwriter the man was more desperate than he had imagined thought charlie as he emerged into the secretarys office the summer rain suddenly burst against the window and he remembered the split sole wheres the nearest shoe shop he said the girl looked up at charlie in hostile bewilderment a what shoe shop repeated charlie supporting himself against her desk he raised his feet so she could see the gap need a new pair he said unnecessarily the girl pressed back against her chair face frozen in contempt im sure i really have no idea she said charlie lowered his foot but remained leaning on her desk never make a girl guide he said and youll never make a comedian it would have to stop now he was trying to score off secretaries just because they had posh accents and losing at first robert nelson had tolerated jennys insistence regarding it more as something like a secret intimacy between them but as the months had passed and she had maintained the demand he had come to regard it as a humiliation to them both she sat waiting on the opposite side of the table beside her lay the wallet various pouches unzipped and ready housekeeping he said counting out the money he watched her put it carefully into the top section of her wallet sipping from his drink hed managed at last to persuade her there was no need for written details of the household accounts so perhaps the other thing wouldnt be difficult dress allowance he said she nodded smiling he took another drink both hands clasped around his glass she sat waiting please robert she said frowning why for gods sake his annoyance broke through so that he spoke louder than he had intended please she said again he put the glass aside determined against another outburst spacing his words in an effort to convince her apart from a stupid piece of paper you are my wife he said gently i love you and want you to stay with me always i know she said then why because its always been since i was young its its obscene he protested realising he had failed again please she persisted angrily he pushed into his pocket bringing out more notes and thrusting them on to the table i love you money thank you she said putting the money into a waiting pouch how long would it take wondered nelson for her to forget what she had once been it was the tie that registered with charlie long before robert nelson got near enough for a formal greeting so long ago thought charlie yet so easily recalled blue stripes upon blue at an angle the two men who had set him up to be killed on the east berlin border had been to eton and like robert nelson had always worn their ties no matter the colour of their suits an identification symbol like road signs something to be recognised by everyone theyd mocked his grammar school accent and the way hed dressed so theyd underestimated him dismissing him as an anachronism a perfect sacrifice and been so disastrously wrong only one of them had survived and that one had been disgraced twice but he would still be wearing the tie wherever he was charlie knew ive kept you waiting apologised nelson reaching him at last through the airport crowd ive only just cleared customs charlie assured him immediately conscious of the swirl of harassed agitation in which the insurance broker moved a strangely pale almost flakyskinned man robert nelson was sweating despite the thin suit and the partial airconditioning so that the wisped receding hair was smeared over his forehead accentuating the pallor even before their handshake had ended he was gesturing impatiently to porters whom charlie had already engaged sighing with frustration at people who had innocently intruded themselves between the luggage and twice muttering sorry so very sorry to charlie in regret for some imagined hindrance the airconditioning was better within the confined space of the waiting car and nelson mopped his face and hands with an already damp handkerchief smiling across the vehicle it was an apprehensive expression decided charlie why he wondered i knew there would be an investigation announced nelson as if confirming an earlier discussion just knew it routine surely said charlie he looked at his watch whiskybreathed at ten in the morning but youre not one of the normal investigators director level willoughby said no said charlie not a normal investigator despite his assurances to willoughby there was still a risk that someone would discover just how different he knew his hand still had the slight shake that had started when he had approached the passport and immigration desks at the airport nelson appeared to be expecting more but when charlie didnt continue he pointed through the window you can just see the pride of america he said charlie gazed out into the bay getting a brief view of the hull before the car dipped into the tunnel that would take them beneath the harbour to hong kong island looks a very dead ship said charlie it is any scrap value less than a million i would estimate i believe the japanese are already interested quite a difference from yes agreed nelson as if appreciating some hidden point quite a difference the vehicle emerged from the tunnel and turned along the connaught road towards the mandarin hotel to the right towards kowloon the seemingly disordered slick of sampans and junks locked one to another and stretched far out into the bay from the harbour edge so tight was the jam that it was impossible to identify occupant with craft and the impression was of constant heaving movement like a waterborne anthill theyre called the floating people said nelson its said that some are born live and die without ever coming ashore charlie turned to his left looking inland a mile away first the middle level then the heights jutted upwards to the peak the apartment blocks and villas glued against the rock edges easy to judge the wealth here said nelson nodding in the direction in which charlie was looking the higher you live the richer you are what about lu one of the richest taipans in the entire colony said nelson hes got a villa on the other side of the peak at shousan hill like a fortress why a fortress ensure his privacy i thought lu enjoyed exposure and publicity exactly said nelson it makes him an obvious target for every crank and crook in asia nelson flustered around the arrival at the hotel urging bellboys over the bags and actually cupping charlies elbow to guide him into the hotel the broker hovered beside him while he registered instantly chiding the porters when they turned from the reception desk charlie sighed nelsons attitude could very easily become a pain in the ass he thought it was the briefest of impressions as they waited for the elevator but charlie had been trained to react to such feelings and he twisted abruptly examining the foyer what is it demanded nelson conscious of the sudden movement nothing said charlie hed always had an instinct about surveillance but this time he had to be wrong how could he be so quickly under observation and from whom there was no reason he was jetlagged and irritated by nelsons constant attention that was it the lift arrived and charlie started to enter then hesitated hed survived by responding to impressions as fleeting as this and while hed changed vocations the need for survival remained more so now that hed come out of hiding sure theres nothing wrong said nelson charlie stared back into the bustling foyer quite sure he said still uncertain nelson had reserved him a suite and charlie examined it appreciatively never got this on civil service grade iv allowance he muttered selfconversation was a habit he never bothered to curb it usually became more pronounced when he was worried what asked nelson thinking aloud said charlie obviously robert nelson had no idea of his companys financial difficulties i had a bar installed pointed out nelson hopefully help yourself charlie invited him you too tired after the flight said charlie watching the other man reach for the whisky islay malt he saw sir archibald had been drinking that when hed gone to his retirement home in sussex the day before setting off to entrap the bastards who had taken over the department and reduced it to an apology of what it had once been thered been bottles of it in a sittingroom cupboard the poor old sod had fallen into a drunken sleep and not been aware when he had left according to the inquest report sir archibald had even swilled the barbiturates down with it i specified a room with a view of the harbour and kowloon said nelson by the window thank you said charlie the ship too yes agreed nelson everywhere i look im reminded of that damned ship charlie turned curious at the bitterness and beyond the new territories is china continued nelson with his back to the room i know youve been to hong kong before no said charlie quickly alert to questions about his past incidentally said nelson apparently unaware of charlies apprehensive reaction australia are for the broker had turned back into the suite and charlie stared at him in astonishment what he said the test said the broker disconcerted by charlies lack of response we get the reports on the bbc world service oh said charlie and no doubt discussed the finer points in clubs and at cocktail parties and couldnt have located lords or the oval without a street map youre not interested in cricket not really admitted charlie what was it that the man was finding so much difficulty in saying nelson looked at his glass appearing surprised that it was empty go ahead gestured charlie nelson remained at the portable bar looking across the room im to be dismissed arent i he demanded suddenly charlie frowned at him what thats why youve come someone whos not a normal investigator a director youve come to fire me because there was no qualifying clause in the policy the fear tumbled from the man the words blurred together in his anxiety of course i havent said charlie he reached down easing off his shoes you must excuse me he said theyre new pinch like hell nelson gazed at the other man controlling the look that had begun to settle on his face old etonians didnt take their shoes off in public decided charlie careful that was an antagonism of an earlier time yours was not the final decision on the policy he reminded him straightening you drew it up certainly and admittedly its an expensive oversight that there was no political sabotage clause but london gave the final approval youre not being held responsible i find that difficult to believe i negotiated it after all very successfully according to willoughby nelson moved away from the bar his suspicion of the remark obvious what do you mean wasnt per cent high comparatively so thats exactly what i want to do compare what were the other premiums i dont know said nelson uncomfortably it was sealed bids lu kept me waiting until the very last moment wanted more time all done in a terrible rush really so convinced was he of dismissal that despite charlies attempted reassurance nelson was still offering a defence and you havent enquired about the other premiums nelson shook his head embarrassed at the oversight another cause for complaint he said resigned ive told you no ones blaming you repeated charlie he would telephone willoughby to get a confirmatory letter itll be a disaster for the firm wont it demanded nelson more than you know thought charlie if they have to pay he said the qualification penetrated the other mans nervousness and he came closer to where charlie was sitting if ive flown seven thousand miles to decide if we should charlie reminded him but weve no grounds for resisting settlement said nelson not yet agreed charlie do you think i havent examined every single thing thats happened since the damned explosion nelson reacted as if his ability were being questioned afresh theres nothing wrong with lus claim not a bloody thing but you still dont know what the other premiums were im sorry said nelson exasperation breaking through can you find out the other companies might not want to disclose them isnt there an old boy network demanded charlie surely there were more bluepatterned ties in hong kong nelson hesitated before replying ill try he promised but i dont see what it would prove might not prove anything admitted charlie then again it might be interesting i think we should look a little deeper thats all get under the surface nelson went back to the window looking now not out over the harbour but down into the streets far below this might be an english colony he reflected but its china down there in almost everything but name he turned back to charlie westerners arent allowed beneath any surface here were tolerated thats all nowhere can be as closed as that protested charlie hong kong is insisted nelson believe me if there were anything wrong with the fire we wouldnt learn about it from the chinese community but there isnt anything wrong as far as youre concerned nelson shook his head i wish there were he said god knows ive tried hard enough to find something but the evidence is overwhelming the police are being cooperative theyve no reason not to be with a case like theyve got he indicated a briefcase ive brought the file for you charlie smiled his thanks so you think well have to pay out nelsons belief that the fire was uncontestable would have been another reason for imagining that a directorial visit was to announce his dismissal realised charlie i know well have to pay confirmed the broker lucky lu never suffers a misfortune that costs him money lucky his wealth started with some deals that turned out spectacularly successful on the hong kong stock exchange its been lucky lu for as long as i can remember sounds like a poofs favourite lavatory reflected charlie massaging his feet it would take weeks to break in those damned shoes it was fortunate he had postponed having the supports put in youre very different from what i expected said nelson suddenly i think other people are going to be surprised too other people i assumed youd want to see the police chief names johnson i mentioned your coming and i told lus people as well willoughby asked me to give you all the help i could thanks said charlie hed have preferred announcing his own presence youre annoyed said nelson detecting the reservation in charlies voice and growing immediately apprehensive no lied charlie poor bugger seemed worried at his own shadow but then so were they all for differing reasons is there anything else i can do charlie shook his head i suppose id better study the file and get some sleep the broker stayed for another drink then left promising to collect charlie the following morning so they could attend the remand hearing of the two chinese accused of arson alone charlie closed all the curtains against the view and the sunlight put a do not disturb notice outside the room and decided the file could wait he slept for about five hours and then woke knowing it was still not midnight hong kong time and that he had long hours of sleeplessness ahead of him edith would have enjoyed the luxury of the apartment he thought feeling his eyes cloud in the darkness and tried so hard to conceal her concern at the cost poor edith always so aware of the money and of his resentment at her inheritance sufficient to support them both and it had been resentment he recognised the perpetual feeling idiotic childlike resentment he could even recall the words hed shouted at her careless of the hurt when she had suggested he simply retire from the service that had decided he was expendable and live on her wealth and dont patronise me with your money like youve always patronised me with your breeding that was why he had inveigled america into the border deal and then disappeared with the defection fund to ensure there would never be any dependence upon her why in gods name hadnt he realised how truly dependent he had been instead of turning them both into exiles terrified of every footstep im sorry darling he said so very sorry he didnt want to spend more than a month in hong kong the grave would become too overgrown if he stayed away any longer sighing he snapped on the light and pulled the file towards him hed be bloody tired in the morning he knew there had been two supplementary reports to the original account from the cias asian station in hong kong and then a separate analysis prepared by specialists at the langley headquarters in virginia well demanded the director certainly looks like peking judged the deputy odd though facts are there weve got to be sure of course why dont we send in someone with no preconceptions to work independent of the station they wont like it im more interested in being able to advise the president and the secretary of state that china is growing careless of detente than i am in the feelings of some station personnel said the director sharply who asked the deputy someone whos keen anxious to prove himself harvey jones heard the telephone ringing as he pedalled up qstreet at the end of his daily fivemile ride he sprinted the last few yards ran up the steps and fumbled the key into the lock to snatch the phone off the rest as the ringing was about to stop there you are said the deputy director annoyed at being kept waiting thought for a moment that you were going to miss the chance of a lifetime the authorities had not anticipated the interest in the remand hearing and had only assigned one of the smaller courts with limited seating so that entry had to be controlled by permit i managed to get two reported nelson in the car taking them to the administrative building it wasnt easy though the press are screaming for all the seats we were lucky then said charlie like the tie the broker retained the harassed anxiety of the previous day and a dampness was already softening his shirt and suit into creases the man was still unconvinced his job was safe it was the discovery of the other premiums charlie knew youre quite sure that the rest were only per cent nelson saw the reiteration as criticism he was annoyed too that such an obvious enquiry hadnt occurred to him in advance of the mans arrival from london yes he said tightly those i could find out about anyway still convinced that theres nothing strange about the fire said charlie its odd conceded nelson odd enough to look further ive told you how difficult that will be theres the police said charlie and the personal danger in approaching them overcautious he told himself how could there be any danger here in hong kong it was he recognised an apprehension of authority any authority it would always be with him like so many other fears the car began to slow at the approach to the administrative buildings it shouldnt last long said nelson remand hearings usually dont youve been to a lot charlie tensed then relaxed there was no danger in the admission quite a few he said but not the sort nelson imagined in the past it had always involved sneaking through side doors and adjoining buildings to avoid the surveillance and cameras of those uncaptured at the official secrets trials of those who had been caught and who nearly always reminded charlie of the grey anonymous people at rushhour bus queues which was why he supposed they had made such good spies until he had exposed them have you anything planned for tonight asked nelson abruptly charlie turned to him in the car theres a very good pekingstyle restaurant in the gloucester road and jenny and i wondered if youd like to be our guest chinatown with english country street names reflected charlie why he wondered had nelson blurted the invitation with even more urgency than was customary jenny he queried my shes someone i live with said nelson awkwardly as if the qualification were necessary he added jenny lin lee id like very much to eat with you said charlie again the need for hurried words there was embarrassment mixed with nelsons permanent agitation because of the crush around the building they left the car some distance away and as soon as they began walking charlie felt the prickle of unseen attention he stared around quickly as he had in the hotel foyer but again could detect nothing apprehension of the cameras he decided as they got to the steps expertly charlie manoeuvred himself behind nelson watching for a casually pointed lens which might record him in the background of a picture and lead to an accidental identification from someone with a long memory it was cooler inside the building although nelson did not appear to benefit theres the police chief he said pointing across the entrance hall to a tall heavily built man superintendent johnson called the broker the man turned a very mannered slow movement like willoughby the policeman had an affectation involving his height but unlike the underwriter johnson accentuated his size leaning slightly back and gazing down with his chin against his chest calculated always to make the person he was addressing feel inferior the senior colleague from london about whom i told you announced nelson johnson examined charlie senior colleague he queried pointedly he was immaculate uniform uncreased buttons gleaming and the collar so heavily starched it was already scoring a red line around his neck yes confirmed nelson appearing unaware of the condescension hesitantly johnson offered his hand charlie smiled remembering nelsons remark of the previous evening about the surprise of people he would encounter underestimated again he thought contentedly investigating the fire added nelson without thinking johnsons reaction was immediate it has already been investigated he said stiffly and satisfactorily concluded of course said charlie smoothly these things are routine johnson continued staring at him unconsciously the man was wiping his hand against the side of his trousers ever been in the force invited johnson another recognition symbol decided charlie like a tie no he admitted it meant a closed door he knew scotland yard announced johnson as if producing a reference fifteen years never an unsolved case just like this one johnson put his head to one side trying to detect the sarcasm yes he said just like this one i rather wondered if it might be possible for you and me to meet at your convenience obviously said charlie ive already made all the relevant material available to mr nelson said the superintendent i know said charlie ive read your reports youve really been most helpful there are just one or two things that seem unusual ive a busy diary of course flattered charlie pompous prick lot of commitments it wouldnt take more than fifteen minutes persisted charlie theres a huge sum of money involved after all talk to my secretary johnson capitulated we will see what we can do tomorrow youre very kind said charlie between what would he be fitted he wondered golf and the yacht club lunch an usher announced that the court was about to convene interrupting them there was a slow shuffle through the entrance bottlenecked by two of johnsons officers scrutinising the entry tickets nelson and charlie were allocated to the well of the tiny court just to the left and below the dock charlie twisted as the men were arraigned looking up at them why was it that criminals never had the stature expected of their crimes the two accused chinese entered the dock cowed and frightened heads twitching like animals suspecting a trap about to close behind them one wore just trousers and vest and the second had a jacket grimed and shapeless from constant use over a collarless shirt the mans trousers were supported by cord charlie recognised the opium habit from the yellowed jaundiced look of their eyes their bodies vibrated with the denial imposed since their arrest charlie turned away stopping at the sight of johnson rigidly upright and towering above the other policemen at the far side of the dock the sort of man judged charlie who would stand up before he farted in the bath probably at attention johnson looked directly at him his face blank at the demand from the usher the court stood for the entry of the magistrate immediately he was seated the clerk announced that the accusation would be read first in english then translated into cantonese for the benefit of the accused the charge against you began the official looking first to the dock and then back to the charge sheet is that on june you did jointly commit an offence of arson namely that you did secrete aboard a liner known as the pride of america incendiary devices and that further you did separately and together ignite at various situations aboard the said liner quantities of inflammable material further it is alleged that you interfered with the fire precaution systems upon the said liner in such a way that additional quantities of inflammable material were introduced into the flames he stopped handing the sheet to the chinese interpreter the man began the accusation but was almost immediately stopped by a noise which charlie later realised must have been the sound of the first man falling he turned at the scuffling movement in time to see the warders move forward to try to prevent the second chinese in the crumpled jacket from collapsing beneath the dock rail there was a moment of complete shocked silence broken only by the unseen sound from the dock of strained almost screaming attempts to breathe and then it was overwhelmed by the babble that erupted as reporters tried to get nearer the dock to look in then there was another commotion as superintendent johnson began bellowing at his policemen to restore order a warder emerged from below the rail and there was a second momentary lull in the noise dead he announced theyre both dead he spoke apologetically as if he might in some way be blamed for it superintendent johnson succeeded in interposing constables between the dock and people trying to stare in then more officers arrived to clear the court it was not until they were back in the vestibule that nelson and charlie were able to extract themselves from the hurrying funnel of people what the hell does that mean demanded nelson charlie considered the question it means he said that there wont be a trial i dont understand protested the broker no admitted charlie neither do i not yet suddenly it seemed that there was going to be very little difference between what he was attempting to do now and what he had done in the past would he still be as good he wondered the photograph of charlie muffin was passed slowly around the inner council then finally returned to the chairman such a nondescript man said the chairman yes agreed chiu incredible yes said chiu again so the insurers arent as satisfied as the police apparently not such a nondescript man repeated the chairman going back to the photograph their formicatopped table had been separated from others in the restaurant by wheelmounted plastic screens trundled squeakily across the bareboarded floors and they had sat upon canvasbacked chairs but the food had been magnificent it was decided charlie a chinese restaurant for discerning chinese it was good enquired jenny lin lee anxiously superb said charlie honestly smiling at her she hesitated then smiled back a man trained to see through the veil that people erect at first encounters he was intrigued by the girl her frailty was practically waiflike yet he felt none of the protectiveness that would have been a natural response instead he was suspicious of it imagining a barrier created with more guile than most people were capable of a professionalism in fact but at what could she be professional her hair obviously very long was coiled thickly but demurely in a bun at the back of her head she wore hardly any makeup just a touch of colour to her lips and looked more like nelsons daughter than his mistress certainly the broker behaved protectively towards her but there was another attitude too a discomfort decided charlie definitely a discomfort charlie was aware that he had held back because of his uncertainty contributing to the awkwardness of the meal would have tasted better with this insisted nelson thickly raising his minute drinking thimble charlie had refused the mao tai preferring beer jenny had chosen tea so the insurance broker had consumed nearly all the bottle nothing like whisky though said nelson as if the qualification were necessary thats what they call it you know chinese whisky yes said charlie theres no better restaurant in the colony for peking duck said jenny quickly shed realised nelsons increasing drunkenness and moved hurriedly to take attention from the man they seemed equally protective towards one another thought charlie it appeared an odd relationship but then who was he to judge hed never managed a proper relationship in his life and now he would never have the chance it really was very good he said its cooked over charcoal and basted in honey she said australia are for by the way said nelson adding to his thimble he looked over the table grinning apologetically sorry he said forgot youre not a cricket fan what are you interested in asked jenny another rescue attempt thought charlie hardly anything he shrugged there must be something persisted the girl should have been thought charlie ediths complaint too the one he thought he could solve with the appropriated money enjoy ourselves now edith my money not yours nothing we cant do except stay alive and hed killed her by being bloody stupid hed killed her as surely as if hed pressed the trigger and he wouldnt forget it he knew not for a single minute of a single day no said charlie nothing new discomfort grew up between them at the collapse of the conversation covered within minutes by the arrival of a waiter clearing dishes and the rotating table centre upon which they had been arranged jenny waited until fresh tea and more cups had been set out and then excused herself pushing through the screen very little to stay for thought charlie jennys a very lovely girl he said dutifully of course she is said nelson charlie frowned both at the choice of words and the truculence nelson was quite drunk now weve learned about the per cent i know ill be dismissed for this damned policy declared the broker obstinately he was gazing down into his cup talking more to himself than to charlie ive told you charlie started but nelson talked on unheeding and then theyll laugh my god how theyll laugh who demanded charlie people said nelson looking at him for the first time all the people thats wholl laugh at what for christs sake jenny and me but to my face then not like now behind my back but why because they consider robert has strayed outside a wellordered system charlie turned at the girls voice she was standing just inside the screen she must have realised they had been discussing her yet she was quite composed sorry mumbled nelson very sorry just talking i think its time we left she said to nelson the tenderness in her expression was the first unguarded feeling she had permitted herself all evening yes agreed nelson realising he had created an embarrassment time to go home he tried to get his wallet from his pocket but jenny took it easily from him settling the bill she seemed practised in looking after him nelson walked unsteadily between them out into gloucester road there was a taxi at the kerbside and the broker slumped into it sitting with his head thrown back eyes closed he doesnt usually drink this much apologised the girl it doesnt matter said charlie oh it does she said urgently you mustnt think hes like this all the time hes not normally its because hes worried about dismissal i know ive tried to make him understand but he wont listen it would mean the end of everything for him to be fired she didnt appear to believe him either thought charlie what the hell did he have to do to convince them he tried to explain to me back in the restaurant but it was difficult for him she seemed to consider the remark then she said speaking more to herself than to charlie yes sometimes its difficult for him thank you for the meal said charlie as she started to enter the car it was a splendid evening she turned at the door frowning no it wasnt she said it was awful on the kowloon side of the harbour harvey jones stared around his room at the peninsula hotel his body tight with excitement specially chosen the deputy director had said to prove himself and by christ he was going to do just that sure of the security of his locked room the american took from his briefcase the documents identifying him as an official of the united states maritime authority transferring them to his wallet a perfect cover for the circumstances he decided it was going to be difficult to sleep despite the jetlag but he had to rest if he were to perform properly carefully he tapped out a seconal capsule swilling it down with water from the bedside jug he hoped the fire wasnt as straightforward as it appeared he wanted there to be a startling explanation something that would surprise everyone impress them too when he revealed it clarissa willoughby stared over the dinner table at her husband throat working with the approach of the predictable anger what do you mean broke just that the woman laughed a disbelieving sound but we cant be for the last two years weve been continuously unlucky said the underwriter its been nobodys fault it must be somebodys fault she insisted he shook his head not wanting to argue with her but knowing it was practically unavoidable it had been ridiculous to expect her understanding because clarissa had never understood anything except perhaps the importance of the dublin horse show compared to cowes week or what dress was right for the royal enclosure at ascot but unsuitable for henley its a combination of circumstances he said inadequately unless we can find something wrong with this ship fire i cant avoid going down going down bankrupt and struck off the exchange oh christ im sorry sorry she mocked what else do you expect me to say there must be something ive used all my own money the banks then wont advance another penny she thrust up from the table and began to move jerkily about the room she was very beautiful he thought spoiled and selfish and arrogant but still very beautiful and she wasnt a hypocrite either shed never once told him she loved him my friends will laugh at me she protested yes he agreed your friends probably will he hadnt meant to emphasise the word she swung back to him what does that mean it doesnt mean anything he said wearily will your friends behave any better she demanded do you know anyone you can rely upon not a friend accepted willoughby just one man whom the underwriter felt he would never completely understand he looked up at his wife how would she react to charlie muffin it would be a cruel experiment for clarissa not charlie what are you going to do delay settlement as long as possible why in the hope of there being some reason why we dont have to pay out is that a possibility he examined the question slowly shaking his head no he admitted it doesnt seem that it is from what we know so far so youre just trying to put off the inevitable yes he said i suppose i am christ she said again i can hardly believe it she lit a cigarette puffed nervously at it and then stabbed it out into an ashtray im still finding it difficult he conceded i want to know at least a week before she declared know what when the announcement is going to be made about your bankruptcy before all the fuss begins why he asked sadly i would have thought that was obvious why clarissa he insisted you surely dont expect me to stay here in london among all the elbownudging and sniggering id hoped you might you should know better than that yes he agreed of course i should what a mess she said what a rotten shitty mess yes he said it is she stopped at the table staring down at him is that all all he asked all youre going to do sit around like a dog thats been beaten once too often and just wait for the final kick theres nothing more i can do what a man she sneered ive said im sorry how soon will you hear about the fire i dont know he said i wont forgive you for this she said the remark reached through his depression and he laughed at her i dont see anything funny she said no darling said willoughby you wouldnt robert nelson had become an unconscious weight by the time jenny manoeuvred him into their apartment she stumbled with him into the bedroom and heaved him on to the bed he lay there mouth open snoring up at her she smiled down poor darling she said with the expertise of a woman used to handling drunks she undressed him rocking him back and forth to free trapped clothing and finally rolling him beneath the covers she undressed hesitated by the bedside and instead put on a kimono returning to the lounge the curtains were drawn away from the windows she slid aside the glass door and went out to the verandah edge standing with her hands against the rail below her the lights of hong kong glittered and sparked like fireflies she looked beyond to where a blackened strip marked the harbour it was impossible to see the partially submerged liner but she knew exactly where it would be she stared towards its unseen shape for a long time her body still and unmoving oh christ she said at last it was a sad despairing sound she turned back into the room her head sunk against her chest so she was actually inside before she realised it wasnt empty any more fright whimpered from her and she snatched her hand up to her mouth jenny stood with her back against the cold window eyes darting to the faces of the three men seeking identification no said the eldest of the three were not people youre likely to know he spoke cantonese oh she said in understanding surprised we are here yes frightened yes its right you should be what do you want for this stupidity to stop stupidity the ship dont pretend ignorance what can i do the man smiled thats a naive question theres nothing i can do she said desperately what about the man whos come from london hes supposed to be investigating she conceded doubt in her voice and what is he likely to discover nothing she admitted precisely said the man so he must be shown by me who else how youre a whore used to men you shouldnt have to ask that question there was distaste in the mans voice momentarily she squeezed her eyes closed to control the emotion you cant make me she said it was a pitiful defiance made more childlike because her voice jumped unevenly oh dont be ridiculous said the man irritated he gestured towards the bedroom door beyond which robert nelson slept do you feel for him i love him said jenny this time she didnt have to force the defiance if you dont do as you are told said the man quietly we will kill him jenny stared across at the leader of the group you do believe me dont you he said yes she said i believe you so youll do it do i have a choice of course not cantonese was the language of another meeting that night because most of the people assembled in one of the three houses that john lu owned in kowloon were street chinese and uncomfortable with english it had been right that he should make the announcement according to tradition so his father had remained on hong kong island freed of the old mans intimidating presence the boy had adopted the same cold authority enjoying its effect upon the people with him is that understood he demanded there were nods and mutterings of agreement even the new territories as well as kowloon and hong kong he emphasised we understand said the man in the front everyone must know insisted the millionaires son that was as important as the tradition of making the announcement they will promised the man who had spoken earlier charlie had expected his appointment to be cancelled after the court deaths of the two chinese but when he telephoned for confirmation superintendent johnsons secretary assured him he was still expected unable to lose the feeling that he was being watched charlie walked to police headquarters by a circuitous route frequently leaving the wider highways to thread through the shopcluttered alleyways their incense sticks smouldering against the evil spirits all the while checking behind and around him irritated when he located nothing and growing convinced yet again that his instinct had become blunted there was another feeling even stronger than annoyance hed always thought of his ability to survive as instinctive too it was an attribute he couldnt afford to lose perhaps i should bum incense he muttered recognising the indication of fear the police headquarters were as ordered and regimented as the man who commanded them the regulationspaced desks of the headbent clerks tidy and unlittered the offices padded with an almost churchlike hush johnsons office was the model for those outside never decided charlie as he entered would it achieve the effect of being occupied and worked in it was more like an exhibition case even seated behind the predictably imposing desk johnson had perfected the stretchedupright gaze of intimidation the police chief indicated a chair to the left of the desk and charlie sat waiting in anticipation almost immediately johnson looked at his watch for charlie to know the pressure upon his time appointment in thirty minutes he warned it was good of you to see me so promptly charlie thanked him especially after what happened in court such men always responded to deference charlie knew murder confirmed johnson murder johnson would need very little encouragement guessed charlie postmortem examinations proved they both died from a venombased poison created involuntary lungmuscle spasms cause of death was asphyxiation charlie said nothing remembering the strangled breathing the chinese farm snakes you know for food i know said charlie so venom is freely available in the colony chinese doctors even use it in some cases as a health remedy itll take more tests but we think it was either from a banded krait or a coral snake you said murder charlie reminded him johnson leaned back in the chair refusing to be hurried despite his own restriction upon time know what solves crime he demanded what asked charlie had johnson always been as overbearing as this or had he developed the attitude since he arrived in the colony routine just simple routine finding those responsible for the fire was merely a matter of gradually working through those chinese employed on the refit matching the fingerprints to those we found all over the sprinkler systems and the incendiary devices and then confronting them with the evidence simple logical routine and now youve made an arrest for their murder said charlie johnson shifted offbalanced by the question employing the same principle weve satisfied ourselves we know the man responsible weve eliminated every person who had contact with the dead men except one who a prison cook ideally placed to introduce the poison his name is fan yungching but you havent made an arrest not yet because hes returned to mainland china suggested charlie johnson frowned at the anticipation thats what we strongly suspect admitted the police chief weve established that he disappeared from his lodgings and that his family have always lived in hunan on the mainland apparently he crossed about six months ago im surprised how easy it appears to be to go back and forth over the border said charlie the superintendent leaned forward on his desk always alert for criticism basically unsure of himself judged charlie its virtually impossible for us to control or even estimate the number that cross each year conceded the police chief at least five thousand come in without chinese permission swimming across the bay double that number must enter with official approval ten thousand said charlie would it frighten you to know that the majority of chinese crews on british warships and naval support vessels come from communist china with merely accommodation addresses here to satisfy the regulations about their being hong kong chinese yes admitted charlie it probably would its a fact insisted johnson and it frightens the americans too particularly during joint nato exercises so youre convinced that the men who destroyed the pride of america were infiltrated into the colony then killed by another chinese agent johnson nodded tapping another file neatly contained in red binding at the corner of his desk the word closed was stencilled on it charlie saw to save the embarrassment that might have been caused by the trial the policeman confirmed johnson had a pigeonhole mind decided charlie once we confronted the two with the evidence of the fingerprints and the incendiary devices they made full statements continued johnson admitted they were told to cross then wait until they were contacted what espionage people call being he hesitated losing the expression sleepers you bloody fool thought charlie he said nothing his feet were beginning to hurt and he wriggled his toes trying to become more comfortable i forget the term dismissed johnson anyway they were eventually contacted given the materials to cause the fire and did what they were told just as you think the prison cook did again johnson looked curiously at the doubt in charlies voice from other people at the mans lodging house we know that the night before the remand hearing another chinese came to see him that he handed the cook a package and that afterwards the man seemed agitated and frightened weve got fingerprints from his room which match those on the rice bowls from which the men ate before they came to court and that together with his mainland background fits neatly into the pattern ive considered all the evidence johnson defended himself ive seen most of it charlie reminded him and mine is the proper conclusion on the facts available but doesnt it seem just a little clumsy asked charlie clumsy the two who fired the liner were opium smokers werent they asked charlie recalling the indications at the court hearing there was medical evidence to that effect admitted johnson many chinese are and almost illiterate pressed charlie there was no education no conceded johnson what about the cook apparently he smoked too we havent been able to establish his literacy obviously then to use your guidelines its not logical is it said charlie or even sensible what demanded johnson resenting the argument in a fanfare of publicity said charlie one of the worlds most famous passenger liners is brought here and a man renowned for years of anticommunist preaching announces that its to become a prestige university at which hes going permanently to lecture against the peking regime im aware of the facts interrupted johnson then dont you think its odd broke in charlie that a country which decides to stifle that criticism a country which according to you can without the risk of interception move ten thousand people into this colony and therefore presumably include in that figure the most expert sabotage agents in any of its armed forces should select for the task three nearilliterate drugtaking chinese whose capture or discovery was practically a foregone conclusion and by so doing guarantee worse publicity than if theyd let the damned ship remain johnson laughed a dismissive sound a logical argument he began routine logic interposed charlie which regrettably doesnt fit the facts concluded johnson you must defer to my having a great deal more knowledge of these matters than you but they just wouldnt do it would they insisted charlie cautious of any mention of his earlier life give me an alternative suggestion said johnson at the moment i dont have one said charlie but im going to keep my mind a great deal more open than yours until ive better proof and you think youre going to get that in hong kong sneered johnson carelessly patronising im going to try the large man rose from his desk staring towards the window youre a westerner he said turning back into the room after a few moments a roundeye even if there were anything more to discover which i dont believe there is you wouldnt stand a cat in hells chance of penetrating this society the second time hed had that warning in fortyeight hours thought charlie it was becoming boring and if i can johnson shook his head at the strange conceit in the unkempt man sitting before him come back to me with just one piece of producible evidence that would give me legal cause to reopen the case and ill do it he promised just one piece he hesitated but i tell you again he added youre wasting your time the per cent premium on its own wasnt evidence not without the reason to support it it could wait until another meeting and charlie was sure that there would be one have you asked the chinese authorities for any assistance in locating the cook asked charlie theres been a formal application said johnson but we dont expect any assistance there never is so what will happen well issue an arrest warrant and perhaps a statement and there the matter will lie still a communistinspired fire johnson smiled condescending again until we receive your surprise revelation there the matter will lie he agreed irrefutably supported by the facts theres no way you can avoid a settlement with mr lu on the evidence available decided charlie the policeman was right poor willoughby he saw johnson look again at his watch and anticipated the dismissal rising from his chair thank you again he said any further help said johnson overgenerous in his confidence dont hesitate to call i wont promised charlie superintendent johnsons next appointment was approaching along the corridor as charlie left politely charlie nodded harvey jones returned the greeting neither man spoke the telex message awaiting charlie at the hotel said contact was urgent so although he knew it would be five oclock in the morning he booked the telephone call to rupert willoughbys home the underwriter answered immediately with no sleep in his voice well he said the anxiety was very obvious it doesnt feel right said charlie so we can fight the hope flared in the mans voice impressions qualified charlie not facts i cant contest a court hearing on impressions said willoughby immediately deflated and according to our lawyers thats what we could be facing if we prolong settlement i know that said charlie there is one thing what lu agreed to pay you a per cent premium i told you that i know whats your feeling at learning everyone else only got per cent there was no immediate response from the underwriter that doesnt make sense he said at last we were the biggest insurers after all exactly so there is something more than impressions said willoughby eagerly again the hope was evident its not grounds for refusing to pay insisted charlie but what about the court deaths the police chief is convinced hes solved that and that it doesnt alter anything what about the per cent linked with the deaths i didnt tell him about the premiums admitted charlie why the hell not because there is no link so i want to understand it first we havent the time protested willoughby how long a week at the very outside said the underwriter thats not enough itll have to be yes accepted charlie itll have to be have you seen lu not yet surely hes the one to challenge about the per cent of course he is well by itself its not enough charlie insisted so what are you going to do i dont know admitted charlie thats not very reassuring im not trying to be reassuring im being honest id appreciate fortyeighthour contact said willoughby and spend the intervening time working out figures on the backs of envelopes and praying guessed charlie ill keep in touch he promised im relying on you said willoughby charlie replaced the receiver turning back upon it almost immediately damn he said hed forgotten to ask willoughby to send a letter to robert nelson assuring him of his job not that the promise would matter if he didnt make better progress than he had so far hed still do it though the next call would be soon enough he was at the mobile bar using it for the first time when the bell sounded carrying his drink he went to the door concealing his reaction when he opened it i thought youd be surprised said jenny lin lee pouting feigned disappointment then she smiled openly provocative the hair which the previous night she had worn so discreetly at the nape of her neck loose now she shook her head a practised movement so that it swirled about her like a curtain i am said charlie then youre good at hiding things she said moving past him into the suite without invitation perhaps we both are said charlie clarissa stood looking down at her husband expectantly when willoughby put the phone down nothing he said shaking his head some inconsistencies but nothing that positively helps but the court murders it doesnt change anything apparently how good is this man youve got there for christs sake the underwriter paused at the question he knew little more than what he had heard from his father he realised certainly the escape in which charlie had involved him had been brilliantly organised but then charlie had been fighting for his own existence not somebody elses very good i understand he said little proof of it so far complained the woman that was the trouble thought willoughby proof give him time he said unthinkingly i thought that was what we didnt have no admitted the underwriter we dont you wont forgot rupert will you no he promised i wont forget a weeks warning at least a weeks warning he agreed why was it he wondered that he didnt feel distaste for this woman jenny lin lee had pulled her hair forward and because she sat with her legs folded beneath her it practically concealed her body he was still able to see that beneath the white silk cheongsam she was naked she took the glass from him making sure that their hands touched i got the impression last night that you didnt drink he said robert needs a sober guardian where is he now at the weekly dinner of the businessmens club said jenny disdainfully one of the few places that will still let him in purposely she moved her hair aside so that more of her body was visible she looked very young he thought there are some that dont he asked apparently she shrugged an uncaring gesture why you mean he didnt tell you she demanded revolving the glass so that the ice clattered against the sides tell me what the great embarrassment of robert nelsons life she intoned deepening her voice to a mock announcement hes in love with a chinese whore it was an interesting performance thought charlie so it had been a professionalism hed recognised the previous night why he wondered had it been so difficult for him to identify he of all people not that he would have used the word to describe her because she wasnt not like the girl in front of him say hello to your uncle charlie theres a good boy whats your name again love but not a whore never have called her that not now she hadnt even taken money not unless it was offered her and only then if the rent were due or the corner store were refusing any more credit or some new school uniform were needed and she would always describe it as a loan actually put scribbled ious in the coronation mug on the dresser hed found fifty there when his mother had died all carefully dated and dozens more in the biscuit tin the one in which she put the rent money and the hire purchase instalments one of the names he supposed had been that of his father she wouldnt have known of course not for certain she would have been able to remember them all though because to her they hadnt been casual encounters none of them he didnt believe shed wanted physical love not too much anyway it was just that in her simple haphazard way she couldnt think how else it would enter except through the bedroom door shed tried to explain pleading with him shed been crying and hed thought the mascara streaks had looked like indian warpaint hed been the national service prodigy then transferred because of his brilliance as an aerial photographer from raf intelligence to the department that sir archibald was creating and so very impressed with the accents and the attitudes of the university entrants impressed with everything in fact and so anxious to belong he hadnt challenged them of course not yet that had been the time when he was still trying to ape their talk and their habits unaware of their amusement and been frightened that the sniffling sobbing woman who didnt even have the comfort now of any more uncles would endanger his selection because of the security screening he knew was taking place cant you understand what its like to be lonely charlie to want somebody you can depend on who wont notice when youre getting old hed grimaced at the mascara and called her ugly the one person who could have given her the friendship shed wanted he thought and he hadnt understood any more than hed understood what edith had wanted from him until it was too late why had he never been able to dream ediths dreams how long he wondered would it take robert nelson strayed outside the wellordered system he quoted she nodded the eleventh commandment said jenny thou shalt fuck the natives but not be seen doing it and you dont love him whats love got to do with being a whore very little hes convenient she said and the beds clean do you really despise him i despise being paraded around to garden parties where people wont talk to me and to clubs where im ignored so he can show me off like someone whos recovered from a terminal illness why dont you tell him that i have he says im imagining it and he wants me to be accepted why not leave like i said she sniggered the beds clean and the money is regular but not enough theres never enough money thats one of lucky lus favourite expressions charlie slowly lowered himself into a chair facing the girl feeling the first tingle of familiar excitement i hadnt heard that he encouraged youd be amazed with all the publicity at the things people havent heard about lucky lu the entry into the society that everyone said would be denied him charlie frowned hed always suspected things that came too easily like what he prompted you got money asked the girl as much as you want offered charlie misunderstanding the demand she stood smiling you spend a lot and you get a lot she promised walking towards the bedroom charlie remained crouched forward in the chair momentarily confused before ediths death there had been many affairs the sex sometimes as loveless as that being offered by the woman who had disappeared into the bedroom but for almost two years there had been a celibacy of grief hed always known it would end but not like this mechanically almost but she had hinted a knowledge about lu of which even nelson seemed unaware a knowledge hed never learn if he rejected her i dont believe you can reach from there she called he grimaced at the awkward coarseness then stood hesitantly walking towards the bedroom there was nothing he realised no lust no feeling certainly not desire just apprehension shed discarded the cheongsam and was sitting back on her heels near the top of the bed shed swept her hair forward again covering herself except for her breasts which pouted through like pinknosed puppies you only keep your clothes on for shorttime you dont want a shorttime do you rehearsed words he thought like prompt cards in a childs classroom would his mother have ever been like this no he decided she wouldnt have even known the expressions he was sure she wouldnt reluctantly he took off his jacket and tie edging on to the bed what do you know about lu he asked he wouldnt be able to make love to her he knew she put her hands on his thigh feeling upwards then gazing at him pulling her mouth into an artificially mournful expression thats not very flattering for a girl she complained immediately there was the prostitutes smile well soon improve that she promised she moved her hand up reaching through his shirt then stopped whats that charlie looked down string vest he said a what string vest supposed to keep you cool in hot weather good god she began to laugh genuinely now and he smiled with her doesnt seem to work either let me see she insisted feeling foolish he took off his shirt and she began to laugh even more pointing at him with an outstretched finger and rocking backwards and forwards on her heels you look ridiculous she protested like a fish a fish wrapped up inside a net he did thought charlie a flat fish very apt he reached for her outstretched hand intending to repeat the question about lu then realised that the amusement had changed becoming more strident edging towards hysteria what he began and then saw she was crying her eyes flooded with emotion oh fuck she said desperately fuck fuck fuck she pumped her hand in his in her frustration and then came forward pressing her face into his shoulder charlie put his arms around her holding her against him her skin was very smooth and he could feel her tipped soft breasts against him there was still no reaction within him it was a good try he said quietly normally there was anger at realising he had been wrong this time it was relief she sobbed on why he said roberts so worried she said her voice uneven and muffled against his shoulder hes convinced hell be dismissed because of the premium but why this she pulled away from him im sorry she said it wouldnt have worked i could have pretended whores do all the time i couldnt it was a sad smile but controlled now no she said you couldnt could you i still want to know why wanted to compromise you then plead for robert ask you not to recommend that he be fired blackmail you even another whores trick hes not going to be sacked insisted charlie ive told him that more times than i can count in a few days ill get willoughby to reassure him by letter she was back on her heels now gazing at him crying had puffed her eyes he saw its my fault you know she blurted suddenly what is the fire everything all because of me charlie leaned forward taking her hand again jenny he said urgently what are you saying lus people are talking openly to the chinese about it they have to you see for lus family to recover face its important that everyone knows jenny he stopped her tell me from the beginning tell me so that i can understand she sniffed and he groped into his pocket for a handkerchief she kept it in her hand tracing her fingers over his wrist a littlegirl gesture lu doesnt just get his money from shipbuilding and property development and oil she began slowly thats crap part of the great benefactor publicity machine what else he owns a good third of the bars and brothels in wan chai announced the girl maybe more theyre quieter now that the war in vietnam is over and the americans arent coming here and the sixth fleet has gone but theres still enough business not that they matter by themselves hes got at least two factories here in hong kong manufacturing heroin from the poppy resin that comes in from thailand and burma its called brown sugar or number three she paused then went on hes the biggest supplier in the colony and ships to america and europe as well another pause you know what a triad is something like a chinese mafia she nodded lus a paymaster for at least three triads with branches not just here but in europe as well how do you know all this she ignored the question and then theres the name lucky lu it doesnt come from the luck he had on the hong kong stock market like all the publicity says he runs the casinos and mahjong games throughout hong kong and kowloon the sad smile again the chinese are the biggest gamblers in the world she said only lucky lu is always the winner how do you know all this repeated charlie almost enough to return to johnson he decided though he still wanted a link with the per cent premium her head was pressed forward now so that she didnt have to look at him and when she spoke her voice was muffled once more before meeting robert she said i was with johnny lu the son that controls luckys vice businesses i was his number one woman ive seen his pictures said charlie he seems to be almost his fathers shadow she hesitated johnny told me not to go she remembered distantly told me i wouldnt be accepted he was right why was the ship fire your fault demanded charlie robert didnt get the major share of the insurance because he was better than anybody else said jenny he got it because lu planned it that way planned it so that the man who took his sons woman and caused the family loss of face would be the greatest sufferer when the ship burned thats why the premium was higher at last thought charlie it was all so remarkably simple lu did it himself she shook her head at the naivety of the question of course she said if you knew more about the asian mind youd know that loss of face is the worst insult a chinese can suffer something thats got to be avenged and having ensured that it wouldnt cost him a penny he even managed to stage it so that his famous anticommunist campaign would benefit he said in growing awareness because he is such an avowed anticommunist it made the story even more believable didnt it she said what about the shipyard workers and the prison cook chosen because they were mainland refugees she said frightened people whod got deeply into debt at lus gambling places and were given the way to settle and as a safeguard against the shipyard men recanting on the rehearsed story which they would almost certainly have done in court he had them killed yes why didnt you tell robert all this asked charlie suddenly why wait so long and let him know that the chinese as well as the european community in hong kong were laughing at him for falling in love with a whore hes suffering enough as it is but it means we can contest the claim robert would have realised that oh you poor man she said this is street gossip bar talk the only proof is the cook whos probably in hunan by now or dead like the other two this isnt anything you can fight lu with hes won like he always wins she was right realised charlie about the proof anyway he still had nothing im buggered if hell win said charlie i told you to show how robert had been tricked said the girl to show why he shouldnt be fired not to fight any court hearing therell be a way promised charlie id like to believe that god how id like to believe that charlie heard the noise first he spun off the bed crouched towards the linking door and then remained there staring up foolishly at the figure of robert nelson framed in the doorway oh no said the girl quietly dear god no if you set out to do this sort of thing you should ensure your corridor doors are secured said nelson he was striving for enormous dignity realised charlie a nerve twitching high on his left cheek was the only hint of the difficulty he was having in controlling himself charlie motioned towards the now cowering girl at last shed tried to protect herself with the bed cover she was crying again he saw softly this time we didnt there was nothing he started but the broker talked over him thats not really important is it of course its important shouted charlie she came here because she loves you it looks like it dont be a bloody fool like the chinese think i am as well as everybody else you heard started charlie but again nelson refused him enough and im as determined as you are that lu wont succeed in his claim he looked to the girl i dont want you back at the apartment he said evenly please just pack your stuff and get out tonight for christs sake protested charlie this is ridiculous whats wrong with you nothing said nelson not any more and when i establish that lus claim is false there wont be any more laughter either so nelson didnt understand any more than hed been able to all those years ago the broker turned away from the bedroom but charlie called out halting him where are you going to find one of the chinese spreading the story she recounted and get him to swear an affidavit incriminating lu said nelson starting towards the outer door again stop him begged jenny robert yelled charlie hurrying into the adjoining room that wont work wait well go to the police first theyre the people nelson slammed the door without looking round leaving charlie standing near the tiny bar assholes he said she was at the bedroom door when he turned because she had only worn the cheongsam it had taken her seconds to dress she had stopped crying but her eyes were still swollen your handkerchief she said holding it out you can keep it if you want she shook her head whores dont cry for long she shrugged a gesture of defeat he expected to catch us she announced what robert he expected to find us he never really trusted me he thought i couldnt forget the old ways thats why he came in without knocking always unsure just as edith had always been unsure thought charlie never quite able to believe their marriage was for him anything different from everything else he did another way of proving himself equal but why me youd have been the obvious choice hell have recovered in the morning said charlie hopefully jenny shook her head no where will you go im known in all the bars she said bitterly wait until tomorrow at least maybe ill contact you tomorrow he said after ive seen the police she gave him a pitying look you dont stand a chance she insisted people have been telling me that for as long as i can remember he said it was good to feel confident again it had been a long time more than two years in fact not since hed started to run charlies second telephone call stopped willoughby as he was leaving his knightsbridge flat for the city the underwriter listened without interruption as charlie repeated what the girl had told him without naming her as the immediate source dear god said willoughby softly theres still no proof warned charlie immediately detecting the feeling in the other mans voice it would mean we wouldnt have to pay a penny i said theres no proof but you can get it surely i can get the police to investigate to be produced in court it will have to be something official do that then and charlie what thank you there was no way to prick the mans optimism something else charlie said what i want you to write a letter to nelson assuring him that his job is safe why its important the inner council were impressed realised chiu chingmao looking around the faces before him they had remained unspeaking during the playback of charlies bedroom discussion with jenny lin lee and for those who did not speak sufficient english chiu chingmao had provided cantonese transcripts the encounter was excellently monitored said the chairman when the tape ended congratulate your people upon installing the devices so well thank you said chiu i will so now the englishman knows the truth yes i wonder what action hell persuade the police to take chiu knew he wasnt expected to give an opinion and said nothing why did the girl try to seduce the englishman asked the chairman suddenly why didnt she just tell him about the fire i assumed what she said on the recording was the truth that she wanted to compromise him into protecting the employment of the man shes living with suggested chiu the chairman shook his head stupid woman he said will nelson cause any problems ive tried to use it to our advantage said chiu how john lu hasnt the cunning of his father said chiu ive calculated upon him panicking by doing what letting lus people know what nelson is trying to do in the waterfront bars yes agreed the chairman it cant do any harm charlie was still in his dressinggown when superintendent johnson telephoned i was about to call you he said recognising the police chiefs voice id like to see you said johnson when as soon as possible charlie hesitated what for it had better wait until you get here it sounds formal it is thirty minutes promised charlie it took him twenty the building was still wrapped in its ordered calm as charlie followed the clerk through the hushed corridor to johnsons office this time the man stood as charlie entered his manner different from their previous meetings johnson pointed to the same chair and charlie sat down curious at the changed attitude unpleasant news announced johnson bluntly what robert nelson was found by a harbour patrolboat just before dawn this morning drowned what repeated charlie incredulous hes dead im afraid she told me to stop him i didnt hear what you said complained johnson he was murdered said charlie johnson spread his hands shaking his head as he did so of course its a shock he said he drowned an accident i dont believe it was an accident insisted charlie johnson sighed annoyance overriding the artificial sympathy the superciliousness was returning charlie realised any more than you believe what happened to the ship demanded the policeman intending sarcasm i know what happened to the ship said charlie lu planned its destruction oh for gods sake wait pleaded charlie hear me out and then see if you think nelson still died accidentally johnson settled behind his desk predictably he looked at his watch charlie watched the policemans face as he recounted the story that jenny lin lee had told him omitting only the circumstances in which nelson had found them in the hotel suite but when johnson did react it was in a way quite unexpected by charlie the police chief laughed head thrown back to emphasise his mockery preposterous said johnson utterly and completely preposterous but the facts started charlie there are no facts johnson crushed him just one small inconsistency the apparent willingness to pay a premium higher than that agreed with the other insurers but that doesnt prove anything it proves everything lu is unquestionably a multimillionaire said johnson the insurance money will only just cover the purchase of the pride of america the money honouring the contracts with the professors and staff he engaged for his university he has had to pay himself so hes actually out of pocket hell recover but will have spent more insurance frauds are for profit not exercise the per cent would be proof if it showed he had made a profit and it doesnt but the point is loss of face thats chinese business johnson was unimpressed youll get nowhere in this colony trying to prove a crime by invoking folklore and tradition how the hell do you prove a crime in this colony demanded charlie johnson stiffened at the intended rudeness when i took over the running of the police force he said speaking slowly it was riven by corruption and scandal i cleaned it up into one of the most honest in the world by strict observance of home office regulations and common sense and common sense dictates that you dont probe too deeply into the affairs of one of the richest and most influential men in asia not when there isnt a good enough reason for so doing said johnson to operate here there has to be a balance knowing when to act and when to hold back since i became chief of police the crime rate has never been so low i respect the chinese and they respect me its a working relationship and youll not instruct your vice squad to probe lu johnson shook his head i had a crime of arson he said i arrested the culprits who admitted it in legally recorded statements the escape of their murderer is an embarrassment but understandable in the circumstances of hong kong i see no need to launch a meaningless wasteful investigation what about robert nelsons death there has already been a postmortem examination said johnson there was nothing besides the water in his lungs that could have caused his death he was murdered insisted charlie your companys representative in this colony was a dissolute said johnson he hesitated uncertain whether to continue then he said there are certain rules by which colonials are expected to live unfortunately mr nelson chose to ignore those rules by openly cohabiting with a chinese girl and not just an ordinary chinese girl at that he cut himself off from both societies ive already had the rules explained to me broke in charlie you can screw them as long as no one knows and you keep your eyes closed dont mock or misquote a system about which you know nothing said the policeman it maintains the status quo of this colony so nelson was an embarrassment whom no one will really miss its no secret that he drank heavily the medical examination showed an appreciable level of alcohol in his body oh come on jeered charlie blind drunk he stumbled into the harbour johnson was making a visible effort to control his annoyance ive no doubt whatsoever that the inquest verdict will be accidental death ill prove you wrong charlie promised by chinese folklore and the comicbook ramblings of a chinese prostitute said johnson isnt it time you simply accepted your liability settled whatever claim is being made for the loss of the ship and stopped running around making a fool of yourself johnsons refusal meant there was no chance of obtaining any official rebuttal of lus claim realised charlie and seven thousand miles away a poor bastard was having the first easy day since the fire and imagining he was safe please he tried again accepting the error of antagonising the other man surely theres sufficient doubt for some sort of investigation not in my opinion johnson was adamant lets not risk the status quo challenged charlie facing the hopelessness of persuading the man no agreed johnson still holding his temper lets not arent you frightened of pressure from london demanded charlie johnsons face tightened at the threat this colony is selfgoverning its a crown colony still answerable to whitehall said charlie it was a stupid attempt he recognised how could he risk going to the london authorities even if willoughby tried there would be a demand for the underwriters source he might be safe in hong kong but he could never sustain a london enquiry if there is any interest from london im sure i can satisfy it said johnson hed destroyed any hope of getting assistance from the policeman charlie knew and he could think of no one else is there anything you want officially done about nelson he asked anxious now to end the meeting formal identification unspeaking charlie followed the police chief through the cathedralquiet corridors and into the basement hed been too often in mortuaries but was never able to inure himself to the surroundings the habitual casualness of the attendants offended him as did the identification tags always tied like price tickets to the toes the drawer was withdrawn and the sheet pulled aside at last robert nelson had lost the expression of permanent anxiety thought charlie yes said charlie what about his clothes asked an attendant as charlie turned to leave charlie looked back the man was indicating a jumble of sodden clothing visible inside a transparent plastic bag ill send for it said charlie the bundle had been tied together with the eton tie jenny opened the door of nelsons apartment hurriedly the hope discernible in her face oh she said there was disappointment in her voice too im glad you stayed said charlie i promised she said but he isnt here i knew he wouldnt be she stood aside for him to enter whats happened she anticipated him remaining by the door hes dead jenny she nodded of course she said she shrugged i tried so hard to protect him thats all i wanted to do to stop him getting hurt in the harbour said charlie inadequately drowned she was standing very still refusing any emotion itll be thought an accident she said yes he said thats how theyre treating it but he was murdered of course i know i wonder which of them did it she said she spoke quietly to herself which of them demanded charlie she looked directly at him as if considering her words nothing she said finally what is it jenny nothing she said again help me pleaded charlie i tried she said sadly for nothing so no more mistakes she paused poor robert she said poor darling ill make the arrangements said charlie yes im sorry jenny really sorry she made a listless movement the resignation was almost visible did you tell the police about the fire she asked they didnt believe me said charlie so nothing is going to be done about that either not by the police no i told you she reminded him i told you lu would win he always does ill upset it said charlie some way ill upset it no you wont she said youll just get hurt like robert and like me do you want me to stay she looked at him curiously stay here for a while she shook her head i told you before she said whores dont cry for long why keep calling yourself that said charlie angrily because thats how ive always been treated she said and how i always will when charlie got back to the hotel he found there had been three attempts to contact him from london by telephone and theres been a telex message added the receptionist remaining at the desk charlie tore open the envelope lu today issued high court writs it said it was signed by willoughby charlie had started towards the lift head still bent over the message when he felt the hand upon his arm ive been waiting for you said the man gather youre as interested in the ship fire as i am who are you asked charlie recognising the accent and feeling the immediate stir of anxiety deep in his stomach harvey jones said the man offering his hand united states maritime authority my ass thought charlie instinctively and this time he knew there was nothing wrong with his instinct it was never part of the original proposal protested lu as always he spoke quietly despite his anger it was an overreaction admitted his son his habitual nervousness was even more pronounced which you could have prevented im sorry youre stupid said lu is there a risk of the police treating it as murder theres been no announcement it was done carefully the absence of an announcement doesnt mean anything i know so youve permitted an uncertainty yes do you know what would have happened to anyone who wasnt my son yes and even that wouldnt be an obstacle if it became a choice between us i know there mustnt be any more mistakes there wont be im determined there wont be said lu quite determined charlie was forcing the calmness sitting deep into the chair with his hands outstretched along the armrests watching harvey jones pace the room trapped charlie decided not quite as positively as he had been beside sir archibalds grave or during the chase that had followed but it was close too close and all his own fault he hadnt considered it properly realising the obvious american reaction to the possibility of communist china deliberately destroying something so recently us property hed managed to conceal the nervousness churning through him charlie knew but only just the american was already worryingly curious otherwise he wouldnt have stagemanaged the lobby meeting so it would only take one mistake and jones would isolate it charlie was sure of that because he recognised the american was good bloody good which meant he had to be better a damned sight better so far he had been with the caution of a poacher tickling a trout into the net charlie had put out the lures and jones had taken them but even then it had needed all charlies experience to spot the tradecraft in the other man for him charlie felt the respect of one professional for another he hesitated at the thought a professional wouldnt have allowed the miscalculation which had brought about this meeting id have expected someone with johnsons experience to see the bit that doesnt fit suggested jones what was that asked charlie he would have to be cautious of apparently innocent questions cautious of everything that peking would hardly have used ignorant hopheads for a job like this johnson told you jones completed a halfcircuit of the room the movement was as much of a test as the questions charlie recognised an attempt to irritate him by its very theatricality made a joke of it said the american inviting some annoyed response johnson seems to think almost everything i say is amusing said charlie oh shit thought charlie he had to continue i asked him today to investigate what i really think happened to the pride of america he said covering the awkwardness perhaps volunteering jennys story wouldnt be so much of a mistake jones would become suspicious of obvious evasion and what do you think really happened that lu planned the fire and the destruction of the ship what jones eased into a facing chair halted by the announcement again leaving out the girls attempted seduction charlie recounted the story he was getting very adept at it he thought to tell jones could be another lure rather than a mistake the mans reaction would be a further confirmation not that he really needed it jesus said jones clever isnt it said charlie but how the hell can you prove it the man had failed thought charlie if jones really had represented the us maritime authority hed have been as interested in proving it as charlie and accepted it as a joint operation jones would realise the mistake and recover quickly he guessed i cant prove it admitted charlie johnson isnt interested called it preposterous which it is clever assessed charlie now he was forced to talk further always with the risk of a slip but it fits better with opiumsmoking illiterates he pointed out that really was damned smart of you repeated jones the american was still manipulating the conversation it seems obvious charlie said uneasily not to johnson whos supposed to be the expert hes got a policemans mind trained only to accept fact what are you trained in demanded jones openly trying to avoid settlements said charlie jones smiled amusement wondered charlie or admiration at escaping again there was as much danger in showing himself an expert in this type of interrogation as there was in a misplaced word the american rose to pace the room again he went towards the bar and charlie said would you like a drink never touch it because it might blur his faculties no matter how slightly guessed charlie and he judged jones to be the sort of man who didnt like to lose control of anything most of all himself about him there was an overwhelming impression of care it was most obvious in the pressed and matched clothes but extended to the manicured hands and closecropped hair and even to the choice of cologne that retained his justoutofthebathroom freshness can i help you to one offered the american no said charlie jones didnt want to impair his thinking he reflected and he couldnt afford to thought about asking for an independent autopsy asked jones if you could discover any injury to nelson inconsistent with his being drowned it would be something upon which johnson would have to act an invitation to reveal his expertise saw charlie the apprehension tightening within him no he said i hadnt thought of that might be an idea said jones yes agreed charlie it might how much time do you think you have now that lus issued writs asked jones nodding to willoughbys telex message that lay between them on the table hed endangered the underwriter by letting the american read the cable as they had travelled up in the lift charlie realised belatedly it had been a panicked reaction to gain time now unless he allayed the uncertainties it would be automatic for jones to have their london bureau check willoughby and in his present state the underwriter wouldnt be able to satisfy any enquiry not much said charlie our lawyers will want to begin preparing an answer to lus claim almost immediately and they wont be able to do that on what ive got available so youre in trouble but just how much wondered charlie looks like it he said ill be intrigued to see what you do said jones what would you do demanded charlie turning the question jones made an uncertain movement im in a more fortunate position than you he said theres no money riding on what i do what then insisted charlie jones was at the window he turned at the open question just a group of government officials who want to know if peking put a match to a liner hardly out of american ownership now jones was making mistakes thought charlie as the different confirmation came of his earlier assessment or was he perhaps it was an invitation to charlie to become more careless why should that interest them he pressed the sale had gone through after all but only just said jones hardly be a friendly act towards america would it and that worries a shipping authority sufficiently to send you all the way here youd better believe it said jones glibly but i dont thought charlie it would be wrong to let the disbelief be too obvious so what are you going to do he repeated it was time to attempt some insurance of his own or at least as much protection as possible jones returned to his chair apparently realising the failure of his wanderings to irritate charlie like you im stuck with the official version said the american but i dont accept it what about you i like your story better than johnsons conceded jones why not ask johnsons help suggested charlie he might change his mind if he got a second request so quickly jones made a dismissive gesture with his wellkept hands hed know it originated from you and he didnt strike me as a man prepared to change his mind very often perhaps youre right said charlie about now he decided we could work together said jones promptly on cue charlie maintained his relaxed pose smiling across at the other man jones had realised his earlier mistake youre welcome to anything i learn promised charlie and if you come up with anything id like to know about it i was actually thinking of something closer said jones i know you were thought charlie aloud he said i was never much for teamwork we could both benefit jones argued he already had charlie decided having led jones into making the suggestion then rejecting it he would know from the closeness of the mans attention just how strong joness uncertainty of him remained which was the maximum insurance for which he could hope or get in each others way said charlie i think its better we work independently but perhaps exchange what we come up with so youre a loner every time how many times have there been what said charlie momentarily confused by the question how long have you worked for insurance companies must be twenty years assured charlie wanting to change position in the chair but knowing the other man would recognise the nervousness it would betray long as that hardly entrust a investigation to a newcomer would they not unless he had particular qualities like being able to see something that the police dont regard as unusual seemed obvious like i told you sure agreed jones you told me charlie waited but the american didnt continue the man was letting the silence build up trying to disturb him as he had attempted with the pointless meandering around the suite remembering the way the encounter had been forced upon him to become annoyed would be entirely natural realised charlie just in time right he said positively standing up if theres nothing more with which i can help you at the moment if youre quite sure there isnt interrupted jones making his most direct approach since they had begun talking and i have a funeral to arrange continued charlie refusing to respond to the innuendo once more jones stood accepting his dismissal kind of you to let me barge in like this no trouble at all said charlie well keep in touch of course im at the peninsula ill remember that damned clever of you seeing the flaw in johnsons case reiterated jones shaking his head in feigned admiration and wanting to prolong the meeting as much as possible now it was charlies turn to use silence ill get along then said jones finally yes charlie encouraged him charlie stood unmoving for several moments after the door had closed behind the american then he went to the bar the bottle vibrated against the glass edge as he splashed the whisky out drank it in one gulp then poured a second good he judged but good enough there was no way he could be sure certainly jones had been pressing until the very end but it would be wrong to read too much into that it was basic procedure the sort of persistence he would have shown himself in the same circumstances he paused at the thought as frightened as he had been there had been something enervating about the confrontation perhaps the feeling of a matador facing an insufficiently weakened bull and knowing it could kill him charlie snorted disgusted with himself that was melodramatic bullshit he thought the sort of posturing of which he knew he had been guilty in the past he was not fighting bulls he was fighting for his life again he wanted to run the awareness came suddenly surprising him he was no more prepared to die now than he had been on the east berlin border or during the pursuit by the americans or the british or during any of the missions upon which hed been sent by the underwriters father a man who relied so much upon instinct charlie recognised his determination to survive as the strongest force within him so how could he survive certainly not by running that would provide whatever confirmation jones needed and start the chase all over again resolve everything quickly then far quicker than willoughby was demanding but how against johnsons official refusal to reopen the case youre fucked charlie he told himself without even being kissed he booked the call to london stared at his glass considering another drink and then rejected the idea it never helped willoughbys response was immediate the man must spend all his time waiting by the telephone nelsons dead announced charlie quietening a flurry of questions from the underwriter oh god said willoughby yes what happened it took charlie only a few moments to tell the underwriter hardly long enough he thought a mans life dismissed in a minute or two and johnson still wont help demanded willoughby when charlie had finished not upon anything and to be fair to the man i dont suppose theres any logical police reason why he should but you said that i didnt have any proof charlie reminded him if harvey jones instituted any investigation in london willoughby would collapse thought charlie again i havent much more time said the underwriter defeat etched into his voice ill have to make an announcement soon perhaps neither of us has got much more time thought charlie i realise that he said what about nelson trying to prove the girls story said willoughby desperately thats a motive cause enough for some sort of police investigation that and the premium but theres no evidence of what nelson was trying to do apart from my word death was by drowning and hed been drinking so theres still nothing with which we can dispute the writs not yet i was very hopeful i warned you not to be it just seemed so good the brokers death registered fully for the first time poor robert said willoughby christ what a disaster theres something else said charlie he had to warn willoughby of the danger of harvey jones he knew charlie had expected alarm but it was more hopeless resignation in the underwriters voice when he had finished telling of the americans visit you could be wrong said willoughby he really could be employed by the maritime agency no chance said charlie refusing willoughby any false reassurance despite his awareness of the mans need ive spent all my life seeing people like harvey jones for what they really are and he suspects you of course not at the moment hes just curious but why hes trained to spot inconsistencies and he saw it straight away in the official account just like i did its only natural he should wonder about someone who thinks like he does what the hell are we going to do charlie i dont know get out insisted willoughby suddenly the only thing you can do is run ive already thought of that admitted charlie it would be the worst thing i could do what then the idea was only half formed in charlies mind but at least it indicated some intention i think its time that i saw lucky lu im not sure thats strictly legal now that hes issued writs it probably wasnt thought charlie but being strictly legal had never been a consideration in the past we dont have time to worry about legal niceties said charlie be careful then be bloody careful charlie hesitated at the words i will he promised or dead he thought it would have helped decided harvey jones had he had someone with whom he could have discussed the meeting but the instructions had been explicit so he had to reach a judgment by himself the man was unusual certainly but was he any more than that the apparent awareness of interrogation techniques was intriguing but there were many sorts of people who might have experience of that lawyers for instance and insurance investigators would have had a lot of contact with the law a smart lawyer would have spotted the inconsistency about the chinese dockyard workers too or again someone who spent a lot of time involved with them specially chosen to prove himself thats what the deputy director had said and he didnt want to prove himself an idiot by suggesting british intelligence were in some way interested with a cover as good as his own hed wait he decided until he was sure and only when he was convinced would he cable langley and get them to run a check in london so that there could be some official instruction for them to work together ridiculous to operate separately after all jones smoothed the robe around him looking across to where his suit hung crisp and fresh after its return from the hotel valet that was another thing hed found difficult to accept about the man for someone important enough to be investigating a insurance claim he was a scruffy son of a bitch meant one thing though with a description like that it wouldnt take the computer long to come up with the mans proper name so they could even approach london with an identity in case the bastards tried to deny their interest the reception area was enormous and everywhere there were pictures of l w lu charlie examined them with the professionalism of his teenage training appreciating the care that had gone into their taking and selection the biggest a gigantic enlargement occupying nearly the whole wall behind the desk of identically uniformed girls showed the millionaire with two american presidents and another only slightly smaller with henry kissinger along another wall were a series showing lu individually and then in groups with all the british commonwealth leaders during the singapore conference and the area to the left was given over to a pictorial history of lus charity work showing him at the two orphanages he had established for vietnamese refugees after the fall of saigon and touring wards of the hospitals which were maintained entirely by the charitable trust he had created christ said charlie mockingly moving forward and looking for the lift he had been told would bypass the other eighteen floors of the skyscraper block from which lu industries were controlled and take him direct to the penthouse office he located it by the guards both were armed he saw a separate receptionist male this time sat behind them at a small desk you have an appointment for eleven oclock with mr lu he said before charlie could speak yes we were told to expect you the lift door opened by some control which the man obviously operated but which charlie could not see as he entered he saw the man reach for a telephone to announce his arrival above predictably there were more photographs lining the lift panels this time showing lu at the launchings of his various tankers and passenger ships the facing wall had pictures of the pride of america leaving new york another of its hong kong arrival and a third showing lu in a small boat alongside the destroyed hull john lu really did resemble his father thought charlie studying the photographs except for the smile the younger man was a miserablelooking sod charlie paused considering the judgment not really miserable more apprehensive despite the obvious entry he could have expected from the willoughby company name and the warning from the increasingly distracted underwriter in a hurried telephone call earlier that morning that lus london office had made contact to establish he had directorial authority charlie had still been intrigued at the speed with which the millionaire had agreed to see him hed anticipated a delay of several days instead of the instantaneous agreement another man uniformed like his colleague on the ground floor awaited charlie when the lift doors opened please he said inviting charlie to follow this time the photographs around the walls were of world leaders charlie identified the nearest as president giscard destaing and pierre trudeau and on easels this time because the wall area was entirely glass giving a degree view of hong kong kowloon and the mainland beyond there were uniformed and armed guards in the corridor and even in three outer offices through which they had to pass to reach the door to lus personal suite it would be virtually impossible to make an unauthorised entry charlie realised lus office was very large created from the corner of the building with the views of kowloon and the new territories rotating smokedglass slats running from floor to ceiling gave the room an unexpectedly subdued lighting compared to the brightness of the other rooms through which he had passed and there was a further surprise here there were no photographs a bookcase occupied one of the two unglassed walls broken only by a doorway and along the other were showcases containing models of boats lu rose as charlie entered hurrying around his desk hand outstretched teeth glinting welcome he said the hiss in his voice only just evident welcome indeed for how long wondered charlie the millionaire personally led him to a couch away from the desk then sat down in a matching easy chair he was a puppydog fat polished sort of person thought charlie but it was only surface plumpness beneath it he recognised a very hard man some refreshment no thank you said charlie nothing at all nothing charlie looked around the office again what is it asked lu i was expecting your son to be present john you appear to spend a lot of time together no father could ask for a more dutiful son he said isnt sontofather loyalty a chinese tradition lu paused filial attachments are important in asia he agreed but unfortunately the ties appear to be becoming less important to the young of today ive learned quite a lot of chinese tradition since ive been here said charlie youve been here some days yes then im surprised surprised that you havent called upon me sooner i dont understand said charlie lu made an expansive gesture surely this meeting means that there is to be no unpleasantness between your company and myself unpleasantness over this business of the writs i dont think i can promise that said charlie guardedly the mechanical efficiency to which hed so far been exposed probably meant that somewhere a tape recording was being made of the encounter it was the sort of precaution he would have taken momentarily lus smile dimmed thats disappointing he said but inevitable im afraid you havent come to agree settlement no lu was forcing the discussion realised charlie to get the response he wanted from the man he needed time to seed some uncertainty what then demanded the millionaire shock him decided charlie to warn you that under no circumstances will my company consider paying out one cent of the claims you have filed against us he declared lu settled back in the chair shaking his head in apparent sadness not the reaction he had tried for thought charlie do you know said lu reflectively i really cant remember when anyone had the temerity to warn me about anything i gather you lead a fairly protected life said charlie gesturing to the outer doors lu sighed too obviously at the intended sarcasm so very unfortunate he said still maintaining the smile the sibilance was more noticeable realised charlie so there was at least some slight annoyance it wouldnt be enough as unfortunate as the death of robert nelson lu nodded i heard of the death of your man here he said such an able person obtained more of my business than anyone else why mr lu said charlie the smile was finally extinguished because i respected him and chose to give him the business at per cent when the rest of the sealed bids quoted for a moment the millionaire faltered i can afford to give my business to whom i choose he said thats not business mr lu thats charity or stupidity or an indication that you didnt expect the money to be out of your hands for very long just long enough for it to be the bait for which it was intended im really not accustomed to rudeness said lu threateningly im not being rude said charlie im asking a very pertinent question after the sealed bid tenders had been taken up said lu we discovered that we were still uncovered to the extent of mr nelsons offer had not at that stage been accepted rather than reopen the other policies which might have left us with even less cover dangerously near the sailing date from new york i decided to give it to him it was an oversight really it was all done at the very last moment he told me about the rush said charlie and i think you are talking bullshit lu winced at the crudeness that hadnt worked either thought charlie im not really concerned with what you will accept or not said lu im rich enough to do as i wish with my money no ones that rich i am and ill remind you that im used to being treated with proper respect because of it and ill remind you that im not being disrespectful said charlie he was he knew intentionally so there had to be some way to penetrate the mans control thats for me to decide said lu there will be several things for you to decide today agreed charlie dont strain my patience said lu now youre issuing warnings said charlie with far more ability to enforce them said lu as you did with robert nelson lu sat impassively hands cupped in his lap it wasnt working realised charlie lu had sensed the manoeuvre and was refusing to react i know that nelson was murdered announced charlie and i know why do something for christs sake he thought all of which said lu would im sure be of great interest to the police my only concern is in the settlement of my claim for the destruction of my ship sorry as i am about mr nelsons death you destroyed your own ship declared charlie and had robert nelson killed when he tried to establish the reasons being spread by your people among the chinese community the patronising smile came back ive made a mistake lu said ive admitted a madman to my office and im usually so careful as careful as you were in having the shipyard workers killed knowing they could never withstand any crossexamination in court more than one murder mocked lu there had always been a desperation about the bluff accepted charlie but hed expected to unsettle the man far more than he had done he should have resisted lus pace and prolonged the verbal fencing he realised it was his own fault that hed hurried the confrontation more than hurried panicked in fact because of his nervousness of harvey jones there had been a time when he wouldnt have made such a mistake no matter what the pressure you and perhaps more importantly your son have lost face once persisted charlie try to press this claim in court and ill ensure youll be ridiculed not just in asia but throughout the world are you prepared to risk that i havent the remotest conception what youre talking about said lu shaking his head i will guarantee that in the english high court my company will oppose your claim said charlie ill see to it that every suspicion comes out well label robert nelsons death for what it was well demand to know in open court why you were prepared to pay per cent on a cover and get a better answer than the one youve given me well show the real reason that your anticommunist campaign was always to be paid for by british insurance companies such nonsense intruded lu youre talking absolute nonsense but we wont just stop there carried on charlie well ask questions about the gambling and the brothelkeeping and the heroin factories that supply america and europe is there no crime for which im not to be held responsible sneered lu he infused boredom into his voice i dont know of a man who uses publicity more effectively than you said charlie ignoring lus jibe are you prepared to risk the loss of face that such a court hearing would cause lu stood and for a moment charlie thought he intended summoning the guards from the outer offices instead the man went to the desk selected a cigar and returned to the chair fumbling for the gold cutter on his watch chain i congratulate you announced lu unexpectedly charlie waited it really was a most effective attempt continued the millionaire almost deserved to succeed will succeed charlie corrected him imagining a change of attitude at last oh no said lu im no longer treating you as a fool and neither must you regard me as one the attitude had changed realised charlie but not as he had hoped ive already told you said lu that im a very careful man i begin nothing without the guarantee of success he stopped waving a flame before his face charlie glanced towards the desk he hadnt seen lu turn off any recording device but thats what the man had done he was sure under the guise of getting a cigar im not arguing you wouldnt win judgment said charlie im saying it would be a court action that would destroy you and your reputation and i asked you not to treat me like a fool repeated lu sadly we both of us know there will never be a court hearing youll withdraw the claim lu laughed at him in genuine amusement no he said i wont withdraw the claim ill press it as hard as i am able because i know damned well that no lawyer no matter how much filth or innuendo he hoped to smear would risk fighting in court the case i am able to bring i will tried charlie but lu raised his hand imperiously halting him you need evidence said lu better evidence than some doubt about a rich mans foible in paying more than he should for a policy he needed in a hurry youd need witnesses prepared to give evidence about a planned crime and if you had that it wouldnt be you sitting here it would be the police gently he tapped the ash from his cigar your lawyers might listen to your romanticising said the millionaire they might even be curious but theyd never introduce it into a court hearing your company will settle for the full amount because they have no option my policy is legally incontestable theres never been any risk of my being humiliated nor will there be ever hed lost accepted charlie completely another thought came suddenly robert nelson had died simply for attempting to establish the accusation at street level he had actually challenged the man you checked up on me with my london office before agreeing to meet me he said lu nodded i told you i leave nothing to chance and they knew i was coming here today to confront you with what i believed to be the truth lus smile broadened youre giving me another warning he said were anything to happen to me so soon after robert nelsons death and my visit here the police might be forced into finding the proof that our lawyers might need to take the case to court it meant admitting defeat but that had been established anyway now charlie needed protection yes agreed lu they just might ill remember that at least decided charlie rising and moving towards the door for the moment he was safe safe from lu anyway but there was still harvey jones youll recommend your company to drop their resistance and settle said lu expectantly charlie stopped turning no he said shortly you cant win you know so people keep telling me perhaps you should listen to their advice perhaps dont become an irritant will you lu cautioned him maybe he hadnt created as much protection as he had hoped thought charlie unfortunately he said from the door it seems to be a facility i have yes said lu determined to master every exchange it could be unfortunate after charlie had left the room the millionaire remained seated in the chair in which he had confronted him and that was how john lu found him when he entered from the adjoining office well asked the father kill him said the son immediately fool snapped lu you spend so much time with scum that you even think like them now but hes got it hes got it all the millionaire shook his head hes got nothing not a shred of proof and theres nowhere he can get it what about the woman you chose badly there didnt you demanded lu avoiding a direct answer the younger man who had remained standing shuffled awkwardly shed talk he admitted about what said the millionaire dismissively but she knows and everything weve got is concealed by companies layered upon companies and by nominees operating through other nominees reminded lu there is nothing directly linking us to anything whos going to start investigating us on the word of a whore she could still be a nuisance said john in rare defiance oh i think she should be punished agreed lu as if correcting a misapprehension the son smiled but properly this time warned lu of course jenny lin lee would want to know of the arrangements for the funeral charlie decided there was no reply throughout the afternoon to his repeated telephone calls so after the inquest at which he gave evidence of identification and which returned the verdict which superintendent johnson had anticipated he went to robert nelsons apartment the doorbell echoed back hollowly to him the caretaker was happy to open the door for fifty dollars and charlies assurance that he represented the dead mans company already the rooms had a stale unlivedin smell expertly he went from room to room nowhere was there a trace of the girl known in all the bars shed said which ones he wondered as he turned to leave the apartment his foot touched something scuffing it along the carpet bending he picked up a letter with a london postmark and the willoughby company address embossed on the back for return in case of nondelivery aware of its contents he opened it anyway reading it in seconds sighing he put into his pocket the underwriters letter assuring robert nelson that his position would not be in any way affected by the pride of america fire not much muttered charlie savagely closing the door since the encounter with the american charlie had become overconscious of the feeling of being watched making sudden and too obvious checks so that had he been under surveillance any observer could have easily avoided detection desperation like trying to bluff lu and this new idea further desperation he recognised forced upon him by the difference of the past from the present before the only consideration had been charlies rules now it was judges rules the need not just to learn the truth and then act to his own satisfaction but to that of barristers and law lords it imposed a restriction to which he was unaccustomed like trying to run with a shoelace undone there seemed a very real possibility of falling flat on his face people spilled from the pavement into des voeux road slowing the cars to a noisy protesting crawl charlie used the movement of avoiding people to check around him then abandoning the futile attempt knowing that in such a throng any identification would be impossible he had expected the legation of the peoples republic of china to be an imposing building perhaps even with a police guard but so ordinary was it slotted in among the shops and the cinema that he was almost past before he realised he had found it he pushed slowly forward through the milling chinese smiling at his first impression it was just like a betting shop even to the counters round the sides at which people were filling in not their horse selections but their applications to return to mainland china he ignored the side benches going straight to the reception desk it was staffed by three men dressed in identical blackgrey tunics i wish to see mr kuo said charlie when the clerk did not react charlie added mr kuo yuanching he knows you i telephoned he said i was to call the man hesitated then turned through a small door at the rear charlie moved to one side to make room for the continual thrust of people a hell of a lot of the five thousand seemed to regard it as a wasted swim he was kept waiting for nearly fifteen minutes before the clerk returned and nodded his head towards the rear office with difficulty charlie squeezed past the counter and went into the room it was as spartan and functional as that through which he had just come a desk three filing cabinets one upright chair for any visitors the walls bare and unbroken by any official photographs even of mao tsetung may i asked charlie hand on the chairback the head of the chinese legation stared at him without any expression of greeting then nodded like confronting a headmaster for the first time thought charlie christ his feet hurt you will take tea said the official it was a statement rather than a hospitable question thank you said charlie accepting the ritual kuo rang a handbell and from a side door almost immediately appeared another tunicked man carrying a tray dominated by a large thermos around it were grouped teapot and cups proper chinese tea announced kuo pouring charlie took the cup sipping it excellent he said politely he had rushed almost everything else and made a balls of it he thought and this was his last chance hopeless though the attempt might be under the newly recognised rules so the meeting could proceed at whatever pace the other man dictated kuo topped up the pot from the thermos then sat back regarding charlie again with a headmasterly look charlie gazed back vaguely disconcerted kuo was a squarebodied heavily built man dressed in the regulation tunic but with no obvious signs of his rank under its cap of thick black hair the mans face was smooth and unlined kuo nodded towards the telephone you spoke of wanting help yes said charlie what kind of help i represent one of the syndicate members who insured the pride of america who now stand to lose a large sum of money who now stand to lose a large sum of money agreed charlie and you dont want to pay cant pay thought charlie sighing there was something almost artificial in the communist criticism of capitalism he decided as ritualistic as the teadrinking were trying to avoid paying out wrongly he explained and at the moment we might be forced to how is that demanded kuo the liner was not set alight by agents of the peoples republic of china declared charlie for the first time there was reaction from the man no facial expression but a hesitation before he spoke again if it is an assurance of that which you want then of course you have it said kuo the accusation has been ridiculous from the start for someone of kuos control it had been a clumsy response thought charlie i want more than assurance he said what proof kuo leaned forward over the desk pouring more tea how long have you been in hong kong he asked settling back into his chair little over a week said charlie then you must have seen the police yes and mr lu yes so we must be almost at the bottom of the list decided kuo charlie considered his reply was kuo seeking an apology imagining some insult in the order of priority there seemed no point in evading the accusation yes he admitted at the bottom briefly unexpectedly kuo smiled youre very honest he said if i thought id achieve more by lying then i would said charlie again the smile flickered into place very honest indeed charlie sipped his tea again hed made the proper response he realised relieved even if you are prepared to help me charlie went on in explanation it might not be possible for you to do so why i believe lu destroyed his own ship said charlie i believe that he used gambling debts to force the shipyard workers into doing it and then had them murdered by someone else who had also got into debt charlie hesitated kuo remained impassive on the other side of the desk believe repeated charlie but cannot prove to the satisfaction of the english court in which lu is suing for payment but there might be a way to obtain that proof by seeing if a prison cook named fan yungching has returned to his family in hunan charlie nodded letting the curiosity reach his face we are not entirely ignorant of the affair said kuo then help me prove the truth of it charlie urged him the real truth you expect my country to help a capitalist institution save a fortune i expect china to have a proper awareness of the harm that could be caused to its relations with washington if this remains unchallenged said charlie an insurance official with a politicians argument mused kuo a logical sensible argument charlie corrected him he sounded as pompous as johnson he thought come now said kuo lu has the irritation of a droning insect on a summers day are you seriously suggesting an impediment between my country and america from someone as insignificant the pride of america was built with an enormous grant from the american government and then sustained by an equally enormous grant until it became blatantly uneconomical millions of dollars of american taxpayers money supported that ship and there was a pride in it the destruction within weeks of leaving america is far from insignificant and im sure there are people within your foreign ministry who feel the same way charlie paused tellingly and if you didnt think so too he said you wouldnt be as familiar with the details as you obviously are again there was the brief firefly smile not only honest said the chinese but remarkably perceptive as well am i wrong kuo fingered his teacup finally looking up no he admitted matching charlies earlier honesty youre not wrong then help me said charlie again how if the cook has returned to hunan began charlie he has kuo cut him off charlie felt the sweep of familiar excitement at the awareness that he could win lus boastful words he remembered but thats all it was a boast in himself charlie knew the need was far deeper sir archibald had recognised it one of the few who had and used it quite calculatingly but openly of course go out and win charlie always the same encouragement and so hed gone out and won because hed had to just as hed had to win and win demonstrably when hed realised sir archibalds successors were trying to beat him and then again when theyd begun the chase go out and win charlie no matter who gets hurt or dies poor edith charlie began concentrating considering another thought hed expected the chinese to be properly concerned but to have established already the return to china of the hunan cook showed a determined investigation superintendent johnson told me he had sought assistance from you said charlie he wants the man returned to the colony and thats not possible probed charlie gently it might not be thought wise i wouldnt need his return to fight lu in the english high court charlie assured him how then give me an entry visa to china said charlie let me interview the man in the presence of your officials and someone from the british embassy in peking who can notarise the statement as being properly made and therefore legally admissible in an english court hed been involved in british espionage for two decades reflected charlie and in that time used a dozen overseas embassies there could easily be an earlierencountered diplomat now assigned to peking who might recognise him he would thought charlie spend the rest of his life fleeing through a hall of distorted mirrors and shying away from halfseen images of fear kuo indicated the teapot but charlie shook his head the man added to his own cup apparently considering the request you must tell me one thing he said what if we make this facility available to you if he makes a full confession about what happened can you absolutely guarantee that lus claim will be publicly discussed in an open court so that the man will be exposed for the fraud he is now charlie remained unspeaking balancing the demand it was impossible to anticipate what the cook would say or his statements admissibility in court despite the attempted legality of having a british embassy official present it would be sufficient to beat lu but more probably in private negotiations with lawyers rather than in an open court challenge it would mean lus claim against my company would fail predicted charlie but not that the man would be taken to court for everyone to witness i cannot guarantee that i respect you again for your frankness said the legation head you knew that without my telling you said charlie yes said kuo i knew it charlie controlled the almost imperceptible sigh another test passed i would try to ensure that my company made a public announcement of any withdrawal by lu promised charlie and that would by implication show the claim to be false but isnt it sometimes a condition of outofcourt settlements that there should be no publicity there appears little you havent considered said charlie no agreed kuo very little does that mean you can give me an immediate decision about a visa kuo shook his head at the eagerness oh no he said i have to refer to peking so there could be a delay there normally is but this isnt a normal case said charlie no so when would you expect to get a decision what would you say if i asked you to return this time tomorrow i would say that you seem to have been expecting me kuo laughed his face fully relaxed for the first time we were he said in fact im surprised its taken you so long the wind began to freshen in sudden breathy gusts as it always does before the summer downpours in hong kong and the priest started to hurry frowning above his prayer book at the clouds bubbling over the peak why shouldnt he thought charlie despite a congregation of only one the man had persisted with a full service even the fifteenminute promise of the glory awaiting robert nelson compared to the unhappiness of the life he had known so why should he get wet from the left the gravediggers hovered shovels in hand as anxious as the priest that the grave should not become waterlogged charlie shook his head refusing the invitation to cast the first sod down upon the coffin the priest smiled slightly happy at the saved minute and so he intoned i commit the body of robert nelson to the earth and his soul to heaven he turned expectantly to charlie who was unsure what to do finally he backed away realising it was over the priest fell into step beside him surprised at the turnout he said genially yes agreed charlie hed worked methodically through the bars of the wan chai and then kowloon trying to locate jenny lin lee and got shrugs and blank faces and assurances that she was unknown particularly for someone so respected in the community charlie looked sideways the priest smiled back ingenuously the man didnt know decided charlie but then how could he perhaps they were busy said charlie the priest frowned thats not usually an obstruction among the european community here he replied automatically at least hell never know how little they cared said charlie jerking his head back in the direction of the grave the priest stopped on the narrow pathway face creased in distaste thats hardly respectful of the dead he complained neither is a business community ignoring the funeral of a man whos worked here all his life snapped charlie wasnt there ever a circumstance in which he did not have to weigh and consider his words he thought wearily quite said the priest immediately retreating very sad the path split one way going back to the church the other to the lychgate exit the first rain splattered the stones as they paused to part goodbye said the priest grateful to have escaped getting wet thank you said charlie he was almost at the covered gateway before he saw harvey jones he stopped careless of the downpour i startled you apologised the american yes said charlie im sorry charlie said nothing he should have seen the man he thought been aware of his presence at least perhaps his instinct was failing hadnt you better get under cover said jones youre getting soaked charlie pressed under the tiny roof turning back to look over the churchyard to avoid the americans direct attention the gravediggers were scrabbling the earth into the grave careless of how they filled it the poor bugger even got buried messily arrived too late to join the service said jones still apologising youd have been lost in the crowd said charlie sarcastically why did you come wanted to see you why because the mans curiosity was increasing rather than diminishing thought charlie answering his own question see how youre getting on said jones liar thought charlie youd have kept drier waiting at the hotel nothing else to do said the american easily perhaps it was the rain that kept everyone away he wasnt very popular said charlie certainly not with someone charlie ignored the invitation hows the investigation going asked jones forced into the direct demand nowhere pity yes didnt suggest a separate autopsy what said charlie forgetting separate autopsy repeated jones try to find something upon which johnson could have worked decided it would be a waste of time so what have you done spent all my time trying to avoid you thought charlie poked about he said and found what nothing what about you nothing it was as if his anxiety were forcing the breath from him making it impossible for him to create proper sentences it would not be difficult for jones to notice the attitude and for his curiosity to increase the rain began lessening soon he would be able to escape still might be better if we worked together suggested the american i prefer to stay on my own said charlie wonder what the chinese think about it said jones suddenly charlie made an unknowing gesture why not ask them might well do that do they have representation here i believe so said charlie playing the game so jones had been out there somewhere in the crowd and seen him enter the legation and wanted him to know why an offer to identify himself like wearing a school tie yes indeed i might well do that repeated the american let me know how you get on said charlie of course promised jones ill keep my side of the bargain another invitation charlie recognised its stopped raining he said nodding beyond the lychgate can i give you a lift ive got a taxi waiting said charlie ill let you know what kuo yuanching says promised jones as he walked from the churchyard who said charlie avoiding the trap kuo yuanching said the american again i gather hes the man to see alone at last charlie stretched back against the seat as his car started its switchback descent towards the central district the tension made him physically ache he blinked his eyes open reflecting upon his encounter with harvey jones because he was tired he was making mistakes there was no reason why he shouldnt have told the american of his visit to the chinese official all he had done was risk being found out in a lie and possibly arousing the mans suspicions further and he guessed jones had plenty of doubts already youre not thinking fast enough charlie he told himself so hes behaved exactly as you predicted said the inner council chairman yes said chiu modestly he kept the satisfaction from his voice you will deal with him personally i think its best and ensure every preparation is made yes i wonder how clever this englishman is it doesnt really matter now does it said chiu the conceit audible i suppose not agreed the chairman charlie got off the train at sheung shui and looked towards the shum chun river that formed the border almost as far as the lo wu bridge there was a confused crush of people he began to walk towards the crossing but immediately had to step aside for a herd of pigs which was being driven into the new territories impossible to control remembered charlie thats what johnson had said about the border traffic difficult even to decide which way most of them were going there was no logical reason for any challenge but charlie still felt the involuntary stomachtightening when he offered his passport at the british end of the control the official glanced at him briefly compared the picture checked the visa and waved him on would he ever lose the apprehension he wondered walking on to the bridge towards china better if he didnt frightened he reacted quicker at the chinese check he offered not just his passport but the letter which kuo yuanching had given him earlier that day immediately there was a smile of expectation and at a gesture from the official another chinese walked forward from a small room behind the passport booth my name is chiu chingmao the second man introduced himself i am to be your escort to peking he retrieved charlies passport waving to indicate that he should bypass the queue that stretched before him obediently the people parted and chiu stretched out to take charlies overnight shoulder grip and briefcase feeling vaguely embarrassed at the special treatment charlie surrendered the bags and fell into step with the other man we expected you earlier said chiu like the men in the hong kong legation he wore the regulation greyblack tunic he was a thin bespectacled man with an intense way of examining people when he spoke as if suspecting the responses they made i didnt expect so many people admitted charlie he nodded towards another herd of pigs or livestock trade is extensive in this part of china said chiu watchfully the treaty guaranteeing british sovereignty was not accepted by peking remembered charlie of course he said wanting to avoid a political polemic the official seemed disappointed once free of the immediate border it was easier to move despite the bicycles they appeared to be everywhere cluttering the kerb edges and thronging the oddly trafficfree roads seeing charlies look chiu said to cycle is to remain fit yes said charlie if he let the man get it out of his system perhaps hed stop we have a long way to go said chiu looking at his watch i know but we can still make our connections added the chinese we will go by train to canton and from there fly to peking i appreciate very much the trouble you have taken said charlie my ministry regards your visit as important said chiu ministry i am attached to the political section of the foreign ministry elaborated the man different from normal recognised charlie they really were going to enormous trouble at the station they appeared to be expected bypassing the normal barriers with an attentive escort of railway officials the train seemed almost as crowded as the border bridge but chiu went confidently ahead of the railwaymen until he found the empty carriage he was apparently seeking and stood back for charlie to enter reserved he announced so much for equality for all thought charlie he sat back as chiu dismissed the officials in a tumble of chinese staring through the window at the lastminute rush before departure for the first time in almost a fortnight he thought he did not have the impression of being watched it was a tangible relief he turned to the man opposite i am still surprised that my visa approval was so prompt he said sweeping his hand out to encompass the carriage and at all this assistance i have already said your visit is regarded as important chiu reminded him less than a day is still fast insisted charlie not for china said chiu seeing the opportunity the train lurched shuddering forward clear of the station like most rail systems upon which he had travelled throughout the world it appeared to go through every back garden but there was a difference here each garden was immaculate and cared for like entries in a horticultural exhibition which was the purpose decided charlie but a public relations exhibition not a horticultural one once in the open country they travelled along the spine of high embankments on either side in the regimented paddy fields peasants crouched kneedeep in the irrigation water beneath the cover of their lampshade hats you will be staying in the hsin chiao hotel in what was once the legation district of peking announced chiu the only hotel in the city with a bar remembered charlie he wondered if hed have anything to celebrate anticipating another diatribe as chiu moved to speak charlie said quickly it is surprising that youve allowed me access to this man in preference to the hong kong police the police would demand his return said chiu as if that were explanation enough but that would surely achieve the same effect as letting me obtain a statement better even it would guarantee a court hearing chiu looked across at him tolerantly it would also establish a precedent he said they were interrupted by the opening of the carriage door charlie turned to see a file of whitecoated men ive arranged for lunch to be served here in the compartment explained chiu neither spoke while the table was erected between them and the dishes laid out there are knives and forks if you wish said chiu solicitously chopsticks will be fine said charlie there appeared no courtesy the chinese authorities had overlooked as they started to eat charlie said so the man will go unpunished chiu paused chopsticks before his face oh no he insisted quietly people who bring disgrace to china never go unpunished the special treatment continued when they reached canton a car was at the station to take them directly to the airport there they again skirted all the formalities driving past the departure building to the waiting aircraft predictably their seats were reserved the man is being brought from hunan to enable your meeting to take place in the capital announced chiu as they belted themselves in for takeoff thats very helpful said charlie we thought it better the british embassy started charlie ambassador collins has promised an official to notarise the accounts of any meeting finished chiu enjoying the constant indications of their efficiency my ministry has already approached them collins a movement went through charlie as if he were physically cold not the same man he thought wildly it couldnt be just a coincidence thats all he smothered the hope now he was thinking like willoughby unrealistically and hed already done too much of that could still be a coincidence he decided not a particularly unusual name after all then again it might not be about due for ambassadorial promotion when theyd met the first secretary at the prague embassy remembered charlie prissy man resenting the london instruction to provide whatever help charlie might demand the department were giving him that sort of authority then still believing the defection to be the biggest intelligence coup of the decade the visit to czechoslovakia had been to arrange the final details of the crossing you know him asked the chinese no said charlie i hope not he thought thered even been an argument between them chiu stared at him curiously just when everything had at last seemed to be going so easily thought charlie why hadnt he checked at the high commission in hong kong taken one telephone call thats all hed even anticipated the danger in kuos office careless again unthinking the aircraft doors thumped closed and the no smoking and seatbelts signs flicked on there was nothing he could do not a bloody thing my ministry have taken a very unusual decision in admitting you said chiu we hope it will work out satisfactorily so do i said charlie sincerely in so many ways he thought hed certainly need the hotel bar but not for a celebration harvey jones leaned against the rail of the ferry taking him from hong kong to kowloon gazing down into the churned waters of the harbour far away the pride of america looked like one of those beached whales that sometimes came ashore along the miami coastline driven to suicide by sea parasites infecting their skins his parents had sent him pictures in their last letter from fort lauderdale the one in which theyd assured him of how happily they were settling down into retirement pity he couldnt send them a postcard be bad security he knew perhaps hed visit them when he got back he might even have something about which to boast then again he might not jones drove his fist in tiny impatient movements against the rail why he wondered were the damned chinese being so helpful to the bloody man and they were being helpful openly so he hadnt even had to make it obvious that hed followed the man to the legation offices kuo had freely admitted it almost volunteered it special chance to prove yourself he was being beaten decided jones by a tiedinthemiddlewithstring hayseed of an agent who should have been put out to pasture long ago and he was an agent no matter how closely he tried to hide behind the insurance investigator crap jones was sure of it the american stared up irritated by another realisation to ask washington to pressure london for cooperation now would be an open admission of failure best to wait at least until the man came back it would be easy to gauge whether the visit had been worth while that was it just wait and trick the bastard into some sort of confession then put the arm on him the ferry nudged against the dock and jones got into line to disembark still failure though whether he did it now or later it wasnt going as he had hoped he admitted to himself reluctantly in fact it was turning out to be a complete fuckup jones had cleared the quayside by the time jenny lin lee finally left the same ferry for a moment she stared across towards hong kong island then started towards kowloon already they would know she had arrived been warned to expect her in fact just as the hotels and then the bars in the wan chai had been warned to refuse her forcing her lower and lower she turned right along the salisbury road and in front of the peninsula hotel which jones had just entered and on towards the harbour slums thats where the mao tai shacks and the shorttime houses were all she could expect now or would be allowed no europeans of course or even clean chinese just the blankeyed diseased men of the fishing junks and the shipyards she could avoid the pain she knew feeling for the assurance of the hypodermic in her shoulder bag there would be no difficulty in obtaining it not until shed really established a dependence then it might be difficult impossible eventually but that hadnt happened yet weeks away and she had to take away the feeling fan yungching the former prison cook was a wizened driedout old man tissuepaper skin stretched over the bones of his face and hands making him almost dolllike a very ugly doll thought charlie the man crouched rather than sat on the other side of the interview bench skeletal hands across his stomach as if he were in physical pain which he probably was fear leaked from him souring the room with his smell soon decided charlie the man would wet himself charlie had been in many rooms confronting many men as frightened as this always at some stage their bladders went he hoped that was the only collapse often it wasnt it was a small boxshaped chamber crowded because of the number of people who had to be present the interpreter who would translate charlies questions was immediately to his left arms upon the table waiting with a notepad before him behind at a narrow bench sat chiu chingmao with him was the official from the legal section of the british embassy geoffrey hodgson the man had introduced himself typical diplomatlawyer posted because of an ability with languages charlie looked at the lawyer and hodgson smiled hopefully just as hed smiled when he confirmed in unwitting conversation the ambassadors former posting to prague expects you at the embassy after the interview hodgson had said no escape then it would have been four years charlie calculated and not more than three hours together the man would have encountered thousands of people in that time and would not know the outcome of charlies visit to czechoslovakia anyway because of the embarrassment to the department scarce reason to remember him wrong to panic then pointless anyway at least he knew in advance it gave him a slight advantage too slight charlie continued his examination of the room at a third table sat two bilingual notetakers taperecording machines between them as efficiently organised as everything else decided charlie shall we start he said there should be an oath if the man has a religion warned hodgson fan shook his head to the interpreters question an affirmation at least insisted hodgson it was an unusual situation and he didnt want any mistakes he understands said the interpreter the man paused as one of the notetakers made an adjustment to the recorder then quoted the undertaking to the old man haltingly eyes locked on to the table in front of him fan repeated his promise that the statement would be the truth he was wiping one hand over the other in tiny washing movements he was too frightened to lie charlie knew the affirmation over fan hurriedly talked on bobbing his hand in fawning pleading motions he begs forgiveness said the interpreter he says he was forced to do what he did that he did not know it was a poison he was introducing into the mens food he was told that it was a substance merely to make them ill to cause a delay to the trial it was going to be more disjointed than he had expected realised charlie he turned to hodgson would there be any difficulty about admissibility if the transcript is shown to be a series of questions and answers the british lawyer pursed his lips doubtfully shouldnt be he said providing that it couldnt be argued that the questions were too leading you must not suggest the answers you want charlie turned back to the cook does he know the man who gave him the substance the same man who threatened me replied fan through the interpreter what is his name johnny lu charlie reached into his briefcase bringing out one of the many photographs of the millionaires son it had been automatic for him to bring it had been taken at the press conference just after the liner sailed from new york and showed the man next to his father this man he asked fan squinted at the picture yes he said finally charlie looked towards the recorders can the transcript show he has identified a picture of john lu taken aboard the pride of america he requested formally the proof charlie thought the proof that johnson had demanded and which would save willoughby what he wondered would save him why did he threaten you he said coming back to the old man i owed money money i had lost at mahjong i did not have it what was the threat that he would have me hurt badly hurt tell me what he said that if i put what he gave me into their food he would not let me be hurt that it would cancel my debt were you at any time told what to do by anyone representing the government of china fan looked hurriedly to the interpreter and then across at chiu to whom the other chinese in the room had been constantly deferent he shook his head you must reply insisted charlie no said fan what about the men who died those accused of causing the fire it was a remote chance but worth trying i do not know said fan did they gamble pressed charlie fan nodded sometimes with me be careful interrupted hodgson from the side if just one section is challenged it could have the effect of casting doubt on the whole statement did they win or lose charlie asked the chinese nodding his acceptance of the lawyers warning sometimes win sometimes lose said fan unhelpfully did john lu cancel your debt he told me to go to him to get a paper but i did not why i was frightened i would get killed i ran away fan gave an involuntary shudder and a different smell permeated the room hed been right realised charlie it always happened what did john lu say would happen to the men who had caused the fire just that they would become ill nothing more why did he want that he said it would get into the newspapers that it was important why i do not know charlie wanted nothing more from the man it had seemed ridiculously easy but the rest of the day wasnt going to be he sat back looking to chiu thank you he said that is all the foreign ministry official appeared surprised it is enough charlie assured him much trouble has been taken said chiu a mistake would be unfortunate to go on might create just such a mistake said charlie looking to hodgson for support the lawyer nodded agreement you came pretty close on one or two occasions as it was he said how long will it take to notarise this statement asked charlie fifteen minutes said hodgson wont take much longer to prepare it either i wouldnt think charlie came back to chiu so i could return to hong kong first thing tomorrow he said he had to limit his stay in peking to the minimum he had decided even if he identified him collins would have no reason to attempt his detention the risk was in querying his presence with london and by the time that was answered he could be clear of hong kong running again chiu was still unhappy with the brevity of the account charlie knew if you wish said the chinese stiffly he did wish thought charlie it wasnt just the new danger of the ambassador he shouldnt forget the curiosity of harvey jones at least he could escape that now one problem replaced by another charlie turned to the trembling figure sitting opposite fan still gazed steadfastly down at the table not realising the questioning was over people who bring disgrace to china never go unpunished chiu had said hardly surprising the poor bastard had pissed himself will you tell him i am grateful charlie asked the interpreter he has been of great assistance fan stared up at the translation even he was bewildered that it was over so quickly charlie rose ending the interview right said hodgson briskly lets get along to the embassy shall we first thought charlie hed need a toilet quite the most unusual city to which ive ever been volunteered the lawyer in the car taking them to the embassy yes said charlie it didnt appear to have a centre rather it was sprawl upon sprawl of squares do you know that underneath all the buildings and offices there are nuclear shelters said hodgson no its a fact insisted the lawyer the chinese are paranoid about an attack from russia they reckon they can clear the entire city in fifteen minutes thats what he needed mused charlie a bombproof hole in the ground to which he could run at the first sign of danger weve arrived announced hodgson to what wondered charlie despite his preparedness he still faltered at the entrance to the ambassadors study knowing as he did so that the reaction would look strange but momentarily unable to control the urge to turn and run come in come in encouraged the ambassador not often we get visitors from home and under such strange circumstances collins had altered very little charlie decided not physically anyway he continued into the room taking the outstretched hand the mans face remained blank please god let it stay that way prayed charlie sherry fussed collins indicating the decanter thank you accepted charlie not more than three hours he thought again how good was the mans memory astonishing business this fire said collins offering charlie the glass very the mans manner had changed since their last meeting even if his appearance hadnt he was more polished than he had been in prague showed more confidence but it would only be surface change guessed charlie still be a prissy sod the chinese chap made a full confession did he full enough said charlie it will be enough for us to challenge lus claim in the high court have to make a report to london about it said the ambassador as if the idea had just occurred to him of course said charlie uneasily i understand the hong kong police have asked officially for assistance collins nodded no reply yet to my note he said he suddenly put his head to one side have we met before charlie brought the sherry glass to his lips knowing an immediate reply would have been impossible for him met before he echoed dismissively i dont think so not often i take sherry with a british ambassador at least the strain didnt sound in his voice sweat was flooding his back smearing his shirt to him collins laughed politely odd feeling theres been another occasion he insisted there must be so many people said charlie quite agreed collins do you anticipate the authorities will send the cook back said charlie trying to move the man on they helped you pointed out the diplomat but only to obtain a statement i gather they feel to turn the man over to the hong kong police would be establishing a precedent for any future cases and they are unwilling to make such a sweeping commitment quite said collins again the ambassador was still examining him curiously and as far as they are concerned a high court challenge will be as good as any criminal court proceedings said charlie ever been to lagos blurted collins snapping his fingers in imagined recollection never said charlie the perspiration would be visible on his face he knew and the room was really quite cold collins moved his head doubtfully at the rejection usually got a good eye for faces he apologised id have remembered said charlie quite said collins since their last meeting the man had affected an irritating air of studied vagueness thought charlie how long you staying in peking ive got what i came for said charlie im leaving as early as possible tomorrow morning oh said collins in apparent disappointment going to invite you to dinner tomorrow evening as i said not often we get visitors from home very kind charlie thanked him but weve got to file an answer in the london courts as soon as possible quite just a stupid mannerism wondered charlie or the thoughtless use of a favourite word to feign interest while he tried to recall their other meeting stockholm tried collins gesturing with his finger charlie shook his head never been there he said the man would persist charlie knew he looked the sort of person who played postal chess and did crossword puzzles enjoying little challenges charlie looked obviously at his watch ive a four oclock appointment at the foreign ministry with mr chiu he improvised he hadnt and there was a danger of the ambassadors discovering the lie but it was the best escape he could manage and there was an even greater danger in continuing this conversation ill check with hodgson said collins taking the hint he spoke briefly into the internal telephone smiling over at charlie as he replaced the receiver all done he said almost immediately there was a movement from behind and the lawyer entered at the ambassadors call carrying a file of documents the chinese original he said holding out the papers and a british translation both notarised by me and witnessed by the first secretary ive also annotated the identified photograph and sworn a statement that it was the one seen by the man youve been very kind said charlie including the ambassador in the thanks thats what were here for replied collins rising with charlie the ambassador walked with him to the study door charlie was aware of his attention amazing said the ambassador when they reached the hallway just cant lose the feeling that i know you from somewhere thank you again said charlie sure about tomorrow night quite sure im sorry charlie hesitated immediately outside the embassy buildings he was trembling almost noticeably so he straightened his arms against his sides trying to control the emotion after his discovery at sir archibalds vault when he had realised they were chasing him there had been times when he had felt helplessly trapped in a contracting room with the walls and ceiling slowly closing in upon him it had been frightening claustrophobic for a long time he had not encountered it but it was very strong now well demanded clarissa willoughby ill have to make the statement soon admitted the underwriter even before you finally hear from hong kong its a criminal offence knowingly to go on trading without funds to meet your obligations said willoughby criminal yes christ i couldnt stand you appearing in court as well i didnt think you intended to stand anything i dont said the woman where are you going i havent made up my mind does it matter i suppose not i feel very sorry for you rupert i really do she spoke in the manner of a person discovering that a friends pet was having to be put down thought the underwriter thank you when do you intend to leave end of the week i suppose said the woman she smiled you really are being remarkably civilised she said isnt that what weve always been he said the bitterness showing for the first time remarkably civilised if it confirms lus involvement with the fire then surely its enough for our purpose anyway said the chairman i suppose so said chiu what else is there chiu shrugged youre right he agreed and on behalf of the council i would like to thank you said the chairman formally chiu smiled gratefully the statement still has to be put to its proper use he reminded them i dont think we should worry about that do you i hope not the wind was stronger than the previous day so the dust from the gobi drifted in pockets through the capital gritting the buildings and plants with a light greyishyellow dust charlie saw that a few people wore face masks or pulled scarves up around their mouths he sat in the hsin chiao foyer his briefcase and shoulder grip already packed beside him knowing he was early but impatient for chius arrival because the hotel was organised on the russian style with each floor having its own reception staff the main foyer was remarkably empty the furniture was frayed and shabby and the walls were patched with quick repair work it reminded charlie of a retirement hotel way back from the sea front at eastbourne the chinese official stopped just inside the entrance when he saw charlie already waiting i am not late stated chiu i couldnt sleep said charlie truthfully so i got up early the car is waiting as the vehicle nudged out into the shoals of bicycles chiu said tan yungching is still available i have what i came for said charlie it will be sufficient believe me it would be difficult to arrange another meeting if anything had been overlooked warned chiu what were they going to do with the poor old bugger wondered charlie the car moved out of the legation district with its pinkbricked buildings and into the huge tien an men square there is much to see in peking offered chiu gesturing towards the redwalled forbidden city i dont think ive time said charlie there is the monument to the heroes of the revolution said chiu pointing through the car window the cornerstone was laid by our beloved leader mao tsetung charlie nodded politely it reminded him of the russian statue to their war dead in east berlin the departments attempt to kill him remembered charlie hed actually stood by the russian monument and watched the innocent east german hed cultivated for just such a purpose drive the marked volkswagen towards the checkpoint poor sod had believed he was driving towards an escape to the west how can a man as sensitive as you sometimes be so cruel several times edith had asked him that unable to understand his peculiar morality of survival as sir archibalds secretary in the early days before their marriage shed heard it talked about in the department admired even as essential for the job but she hadnt admired it shed been frightened of it he didnt think she had ever been completely sure that it hadnt affected their marriage suspecting charlie of a calculated willingness to use her as he seemed willing to use everyone else not even at the very end had she truly believed that it was inherent in him something of which he was more ashamed than proud you would not care to stop to see the monument said chiu or perhaps the museum of the revolution no thank you said charlie id rather get straight to the airport again the formalities were waived and they were the first on the cantonbound aircraft neither spoke while the other passengers boarded but as they trundled towards takeoff chiu said you had a good meeting with your embassy charlie looked at the man beside him that was the problem he accepted hed never know not until it was perhaps too late very he said the ambassador is making a report to london about your helpfulness it will probably mean a fresh application for the man to be returned to hong kong probably agreed charlie he closed his eyes hoping the other man would stop forcing the conversation he was very tired realised charlie but not from the restless almost unsleeping night it was an aching mental and physical fatigue his mind and body stretched against relaxation not just by the need to anticipate the obvious dangers but to interpret the nuances and halfsuspicions hed swung the pendulum too far he thought the rotting inactivity about which he had whined to willoughby seemed so very attractive now but wouldnt he supposed if he were pushed back into it which didnt at the moment seem very likely he managed to feign sleep until the arrival of the meal we will be in canton soon promised chiu and after that hong kong to what wondered charlie i cant thank you enough for the help youve given me he said sincerely let us hope it has not been wasted said chiu the criticism obvious yes agreed charlie unannoyed lets hope because there was special clearance in canton they were aboard the express within an hour of touchdown the same peasants seemed bent beneath the same hats in the same fields thought charlie i will keep mr kuo and your hong kong legation informed of what happens promised charlie what do you intend doing ill lay the information before the hong kong police obviously said charlie it will be more than sufficient for them to begin enquiries then tell our lawyers in london that we have proof upon which they can immediately enter a defence to lus claim and then flee he thought chiu nodded with no guarantee that there will be either a criminal or a civil hearing at which lu can be denounced its almost a certainty in one court or another said charlie carelessly almost a certainty echoed chiu throwing the qualification back at the border chiu escorted him to the bridge again my thanks said charlie facing the man near the jostling booth there seemed to be more people than when he had entered china it was in both our interests said chiu charlie turned offering his passport but was again waved through without inspection he walked across the bridge glad of the distant sight of a train already in sheung shui station he felt a flush of relief then immediately annoyance because of it he had become so nervous that he saw omens of good fortune in something as ridiculous as a waiting train like a housewife planning her day around a newspaper horoscope he hadnt realised the strain had become that bad he was about a hundred yards into the new territories when instinct made him react seconds before the attack became obvious he swivelled automatically pulling the overnight bag and briefcase in front of his body as some sort of protection there were three of them he saw marked out against the rest of the chinese by their westernised silk suits the sort that lucky lu favoured thought charlie fleetingly they were spaced expertly so that it would be impossible to confront one without exposing himself to the other two and approaching unhurriedly very sure of themselves the man to the right was even smirking charlie turned to run but collided at once with an apparently surprised man carrying a jumble of possessions in a knotted rug it burst open as it hit the ground cascading pots and pans and clothing and the man started screeching in bewildered outrage charlie tried to dodge around him brushing off the mans grasping protests but hit another group who drew together blocking his escape and gesturing towards the shouting peasant hed never get through he realised turning back the three were still walking calmly and unhurriedly towards him blocking any dash back to the border the smiling man had pulled a knife narrowbladed so there would hardly be any puncture wound little risk of identifying blood splashes after the attack very professional judged charlie the peasant was babbling to his left and charlie swept out thrusting him aside the advancing men stopped warily they believed he was seeking space in which to fight charlie knew it wouldnt be a mistake theyd make for longer than a few seconds all his life charlie had existed in an ambience of violence but always avoided actual involvement relying upon mental agility rather than physical ability a survivor unable to fight his own battles it was not cowardice although he was as apprehensive as anyone of physical pain it was an acceptance of reality he just wasnt any good at it not close up handtohand brutality never had been no matter how persuasive the lecture or good the instruction he had never been able to bring himself to complete the motion in training that would in a proper fight have maimed or killed the practice grown men grunting around a padded floor in canvas suits had even seemed silly hed actually annoyed the instructors by giggling openly one day sir archibald had warned in rare criticism there might be the need but hed still been careless because the department had had a special section for such activity men who regarded death or the infliction of pain as a soldier does uninvolved and detached a function of their job hed only achieved the attitude rarely to survive in east berlin and to avenge ediths murder and even then it had been remote he had wanted ediths killer to die but not to see the fear of realisation upon his face the sort of fear that the three men could see in him now now there was the need theyd started forward again more confidently the one with the knife said something and the other two began to grin as well they definitely knew realised charlie help he screamed the plea desperately instantly aware that other people around had joined in the shouts of the man with whom he had collided smothering the sound of his voice help for gods sake help the crowd pulled away from him and for the briefest moment charlie thought it was because of his yell then he saw it was an almost rehearsed enclave with the three men facing him just six feet away and that there were more assailants than he had at first identified the handle of his overnight bag was looped with a strap so that it could be supported on his shoulders he gripped the top of the strap whirling the bag around his head in clumsy arcs forcing people away from him they drew back easily isolating him in a circle twenty at least decided charlie probably more no way of knowing the briefcase demanded the chinese with the knife he reached out beckoning charlie stared back panting his eyes locked on the knife in the mans hand he thought of the pain it would cause thrusting into his body and his stomach loosened give me the briefcase insisted the man again he motioned impatiently the other two had spaced further out so that he was faced with a wider attack the knifeman moved to come forward and again charlie swept the bag around in a wild wardingoff sweep aware that the artificial protests from the peasants had stopped he screamed again help please help me he could even see the border in the direction in which he was facing less than a hundred yards the police and officials appeared unaware of what was happening it was a cry of shock not pain and as he fell charlie saw that it was one of the long poles from which hed seen many of the peasants supporting belongings and goods that had been swept across the back of his knees crumpling his legs beneath him the overnight bag hampered him now the strap becoming entangled with his wrist and before he could free himself one of the three men he had first seen had got to him clamping his arm to his side charlie butted him in the face with his forehead hearing the grunt of pain hed hurt himself too he realised blinking he tried to scramble up but felt himself being grabbed behind by unseen hands because his eyes were watering he could only halffocus on the man with the knife bending over him only feet away i said i wanted the briefcase it was a scream of fear this time with no articulate words charlie thrust back into the people holding him from behind trying to escape the knife stomach knotted for the moment of pain he kicked out but half bent as he was he missed the mans groin hitting him harmlessly on the thigh and then the attacker hed butted grabbed his leg twisting him completely over charlie lay face down sobbing his helplessness he was almost unaware of the briefcase being snatched from him because of the pain that exploded in his head as something began smashing into his skull urgent hammering blows but not the pain that he had imagined from the knife he thought as he drifted into unconsciousness hardly any hurt at all now that theyd stopped hitting his head so death wasnt as painful as hed always thought it would be got it hodgson who had brought their copy of the chinese statement into the ambassadors study so that the man could refer to it when preparing his report to london stared down at collins im sorry sir that man i knew id met him before oh prague declared the ambassador four years ago in prague hodgson waited not knowing what was expected of him collins had his eyes closed with the effort of recollection attached to our intelligence service he added actually had some sort of altercation with him the ambassador opened his eyes frowning at the memory whats he doing as a director of a lloyds underwriting firm he demanded as if the young lawyer would have the answer instantly available i dont know said hodgson he hesitated then risked the impertinence surely it cant be the same man he said collins maintained his distant look certainly looked like him he said his conviction wavering it would take years to attain the seniority that he appeared to have pointed out hodgson quite conceded collins turning back to his desk quite he hadnt died the awareness came to him with the first burst of searing pain as if his head were being crushed between two great weights he tried to twist to get the pressure to stop but that only made it worse and then he heard a sound and realised he was whimpering itll ache said a voice muzzy as if the words were coming through cottonwool charlie could feel the strong light against his face and squinted his eyes open carefully frightened it would cause fresh pain it did there appeared to be a lot of people standing over him but his vision was blurred so he could not distinguish who they were how do you feel asked the voice hurts managed charlie hurts like buggery his voice echoed inside his own head making him wince weve given him an injection now we know theres no fracture itll get better soon charlie tried focusing again feeling out with his hands as he did so a bed hospital then do you feel well enough to talk another voice superintendent johnson cautiously this time charlie turned in the direction of the sound still difficult to distinguish the man but the height was obvious yes theres a shorthand writer present hell record what you say all right who did it chinese could you recognise them again charlie considered the question in his fear all hed looked at was the knife and their clothes there was the one with the smile hed seen his face closely enough probably he said mainland chinese they wore westernised clothing said charlie silk suits did they speak one did english whatever drug theyd given him was taking effect the pain was lessening and johnson was becoming easier to see hong kong then it would seem so why id got the proof charlie blinked at the announcement wanting very much to see the policemans face johnson was gazing down at him keeping his face clear proof the cook was made available to me in peking it was just as the woman said everything you brought the statement back in the briefcase that was what the man kept saying he wanted the briefcase when the border guards got to you you only had a shoulder grip so they got it and the proof was there almost a sound of relief in johnsons voice no decided charlie that was unfair i wont admit i was wrong not yet said johnson identifying his attitude i didnt ask you to said charlie ill need more than a statement made by a man to whom im refused access i need facts so far we havent even the affidavit you claim was sworn charlie almost shook his head in denial stopping at the first twinge of warning it was notarised to make it legally admissible by a lawyer from the british embassy he said they have a copy you could get it from the foreign office in london what did the cook say that the poison was given to him by john lu that hed been told it would only make them ill and that it would cancel his gambling debt just as the woman said repeated johnson reflectively it will be sufficient to make the enquiries insisted charlie he could see everything clearly now apart from johnson and the shorthand writer there was another policeman by the door standing near the third officer were a nurse and a whitecoated man whom charlie assumed to be a doctor they were both chinese yes agreed johnson it will be sufficient to start enquiries do you think the chinese will send the cook back definitely not said charlie itll be difficult trying to proceed on a case like this with the legal muscle that lu can employ with only a sworn statement can you guarantee a court hearing the constant demand from every chinese official hed met johnson was right accepted charlie and the foreign office statement would only be a copy would the company lawyers be prepared to go into court on anything less than the original yes said charlie itll be difficult id like a fuller statement later on said the police chief of course maybe tomorrow johnson put the question more to the doctor than to charlie certainly the xrays show theres no fracture said the whitecoated man cautiously but theres undoubtedly concussion id like to keep him under observation for a few days tomorrow insisted charlie there was an uncertainty in his mind a doubt he could not even formulate little more than instinctive caution but it was there nagging more intrusively than the pain and there was something else the danger of the ambassadors memory and joness curiosity that might not be wise protested the doctor youre lucky not to be more seriously hurt how lucky charlie put the question to johnson the policeman stared back at him curiously what do you mean he asked how long was it before the border guards got to me johnson made an uncertain movement we dont know they didnt see the beginning of the attack obviously by the time they got there you were unconscious and there wasnt a sign of anyone whod attacked you or the briefcase or the briefcase confirmed johnson one of the men had a knife said charlie the one who did the talking johnson looked at the doctor nothing but head injuries insisted the man and minor grazing consistent with being knocked to the ground there was a knife insisted charlie i saw it they didnt understand he thought so they obviously got the briefcase without having to use it said johnson easily we can get it all down in the statement i wish youd give yourself more time said the doctor they thought the knife was a hallucination decided charlie i can sign myself out as i could in england he asked yes said the doctor ill agree to stay overnight promised charlie but tomorrow ill leave it would be ridiculous even to try tonight he knew hed collapse and lengthen the period in hospital youve had at least four severe blows to the head said the doctor but theres no fracture concussion can be as bad a nights rest will be sufficient why dont i call tomorrow suggested johnson moving to intercede to see how you are at the hotel said charlie finally the doctors hostility spread to the nurse who remained after everyone else had left she moved jerkily around the room showing her irritation in the briskness with which she moved tidying up after the policemen would you like a sleeping draught she asked please said charlie without help he knew hed never rest she returned within minutes with some brown liquid in a tiny medicine glass waiting by the bedside until he swigged it down he relaxed back upon the pillow she plumped for him good night she said good night something is not right charlie he said to himself after she had gone but what the hell was it he began to feel the approach of drowsiness he turned on the pillow looking towards the door through which the girl had just left jesus he thought as sleep overtook him i hope that girl is not a gambler the ache was still there but far less than the previous night little more than a hangover discomfort and hed endured enough of those the growing belief that he knew what was happening helped always the same excitement the awareness that he had realised something that no one else had he needed more though a damned sight more but at least he had found the direction in which to look for it at last and charlies rules too not judges i wish youd stay said the doctor there are things i must do what reports to be made to london apart from the statement to the police he said glibly nothing that couldnt wait ill be careful said charlie and would have to continue to be no matter what happened the doctor moved his shoulders abandoning the attempt these might help he said handing charlie a phial of pills and if you start vomiting get back here immediately i will promised charlie the nurse of the previous day entered frowning when she saw that charlie was already dressed damned glad you dont play mahjong or follow the horses charlie greeted her the girl stared at him what she said forget it said charlie sure youre all right demanded the doctor positive insisted charlie it had been a bloody silly thing to say irrationally it had been his first thought upon awakening and from it had come the conclusion that was exciting him you wont change your mind no charlie walked slowly to the hospital elevator conscious of the movement against the corridor floor jarring up into his head there was a slight nausea deep in his stomach but he knew it was not from the head wounds he was actually aware of the customary discomfort from his feet that had to indicate some improvement he reached the hospital reception area and had just realised the need for a car when he heard the shout and turned expectantly hi there called harvey jones hello said charlie hed anticipated the approach but thought it would be back at the hotel hed underestimated the mans keenness heard you got mugged said the american how is it still painful admitted charlie who told you about the attack superintendent johnson ive been keeping in touch with him oh thought you might get into contact when you returned from peking you knew i was there then sure admitted jones easily he motioned towards the forecourt ive got a car can i give you a lift thank you said charlie he relaxed gratefully into the passenger seat feeling the ache in his body now as well as his head and aware how much it had taken from him to travel even this short distance the doctor had been right he should have stayed how did you know id gone to peking pressed charlie kuo yuanching told me the american had been easing the car out into the jammed streets but he risked a sideways glance to assess charlies reaction quite open about it was he why shouldnt he have been no reason agreed charlie did you try for a visa again there was a glance from the american to gauge any sarcasm yes he said shortly but he wouldnt give you one said it might take months to process thats why i wanted to know the moment you got back why we promised to pool everything we found remember i remember said charlie what have you come up with the car was bogged in traffic and the american turned completely towards charlie you smartassing me charlie returned the look his face open with innocence no he said why should i the traffic moved and jones had to look away were going to work together soon and youd better believe it said the american now it was a blatant threat recognised charlie i took a statement from the cook he said trying to turn the other mans annoyance and it confirmed everything we knew but couldnt prove so it wasnt peking definitely not and youve got the statement thats why i was attacked the briefcase containing the chinese original and the transcript signed by an english embassy official were stolen there was a photograph too identifying john lu this time it was charlie who was studying the american watching his expression jones continued staring straight ahead moving his fingers lightly against the steering wheel in his impatience with the vehicles around him lus men demanded jones finally hed be the only man to gain by stealing it thats what superintendent johnson thinks you must have had quite a discussion with johnson if jones had known about the statement and its theft why had he wanted him to repeat it some sort of test supposed charlie johnsons being very helpful admitted the american why i think he believes its going to be tough to prove anything against lu even now and that hes going to need all the assistance he can get and you can provide that assistance admit it you bastard thought charlie seizing the opening youve hinted the agency might help in return for favours its possible said jones charlie sat back letting the discussion go his headache was worsening even though it was difficult without water he gulped down two of the tablets he had been given at the hospital coughing when they stuck drily in his throat anything wrong asked jones anxiously no lied charlie they gained the tunnel running beneath the harbour and the car increased its speed how much had happened in the two weeks since hed made the same journey with robert nelson reflected charlie so many tunnels so much misunderstanding as they emerged charlie looked across to the lu office block guessing where charlies attention lay jones said hell be worried sick will he said charlie the american laughed at the caution the whole damned thing is about to come down around his ears he insisted i wish i were as sure admitted charlie a signed statement was tenuous enough now even thats gone youre a shit charlie he thought but hed never made the pretence of being anything else except a survivor and thats what he was doing now surviving he hoped please god that hed got it right jones eased the car into the edge of connaught road and charlie got out unsteadily in front of the mandarin hotel well keep in touch said jones leaning across the passenger seat yes and take care i shall charlie assured him because of the time difference between hong kong and london superintendent johnson had left his office late he had been held up awaiting confirmation that a copy of the peking statement would be despatched to him as soon as it arrived from china in the diplomatic bag just as he reached his apartment on the middle level the first contact came from the station inspector when he learned it had been an anonymous telephone call to police headquarters johnson refused to overrespond but he listed his instructions carefully ordering that the forensic and photographic sections should be alerted in case it were genuine and that his official car should be sent back then he sat still in uniform waiting the second call came within thirty minutes there was positive confirmation the duty officer reported nothing was being done until his arrival as he had insisted johnson had been trained at hendon and sometimes even here he referred to the longago lectures and notes remembering them now he sat in the back of the car as it made its way towards stubbs road and the peak eyes closed consciously trying to clear his mind of any preconception and suspicion about the fire and the courtroom murders and the claims of a downatheel insurance investigator hed need an open mind he knew it was going to be a difficult one the most difficult ever particularly now the foreign office in london was involved the sort of thing he tried so hard to avoid he gripped and ungripped his hands a frustrated gesture it was all so damned vague like imagined shapes in the fog and the lectures had told him to ignore things that werent clear he needed facts just plain straightforward facts he stirred moved by another thought whatever he was driving towards it certainly seemed that he had been wrong about the fire and the men who had admitted responsibility which was going to be bloody embarrassing yet the facts had been there as obvious as the fingers on his hand too obvious and hed made a mistake superintendent johnson who was well aware that had he remained in england he would never have risen above the rank of ordinary inspector didnt like making mistakes he worried that other people would realise his limitations and laugh at him he nodded with satisfaction at the road block established half a mile from lus mansion on shousan hill acknowledging the wave as his recognised car swept through but it would be the only one allowed past he was confident hed repeated the instruction during the second call it was the sort of routine at which he was very good an inspector was waiting at the already opened gate to lus home well demanded johnson getting from his car everything as you asked sir said the man nothings been touched servants and guards assembled in one spot so they couldnt interfere with anything how many fifteen john lu is one of them yet they heard nothing lu apparently relied upon an extensive electrical system so what happened to it here the inspector invited him johnson followed the man to a corner of the surrounding wall it was topped all the way by thick wire mesh normally enough electricity going through that to kill an elephant said the inspector what stopped it working with a nightstick the inspector indicated an obscured corner near brickwork which swept out to begin the imposing entrance through which one had to drive to reach the house theres a conduit box there he said he waved an impatient hand and an officer in one of the waiting cars gave him a light operated from the vehicles battery its been bypassed so that there was no current passing through this section here in the light of the torch johnson could see avoidance leads clamped by their bulldog clips to the live wires and beyond them the hole that had been carefully cut through the mesh on the other side said the inspector theres the main junction box for this side of the house every alarm system has been circuited in the same way an expert said johnson professional agreed the officer what about the clips havent let the forensic people get to them until your arrival said the man he hesitated but i think youll find theyre of american origin he said wanting to prove himself american demanded johnson sharply the inspector partially retreated at his superiors reaction thats my guess he said what about the house it happened in what appears to be the main lounge ive men guarding it and an ambulance on the way ambulance one of them is still alive johnson waved the inspector towards his car entering from the other side and telling the driver to go on normally he realised the grounds would have been floodlit but the interference with the power supply had created an odd patchwork effect the scientific experts were grouped just inside the main entrance to the house when they saw johnsons car arrive they straightened expectantly give me a moment he said moving past them he stopped just inside the door of the room the inspector indicated to get an overall impression holy jesus he said softly it had been a protracted desperate fight a glasstopped table in the middle of the room was splintered and crushed presumably by the weight of a stumbling body there were bloodstains too which continued to an overturned couch and then led to a wall near the fireplace here all the ornaments and decorations had been swept aside in the struggle and more blood smeared the walls a delicate chinese brushworked painting that had concealed the wall safe hung lopsided the hook almost torn from the wall the safe gaped open and inside johnson had the briefest impression of bundles of money banded together in tight blocks but he wasnt interested so much in the safe at its foot his body wedged in a strange awkwardness against the skirting board lay harvey jones the mans leg was twisted beneath him hed broken it when he fell thought johnson his mind registering the details with a clinical latertobeproducedincourt accuracy near the mans outstretched left hand was a tall pedestal ornament its heavy base messily bloodstained there was a matching ornament on the other side of the fireplace johnson saw cracked where it had fallen to the ground he knelt to get closer to the body joness eyes were still open in a shocked expression of death and the police chief could just see the bullet entries one high in the left shoulder was little more than a flesh wound but there was another lower in the chest and from the amount of blood it was clear there was a third that he couldnt immediately see johnson had begun to straighten before he noticed the document he crouched again trying to read it without displacing it before the photographs were taken there was a slight splash of blood on one corner and the mans arm obscured the beginning but it was quite easy for johnson to read at least a third and identify the signature of geoffrey hodgson alongside the seal of the british embassy in peking he stood slowly so he wouldnt have to await the arrival of the diplomatic bag here called the inspector the chinese millionaire lay so that his crumpled body was almost completely concealed by the desk from it came the snorted breathing of someone deeply unconscious and by moving around behind him johnson could see the deep triangular gash at the side of lus head the police chief looked across at the ornament by joness outstretched hand the base could have created just such a wound facts he recognised contentedly presentable unarguable facts soon it would be time to bring the photographers and scientists in to commence the simple logical routine quite a fight suggested the inspector drawers had been jerked from their runners and in two places johnson could see where the locks had been forced crudely jemmied open by some strong leverage the contents were strewn haphazardly over the desk as if someone had been looking for something particular and discarded what he didnt want without caring where it landed again johnson crouched grunting with the difficulty of getting his large body beneath the narrow legspace of the desk about six inches from lus right hand lay a pistol johnson lowered himself to it sniffing immediately twitching his nose at the smell of cordite czech commented the inspector m roughlooking weapon said johnson rising but could be fitted with a silencer said the inspector indicating the attachment there was movement at the door and johnson turned the ambulance is here reported the guarding policeman let them come in said johnson and forensic and photographic too the experts entered in a bunch photographs first stipulated johnson sure of his case and therefore sure of himself the whitecoated ambulance men entered with their stretcher the mans here said johnson but before hes moved i want a paraffin test on his hands to establish that hes recently fired a gun immediately one of the plainclothes men opened a bag and began walking towards the desk superintendent johnson the police chief turned at the inspectors summons this would seem to be the point of entry said the officer a neat semicircle had been cut from the glass near the interior catch of the ceilingtofloor window thats it agreed johnson not difficult to see what happened quite obvious agreed johnson intruder surprised by the householder in the middle of a robbery is shot but manages to bludgeon the man to the ground then dies of his injuries as he tries to retrieve from the safe what hes looking for looking for something i thought was going to create the most difficult case id ever been called upon to handle admitted the police chief but now it looks like one of the easiest the inspector pointed towards the dead man at the far side of the room quite an expert wasnt he oh he was an expert right enough said johnson the inspector turned at the confidence in his superiors voice did you know him johnson smiled he worked for the american government he disclosed the central intelligence agency oh said the inspector doubtfully that could cause some problems couldnt it i dont see why said johnson the facts were there after all no one could argue with them plain as the fingers on his hand charlie muffin was finally sick he stood sweating over the lavatory bowl agonised by the head pain that came with each stomachstretching retch when he could finally leave the bathroom it was difficult to see and for a moment he thought he was suffering from the double vision with which hed awakened in hospital he sat quietly on the edge of the bed blinking the wetness from his eyes he was limp with perspiration and smelt like the confused old man in the peking interview room charlie reached out for the pills the doctor had given him concerned at how few remained in the bottle it would be sensible to go back to hospital sensible but impossible he undressed carelessly leaving his clothes puddled on the floor he didnt bother to get beneath the bed covering because he knew he wouldnt sleep it was going to be a long time until the morning he thought johnson took the document from charlie nodding with satisfaction at another established fact no doubt at all no said charlie thats definitely the statement i took from the cook in peking and the one that was stolen from you at the border yes and this is the photograph identifying john lu yes the police chief sat back expansively thats it then everything explained it would seem so agreed charlie there was no pain now but if he moved his head quickly he still felt a slight dizziness it had all been brilliantly conceived he thought which meant he was still in great danger youll always have to run charlie always be a defence to the killing of course said johnson reduced to manslaughter or even with a good counsel justifiable homicide in the protection of his property yes in fact joness killing is unimportant compared to the door it opened the fitting epitaph thought charlie sadly here lies harvey jones whose death served a purpose it would seem i owe you an apology conceded johnson unexpectedly you were right it would have been difficult to prove he admitted indicating the statement even with that but not now said the police chief no said charlie not now what about john lu the widest open door of them all what do you mean he was among those detained at the house last night so he couldnt run and so he panicked started making admissions before we even asked the questions you were lucky luckier than we thought his lawyers are trying to do a deal now to salvage something from the mess into which he talked himself what sort of deal his evidence against his father together with all the details of the crime empire in exchange for a guarantee against prosecution not very chinese son turning against father is it johnson laughed the policeman was very happy with himself thought charlie i told you not to take any notice of that folklore rubbish he said yes said charlie you told me will you accept his offer make an unbreakable case the policeman sat forward as the thought came to him and it would be the end of any claim against you if hed agree to be a witness yes said charlie it would he hated his father apparently said johnson hated him always have you told your people in london charlie nodded i telephoned before coming here he said willoughby had almost sobbed with relief itll be a hell of a case when it finally comes to court yes said charlie johnson saw a lot of personal credit coming from it and not just because of lu and who he is continued johnson you didnt have any idea that jones was an american intelligence agent did you no said charlie no idea at all he was confided johnson theres an enormous diplomatic flap i suppose there would be said charlie he looked at his watch coming to the remand hearing johnson invited him yes said charlie rising it was difficult to keep in step with the large man and charlies head began to hurt again i wondered if you would do me a favour he said johnson slowed looking sideways of course now the man was almost overcompensating in his friendliness thought charlie i want to find the woman said charlie woman jenny lin lee the woman who was with nelson johnson stopped completely turning across the corridor towards charlie shes not at nelsons flat any longer explained charlie you think shes gone back whoring charlie knew he would never be able to think of that word as anything but offensive and ugly yes he said shouldnt be too difficult promised johnson setting off towards the court again call me tomorrow i will said charlie early hed already booked his return flight to london he was taking a risk even now but there were other things to do it was the same court as that in which the two chinese shipyard workers had appeared and again there was a crush for admission because he was with johnson charlie entered ahead of everyone else with a choice of seats i gather lu is flying lawyers in from london when the case opens said johnson when will that be i shall apply for remands until we reach a decision with the son but it shouldnt take too long ive got an unarguable case just as hed had with the fire and the poor sods whod got killed thought charlie how was it that people like johnson got into positions of power there was a great similarity between the police chief and the people whod taken over the department after sir archibalds death unarguable agreed charlie johnson identified the sarcasm surely you dont think this is wrong he demanded charlie hesitated avoiding an immediate reply youve got a good case he said finally the ushers began to admit the public and charlie moved away towards the seat he had occupied when he and nelson had been in court he turned as lu was brought in the millionaires head was turbaned with bandages and a medical attendant was in the back of the dock as well as the warders lu stared defiantly towards the magistrates bench hands gripping the top of the dock the court rose for the magistrates entry and immediately the clerk read out the charge of murder against lu johnson rose as the man finished i would make a formal application for a weeks remand he said officiously at which time i anticipate the police being in a position to indicate when they could proceed the local solicitor representing lu until the arrival of the london counsel hurried to his feet he was wearing an eton tie charlie saw i would like it entered into the court records at this first hearing that my client utterly denies the preposterous charge against him said the man were it based on fact there would be a producible defence against it but it is not i would therefore make application for bail asking the court to consider my clients position in this community he would of course be prepared to surrender his passport having regard to the seriousness of the charge together with other matters still under investigation the police oppose bail most strongly objected johnson instantly bail refused declared the magistrate chairman as the solicitor moved to speak the man went on you have the right of course to apply to a judge in chambers an application will be made said the solicitor he wont get it johnson said to charlie as the court cleared no said charlie uninterested it was almost time for his appointment know what the defence is going to be charlie paused at the court exit turning back to the police chief what that he knows nothing whatever about what happened to harvey jones johnson laughed inviting charlies reaction when charlie said nothing johnson added ridiculous isnt it yes agreed charlie ridiculous no risk at all willoughby nodded at his wifes question no risk at all not any longer she came towards him arms outstretched why darling thats wonderful he refused to bend towards her and because of his height she wasnt able to pull herself up to kiss him oh she said punishment what did you expect theres no need to be to be she stumbled uncivilised he offered or sarcastic he closed his eyes helplessly why couldnt he just tell her to get out shed been going after all do you still want me to leave you know the answer to that do you still want me to leave she persisted no he conceded his voice a whisper then you mustnt be cruel to me youre a cow he said which is a very rude and offensive word but ive never pretended to be otherwise the usual defence he thought what about this man whos done it all charlie charlie what a delightfully coarse name is he coarse darling strange in many ways allowed willoughby i simply must meet him yes agreed the underwriter you must very soon all right very soon rupert what say you love me i love you kuo yuanching looked cautiously across the desk head to one side in what charlie had come to realise was an habitual pose im intrigued at your visit said the chinese you shouldnt be said charlie it would be wrong to let this man imagine any superiority kuo let an expression reach his face but refused to respond directly to the remark instead he said everything would seem to have been resolved far better than you had hoped and youll get your court denunciation it would seem likely admitted kuo its inevitable predicted charlie especially now that john lu wants to save himself by turning queens evidence then were both satisfied no said charlie im not satisfied at all not with having saved thats not what i meant what then i know what happened announced charlie kuo remained expressionless hands resting lightly on the table top doesnt everybody he said no mr kuo hardly anybody the man shook his head raising his hands in a gesture of bewilderment you baffle me he protested condescendingly for a long time you baffled me said charlie and then i thought of the incredible help and all the concern about lu being publicly denounced and then i remembered what mr chiu told me as we were going to peking what was that people who bring disgrace to china never go unpunished quoted charlie kuo nodded seriously thats true he agreed were sometimes a vindictive nation ive often been accused of the same fault perhaps thats how i finally realised the truth is vindictiveness necessarily a fault its taken me a long time to recognise it admitted charlie too long he thought im still waiting to be surprised prompted kuo apart from the fact that i should have been wounded by the knife the border attack was very convincing even to the suits your people wore just like lus men but not to use the knife was a mistake our people echoed kuo your people insisted charlie no one except the chinese authorities knew when i would be returning across the border with the statement implicating lu so it couldnt have been anyone else could it there was a disparaging expression upon kuos face but why should we steal from you an affidavit we went to such enormous trouble to ensure you obtained he said to guarantee even if it meant murder the public disgrace of lu said charlie a disgrace that i couldnt guarantee not even with the statement a very wild flight of fancy said kuo mildly no argued charlie not wild at all just a sensible interpretation of pekings determination to maintain its rapport with america a rapport important enough to risk the death of an american agent an agent whom you took particular care to let know the facilities id been given and whom you knew would make an effort to retrieve incriminating evidence if enough people pointed him to it and enough people did charlie paused which was why i wasnt knifed he accepted i had to set the bait didnt i kuo pushed his chair slightly away from the table making a small grating sound it actually removed the risk of having to snatch him off the streets with all the problems of failure that that might have created didnt it all you had to do was follow him until he got to lus house people who know more about it than i said you were extremely clever mr muffin said kuo conversationally but i dont think any of us believed youd work it out as far as you have you really are a surprising man charlie sat motionless numbed by the identification why bewilderment mr muffin youd expect peking to have extensive files on all american and british operatives wouldnt you said kuo still casual just as they have files about our people charlie still couldnt respond it was little more than a routine crossreference with your picture almost as soon as you arrived in the colony to question the fire that gave us your identity said the chinese he had assumed control decided charlie and you were right continued kuo we had far more reason than any british insurance company to expose lu so nothing could be left to chance the almost constant impression of surveillance remembered charlie so his instinct wasnt failing he felt the relief of a man fearing blindness who is assured that all he needs are reading glasses your coming really fascinated us admitted kuo particularly as your file had you marked as dead he leaned forward across the desk and such an interesting file he said we could easily appreciate why london and washington would want you killed russia would have leaked the humiliation of the british and the americans charlie knew theyd seen it from the beginning as a propaganda coup he was not surprised that peking knew the details you made very full use of me didnt you he said at last as much as we possibly could conceded kuo the arrival of the man jones made it perfect for us otherwise mine would have been the body found in lus lounge kuos face opened with the obviousness of the answer it would have had to be wouldnt it he said and you would have had as much reason to try to retrieve the document as the american more maybe but im not being allowed to escape am i guessed charlie escape within twentyfour hours this colony will be inundated with men from washington investigating the death of one of their operatives predicted charlie to point them towards me would round the whole thing off very neatly wouldnt it youre a very suspicious person mr muffin i have to be kuo nodded yes he agreed of course do you intend exposing me demanded charlie kuo sighed a man facing an unpleasant duty its very unlikely that theyd see the flaw you recognised no one was as completely involved as you after all but theres always the outside possibility and as ive said we cant leave anything to chance so to be handed me might deflect their curiosity you must admit said kuo washington would be very interested moving slowly so the man would not misunderstand charlie put his hand into the inside pocket of his jacket and took out an envelope as interested perhaps as they would be in these he said kuos control was very good thought charlie there was not the slightest indication of emotion as the man went carefully through the photographs the first showed quite clearly harvey jones bypassing the alarms at lus house there were more of chinese this time at the same spot on the wall the picture of the americans apparently unconscious body being bundled into the lounge was slightly blurred because of the distance from which it had been taken but jones was still recognisable there were several pictures of a car with the number plate clearly identifiable the registration would prove it to be the vehicle assigned to this legation wouldnt it asked charlie oh yes agreed kuo he looked up infrared photography i was professionally trained said charlie i actually entered the department because of it theyre very good said kuo as if he were admiring holiday snapshots the only difficulty is the need to keep the film refrigerated until just before use and then getting it developed as soon as possible afterwards said charlie fortunately in a place like hong kong i had no difficulty buying an lens the negatives and more prints are obviously in a safe place said kuo bored with the phoney civility obviously agreed charlie unworried by the threat he looked at his watch one set will almost be in london by now he said he was back in an environment hed believed hed left for ever he felt very much at home with a complete account queried kuo very full confirmed charlie you could have saved jones the chinese accused him suddenly i tried said charlie but only after he had guaranteed his own survival the telephone call to the police charlie nodded but i was too late he said as always i wondered about the call said kuo it was much sooner than that which we had planned to make we were almost caught i know said charlie taking more pictures from his pocket kuo was shown twice by the identifiable car really very clever he congratulated charlie as i said i have to be just as i had to be there said the chinese in explanation we realised the risk of course but i had to see the affidavit was put in the right place and guarantee the little important things like ensuring the firing traces would be found on lus right and not left hand nothing could be left to chance remembered charlie exactly keep the photographs offered charlie i expect youll want other people to see them mr chiu for instance kuo nodded putting them into a drawer in the desk i congratulate you said kuo charlie didnt feel any pride just relief and regret the regret of which edith had never thought him capable it would seem said kuo that we will part in friendship not exactly friendship qualified charlie more in complete understanding kuo smiled its been an interesting experience mr muffin for both of us agreed charlie johnson had wanted to send someone with him but charlie had refused the protection the shack was actually against the kowloon waterfront part of the tindrum and cardboard shanty town to the east of the city charlie felt the attention as soon as he entered stopping just inside the door to adjust to the darkness and not just attention he realised hostility too the mutter of conversation began again but everyone was still watching him he knew everyone except jenny she was at the bar head bent in apparent interest in something before her he picked his way through the trestles at which the chinese sat careful not to come into contact it would need little excuse for an argument to erupt as he got near to the girl he saw that the hair of which she had once been so proud was greased with dirt and matted in disorder jenny he said quietly her glass was almost empty she was staring down into it but her eyes were fogged and unseeing jenny he tried again the barman positioned himself in front of him beer said charlie the man looked at the girl and charlie nodded there was still no reaction when her glass was refilled he reached out touching her arm she was very cold despite the ovenlike heat of the place she responded at last to his touch squinting sideways there was no immediate recognition twenty dollars she said distantly very good for twenty dollars jenny he said again trying to reach her hong kong not american she recited fuck all night just twenty dollars there were no puncture marks on her arms he looked down and saw the needle bruises around her ankles near the big vein know you she said thickly the cheongsam was the one she had worn the night she had come to his room it was very stained and the thigh split had been torn so that it gaped almost to her groin came to fire robert she smiled with the pride of a child remembering a difficult multiplication table lu lost said charlie too many other people did as well but lu lost there was no comprehension robert came here she said mouthing the words slowly that night he came here he reached out again trying physically to squeeze some reaction from her lu has been arrested he said very brave coming here by himself roundeyes arent allowed now theyve made me come here work here punishment charlie lodged against the barstool looking at her sadly the heroin had almost completely blanketed her mind she would take months to cure months of patient constant care he looked at his watch the flights bringing in the american investigation teams to supplement those already in the colony would be arriving within three hours it would have to be someone else she blinked her eyes as if remembering something all night she said only twenty dollars anything you want she snatched out suddenly desperate when she saw him move fifteen then anything you want for fifteen he shrugged her hand away threading between the unsteady tables again it didnt matter if he collided with anybody he realised they had wanted him to find her and see what had happened bastard she screamed behind him fired robert yes thought charlie stepping unsteadily out into the street he was a bastard literally and in every other way usually he wasnt as ashamed of it as he was now she wouldnt have understood had he tried to explain he wasnt abandoning her willoughby needed movement to let off his excitement striding without direction about the room for the first time he was holding himself upright charlie saw he was remarkably tall unbelievable said the underwriter groping for words sufficient to express himself a miracle nothing short of a miracle the grandfather clock in the corner of willoughbys office chimed the halfhour and charlie looked across to it still another hour before the appointment the chiropodist would probably insist upon the supports being put into his shoes mean another new pair he supposed wonder how difficult it would be adjusting to an artificial lump beneath each foot people got hurt charlie reminded him puncturing the other mans euphoria too many people willoughby stopped the pacing looking seriously at charlie and not just in hong kong said the underwriter obscurely i dont understand said charlie despite the chiropodist he could still get to guildford before the rushhour he hoped ediths grave hadnt become too neglected willoughby shook himself like a dog throwing off water its not important incidentally there was quite a lot of money due to robert nelson i sent it to our new broker there was a woman said charlie hopefully its important to arrange something for her jenny lin lee interrupted willoughby charlie nodded shes dead oh massive drug overdose apparently said the underwriter the police have decided it was selfadministered so theres no question of any crime already stencilled closed and filed in one of johnsons neat little cabinets by one of his neat little clerks thought charlie again hed been too late she knew lu would win some sort of victory said charlie softly what nothing said charlie ill always be indebted to you declared the underwriter sitting at last at his desk it took me a long time to realise how long id been away said charlie almost too long he would never know about the peking ambassador he thought not until it was too late anyway i wouldnt like it to end said willoughby in fact clarissa wants to meet you clarissa my wife lets meet socially very soon thank you im sorry for the way all this began charlie it was wrong to treat you as i did forget it id like the association to continue charlie shifted uncertainly how soon would it be before the fear diminished and the boredom began eating away at him again i dont know he said i made a lot of mistakes but won in the end only just which was all he could ever hope for decided charlie to win by a small margin
