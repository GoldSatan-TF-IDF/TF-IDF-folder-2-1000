lois mcmaster bujold the spirit ring chapter one fiametta turned the lump of warm reddish clay in her hand do you think its done yet papa she asked anxiously can i break it open now her father closed his hand over hers testing the heat not yet set it down it wont cool the faster for being juggled she signed impatiently and laid the clay ball back down on the workbench in the patch of morning sunlight falling through the windows iron grille cant you put a cooling spell on it he chuckled ill put a cooling spell on you girl you have too much of the element of fire in you even your mother used to say so reflexively master beneforte crossed himself and bowed his head when naming the dead the laugh faded a little in his eyes dont burn so fast its the banked coals that last the night but you stumble in their dark fiametta parried what burns fast burns bright she leaned her elbows on the bench and scuffed her slipper across the floor tiles and regarded her work clay with a golden heart in his sunday sermons bishop monreale often said man was clay she felt a melting sense of union with the object on the table brown and lumpy on the outsideshe sighed againbut full of secret promise if only it could be broken open maybe its marred she said nervously an air pocket dirt could he not sense it a pure high hum like a tiny heartbeat then you can melt it down and do it over till you get it right her father shrugged it will be your own fault and just what you deserve for rushing ahead and pouring before i came to watch you the metal will not be lost or it shouldnt beill beat you like a real apprentice if you manage such an apprentices trick as that he frowned ferociously but fiametta sensed not altogether seriously it wasnt the metal she was worried about losing but she had no intention of confiding her secret and risking disapproval or derision when shed heard her fathers step in the hallway she had hastily rubbed away the chalk diagram with spit and her sleeve and swept the recipe sheet carefully copied in her best hand and the set of symbolic objectssalt dried flowers a bit of unworked gold wheat seedsfrom the workbench the apron into which shed bundled them sat on the end of the table looking dreadfully conspicuous papa had after all only given her permission to cast gold she hitched her nip over a tall stool rubbed at the leather apron over her gray wool outer dress and sniffed at the chill spring air slipping through the workrooms unglazed window but it worked my first investment worked or at least it didnt backflow a pounding penetrated from the houses heavy oak outer door and a mans voice master beneforte hallo the house prospero beneforte are you awake in there fiametta scrambled up to the table to mash her face against the grille and try to see around the corner of the window frame into the street two menits the dukes steward messer quistelli papa and she brightened the swiss captain ha master beneforte hastily pulled off his own leather apron and straightened the skirts of his tunic perhaps he brings my bronze at last its about time has no one unbarred the door this morning he stuck his head through the workrooms other window that opened onto his houses inner court and bellowed teseo unbar the door his graying beard pointed left and right where is the useless boy run and unbar the door fiametta tuck your hair under your cap first youre all awry like a washerwoman fiametta hopped down untied the strings of her plain white linen cap and with her fingers pushed and combed back strands of her crinkly black hair which had escaped unnoticed in her absorption with her mornings work she tightened her cap smoothly over her head again though in the back a wild cushion of ringlets defied order cascading over her nape and a third of the way to her waist she now wished shed taken the time to braid it at dawn before racing off to lay the fire in the little cupellation furnace in the corner of the workroom before papa woke and came down better still if shed put on the real lace cap from bruges that papa had given her last spring for her fifteenth birthday the pounding resumed hallo the house fiametta danced into the stonepaved hallway and slid back the bar of the main door opened it and swept a curtsey good morning messer quistelli and a breath more shyly captain ochs ah fiametta messer quistelli gave her a nod im here to see the master messer quistelli wore long dark robes like a scholar the guardsman uri ochs wore the dukes livery a short black tunic with sleeves striped red and gold and black hose he bore no metal breastplate nor pike nor helmet this peaceful morning only the sword at his hip and a black velvet cap with the duke of montefoglias badge on it perched on his brown hair the flowerandbee badge was master benefortes own work coppergilt appearing solid gold keeping the secret of the captains relative poverty the swiss sent half his pay home to his mother master beneforte had whispered shaking his head whether in admiration for this filial piety or dismay at his financial fecklessness fiametta had not been sure captain ochss legs filled his hose neatly though no sad drooping bags to them like the leggings of skinny young apprentices or dried old men from the duke fiametta asked hopefully the leather purse hanging at messer quistellis waist next to his glasses bulged in a most promising manner but then the duke was always promising papa said fiametta ushered the men inside and led them into the front workroom where master beneforte advanced on them rubbing his hands in greeting good morning gentlemen i trust you bring good news about the bronze duke sandrino promised me for my great work sixteen pigs of copper mind you no less are the arrangements made yet messer quistelli shrugged against this importunity not yet though im sure by the time youre ready master so will the metal be his raised brow had a faint ironic tilt and master beneforte frowned her father had a nose like a hunting dog for the faintest slight or insult fiametta held her breath but messer quistelli went on touching the purse at his belt i do bring you my lords allowance for your wood and wax and workmen even i am not so great a conjurer as to be able to make bronze from wax and wood growled master beneforte but he reached for the purse anyway messer quistelli turned slightly away your skill is unquestioned master it is your speed my lord has come to doubt perhaps you try to take on too many commissions to the detriment of all i must use my time efficiently if my household is to eat master beneforte said stiffly if my lord duke wishes his wife to stop ordering jewelry he should take it up with her not me about that saltcellar said messer quistelli firmly i have pressed it forward with incessant industry as i have said yes but is it finished it lacks only the enamelling and perhaps the functionary spells messer quistelli suggested have you laid them on yet not laid on said master beneforte in a tone of injured dignity this is no hedgemagicians spell of seeming your lord requires of me the spell is integral builtin worked along with each stroke of my chisel duke sandrino requires me to observe its progress said messer quistelli a shade more diffidently the news is not general yet but i am to tell you in confidence his daughters betrothal is being negotiated he wants to be sure the saltcellar is finished in time for the betrothal banquet ah master benefortes face lightened a worthy debut for my art when is it planned the end of this month so soon and who is the fortunate bridegroom to be uberto ferrante lord of losimo there was a distinct pause i see my lord dukes urgency said master beneforte messer quistelli made a handsdown gesture blocking further comment fiametta master beneforte turned to her taking a ring of keys from his girdle run and fetch the golden saltcellar from the chest in my room mind you lock both chest and door again behind you fiametta took the keys and exited at a ladylike walk no childish skipping under the eyes of the swiss captain until she reached the stairs in the courtyard to the upper gallery which she took two at a time the big ironbound chest at the foot of her fathers bed contained a dozen leatherbound books several stacks of notes and papers tied with ribbonsanxiously she tried to remember if she had indeed replaced them last time identically to their previous arrangementand a polished walnut box the chest was redolent with the aromas of paper leather ink and magic she lifted out the heavy box and relocked both chest and room with the complex filigreed iron keys she could feel the spells of warding slide into place along with the bolts a tiny jolt up the nerves of her hand most potent to be sensed at all given papas incessant drive for subtlety in his art she returned to the downstairs workroom her light leather slippers padded almost silently across the flagstones as she approached a chance word in the captains voice caught her ear she stiffened and listened outside the workroom door your daughters mother moorish then or blackamoor ethiope surely messer quistelli opined was she a slave of yours no she was a christian woman replied fiamettas father from brindisi there was a certain dryness in his voice whether with respect to christian women or brindisi fiametta could not tell she must have been very beautiful said the swiss politely that she was and i was not always so dried up and battered as you see me today either before my nose was broken and my hair grew gray captain ochs made an apologetic noise implying no slur intended on his hosts face messer quistelli also aging laughed appreciatively has she inherited your talent in your art master beneforte while avoiding your noser asked messer quistelli shes certainty better than that hamhanded apprentice of mine whos fit only for hauling wood her drawings and models are very fine i dont tell her so of course theres nothing more obnoxious than a proud woman i have let her work in silver and ive just started letting her work in gold messer quistelli vented a suitably impressed hmm but i was thinking of your other art ah master benefortes voice slid away without actually answering the question its a great waste to train a daughter who will only take your efforts and secrets off to some other man when she marries although if certain noble parties remain in arrears on the payments an artist of my stature is properly owed her knowledge may be the only dowry i can afford her he heaved a large and pointed sigh in messer quistellis direction did i ever tell you about the time the pope was so overwhelmed by the beautiful gold medallion i crafted for his cope he doubled my pay yes several times said messer quistelli quickly to no avail he was going to make me master of the mint too till my enemies whispers got up that false charge of necromancy against me and i rotted in the dungeons of castel sain angelo for a year fiametta had heard that one too she backed up a few paces shuffled her slippers noisily on the tiles and entered the workroom she set the walnut box carefully before her father and handed him back his keys he smiled and rubbed his hands on his tunic and with a word under his breath unlocked and opened the box he folded back the silk wrappings lifted the object within and set it in the middle of the grid of sunlight falling on the table the golden saltcellar blazed and sparked in the light and both visitors caught their breaths the sculpture rested on an oval base of ebony richly decorated upon it two palmhigh golden figures a beautiful nude woman and a strong bearded man holding a triton sat with their legs interlaced as we see in firths and promontories master beneforte enthusiastically explained the symbolism a shipfiametta thought it more of a rowboatof delicate workmanship near the hand of the seaking was to hold the salt a little greek temple beneath the earthqueens gracefully draped hand was meant for the pepper around the man sea horses fish and strange crustaceans sported around the woman a happy riot of beautiful creatures of the earth the swiss captains mouth hung open and messer quistelli pulled the spectacles from his belt balanced them on his nose and peered hungrily at the fine work master beneforte swelled visibly pointing out meaningful details and enjoying the mens astonishment messer quistelli recovered first but does it work he demanded doggedly master beneforte snapped his finger fiametta fetch me two wineglasses a bottle of winethe sour wine ruberta uses for cooking not the good chiantiand that white powder she uses to destroy rats in the pantry quickly now fiametta scampered glowing with her secret i designed the dolphins and the little rabbits too behind her she could hear master beneforte bellowing again for teseo the apprentice she flung across the courtyard and into the kitchen meeting rubertas protests at her flurry with a breathless papa wants yes girl but i wager hell want his dinner as well and the fires gone out in the stove ruberta pointed with her wooden spoon at the bluetiled firebox oh is that all fiametta bent over unlatched the iron door and turned her face to look inside the dark square she ordered her thoughts to an instant of calm piro she breathed brilliant blue and yellow flames flared up like dancers on the dead coals that should do it she tasted the heat of the spell on her tongue with satisfaction at least she could do one thing well even papa said so and if one why not another thank you dear said ruberta turning to fetch her iron pot by the aromatic evidence on the cutting board she was about to do splendid things with onions garlic rosemary and spring lamb youre welcome quickly fiametta assembled the items needed for the demonstration upon a tray including the last two clear venetian wineglasses from the set the carters had broken in their move here to montefoglia almost five years ago papa had forgotten to mention the salt or the pepper she snatched their jars from the high shelf and added them to the array as well and marched it all to the workroom her back straight smiling to himself master beneforte tapped a little salt into the bowlhull of the ship for a moment his face took on an inward look he whispered under his breath and crossed himself fiametta touched messer quistellis arm as he started to speak to keep him from interrupting what she knew to be a critical step the hum from the saltcellar that answered master benefortes whisper was deep and rich but very very faint musical and fine a year or so ago she could not have sensed it at all messer quistelli clearly did not the pepper papa fiametta offered it we shall not use the pepper today he shook his head he then placed a generous spoonful of the rat powder into one of the wineglasses and tied a string around its stem to mark it then he poured the wine into both glasses the powder dissolved slowly with a faint fizz where is the boy master beneforte muttered after a few more minutes of waiting fortunately before his master could work up to true irritation teseo slammed through the front door and appeared in the workroom his cap askew on his head and one hose sagging with points nailtied and a towel bundled in his nervous hands i could only catch one in the midden master teseo apologized the other bit me and ran off huhl perhaps ill use you for a substitute then master beneforte frowned teseo paled he took up the towel which proved to imprison a large and wildlooking rat its teeth yellow and broken and its fur mangy teseo sucked on his bleeding thumb the rat snapped hissed writhed and squeaked holding the beast firmly by the scruff of its neck master beneforte took a fine glass tube drew up some nowchalkypink wine from the glass with the string and forced the liquid down the rats throat after another moment he released the animal onto the tiles it snapped again started to run and began whirling in circles biting at its sides then it convulsed and died now observe gentlemen master beneforte said his two guests leaned closer as he took a sprinkle of salt between his fingers and dropped it into the plain wineglass nothing happened he took a second more generous pinch and dropped it into the poisoned wine the salt flared grains sparkling orange a blue flame like ignited brandy breathed up from the surface of the liquid and burned for fully a minute master beneforte stirred the mixture slowly with the pipette the contents were now as clear and rubybright as the other he lifted the stringed glass now his eye fell on teseo who squeaked rather like the rat and apprehensively stepped back ha unworthy boy master beneforte said scornfully he glanced at fiametta and a strange inspired smile curved his lips fiametta drink this messer quistelli drew in his breath with a gasp and the captain clenched his hand in shocked protest but fiametta straightened gave them a proud and confident smile and took the wineglass from her fathers hand she raised it to her lips and quaffed it all down in a single draught captain ochs started up again as she grimaced and just the faintest alarm flared for a moment in master benefortes eyes but she raised a hand in reassurance salty sour wine she scraped her tongue over her teeth and smothered a small belch for breakfast master beneforte smiled triumph at the dukes steward does it work apparently so and so you may bear witness to your lord messer quistelli clapped his hands wonderful though his eyes shifted now and then to recheck fiametta regretfully fiametta stifled a malicious urge to clutch her belly drop to the floor and scream the fleeting opportunity might be beautiful but master benefortes sense of humor did not extend to jokes played upon himself nor did his respect for revenge include justice for insults he laid upon others its a great waste to train a daughteriametta sighed messer quistelli touched the beautiful goldwork and how long will it last the saltcellar forever for that is the incorruptible nature of gold the spell of purificationperhaps twenty years if the piece is undamaged and it is not used without need the prayer of activation will be engraved upon the bottom for i fully expect it to outlast me messer quistelli raised impressed brows that long i give full value in my work said master beneforte taking the hint messer quistelli counted out the dukes monthly allowance onto the workbench and fiametta was sent again to lock both the saltcellar and the purse away in the strong chest when she returned messer quistelli had gone but captain ochs lingered with her father as he often did come uri into the courtyard master beneforte was saying and see your martial twin before i clothe him in his clay tunic i finished laying on the wax but two days ago the clay has been seasoning for months finished id no idea you were so far along said captain ochs will you invite the duke to inspect this new soldier of his then master beneforte smiled sourly and held one finger to his lips i wouldnt even be telling you if i didnt want to check a few last details i mean to mold and cast it in secret and surprise my impatient lord of montefoglia with the finished bronze let my enemies dare try to insult my diligence then you have been at this for over three years said uri doubtfully still tis always better to promise less and do more than the other way around aye master beneforte led the younger man into the open courtyard the pavement was still in morning shadow though a line of light was almost visibly creeping down the wall as the sun rode higher fiametta tagged along very quietly lest by drawing her fathers attention she win an unwelcome chore that would send her out of earshot beneath a canvas canopy a lumpy linenshrouded figure stood a manandahalf high ghostly in the grayness master beneforte stood on a stool and carefully unwound the protective wrappings a mans strong hand raised high emerged first holding a fantastical snakehaired severed head grimacing in a death mask then the calm heroic face beneath a winged helmet then the rest of the figures smooth nude shape its right hand held a fine curving sword the supple muscles seemed to hold the whole body poised live as a spring beneath the grisly trophy brandished in triumph its translucent surface was all made of goldenbrown wax exhaling the faintest aroma of honey truly breathed uri moving closer its magical master prospero he almost seems ready to step off his plinth better even than the plaster model master beneforte smiled pleased no magic to it boy this is pure art when this is cast it will glorify my name forever prospero beneforte master sculptor those ignorant fools who call me a mere goldsmith and tinker will be utterly routed and confounded the day this is unveiled in the square the dukes decorator hah uri stared fascinated into the heros wax face do i really look like that i fear you flatter me exceedingly master beneforte master beneforte shrugged the face is idealized perseus was a greek not a swiss nor pocked like a cheese it was your body that was so invaluable to me as a model wellknit strong without that lumpiness that some strong men have uri mimed a shiver glorious or no you wont again talk me into modeling naked in the winter while you sit swaddled in fur i kept the brazier full of coals i thought you mountain goats were impervious to cold when we can move around our winters keep us hardworking it was the standing still all twisted up like a rope that did me in i had a head cold for a month after master beneforte waved a dismissive hand it was worth it now while i have you here take off your right boot i have a little worry about this statues foot when the statue is cast i must force the metal down nearly five cubits the heads will do famously for fire ascends but he is to be perseus not achilles eh the swiss captain dutifully removed his boot and wriggled his toes for the sculptors inspection master beneforte compared flesh and wax and at last grunted satisfaction well i shall be able to mend what is lacking if need be you can see the very veins of this waxy fellows flesh said uri leaning close im almost surprised you didnt put in my hangnails and calluses hes so lively will it come out of the clay so fine like that in bronze the flesh is so delicate he hopped pulling his boot back on ha of that i can give you an immediate demonstration we have just cast a fine little conceit in goldill knock off the clay before your eyes and you can see for yourself if my statues hangnails will survive oh papa fiametta interrupted urgently can i undo it myself i did all the other steps by myself surely he must sense her newcast spell if he handled it so fresh what youre still moping around have you no chores or were you just hoping for another glance at a naked man master beneforte jerked his chin toward his waxen perseus youre going to put it in the town square papa all the maidens will see it fiametta defended herself had he caught her peeking at those modeling sessions the live perseus uri looked like this was a new and unsettling thought he glanced again at the statue as if inspired to ask for a bronze loincloth well master beneforte chuckled indulgently at her flusterment youre a brave good girl fiametta and deserve some reward for drinking sour wine for breakfast to confound that doubter quistelli for me come along he herded them both back toward the front workroom youll see captain the lost wax process is so easy a child can do it im not a child any more papa fiametta put in his smile went bland so it would seem the clay lump lay on the worktable where shed left it fiametta gathered up the tiniest chisels from the rack on the wall held the ball in her hands for a moment and recited an inward prayer the spells inaudible hum became almost a silent purr her father and the captain leaned on their elbows to either side and watched she chinked away with the chisel and clay flew off in chips gold gleamed from its matrix ah tis a ring said uri leaning closer fiametta smiled at him a little lion mask the captain went on interested as her fingers worked a needle to clean away the last of the clay oh look at the tiny teeth how he roars he laughed the teeth are meant to hold a ruby fiametta explained garnet master beneforte corrected a ruby would be brighter and more costly it would look well on a lords hand id think said uri you could recover the price of a ruby its to be my own ring said fiametta oh surely its sized for a man maiden a thumb ring fiametta explained a design thats cost me twice the gold of a finger ring master beneforte put in i shall hedge my promises more carefully next time and is it a magic ring madonna master beneforte stroked his beard and answered for her no fiametta glanced up at him from under the protective fringe of her eyelashes he neither smiled nor frowned yet she sensed a sharp observance beneath his bland demeanor she jerked around put the ring in the captains palm and held her breath he turned it over stroking the tiny waves of the lions mane with one finger he did not attempt to slide it on a puzzled look came into his eyes you know master beneforte how bitterly you have complained of your lazy and clumsy workmen a thought just came to mehow if i write to my brother thur in bruinwald hes only seventeen but hes worked all sorts of jobs at the mines and forges there since he was a boy hes very quick and hes assisted master kunz at the furnace it wouldnt be like breaking in a young and ignorant apprentice he already knows much of metal particularly copper and he must be much bigger and stronger now than when i last saw him just what you need for your perseus gloriosus do you write your brother often asked master beneforte watching him turn the ring in his hand no heavens i havent been home for four years a miners life is hard and spare the memory of those dark close tunnels gives me the shivering fits even yet ive twice offered to get thur a position in the dukes guard but he says hes loathe to be a soldier i say he doesnt know whats good for him but if the dukes glory in arms wont lure him out of that hole in the ground perhaps your glory in the arts might his hand closed again around the ring he handed it back to fiametta and rubbed absently at his palm worked at copper smelting has he said master beneforte well yes do write him lets see what happens the captain smiled ill go and do it now he made a pretty leg of a bow to fiametta bade master beneforte good morning and hurried out fiametta sat down on the stool the ring in her hands and heaved a huge sigh of disappointment youre right papa its useless i just cant do magic you think not said master beneforte mildly the spell didnt work i put my heart and soul into it and nothing happened he didnt even put the ring on for a moment she looked up realizing shed just given away her secret but master beneforte looked more thoughtful than angry i didnt exactly disobey papa you didnt tell me i mustnt try to work magic in the ring you didnt ask he said shortly you know very well ive never encouraged you metal magic is too dangerous for a woman to work or so ive always thought now i begin to wonder if it might be more dangerous to leave you untrained i was very careful to use nothing but story spells in the ring papa yes i knowdo you think you are transparent fiametta he added at her unsettled look i am a master child even another master could not use my books and tools without my knowing it she slumped but my magic failed he took up the ring and turned it in the light i should beat you for your slyness and sneaking he flipped open the folded apron on the end of me bench examined its contents and pursed his lips you used the truelove spell of the master of cluny right she nodded miserably that spell does not create true love child that would be a contradiction in terms for magically compelled feelings are not true it only reveals true love oh your ring may have worked though the master of clunys magic is no exercise for an apprentice it truly revealed that the handsome if pockmarked captain ochs is not your true love but i like him hes kind and courteous a gentleman not like the usual rough soldiers hes simply the first man youve seen or at any rate noticed and you have certainly seem all of him well thats not my fault she said grumpily its all your giggling girlfriends whove inspired you to this unbecoming forwardness ill be sixteen in a few weeks papa you know my gossip maddalena was betrothed last month shes already getting fitted in her wedding clothes and here the news this morningthe duke s daughter julia is only twelve that is pure politics said master beneforte and of an odor not of roses at that see you hold your tongue on that news or ill know where the rumor came from lord ferrante of losimo is fully thirtyfive and has a dubious reputation his second wife was not yet sixteenthe same age as you and think on thatwhen she died in childbirth not two months ago i shouldnt think youd find her fate so attractive as all that no of course not and yet all of a sudden everyone seems to be getting married except me all the good men will be taken and youll sit on me till im old and fat just to keep me handy for your spells bleed you a little into this new greenwood bowl love just a droptill i drop virgins blood virgins hair virgins spit virgins piss some days i feel like a magic cow your metaphor is terribly scrambled fiamia you know what i mean and then youll betroth me to some old rooster with skinny legs and a head as bald as an egg master beneforte suppressed a grin well rich widows dont lead so bad a life ha its not funny papa she paused and said more lowly unless youve tried already and found none to take me because i am too blackcomplexioned or too poordowered no daughter of mine shall be called poordowered he snapped back stung enough to finally drop his irritating air of amusement he composed himself again and added bank your burning soul in patience fiametta until my great perseus is cast and the duke rewards me as i deserve and it wont be some poor soldier ill buy you for a husband either your chattering girlfriends jaws will stopmost unaccustomedlyand hang open with envy at the wedding procession of prospero beneforte s daughter he handed her back her ring so keep this golden bauble as a lesson to yourself to trust your father before your own ignorance this little lion will roar at your wedding yet i drank your poisoned wine how much more trust do you require fiametta hid her ring deep in a pocket of her gown and went to get a whisk broom to clean up the clay from the workbench chapter two snow slid beneath thur ochss boots as he climbed from the little valley village of bruinwald toward the lift shed at the mines mouth he kicked reflectively at a graywhite mound beside the trail it flew in sad lumps not the fine cold powder of a few weeks back nor yet spring slush he would have welcomed slush any hint of the coming warmth the leaden dawn promised another leaden gray day of a winter that seemed to linger forever not that he was going to see much of this daylight he repositioned his pick over his shoulder and stuck his free hand into his armpit in a futile attempt to conserve body heat a shout halloed from above and he glanced up and hastily moved to the side of the trail prudently behind a tree on a wooden sledge a boy sitting atop a heavy pigskin sack of ore and whooping like a tartary horseman skidded past thur followed shortly by another racing each other to the valley floor there would be broken bones at the bottom if they didnt drag their feet before the next curve somehow they made it around out of sight and thur grinned sledding the ore down to the stream had been one of his favorite winter jobs a couple years back before hed grown to his present size and everyone spontaneously began assigning the heaviest tasks to him he reached the wooden shack sheltering the lift machinery and ventilation bellows and stepped gratefully out of the chill dawn breeze hissing down from the rocky wastes above the mine foreman was there before him measuring the days oil into their lamps thurs workmate henzi was unblocking the lift pulley and checking the teeth and rundles of the gears perhaps next year they could afford to have the machine enlarged and a hitch of horses or oxen to turn the axle in the meantime ore must be raised so two big men trod a wheel that turned beneath their straining legs heavy work but at least they could see daylight good morning master entlebuch thur said politely to the foreman rather hoping to be assigned to the wheel today but master entlebuch grunted to his feet and handed him a lamp farel the pickman entered stamping the snow from his boots and also received an oilcharged lamp and the baskets and wooden trays for the black copper ore master entlebuch has the priest come to fumigate for the kobold infestation yet farel asked anxiously no said master entlebuch shortly theyre getting awfully forward down there they knocked over two lamps yesterday and that broken waterpump chainthat wasnt just rust it was rust said the foreman grumpily from the slapdash job somebody did of oiling it most likely and as for the lamps kobold is but another word for clumsy in my belief so get yourselves down there and find some decent ore today before we all starve you two start on the upper face thur and farel packed their tools in the ore lift bucket and started down the wooden ladder into the mine hes in a foul mood this morning farel whispered above thur in the planklined shaft as soon as they were out of earshot of the lift shed i bet he just wont pay for the priests incense cant more like sighed thur the few veins they were presently working had been growing poorer all year there was no longer enough washed ore to keep master kunzs smelting furnace working more than twice in the month or thur would have been down helping at the forge this very day cleaning the spent furnaces stoking the roaring fires and watching master kunzs marvellous transformations of black dirt into pure shimmering liquid metals he would have been warm as toast working for master kunz perhaps he ought to try hiring himself out to the charcoal burners though with the smeltery at enforced rest there was little market for charcoal either the bergmeister threatened to shut this mine down soon if its profits did not improve it was this specter of dearth that made the foreman so shorttempered and jumpy thurs uncle had said as for thur well he must just keep a careful eye out for kobolds they reached the bottom of the vertical shaft and henzi lowered their tools thur hitched his hood up over his head to keep the rock dust out of his blond hair and off the back of his neck the slow silence of the stone pressed on thurs ears as they made their way down the sloping tunnel by the flickering orange glow of the oil lamps some men found the quiet eerie out thur had always found it rather comforting patient and unvarying enduring as a mother it was noise the sudden groan of shifting rock that terrified some forty paces into the mountain the way split into two crooked forks each following what had once been a rich vein of copper ore one sloped steeply downward and thur was mildly grateful not to be hauling baskets of ore up it today other dark holes led off veins played out and abandoned and robbed of their supporting timbers they followed an upper more level branch till it deadended at last in a raw rock wall farel set his lamp down carefully out of the range of flying chips and hoisted his pick have at it boy thur positioned himself where his backswing wouldnt strike the other man and they both began whaling away at the dim discoloration in the rock that was the fading stringer of ore a half hours work left them both gasping hasnt that idiot entlebuch started the bellows yet farel wiped sweat from his brow go yell up suggested thur he shovelled their halfbasketful of ore for farel to take with him as long as he was going in the pause thur could hear distant echoes of the pounding now going on at the lower tunnels working face the rock was hard the ore was thin and theyd extended the tunnel barely fifteen feet in the last three months thur adjusted the leather knee pads his mother had fashioned knelt and attacked the face lower down he hacked till he was winded and aching from his crouched position then stood and leaned to rest a moment on his pick farel was not back yet thur glanced around then stepped up to the rock face and leaned against its chipped and scarred surface he spread his fingers against the discoloration and closed his eyes the babble of his thoughts faded into an inarticulate silence at one with the silence of the stone he was the stone he could feel the stringer of ore like a tendon running through his body thinning ten feet in dwindling and yet a few feet farther on like a swordstroke slanting down a rich vein native copper glorying along like a bright frozen river crying for the light that it might shine the metal calls me thur whispered to himself i can feel it i can but who would believe him and how did these visions come or were they devildreams false lures stussi the tanner had babbled of visions in a fever once then a long worm had slithered out of his nose and hed died thurs vision throbbed with a pulse of danger maddeningly vague melting away the moment his emptiness was clouded with the very question what his hands clenched on the stone a flicker in the corner of his eyelamp going out or farel returning he sprang away from the rock flushing but there was no tramp of boots and the lamp burned no more badly than usual there a shadow in the wavering shadowsthat funnyshaped rock moved thur stood still barely breathing the rock stood up it was a gnarled brown mannikin some two feet tall with what seemed to be a leather apron like a miners about its loins it giggled and jumped to one side its black eyes glinted in the lamp glow like polished stones it skipped over to thurs basket and made to put in a lump of ore thur made no sudden moves in all his time in the mines hed never seen a gnome so close and clear only movements in the corners of his eyes that seemed to vanish into the walk when he made to approach them the mannikin giggled again and tilted its narrow chin aside in an attitude of comical inquiry good morrow little man thur whispered fascinated hoping his voice would not startle it away again good morrow metalmaster the kobold returned in a tinny voice it hopped into the basket peered over the top at thur and hopped out again in quick jerky motions its arms and legs were thin its toes and fingers long and splayed with joints like the knobs of roots im no master thur smiled he hunkered down so as to loom less threateningly and fumbled at his belt for the leather flask his mother had filled with goats milk before dawn carefully he reached for the ateau the wide wooden dish used for carrying out the best ore tapped it upside down to knock out the dirt and poured some milk into it he shoved it invitingly toward the little creature you can drink if you wish it giggled again and hopped to the rim it did not lift the vessel but put its head down and lapped like a cat pointed tongue flicking rapidly in and out its bright eyes never wavered from thur as it drank the milk vanished quickly the kobold sat up emitted a tiny but quite distinct belch and wiped its lips with the back of one twiggy wrist good my mother fixes it in case i thirst before dinner thur responded automatically then felt a little idiotic surely he should be trying to catch the creature not conversing with it squeeze it to get it to tell him where gold or silver lay or something yet its wrinkled countenance like a dried apple made it seem venerable not evil or menacing it sidled toward thur he tensed slowly one cool knobby finger reached out and touched thurs wrist i should seize it now but he couldnt didnt want to move the kobold jittered across the stones and rubbed up against the discolored vein in the rock it oozed seeming to meltits getting away master kobold thur croaked desperately tell me where shall i find my treasure the kobold paused its halflidded eyes stared directly at thur its answer was a creaky chant like the overstrained wood of a windlass lifting a heavy load air and fire metalmaster air and fire you are earth and water go to the fire ice water will put you out cold earth will stop your mouth cold earth is good for kobolds not for metalmasters grave digger grave digger go to the fire and live it melted into the vein leaving only a fading giggle behind riddles ask a blasted gnome a straight and simple question and get riddles he should have known the cadence of its speech had infused its words with doubled meaning grave digger the solemn miner or the man who chipped out his own tomb meaning himself thur the sweat drying on his body had chilled him to the bone he sank shivering to his knees his heart was laboring and there was a roaring in his ears like master kunzs furnace when the bellows played his eyes were darkening o it was the lamp flame dwindling low and weak ut there was plenty of oil farels voice rang painfully in his ears by our lady the air stinks in this pocket and then hey boy hey a strong hand closed around thurs arm and hauled him roughly to his feet thur swayed dizzily farel swore and pulled thurs arm across his own neck and began to guide him up the tunnel bad air said farel the ventilation bellows are pumping all right now there must be a blockage somewhere in the pipe damn maybe the kobolds did it i saw a kobold said thur his heart was still pounding but his vision was beginning to clear in so far as anyone had vision in these staring shadows in the heart of the mountain i hope you shied a rock at it said farel i fed it some milk it seemed to like it idiot boy for gods sake were trying to get rid of the vermin not attract morel feed it and itll be back with all its brethren no wonder were infested it was the first time i ever saw one it seemed nice agh farel shook his head bad air all right and bad dreams from it they reached the fork of the tunnel the air was fresh enough here farel sat thur down beside the hollow wooden tube that piped the forced air into the lower reaches of the mine stay there while i get master entlebuch are you going to be all right thur nodded farel hurried away thur could hear him shouting up the lift shaft over the creaks and groans of the wooden machinery thur was still chilled and he wrapped his arms around his torso and drew up his long legs farel had taken the lamp the blackness closed in in time farel returned with master entlebuch who held his lamp up to thurs face and stared at him in worry he questioned thur about his symptoms and went back down the runnel with farel tapping the wooden air pipe with a stick as he went at length farel came back carrying thurs abandoned lamp and tools a piece of pipe was crushed in a rockfall master entlebuch says forget the upper tunnel today as soon as you feel able go join the crew on the lower face and haul baskets for a while thur nodded and rose farel shared flame from his lamp to rekindle thurs air and fire thought thur life he did not feel so shaky now and he started down the lower tunnel in search of the other work crew he was careful on the steep descending track so as not to spill or splash his oil and even more careful on the ladder in the vertical shaft that drove downward another thirty feet this bottom tunnel had followed a corkscrewtwisting vein going down then up again at the end he found four men taking turns in pairs chopping at the hard rock face or sorting over the chips while catching their wind they greeted him in tones ranging from niklauss habitual good cheer to birss melancholy grunt thur loaded a basket with good chips heaved it to his shoulder and carried it down and up the lower tunnel to the shaft he emptied it into a leather bucket climbed the ladder with the basket slung over his arm turned the windlass and raised the bucket on its rope refilled the basket carted it to the upper lift shaft dumped it in the big wooden bucket and shouted for henzi who raised the load out of sight then thur went back for the next load and the next and the next until he lost count he was weary with work and hunger when henzi at last lowered a bucket packed with bread cheese ale and barley water which the men at the lower face greeted with much more animation than theyd greeted thur after dinnerbreak farel joined them master entlebuch and i sawed out the broken pipe and hes gone to get another length made to fit farel was taken into the work gang with the usual acknowledging grunts thur did a stint with hammer and pick on the hardest part of the tunnel face making the rock ring and the chips fly till his arms and back and neck ached the smell of the mine seemed to fill his head cold dry dust scraped metal hot oil the smokestink of burning fat for it was not the best oil sweat in wool the cheeseandonion breath of the men when they finally got enough good ore to make up a heavy basket thur and farel took it together they were halfway to the ladder when the orange oil light glinted off a small gnarled shape moving by the side of the tunnel pesky little demon farel shouted begone he dropped his half of the basket snatched up his pick and flung it forcefully at the kobold the shape melted into the rock with a tiny cry ha i think i winged it said farel going retrieve his pick which had stuck in the stone i wish you hadnt done that said thur perforce letting his side of the basket down also he balanced their lamp atop it theyre gentle creatures they dont do any harm that i can see they just get blamed if anything goes wrong no harm my eye growled farel he tugged at his pick which had stuck fast he yanked then put his foot to the wall and heaved the pick jerked free taking a big chunk of the wall with it and farel fell over backwards cracking his head on a bracing timber no harm he yelped rubbing his scalp you call this no harm he scrambled back to his feet a crack was propagating from the new hole in the side of the tunnel darkening strangely even as thur stared water began to seep from the crack uh oh said farel in a choked voice peering around thurs shoulder the mountain groaned a deep vibration that thur heard somehow not with his ears but with his belly the trickle became a spurt then a spew then a hard stream that shot straight out to splash and splatter against the far wall from down the tunnel came a crash yells and an agonized scream the roofs coming down farel cried his voice stretched high with terror run for it he flung his pick aside and galloped up the tunnel thur horrified ran hard on his heels his hands held up to keep from clobbering his head on a timber in the dark at the foot of the ladder fumbled for in blackness they paused nothing else has fallen thur spoke into farels hesitation yet said farel his hand came out of nowhere feeling for thur thur grasped it it was cold with sweat it sounded like someone was hurt back there said thur he could hear farel swallow ill run for master entlebuch and get help farel said after a moment you go back and see what happened all right thur turned and felt his way back down the tunnel he could sense the whole weight of the mountain pressing overhead the great support timbers could splinter like kindling if the mountain shifted further cold earth will stop your mouth grave digger he could not hear shouts or cries up ahead any more only the snaky hiss of the water the tilted basket of ore the lamp still burning atop it came in sight the water gushing from the wall flowed away down the tunnel thur took up the lamp and slipped and slid down the nowmuddy tunnel floor near the bottom of the dugout veins curve a sheet of water roiled it stretched from thurs feet across to where the roof of the tunnel clipped to meet it no wonder hed heard nothing the men at the work face were cut off in an air pocket the water seal blanketing their cries until the cunning water pushing up through whatever fissures it could find squeezed the pocket smaller and smaller a wet head broke the opaque shimmering surface spat and gulped air in a huge hooting gasp a second head came up beside him anxiously thur reached out and helped the figures heave out of the water the second clinging to the first the second man had a dazed look and a cut across his forehead that mixing with the streaming water seemed to be bleeding buckets the first mans eyes were rolling white with fear are the others coming behind you thur asked i dont know matt the first man panted i think nildaus was pinned in the rockfall and birs stayed with him brave birs braver than thur that was certain if thurs father had had such a brave workmate six years ago he might be alive today matt shook his head i thought he was coming with us but he has the horrors about water a hedgewitch once prophesied he was safe from all deaths but drowning he wont even drink water just ale the rising flood lapped at thurs toes and he stepped back they all watched avidly but no more heads popped up the bleeding man swayed woozily best you walk him out before we have to carry him thur observed help should be coming ill stand watch here tell them up above to keep the ventilation bellows pumping maybe it will help hold the water back in there or something matt nodded and supporting the injured man staggered up the tunnel thur stood and watched the dark water rising the longer they waited the worse it would get deeper and more difficult ice water will put you out no other heads appeared the water licked thurs toes again and again he stepped back he muffled a tiny wail of dismay in the back of his throat a squeak like the injured kobolds he set the lamp down on the floor several feet back up the tunnel turned and waded into the water the icy shock when it came up over his boots and hit his crotch took his breath away but he pushed on till his feet left the floor he breathed deeply held it turned and began to shove himself along the inundated tunnel roof down down he could feel the pressure growing in his ears even as they began to numb then up thank god it was all uphill from here he pulled himself along faster unless there was no air pocket on the other side in which case he his hand splashed through to unresisting air then his head he gasped as wildly as matt had done there was a little light someones oil lamp had stayed upright his feet found solid ground and he sloshed up onto dry stone his eyes were cold his scalp tingled and his fingers were crooked numb claws the orangetinged air chill as it was seemed like a steamhouse in contrast birs was standing by the waters edge sobbing a struggling shape in the shadows on the floor near the rockface was niklaus swearing at him the swearing paused thur is that you thur knelt in the dimness beside niklaus and felt for damages the edge of a tilted slab pinned niklauss leg to the floor the bone was shattered the flesh pulpy and swelling beneath thurs fingers the slab was so damned big thur grabbed for a pick scrabbled its point under the slab and heaved the rock barely shifted birs help me thur demanded but birs wept on as though he neither saw nor heard so lost in his own imagined damnation he was missing the real one going on behind his back thur went round and shook him by the shoulders at first gently then hard witless wake up he shouted into birss face birs didnt stop crying but he did start moving with pick shovel a bar and stones shoved in to hold each heaves grunting progress they raised the slab niklaus screamed as the blood rushed back into his leg but still managed to jerk free and roll away the waters still rising said thur it was foretold wailed birs thurs hands clenched and he loomed over the man the hedgewitch told truth your fate is drowning ill hold your head under myself if you dont help me you tell him thur gasped niklaus from the boor birs cringed away his terror dwindling to a suppressed whine take niklauss other arm theres naught to do but hold your breath and push yourself along the other two both made it they dragged nicklaus into the water and waded out lour pushed off with his feet and started under flailing with a panicked cry birs retreated no help for it tugging niklaus who at least had sense to claw the wall with his free arm and help push thur kept going the heat sucked faster this time from his aching flesh and bones when they broke the surface again niklauss eyes had rolled back in shock but master entlebuch and farel were waiting with two other men the team of three quickly laid niklaus on a blanket and started away with him anyone left master entlebuch asked birs thur wheezed his body racked with shudders is he hurt no but hes all in a twist through terror of the water because of some fool fortunetelling can you swim back and get him out he could get himself out if he would thurs woolen hood tunic and leggings were saturated sagging and leaden with their burden of water a dead weight on his body irked to distraction by it he pulled the dripping hood off over his head like a horse collar and let it rail with a sodden splat the mountain groaned again the thick support timbers skirled like bagpipes followed by a hail of tiny popping noises from within the wood its going to go master entlebuchs voice rose taut weve got to clear this tunnel now muting his own inner wail thur turned and waded in for the third time his growing numbness almost mitigated the cold his head was pounding and strange red lace swirled before his tightshut eyes before he felt his way to air again when he fought up out of the water this time the stony beach in the air pocket had shrunk to a mere yard birs was crouched there praying or at any rate crying god god god god he reminded thur of a sheep bleating come on yelled thur well be buried here ill drown shrieked birs not today you wont snarled thur and clipped him hard across the jaw with his bunched fist rather to thurs surprise birs bounced off the wall and fell dazed at the single blow it was the first time thur had hit anyone with his new mans strength not in a boys scrambling puppyfight birss jaw looked strangely offcentered no help for it now thur clamped birss head under his arm and dragged him into the freezing water even dazed birs struggled against thurs grip as their heads went under thur clamped it tighter heaved and pushed his lungs labored and pulsed against the seal of his mouth he let a little air out he couldnt help it ice water will put you out ut not today not today not today god save me for hanging he surfaced to air and confusion the black was pitchabsolute master entlebuch was gone and hed taken the lamp with him thurs free arm waved disoriented seeking wall or floor or roof or any guide he thumped at last into the wall stone on his reaching fingers his feet found the sloping floor he was cramped bent like a bow from the cold and with knots in his legs and arms that felt like walnuts out of the water with his burden birs was choking and sputtering therefore alive and undrowned thur was afraid to let go of him in the dark even when birs rolled over and vomited about a quart of swallowed water into thurs lap thur struggled to his feet and began marchdragging birs up the tunnel the ladder at the lower shaft proved a nightmarish barrier as thur tried to shove his dizzied workmate up it he shouted threats and encouragement up at birs move move move your hands move your feet his own fingers were numb to the point of paralysis crippled claws then from the tunnel below them came an almost rhythmic series of splintering cracks and a thunderous rending crash birss boots vanished from before thurs nosehes fallen was thurs first panicked thought then pebbles pattered down on his head from birss mad scramble out the top of the shaft no hes recovered thur scrambled too and ran like a crouching rabbit after he heaved himself into the upper tunnel he added his hollering to birss muffled screams when they reached the lift shaft it seemed to take forever before the ore bucket descended thur stuffed birs into it and took to the ladder he almost blacked out halfway up but the gray light overhead drew him up hire the silver promise of heaven henzi was unloading birs when thur arrived thur stood in the lift shed his hands braced on his knees lungs pumping like bellows didnt you bring out any of the tools master entlebuch asked him anxiously thur stared at him like a dumb ox stupefied birs once on his feet mumbled something unintelligible but distinctly hostile in tone swung a punch at thur missed and fell over outside the lift shed door spring sleet was hissing slantwise down the wind i want to go home thur said incoherent from the cold he reached his cottage at last his mother took one horrified look stripped him of his freezing garments stuffed him into her own bed between two feather mattresses with hot stones plied him with steaming barley water sweetened with honey and never asked after tools or even his missing hood even so it took him two full hours to stop shivering racking shudders like an ague he gave her a jerky and truncated account of his day that nevertheless left her face drawn and lips compressed she never left him till his teeth stopped chattering when his steadying voice at last reassured her of his probable survival she went across the room to the mantle over the fireplace and came back with a piece of paper that crackled as she unfolded it here thur this came this morning from your brother uri he has found you a fine opportunity uri still after him to take up the mercenarys pike the letters red wax seal was already broken by their apprehensive mother who greeted every rare communication with suppressed terror of news of disease inflamed wounds amputation loss of money at play or disastrous betrothal to some whorish camp follower all the hazards of a soldiers life it wasnt exactly the risks of a soldiers trade that repelled thur all life was a hazard and hed be willing enough to make swords hed seen milanese armorers work that had taken his breath away but to then take that work of art and stick it into a live man no he vented a longsuffering sigh and took the paper a curious shock ran up his arm his fingers warmed as he read his weariness dropped away and he sat up not soldiering after all his eyes raced faster over the phrases apprentice to the dukes goldsmith and master mage marvellous bronze underway for my lord duke needs a strong smart lad opportunity thur stroked the paper the sun would be warm now on the southern slopes of the pass into montefoglia in the summer the sun would blaze like a furnace mouth he licked his lips what do you think he asked his mother she took a brave breath i think you should go before that devilish mountain eats you as it ate your father youd be alone your uncle will look after me id rather have you safe in montefoglia than up in that vile mine every day if uri wanted you for a soldier it would be different you know how i hated it when he went for a mercenary so often the boys come back if they come back at all either broken and sick or turned strange and hard and cruel but this now thur turned the letter over does the master mage realize i have no turn for sorcery his mother pursed her lips i confess thats a part i do not like this master beneforte is a florentine he may be a dabbler in the black arts or worse perversions as dangerous to boys as to maidens still he works for the duke of montefoglia who by uris account is honorable for a nobleman montefoglia he had never noticed before how the very name sounded warm you can read and write in two tongues and have a little latin too when brother glarus was teaching you he once told me you might go to padua and study to be a doctor i often dreamed of it but then your father was killed and things got harder i did not love latin thur confessed warily suddenly realizing there could be worse fates than soldiering but his mother did not pursue that subject she rose to tend to the pease porridge bubbling over the fire made with extra ham in honor of thurs narrow escape from the mine he burrowed back into the feather mattress and clutched the letter to his chest his flesh was still cold as lard but the paper seemed to radiate warmth grave digger grave digger go to the fire he laughed and muffled the laugh as his mother glanced over and smiled though not knowing the joke montefoglia by god and the kobold i think ill do it he lay back and watched the firelight flicker like reflections off water on the whitewash between the dark roof beams and dreamed of incandescent summer chapter three ruberta the housekeeper helped fiametta lift and slide the heavy red velvet gown over her head and smooth it down over her fine linen underdress fiametta brushed at the folds of its widecut skirt so profligate of cloth and sighed pure satisfaction hie dress was far finer than anything shed dared hope for master benefbrte had produced it quite unexpectedly from an old chest when fiametta had complained of the sad figure she would cut at the dukes banquet in plain gray wool the dress had once belonged to fiametta s mother fiametta and ruberta had spent a week cutting it down and resewing it judging from the measurements fiametta was now nearly as tall as her mother had been though more slender strange she remembered her mother as tall not short tall and dark and warm fiametta held out her arms and ruberta pulled on the sleeves and tied them to the dress at the shoulders and fluffed out puffs of the underdress for contrast at the elbows the red velvet sleeves were embroidered with silver thread echoed by a silver band running all around that wonderful hem dont bounce so girl ruberta complained mildly and pinched her lower lip with her teeth in concentration as she knotted the bows just so she stepped back and regarded fiametta with judicious pride now for your hair oh yes please fiametta plunked down obediently on the stool no little gins cap today nor hair in a mere simple braid down her back the dress had come with a matching hair net of silver thread and pearls magically untarnished with age ruberta parted fiamettas hair in neat if wavy wings wound it up on the back of her head and fastened the net over the mass of it except for two dark ringlets she made to bounce artfully in front of fiamettas ears fiametta stared greedily into her little mirror delighted turning her head back and forth to make the ringlets jump thank you ruberta she flung her arms around the housekeepers aproned waist and hugged her youre so clever oh your slipperstheyre still in the kitchen ill go get them ruberta hurried out fiametta tried the mirror at various angles and ran her hands again over the soft sumptuous cloth she sucked on her lower lip and on impulse rose and went to the chest at the end of her bed she pushed aside linens and found a flat oaken casket she opened it to reveal her mothers death mask many people kept death masks of wax prospero beneforte had recast fiamettas mothers in bronze darkened by his art to a rich brown close to her original skin tones the alert dark eyes were closed now like sleep but a strangely sad sleep above the soft curves of her nose and wide mouth fiametta held the mask up to her dress and peeked over it into her mirror held out at arms length she squinted in an effort to weld face and dress in the blur then she lowered the mask to her chin and compared the two faces how much of the paler one was prospero beneforte how much this lost woman fiamettas nose had a definite bridge and her jaw was more sharp cut than this dark visage but otherwise who am i and whose am i where do i belong mother rubertas step sounded on the gallery and fiametta hastily replaced the mask in its casket and locked it away again ruberta handed the polished shoes in through the door hurry now your papas waiting downstairs fiametta jammed her feet into the shoes and skipped out of her bedroom and around the upper gallery overlooking the courtyard she took up her skirts to descend the stairs then shook them out and walked more sedately as befit her ladys hairstyle no slaves gown this nor mere servants but obvious proof that her mother had been the true christian wife of a great artisan fiametta held her chin up firmly master beneforte was standing in the stonepaved hallway he looked splendid too fiametta decided he wore a cloak of black velvet that swung to his knees and a big hat of the same fabric wound round like a turban with a jaunty fall of cloth to the side his tunic was of honeybrown cut velvet high to his neck where a bright white line of linen showed with a pleated skirt to his knees and black hose despite his graying hairs master beneforte still resisted the long gowns of the aged though the sober colors hed chosen suggested a suitably powerful maturity hed set off the tunic with a gold chain of his own workmanship displaying his art he turned at fiamettas step ah there you are he looked her up and down eyes going strangely distant muttered huh and shook his head as if to clear his vision do i look well papa asked fiametta alarmed you look well here he thrust out his hand to her draped over his palm was a silver belt of cunning workmanship fiametta took it up surprised it was in the form of a silver snake round and flexible as a rope the gleaming scales were as fine as a real snakes their overlapping plates concealing whatever linked its skeleton its head was solid silver modeled as in life with green chipsemerald glassglittering for eyes put it on said master beneforte how i see no clasp just loop it it will stay its enchanted isnt it just a little spell for your protection thank you papa she fitted it around her waist curling the tail around behind the head and indeed it held last only then did she think to ask does it come off whenever you wish she tried it and looped it back on did you just make this she thought hed been working night and day to finish the saltcellar no ive had it for some time i just cleaned it and renewed the spell was it mamas yes fiametta stroked it her fingers sliding over the scales they emitted a faint musical vibration almost too thin to hear the dukes saltcellar sat waiting on a bench against the wall its new box was satinlined ebony to match the base with gold clasps and gold handles on the ends fiametta had helped assemble and polish it she would not have guessed her father to be nervous but he opened the box and checked its contents one last time and rechecked the seating and security of the clasps then wandered into the workroom and peered out the window ah at last his voice drifted back to her and he returned to the hall to unbar the door for the swiss captain and two guards the guards breastplates gleamed like mirrors and captain ochs was dressed in his best and cleanest livery with a new doublet with gold buttons issued in honor of the betrothal all ready master prospero the captain smiled he nodded to the ebony casket shall i have my men carry it ill carry it myself i think said master beneforte lifting the box have them walk one ahead and one behind very well and they started off so ordered the captain and fiametta flanking the goldsmith keep the door barred till my return teseo master beneforte called back and the apprentice bowed awkwardly and closed it behind them master beneforte paused till he heard the bar slide into place nodded and marched down the cobbled street it was a bright day two weeks after the holy feast of easter just barely cool enough for velvets to be comfortable trees had budded into new leaf in the weeks since fiametta had cast her ring she clutched the lion mask on her left thumb and let thesighgarnet catch and wink back the midday sun that light glowed too off the yellow brick and stones and red tile roofs sad dun in winter montefoglia almost looked like a city of gold on long summer afternoons they passed from the street of big houses flanking her fathers home and workshop down into older more crowded construction crossing a side alley leading down to the water fiametta glimpsed boats and the docks a few lazy lake gulls swooped and squawked perhaps when papa took her fishing again this summer hed finally teach her the secret spell he used for baiting his hook the narrow lake extended eleven miles north from montefoglia toward the foothills of the alps beyond which lay captain ochss home the first pack train of the season had come down over montefoglia pass a week ago fiametta had heard higher and more difficult than the great brenner to the east the route yet served the needs of the little duchy montefoglia was hard hill country and would have been poor indeed without the trickle of trade and the fishing of the lake on the east shore north of town the monastery of st jerome kept grape vines spring wheat in terraces orchards and sheep the main road ran up the east side of the lake past its stone walls the west side being too sheer rocky and wild for any but goat paths fiametta could see a few figures on horses and a slow ox cart moving on the dusty white ribbon st jeromes scriptorium also supplied illuminated books for the dukes library pride of the castle that dominated the bluff at far end of town it was the dukes boast that his library held none of that cheap modern printed matter but only proper calligraphed manuscripts bound in rich decorated leatherover a hundred volumes it seemed a constrictive stipulation to fiamettas mind but perhaps it was because duke sandrino could read but not write himself that calligraphy seemed so significant to him old people were ridiculously conservative about the oddest things and how go the betrothal celebrations master beneforte inquired of the captain fiametta lagging quickened her step and closed the gap to listen well the duchess had an illumination in the garden last night with a tableau and madrigals the singers sounded very pretty id have been doing the costuming for that set piece but for the dukes insistence upon this master beneforte lifted the ebony box im surprised that dolt di rimini didnt botch the effects the man couldnt design a doorknob the captain smiled dryly at this aspersion upon master benefortes most notable local rival in the decorative arts he did all right for your consolation there was a bad moment when the candles set fire to a headdress but we doused the lady and got it out with no injury but to her feathers i knew i was right to insist on having those buckets ready backstage ha i understand the future bridegroom rode in on time this morning at least yes the captain frowned i must say i dont like the retinue he rode in with a hardbitten bunch and fifty menatarms seems excessive for the occasion i dont know what duke sandrino was thinking of to allow my lord of losimo to bring so many the honor due his future soninlaw he says well uberto ferrante was a condottiere before he fell heir to losimo two years ago said master beneforte judiciously he hasnt really been there long enough to establish local loyalty presumably these are men he trusts fell heir my eye he bribed the papal curia to overturn the other cousins claim and again for dispensation to marry the heiress i suppose cardinal borgia wanted to be sure of a guelf in losimo to oppose the ambitions of venice and the ghibbellines from my experience of the curia id say you guess exactly right master beneforte smiled sourly i do wonder where ferrante got the money though the ambitions of milan seem a nearer threat to me poor montefoglia sitting like an almond between two such pincers now milans an example of how a soldier may rise i trust lord ferrante has not been studying the life of the late francesco sforza too closely marry the daughter then make yourself master of the state take note uri the captain sighed i dont know any heiresses alas he paused thoughtfully actually thats exactly what ferrante did in losimo i trust he does not seek to duplicate the ploy in montefoglia our duke and his son are both healthy enough to prevent that i think said master beneforte he patted the ebony box and perhaps i can do my little part to help keep them so hie captain stared down at his boots pacing over the stones i dont know i do know duke sandrino is not altogether happy with this betrothal and duchess letitia even less so i cannot see what pressure ferrante can be putting yet i sense there was hard bargaining for the dowry too bad lord ferrante is not a younger man or lady julia older or both i know the duchess insisted it be put in the contract that the wedding not take place for at least another year perhaps lord ferrantes horse will dump him on his head and break his neck betimes i will add that to my prayers smiled the captain it almost wasnt a joke the conversation lagged as they reserved breath for the final climb to the castle they passed through a gate flanked by two sturdy square towers of cut stone topped by the same yellow brick common in most of montefoglias newer construction the soldiers escorted them across a stonepaved courtyard and up the new grand staircase the present duke had installed in hopes of softening the austere and awkward architecture of his ancestors master beneforte sniffed at the stonework in passing and muttered his habitual judgment should have hired a real sculptor not a country stonecutter they passed through two dark halls and out another door to the walled garden here among the flowers and fruit trees the tables were set for the betrothal banquet the throng was being seated just the timing master beneforte had hoped for his grand presentation the ducal family together with lord ferrante and the abbot of saint jerome and bishop of montefoglia two offices one man occupied a long table raised on a platform they were shaded by awnings made of tapestries four other tables were arranged at right angles below and beyond for the lesser guests duke sandrino a pleasantry bulky man of fifty with nose and ears of noble proportions was washing his hands in a silver basin with rose petals floating in the steaming water held by his steward messer quistelli his son and heir the tenyearold lord ascanio sat on his right one of lord ferrantes liveried retainers was adjusting a footstool with a padded leather top beneath his masters boots in the shape of a chest carved with losimos arms the portable furniture was evidently for some idiosyncratic comfort for lord ferrantes legs were of normal shape and length maybe his silk hose concealed an old war wound that still pained him fiametta schooled herself not to gawk while trying to memorize as many details as possible of the overwhelming display of velvets silks hats badges arms jewels and hairstyles before her the lady julia seated between her mother and her bridegroomtobe wore springgreen velvet with gold embroidery andhaa girls cap though indeed the green cap was embroidered with more gold thread and studded with tiny pearls her hair was braided with green ribbons in a blonde rope down her back did duchess letitia deliberately seek to emphasize her daughters youth julias slight flusterment made a vivid contrast with the lord of losimo on her other hand dark mature powerful clearly a disciple of mars lord ferrantes lips smiled without showing his teeth perhaps his teeth were bad the abbotandbishop was seated to lord ferrantes left no doubt both for the honor and to give ferrante an equal to talk to if julias girl chatter or bashful silence grew thin abbot monreale had been a flamboyant knight in his youth when hed been severely wounded and made a deathbed promise to dedicate his life to the church if god would spare him hed kept his promise with flair grayhaired now he had a reputation as a scholar and a bit of a mystic he was dressed today as bishop not abbot in the splendid flowing white gown and goldedged red robe of his office with a white silk brocade cap over his tonsure monreale was also the man who yearly inspected both the workshop and the soul of prospero beneforte and renewed his ecclesiastical license to practice white magic master beneforte after making his leg to the duke his family and lord ferrante bowed to the abbot with immense and unfeigned deference as theyd practiced master beneforte knelt and opened the ebony box and had fiametta present the saltcellar to the duke with a pretty curtsey the snowy linen of the table set the gleaming gold and brilliant colored enamels off to perfection master beneforte beamed when the occupants of the table broke into spontaneous applause duke sandrino smiled in obvious satisfaction and asked the abbot himself to bless the first salt which the steward hurried to pour into the glowing boatbowl master beneforte watched in breathless suspense now was the time hed confided to fiametta in their private rehearsal when hed hoped the duke would fill his hands with ducats in a magnificent gesture of generosity before the assembled guests hed hung a large purse empty beneath his cloak in anticipation of the golden moment but the duke merely if kindly waved them to places prepared for them at a lower table well he has a lot on his mind later master beneforte muttered in his beard concealing his chagrin as they settled themselves a servant brought them the silver basin to wash their handsone of master benefortes own pieces fiametta noticedand the banquet commenced with wine and dishes of fried ravioli stuffed with chopped pork herbs and cream cheese rolled in powdered sugar baskets of bread made entirely from white flour appeared and platters of veal chicken ham sausages and beef and more wine master beneforte watched the upper table with sharp attention no blue flames flashed up from anyones plate though fiametta made polite conversation with the castellans wife a plump woman named lady pia on her other side when the castellans wife rose for a moment beckoned by her husband master beneforte leaned close to his daughter and lowered his voice fiametta braced herself for more grumbling about the dukes ducats but instead he said unexpectedly did you notice the little silver ring lord ferrante wore on his right hand child you stood closer to him than i fiametta blinked yes now that you mention it what did you think of it well she tried to call it up in her minds eye i thought it extremely ugly what form had it a mask an infant or puttis face i think not ugly exactly but i just didnt like it she laughed a little he should commission you papa to make him something prettier to her surprise he crossed himself in a tiny warding gesture say not so yet how dare he wear it openly in front of the abbot perchance it came to him secondhand and he doesnt know what it is or hes muted it somehow it was new work i thought said fiametta papa what bothers you he looked disturbed im almost certain its a spirit ring yet if its active where can he have put the he trailed off lips thinned staring covertly at the upper table black magic fiametta whispered shocked not not necessarily i once er saw such a thing that was no grave sin and ferrante is a lord such a man should be easy and conversant with forms of power not so appropriate in lesser men yet proper to a ruler like the great lord lorenzo in florence i thought all magic was either white or black when youve grown as old as i have child you will learn that nothing in this world is either all white or black would abbot monreale agree with that she asked suspiciously oh yes he sighed his brows rose in a sort of eyebrowshrug well lord ferrante has a year yet to reveal his character his fingers curled suppressing the topic as lady pia returned the meats what little was left of them were taken away by the servants and platters of dates figs early strawberries and pastry confections were set before the guests fiametta and lady pia collaborated on selections and did great damage to the dried cherry tarts musicians at the far end of the garden began to play above the chatter and clink of cutlery and plates the dukes butler and his assistants poured out sweet wines in anticipation of closing toasts messer quistelli hurried out of the castle and stepped under the tapestries shading the high table he bent his head to whisper in the dukes ear duke sandrino frowned and made some query messer quistelli shrugged the duke shook his head as if annoyed but leaned over spoke to the duchess and rose to follow his steward back inside the castellans wife entered into a negotiation across fiametta with master beneforte to mend a little silver ewer of hers that had a broken handle fiametta could see her father was not flattered to be bothered by such a domestic trifle apprentices work till his eye fell on her he smiled slightly fiametta will mend it it can be your first independent commission child oh can you do it lady pia looked at her both doubtful and impressed i suppose id better see it first fiametta said cautiously but inwardly delighted lady pia glanced at the high table they wont start the toasts till the duke returns what can be keeping him away so long come to my rooms fiametta and you can see it right now certainly lady pia as they rose messer quistelli returned to speak this time to lord ferrante ferrante grimaced puzzled irritation but evidently compelled by his hosts command got up to follow the steward with a jerk of his hand lord ferrante motioned two of his men to fall in behind him if shed seen them on the street fiametta would not have hesitated to dub them bravos the senior of them a toughlooking bearded fellow missing several front teeth had been presented as ferrantes principal lieutenant captain ochs leaning over to chat with some lady at one of the lower tables looked up frowned to himself and followed he had to lengthen his stride to catch up the two women waited for the men to clear the doorway then the castellans wife led fiametta within fiametta glanced aside curiously as they crossed the chamber through a door at the far end into a cabinet or study she could see the duke standing at his desk with two travelstained men one a gravefaced priest the other a choleric nobleman lord ferrante and the rest of the retinue then blocked her view and she followed lady pia the castellan had rooms in one of the square towers lady pia took the ewer from a shelf in her tiny thickwalled bedroom crowded with her bit of furniturea bed and chestsand waited anxiously while fiametta carried it to a window slit to look it over fiametta was secretly pleased to find it not a mere soldering job but one requiring more expertise the handle cast in the form of a sinuous mermaid was not only loose but cracked fiametta assured the castellans wife of a swift repair and they wrapped the piece in a bit of old linen and returned with it to the garden passing again through the large chamber fiametta was startled by duke sandrinos angry shouting coming from the cabinet he was leaning across his desk on his clenched hands lord ferrante stood facing him with his arms tightly folded his jaw set and features darkening to a burnt brick red his voice rumbled in reply in short jerky sentences pitched too low to be clear to fiamettas ear the two dusty strangers looked on the nobles face was lit with malicious glee the priests was white captain ochs leaned with his back to the doorframe apparently casual but with his hand resting on the hilt of his sword lady pias hand tightened on fiamettas shoulder in alarm duke sandrinos voice rose and fell lies and murder black necromancy sure proof no child of mine nsult to my house get you gone at once or prepare for a war to spin your vile head condottiere bastard spluttering with fury duke sandrino bit his thumb and shook it in lord ferrantes face i need no preparation lord ferrante raged back leaning toward him your war can begin right now as fiametta watched openmouthed lord ferrante snatched his dagger out lefthanded in the same continuing upward arc he slashed it across duke sandrinos throat so powerful a blow it halfsevered the neck and bounced off bone ferrante struck so hard he unbalanced himself and he and his victim fell into each other across the desk as if embracing smeared sudden scarlet with a shocked cry that was almost a wail captain ochs ripped his sword from its scabbard and started forward in the confined space of the cabinet a sword was little more effective than a dagger though and both bravos had their daggers out the gaptoothed lieutenant took the choleric nobleman through the heart with a blow almost as sudden and powerful as his masters first stroke had been aged messer quistelli unarmed ducked but not fast enough the second bravos knife blow knocked him to the floor uri lunging forward deflected a followup blow then found himself wrestling the man as the priest raised his hand lord ferrante gestured toward him with his bunched right fist the silver ring glared and the priest clutched his eyes and screamed lord ferrante stabbed him through his unguarded chest i must get my husband the castellans wife dropped her ewer picked up her skirts and ran for the garden the lieutenant looked up at the noise frowned and started toward fiametta his eyes were very cold dizzied with shock her heart hammering fiametta whirled and sprinted after lady pia she was almost blinded by the sunlight halfway across the garden the castellans wife was hanging on her husbands arm and screaming warnings he was shaking his head as if he found incoherent the cries that made perfect sense to fiametta she looked around frantically in the white afternoon for her fathers big black hat there nodding to some man the lieutenant turned his head in the doorway and plunged back inside fiametta flung herself onto master benefortes chest her fingers clutching his tunic papa she gasped out lord ferrante just murdered the duke uri ochs spun backwards through the door there was blood on his sword treachery he shouted blood sprayed from his mouth with the words murder and treachery montefoglia to arms ferrantes men as surprised as montefoglias began to gather together in knots ferrantes lieutenant pursuing captain ochs through the door cried his comrades to his aid the devil hissed master beneforte through his teeth there goes my commission his hand clamped on her arm and he wheeled around staring this garden is a death trap we have to get out of here now men were beginning to draw swords and daggers and the unarmed to snatch up table knives women were screaming master beneforte started not for the door but toward the high table captain ochs and ferrantes lieutenant were also heading that way at a pellmell run ferrantes lieutenant leaped and aimed a sword swing across the linen at little lord ascanio that would have taken off the boys head if captain ochs had not knocked the blade aside with his own abbot monreale started up and dumped the table over on the gaptoothed losimon as he stumbled and turned for another strike with a wild lunge master beneforte caught his saltcellar as it arced glittering through the air and bundled his cloak about it now fiametta for the door fiametta yanked convulsively at her skirt pinned under the edge of the heavy table papa help duchess letitia clutched her daughter and halfjumped halffell over the back of the platform into the tapestries uri leaping up grabbed ascanio and shoved him toward abbot monreale get the boy out he gasped the abbot swirled his red robe around the terrified child and parried a bravos sword thrust with his crozier followed up quite automatically with a powerful and wellaimed kick to the mans crotch saint jerome to me monreale bellowed his prior and brawny secretary sped to his aid another bravos descent on ascanio was met with an odd motion of the abbots staff the mans face grew abruptly blank and he wandered off over the side of the dais sword drooping he was struck down by one of montefoglias guards joining the fray master beneforte halfway to the door heard fiamettas cries and started back uri guarding the group now growing about the abbot and ascanio locked in murderous swordplay with ferrantes gaptoothed lieutenant uris breath bubbled strangely in a thrustandparry uri kicked aside lord ferrantes footstoolchest over the edge of the dais it bounced on its side and spilled open it was packed with rock salt which cascaded across fiamettas feet pickled in the salt curled the shrivelled corpse of a newborn infant fiametta screamed and ripped her caught skirt out from under the table in her recoil uri glanced aside his eyes widening ferrantes lieutenant lunged and thrust his sword through uris new doublet fiametta could see five inches of blade sliding out of the captains back the gaptoothed man turned the blade put his foot to uris torso and yanked it back out with a dreadful sucking sound blood gushed from both wounds front and back the captain fell fiametta wailed stooped and flung a heavy platter at the losimon lieutenant with all her strength master beneforte grabbed fiamettas arm and dragged her toward the exit the doorway was clotted with struggling men master beneforte fell back dismayed he shoved the bundled cloak containing the saltcellar into fiamettas shaking hands and snarled dont drop it and stay on my heels this time damn it he snatched up a bottle from one of the tables and drew his own showy dagger with its jewelled hilt the mirrorpolished blade never yet used flashed in the sun master beneforte tried again to force his way through the gardens only exit a knot of men exploded outward as more of montefoglias guards charged through master beneforte darted forward into the brief breach just inside one of ferrantes men cut at him yelling he parried and splashed the contents of the little jug into the mans face the losimon yowled and swiped at his eyes with his free hand master beneforte knocked his sword aside and they were through magic gulped fiametta vinegar snapped master beneforte there was another vicious struggle going on at the despised marble staircase master beneforte practically tossed fiametta over the balustrade and vaulted after her they pelted across the courtyard toward the towerflanked gate now being hotly contested by ferrantes men and montefoglias lord ferrante was there in person gesturing with a sword and shouting encouragement hold the gate and well have the rest at our will hold almost casually his sword licked out and tore open the throat of an attacking soldier in montefoglias livery the man had ribbons in ferrantes colors tied to the flowerandbee badge of his cap in honor of the days festivities and they bounced wildly as he fell christ jesus its going to be a massacre master beneforte groaned lord ferrante turned and saw master beneforte he stepped back a pace his eyes narrowing then raised his right fist with the silver ring faceout master beneforte growled stupid in his throat and raised his own hand in a peculiar rapid wave fingers moving very precisely fiamettas belly wrenched with the tilted gutfeel of clashing magics there was no subtlety in this the silver ring began to glow then suddenly emitted a brilliant flash and an earsplitting crack lord ferrante not master beneforte screamed dropped his sword and clutched his right hand with his left a distinct odor of burnt meat wafted beneath another sharp tang fiametta could not identify kill them lord ferrante roared stamping his boots in agony but the soldier facing master beneforte gave way in confused panic master beneforte skipped backward a few paces dagger brandished as fiametta picked up speed then they both ran from the castle gate as hard as they could at the bottom of the hill fiametta glanced back lord ferrante was pointing her way holding up a purse and yelling something a pair of bravos sped out the gate as the houses grew more crowded master beneforte darted between two shops and into an alley then dodged into another alley they fought through someones laundry hung out to dry and vaulted a sleeping dog fiametta was gasping for air it felt like someone had stuck a dagger into her side so sharp was the pain of her laboring lungs and banquetladen stomach stop fiametta they had come to the edge of the buildings by the shoreline of the lake master beneforte sagged against a wall of dun brick he too was gasping his head bent to one side his right hand kneaded his belly just below his chest as if to push back pain when he looked up his face was not flushed as fiamettas was but of a gray pallor sheened with sweat i should not have gorged so well he blurted even at the dukes expense and after another moment in a strange small voice i cant run any more his knees buckled chapter four papa she wouldnt dare let him fall she might not be able to get him up again she twisted up under his armpit and pulled his arm across her shoulders onehanded juggling the bundled cloak under her other elbow he was incredibly heavy draped over her we have to keep going we have to get back to the house her throat clotted in panic more frightened by the weird gray color of his face than by the bravos seeking them through the alleys like a pair of hunting dogs if ferrante takes the castle he will take the town and if he takes the town our old oak door wont stop his soldiers not if they think theres treasure inside and if he takes the town hell take the duchy no place to run with fifty men said fiametta fifty men and the moment he paused no hell take the town at most then hell wait for reinforcements then the rest his face was furrowed with pain he hugged his torso and stood bent over swaying you run fiamia god dont let them catch you the blood lust will make them crazy for days ive seen men get like that a stone quay served several wooden docks built out into the water a little fishing boat was just bumping up to the pilings its sole sunburned occupant tossed a rope around a post to secure his craft then turned back to his lateenrigged sail of coarse brown hemp which hed halflowered as hed coasted in he straightened its folds and lowered it fully he climbed out onto the dock and took up the rope to lead his boat around the end to its proper mooring on the lee side the boat breathed fiametta come on he squinted at it beard pointing maybe they stumbled forward master boatman fiametta called as they came near would you please hire us your boat she suddenly realized she was carrying no coins and neither was master beneforte eh the peasant stood and pushed back his straw hat and stared dully at them my father has taken ill as you see i wish to take him gently across to saint jeromes and see brother mario the healer she glanced back over her shoulder at once well i have to unload my fish madonna maybe then no at once at his offended frown she tore the silver net from her hair and held it out to him here there are as many pearls in my net as you have fish in yours ill trade you even but dont argue with me the astonished boatman took the hairnet well never before have i pulled pearls from lake montefoglia fiametta moaned in her throat and coaxed master beneforte to sit on the edge of the dock from there he dropped heavily into the open boat and motioned urgently to his bundled cloak she shoved it into his hands and he clutched it to his chest he looked worse his mouth open with pain and legs drawing up she jumped in alter him fighting her velvet skirts the boat rocked wildly bemusedly the boatman standing on the dock tossed in the bow rope and then after another glance at his handful of pearls his straw hat as well it spiraled down into the bottom of the boat fiametta squatted and grabbed an oar heavy in her hands and used it to shove them hard away from the dock a man in ferrantes livery emerged from the alleys spotted them and shouted over his shoulder he started for the dock he had a drawn sword in his hand fiametta pointed back toward the shore watch out boatman those two men who are coming will steal your pearls and beat out his life as well she feared in their frustration as casually brutal as wolves what the peasant wheeled and stared in panic at the two bravos who had nearly reached the dock his hand tightened on his new treasure she found the rope to raise the sail and hung on it handoverhand the warm afternoon breeze was faint but steady and more importantly from the south blowing them away from the shore even while she struggled with the sail and had no hand free for the steering oar they had drifted a good forty feet away from the dock by the time the two shouting bravos reached the end of it they shook their swords at fiametta and cried obscene and violent threats they were just turning back to wreak lethal vengeance on the poor man who had helped her when the peasant who had fallen back and picked up a long oar charged forward with it like a knight at joust it struck one swordwaving bravo square in his steel breastplate with a yell the man fell backwards into the water and sank swinging the oar around like a quarterstaff the peasant toot the second bravo in the chin with a crack that echoed across the lake he staggered back unbalanced and splashed after his comrade by the time the two men had saved themselves from drowning at the cost of abandoning their heavy metal weapons and armor to the lake bottom and splashed soddenly back onto the beach the boatman had thoroughly disappeared the light spring air filled the little boats brown sail the angry figures on the beach shaking their fists and impotently biting their thumbs seemed as tiny and feckless as gnomes master beneforte who had been watching over the side with great anxiety loosened his whiteknuckled grip on the gunwale and sighed sinking back into the bottom of the boat his face was still very pale though his breathing seemed a shade less labored he must be sick and in pain indeed not to be even offering criticism of her handling of the boat she almost wished for a scathing remark just for reassurance was it heartsickness or lord ferrantes evil magic that had laid him so low or some pernicious combination of both the pearls in that hairnet were worth more than this entire leaky boat he said after a moment but it sounded more of an observation than a complaint let alone the days catch the fish in question lay covered in water in a wooden tub in the bow the drying nets piled beside it not at that moment fiametta pointed out sturdily true he breathed very true wearily he leaned his head back adjusting his hat for a pillow fiametta sitting in the stern with the steering oar loosened the rope and let the boom swing out a little more squarely to the following breeze it seemed miraculously calm and peaceful with only the creak of the ropes the slap of little wavelets and the bubbling of the wake astern it was a day for a picnic not a ghastly massacre it wasnt a very big sail nor a fast boat nor a strong breeze a determined horseman or two paralleling them on the white road along the eastern shore could outpace them they had water in abundance and certainly needed no foodher stomach was still stretched and leaden with the betrothal banquetbut sooner or later they must come to shore where hardfaced men would be waiting the green shoreline blurred as tears filled her eyes and spilled down her cheeks wet annoying tracks she ducked her head and rubbed the tracks with her sleeve there were dots of darkening stain on the red velvet blood splashes captain ochss blood she couldnt help it she began to cry in earnest despite her weeping she kept the steering oar straight guiding them between the two shores unusually master beneforte did not demand she stop her blubbering or hed beat her but just lay and watched her till she gulped her way back to coherence what did you see happen in the castle fiametta he asked after a time still supine his voice was tired unhurried now despite the question the tone steadied her as best she could remember she stammered out an account of the men words and blows shed witnessed hm he pursed his lips in thought i first guessed it was some longlaid treachery lord ferrante assassinating his host take the daughter and the dukedom but stupid for he already had the daughter and could do murder in secret at his leisure if that was his mind but if as you guess those strangers brought some slander sufficient to break the betrothal then lord ferrante was hurried into his treachery and will prove his witor lack of itin the aftermath he must carry it all the way through now he sighed poor montefoglia fiametta wasnt sure if he meant the duke or the dukedom what do we do next papa how do we get home his face screwed up in distress compounded with disgust my work in progressthe jewels the moneyall forfeit my great perseus what a woeful day if in my foolish pride i had not insisted on presenting the saltcellar at that banquet we might have lain low let the affairs of princes blow by overhead plow under one duke raise another as fortune spins her deadly wheel maybe if ferrante had secured himself as tyrant of montefoglia he would have continued my commissions nownow he knows me i hurt him i fear that was a grave mistake maybe fiametta floated a cautious hope maybe lord ferrante will lose the fight he could be already slain mm or perhaps monreale really will get little lord ascanio out i would not underestimate monreale in that case its civil war though oh god save me from the affairs of princes yet only the patronage of princes can support great works my poor perseus my lifes crown what about ruberta and teseo they can run away my statue cannot he brooded perhapsif the soldiers come to our housethey wont notice the perseus fiametta offered frightened by this agitation worsening his obvious illness hes seven feet tall fiametta hes a little hard to miss not so hes all clothed in his clay now and he just looks like a big lump in the courtyard and hes much too big to carry away surely the soldiers will look for gold and jewels that they can hide in their clothes but would they takesaya bronze death mask that was certainly small and portable and then look for wine groaned master beneforte and then get drunk and then start smashing things clay and my genius so fragile he looked like he was about to cry himself you saved the saltcellar accursed thing ive half a mind to pitch it in the lake let it bring bad luck to the fish he didnt move to do so though but hugged the bundled cloth tighter to himself fiametta drew up some cold lake water for them both in the fishermans tin cup she found under the rear seat master beneforte drank and squinted in the afternoon glare and scrubbed his wrinkled brow with hooked fingers the sun is troubling you papa why dont you put on that straw hat and keep it from your eyes he plucked it up turned it over and snorted stinks but he put it on it did shade his jutting nose he rubbed his chest there was still pain there a deep ache fiametta judged by his awkward movements as he turned on his side then back again in a futile quest for ease why didnt you use magic to escape the castle papa she remembered lord ferrante raising his fist and the glaring putti ring or or did you if i had been a trained mage i would have done something to save the brave captain would she have the confusion and terror of that moment had overwhelmed her shed barely been able to save herself from her own skirts magic in the service of violence is a very perilous thing master beneforte sighed i have done magic and god save me i have done violence even to murderive told you of the time i took vengeance upon a corporal of the bargello for the death of my poor brother i was twenty and hot and stupid then it was a great sin though the pope gave me a pardon for it but i have never done violence with magic even at twenty i wasnt that stupid i used a poniard but lord ferrantes spirit ringtwice i saw him use it to do violence once it bit him for his pains master beneforte smiled in his beard but his smile fell away that ring was more evil than id feared what is a spirit ring papa you said youd seen one before in possession of the lord of florence and it wasnt a sin i made the spirit ring now on the hand of lorenzo dmedici child master beneforte confessed with a low sigh he glanced uneasily at her from the shadow of the straw brim the church forbids them and with reason but i thought the way we had this one set up i might cast such a powerful work and yet not be tainted i dont know you see if a corpse is preserved unshriven and unburied which is against any law the newriven spirit tends to linger by the body and with proper preparations that ghost can be harnessed to the will of a master enslaved fiametta frowned the word had the distaste of iron on her tongue yes or or bonded how it came about in florence was lord lorenzo had a friend who was dying in great debt he struck a pact with the man in exchange for his souls service to the ring upon his natural death lorenzo would care for and look after this mans family which oath lord lorenzo has kept to this day as far as i know lorenzo also swore to release the spirit if he feels his own death approaching ghost magic is immensely powerful i feel there was no sin in what we did but if some more narrowminded inquisitor ruled otherwise lorenzo and i could burn at the stake backtoback so keep this story to yourself child master beneforte added reflectively we hid the body in an old dry well beneath some new construction of the dmedici in the heart of florence the rings power diminishes when it is taken too great a distance from its old bodily home fiametta shivered did you see the dead baby when the casket of salt burst open master beneforte blew out his breath yes i saw it that cannot have been some little sin no master benefortes lips compressed you saw it closerwas it a girlchild yes i greatly fear that may have been lord ferrantes own stillborn daughter unnatural stillborn or murdered surely it was only the poor who secretly strangled unwanted daughters master beneforte bowed his head thats the trick of it you see a murdered spirit has special powers special rage a murdered unbaptized unburied infant he shuddered despite the heat do you still think nothing in the world could be all black mm he huddled down in the boat i confess he whispered i begin to have grave doubts of the hue of uberto ferrantes heart an infant could not have chosen to bond its spirit she must be enslaved said fiametta frowning deeply compelled without knowing why one corner of master benefortes mouth curved up not any more i released it from the ring it sprang away in that great flash you saw fiametta sat up oh good papa oh thank you he raised his brows bemused by her eager approval wanned in spite of himself well im not so sure how good it will prove lord ferrante must have gone to great lengths to bind those powers to his will his rage will be unbounded to so lose all his trouble in an instant the burn on his hand will be as nothing compared to the loss of such a potency but the burn will remind him oh dear yes he will remember me youve always wanted to be remembered aye he sighed but i fear this fame could be too final the afternoon wore on the southerly breeze pushed the crude boat along at little more than a walking pace but unfailingly the shoreline crept through its changes farms and vines and patches of forest to the right rubble and scrub and sheer rock faces growing higher and wilder to the left to fiamettas relief master beneforte slept for a time she prayed he would feel better when he woke and indeed when his eyes blinked open again in the slanting light of late afternoon he sat upright for the first time how go we i think were going to run out of lake and light at about the same time she almost wished the lake would run north forever but when the shifting hills had parted around that last curve theyd revealed not another stretch of lake but the capping shoreline with the tiny village of cecchino huddled on its edge as long as we dont run out of wind its grown more erratic the last little while fiametta admitted she made another adjustment to the sail he stared at the cloudless turquoise bowl of sky arcing between the hills i trust there will be no storm tonight for becalming we have oars she glanced at the oars with unease there went her last hope of avoiding the dreaded shore even if the wind failed which it seemed inclined to do over the next halfhour their progress slowed to a crawl the surface of the water grew silken and the little slap of wind waves against the hull muted to pure silence the village was still a mile off she gave up at last and lowered the sail she jiggled the heavy oars into the oar locks and made to sit on the center bench give over master beneforte snorted your puny little girl arms wont get us there before nightfall he evicted her from her place with a wave of his hands and took it over with a grunt he started them forward with powerful sloshing strokes that made whirlpools spiral away from the oar blades into the smooth water but after two minutes he stopped his face grown gray again even against the orange glow of sunset he gave up the oars to her without even arguing and was very quiet for a time it was dusk when fiamettas last aching pull nosed the bow onto the pebbled beach stifflegged they stumbled out of the boat and pulled it another foot up onto shore master beneforte let the bow rope drop to the gravel crunching underfoot will we stay here the night fiametta asked anxiously not if i can get horses said master beneforte this place is too small to hide in i wont begin to be easy till were over the border hole up somewhere beyond lord ferrantes reach till things sort themselves out will we ever get to go home again he gazed south over the darkening lake my heart stands in my courtyard in montefoglia covered with clay by god and all the saints i will not be sundered from my heart for long over the course of the next hour they discovered that fisherfolk were not notable horsemen boats after all did not require expensive hay and grain they were handed from one headshaking peasant to another less and less hospitably as the night grew darker at last fiametta found herself standing with her father in a shed at the end of the village looking at a fat white nag that was overattheknees grayheaded bewhiskered and venerable are you sure you dont mean us two to carry him master beneforte dismayed asked the geldings owner fiametta petted its wide velvety nose and listened shed never had a horse before the villager launched into a lengthy list of the beasts great strengths and manifold virtues ending with a declaration that the horse was practically one of his family yes your grandfather muttered master beneforte in his beard but after further negotiation the deal was struck a jewel and the boat for a horse master beneforte prised a jewel from the hilt of his dagger under the mans suspicious eyes he drew the line in outrage at the villagers request for a second jewel for a saddle the subsequent crescendo of argument almost broke the deal again still the horse trader offered them bread cheese and wine master beneforte denied being hungry though both he and fiametta drank a little wine they packed the bread and cheese along the rising moon had just cleared the eastern hills when the peasant helped boost fiametta up behind her father on the horses warm wide back the barebacks downward curve was practically a saddle in itself the night was clear and the moon still nearfull its light sufficient for them to make out the road in front of them at the speed they were going to be traveling it would be quite safe master beneforte clucked and beat the horses fat sides with his heels and they ambled off as they left the environs of the village the horse seemed to perk up at this break from its usual routine and stepped out well vigorously was too strong a term normally perhaps the heavy red wine combined with the gruesome day just past made fiamettas eyelids droop she laid her head against her fathers back and dozed lulled by the horses steady rocking clopaclop the horse trader had earnestly warned them of demons abroad in the dark after today demons seemed homey to fiametta compared to men she didnt fear the dark at all as long as there were no men in it her blood was beating raggedly in her ears as she jerked awake at a sudden jounce of the white horse under her her father was slapping the beast into a trot hissing and no the thrumming noise wasnt inside her head but outside hoofbeats on the road behind them jostled and sliding she clutched master beneforte around the waist and cranked her aching head around to stare over her shoulder how many master beneforte demanded in a strained voice i im not sure horsemen yes dark shapes on the road behind them cold light glinting off metal more than two four i should have bought a black horse this cursed beast shines like the moon master beneforte groaned and this country has no cover worth a whores spit nevertheless he yanked the horse off the road and headed them across a silvermisted meadow toward a coppice of spindly trees it was too late a shout went up behind them catcalls and hooting as their pursuers seeing them belabored their horses into full gallop threequarters of the way across the meadow master beneforte pulled the white horses head back around he drew his dagger get down and run for the trees fiametta papa no youre more a hindrance than a help this needs my undivided attention run damn it fiametta huffed out her breath in protest but she was halfsliding off the horses slick back anyway she fell to her feet and skipped backwards the four dark horsemen were turning in to the meadow and spreading out in a frontal charge actually not quite a charge their horses bounced in a hesitant reinedin canter as if the idea of attacking a master mage in the dark was beginning to lose its appeal with proximity they do not know how sick he is fiametta thought the leader pointed at fiametta and shouted to one of his men who peeled off from the rest and started forward at a much more convincing pace fiametta picked up her skirts and sprinted for the trees the coppice was closegrown if she reached it first he would not be able to force his mount in among the lashing branches if she didnt a panicked glance over her shoulder showed the other three closing in on master beneforte who waited for them dagger raised the drama of the tableau slightly spoiled by the fat white horse fighting to put its head down and eat grass pigs master benefortes shout echoed in her ears scum come and be slaughtered like the vile herd of swine that you are master beneforte had often maintained that the best defense was a good offense most men being cowards at heart but his labored breathing drained much of the threat from his tones the man detailed to pursue fiametta was clearly not in the least frightened of her however she crashed into the coppice just ahead of him he made his horse rear to a stop and dismounted to follow he didnt even draw his sword his boots were heavy and his legs were long she dodged around the tree boles the ragged ground catching at her light slippers he loomed closerwith a lunge he caught her flying skirt and yanked it up dumping her on her face the ground came up like a blow knocking her teeth painfully she spat dirt he landed on top of her and pressed her to the ground she twisted around to claw at his eyes he was winded but laughing teeth and eyes gleaming in his shadowed face he pinioned both her wrists in one hand her lungs burned too breathless to scream she tried to bite his nose he jerked his head back barely in time and cursed methodically onehanded he began to pull off her jewelry her silver earrings and necklace of no great value except for their delicate design he stuffed into his doublet luckily the wires gave way before her earlobes tore her ears stung where theyd twisted free he had to lie across her chest and use both hands to pry up her thumb and strip it of the lion ring while her legs kicked unable to reach a target he held the ring up to the moonlight and uttered a ha of satisfaction at its weight but then rather absently laid it on the ground he pushed up on his hands and looked down her body the faceted green eyes of the silver snake glinted in the leafdappled moonlight oh ho he said laid his free hand on the belt and jerked the belt held fast he jerked again harder lifting her hips from the ground intrigued his hand left the belt and closed over her crotch and he pinched her hard through the thick velvet the snakes eyes glowed red the silver head rose waved once from side to side curved around gaped its mouth wide and sank silver fangs deep into his groping hand he screamed like a man damned a ridiculously highpitched shriek to come from that big throat he clutched his hand to his chest and rolled off her folded into a ball and kept screaming the howls became wordsoh god i burn i burn black witch oh god i burn fiametta sat bolt upright in the dirt and leaf litter he was rolling from side to side like a man possessed his back arched convulsively she patted the ground all around groped up her lion ring stuffed it back on her thumb scrambled to her feet and clawed her way through the spring vegetation surely they would expect her to run away she circled back toward the meadow instead an opening slashed through the branches of the coppice proved to be from a large old beech tree fallen slantwise with its roots ripped up she burrowed under its shadow into a leaffilled depression and went as still and quiet as her heaving chest and raw whistling breath would permit she could hear the men shouting to each other but not master benefortes bellow the snakebite victim still howling finally found his way back to his fellows and the hideous din dimished their hoarse coarse voices blundered no nearer to her anyway her command of her own breath returned slowly finally multiple hoofbeats faded into the distance but had they all departed or just some of them she waited her ears straining but heard only the whisper of branches a few insects and the call of a nightingale leafshadows wove a brocade with the moon now at zenith with her eyes wide she picked her way quietly back to tile edge of the meadow no bravo jumped from ambush only the white horse was visible hallway across its head down in the milky mist she could hear its teeth ripping up and grinding the juicy meadow grasses she crept out into the cold dewsoaked clumps she found her fathers body not far from the horse he lay tumbled silvered beard pointing upward open eyes blearing in the moonlight the losimon bravos had stripped him of the saltcellar cloak gold chain jeweled poniard and scabbard and his rings as shed expected theyd also taken his tunic hat and shoes leaving him only his ripped linen shirt and black hose points halfuntied it was terribly undignified he looked like an old man overtaken by death on the way to the wardrobe fearfully she patted him for sword wounds but found none she laid her ear to his dewdampened chest what could you hear if a heart had burst who would hear hers if it burst now he must have been felled by his own illness before hed even had a chance to defend himself perhaps the efforts had been the final blow shed thought the day had drained her of every possible reaction but apparently she still had tears left her face cried on almost without her as if she were split in two her other part methodically dragged his body to the lip of a small gully that drained the meadow she recaptured the horsethe losimons had apparently scorned to steal the old nagled it down and positioned it in the low spot and dragged master beneforte across its swayed back the abandoned husk of master beneforte wherever he was her father certainly was no longer in there the horses fuzzy white ears flicked back and forth confused by its odd burden her fathers arms dangled down and his hair hung lank and strange she chose to lead the horse from the other side holding the husks foot to keep it steadily balanced still crying strangely calm she coaxed the horse back onto the road and began walking north chapter five from winter to summer was but a twoday walk thur noted to himself with contentment he patted the shoulder of the big brown mule he led for packmaster pico yesterday morning the pack train had crested the snowy heights of montefoglia pass all barren rocks and treacherous ice and biting clawing wind this evening they strolled along a poplarlined avenue grateful for the green shade against the glare of the westering sun arcing down into the soft rolling hills he wriggled his toes in his dusty boots his feet were warm the mules long furry ears aflop to each side rose to attention and its tired plod quickened up ahead pico had paused to let down the bars to a pasture gate he led his pack train within judging by their puling the eight mules were familiar with this stop though it was all new to thur keep them moving to the grove pico pointing to the stand of trees shading one end of the pasture shouted over his shoulder to his two sons and thur thats where well camp well take their packs off first and then turn them loose the mule tried to nudge thur toward the green grass and the little stream but thur dutifully dragged it to the grove and tied it to a tree youll be happier to have your pack off first he told it then you can roll it waggled its absurd ears at him in disagreement and snorted through its creamcolored nose and thur grinned he pulled off its heavy pack loaded with copper ingots and hides and the pack of its work mate who followed on a rope and turned both beasts loose they thudded away toward the stream squealing happily the pastures only other occupant a swaybacked old white horse regarded the invasion with both interest and suspicion the look on its long gray face made thur think of the old scholar brother glarus presented with a troop of rowdy new students thur turned to help picos younger boy zilio with his mules heavy packs which threatened to crush the lad zilio smiled gratefully and sprang about rather like the released mules pico his sons and thur lined up the packs and set the bright striped saddle pads atop upside down to dry and air the boys began to unload their meager camp gear and pico started to build a fire in a charred circle from a handy stack of wood thur stared around with interest on the other side of the road rambled a big twostory stucco house whitewashed a pastel pink with outbuildings in a yard behind the whole was surrounded by a high pink stucco wall with broken glass and rusty nails set in its top frosting of cement but a wide double wooden gate stood invitingly open to the road you could take a room at the inn if you liked pico seeing thurs gaze nodded across the road if youre tired of sleeping on the ground innkeeper cattis beds are good but i warn you hes a great greedyguts and charges plenty for his linen he really prefers prelates to muleteers for customers when he can get them will you sleep there no i always stay with my beasts and my load unless its pouring rain or snowing he charges me enough for the pasture and the firewood tis a good stop though and good fodder and the beasts like it and with an early start i can usually push all the way home to montefoglia by dark in the summer cattis wife sets a good table on the nights when the rain makes my fire too miserable she smokes the most excellent hams which reminds me i promised to bring one home to my neighbor who watches my place when im away dont let me forget when i go over there to settle my charges thur nodded dug out his bit of tallow soap and went to wash his hands and face upstream the brook was icy but refreshing and the evening air so warm he was lured into washing his hair and upper torso and then much more quickly his lower half picos older boy tich a gawky fifteenyearold came over to watch intrigued he shuffled off his boot and stuck an experimental foot into the brook then yelled with the cold its not that bad thur said mildly tich hopped in a circle shaking the drops off mad mountain man he stuffed his foot back into his boot the water in the mines is much colder god save me from the mines then said tich fervently im for the open road isnt this the life he waved a possessive arm at the encroaching spring evening as if he owned it all to the horizons you should join us thur not shut yourself up in some nasty little dark shop thur shook his head smiling its the metal tich hundreds of men labor to get metal like the copper were carrying into the hands of some fancy smith and who gets the credit the artisan thats who besides thur paused hesitating to confide his hearts hope to a possibly unsympathetic ear i want to learn to make splendid and beautiful things besides it cant be any darker or more nasty than the mines its all in what youre used to i guess tich allowed too amiable to argue pico strolled over to redirect tichs energy come on boy youve got mules to curry thur shrugged his dusty wool tunic and leggings back on those must last till he reached montefoglia and found a washerwoman perhaps he could strike a deal split firewood or something in exchange working his way with packmaster pico thur had not yet had to tap his little store of coins and he hoped to make them last as long as possible so as not to be wholly dependent on the charity of his brother uri he shared his soap with pico while tich attempted to dragoon the tenyearold zilio into helping with his assigned chore and zilio protested their squabbling faded in the distance as thur and pico walked across the road to the inn the mens shadows lay long in front of them as the sun reached for the rim of the hills to their backs thurs stride lengthened the pink inn seemed poignant with some undefined promise drawing him on thur decided it must be his thirst he shouldered through the front door after pico who called cheerily for catti the whitewashed front room was set up with tables on trestles and benches a few coals glowed in the banked fireplace ready to ignite a neat stack of wood waiting to be piled on later as the evening cooled several promising kegs with taps sat on more trestles against one wall master catti emerged from the back of the building wiping his hands on a grimy linen towel he was a graying man his waist thickened more with age than living and he stumped along quickly on short ah pico he greeted the packmaster eagerly i saw you come in have you heard the news from montefoglia his smile was welcoming but his eyes looked strained pico arrested by the hushed tones dragged his gaze from the kegs to his host no what duke sandrino was assassinated four days ago what how did it come about picos mouth gaped thurs happy warmth washed from his belly in an instant to be replaced with a cold knot of ice catti rocked on his heels grimly satisfied with the effect of his gossip they say he had some sort of quarrel with the lord of losimo at the betrothal banquet for his daughter julia daggers were drawn and the usual followed a terrible mess by the accounts ive heard so far from people coming up the road lord ferrantes troops have captured montefoglia at least for the moment my god have they sacked the town asked pico not much they still have their hands full with my brother is in the dukes guard thur interrupted urgently ah catti raised his eyebrows hes just botched himself out of a job id say and a little less tartly i hear some of the guards fled with little lord ascanio and their wounded behind the walls of saint jerome with the abbot monreale and some of the guards presumably had not yet thur could picture uri defending the boylord getting him safe behind the monasterys stones being last through the gate no doubt ferrantes troops march about and glare at the walls catti went on but they dont quite dare attack the brethren yet ferrante has the duchess and lady julia as hostage and has sent to losimo for more troops at the quickmarch pico the packman whistled through his teeth bad well my place lies outside the town and theres little enough to steal there thank the virgin i brought zilio with me this trip i often leave him with my neighbor i think id better lay over a day or two with you catti if i can have your pasture till we get some hint of how things fall out i should think youd get a good price down there right now for your metals from one side or tother said catti theyll be wanting armor weapons bronze for cannon im more likely to have it stolen from me by one side or the other said pico gloomily no twould be better to cut over the hills and go west to milan my mules will eat most of my profits in the travel though he glanced at thur youre free to go on to montefoglia if you wish thur to seek news of your brother though id be sorry to lose your strong back i dont know thur stood stiff with doubt and worry stay the night suggested catti decide in the morning yes that would be best pico agreed there may be better news by then who knows he clapped thur consolingly on the shoulder in awkward sympathy thur nodded thanks and reluctant agreement do you still want your ham he remembered not now i tell you though catti if your wife has any of those big smoked sausages ill take one we can toast slices over the fire tonight and on our way to milan i think she has a few left from the last pig hanging in the smokehouse but good thur go pick out one for us will you i had better go tell my boys the bad news frowning pico went back out the door and recrossed the road catti shrugged and led thur through the inn and across the back yard thur readily identified the small shack that was the smokehouse by the aromatic gray haze that seeped out under its eaves and hung promisingly in the still evening air thur ducked into the smoky dimness after catti catti bent down and inserted a couple more watersoaked sticks of apple wood into the coals of the fire pit in the center of the dirt floor the aromatic cloud thus released tickled thurs nostrils and he sneezed theres four left catti reached up and tapped one of a row of brown gauzewrapped cylinders hanging from the blackened rafters and made it swing take your choice thur glanced up then his gaze was riveted by what lay in the shadows above the rafters a board crossed them at right angles balanced on the board was the nude body of a graybearded man closewrapped in the same sort of gauze as the sausages like a thin swaddling shroud his skin was shrivelled and tanning in the smoke pico was right thur observed after a moments stunned silence your wife does smoke the most unusual hams catti glanced up after him oh that he said in disgust i was just going to tell pico the story hes a refugee from montefoglia who didnt quite make it penniless it turned outafter the bill was run up do you do this often to guests who dont pay asked thur in a fascinated voice ill tell pico to settle our bill promptly no no he was dead when he got here catti exclaimed impatiently three days ago but the priest was gone and theres none to shrive him and none of my neighbors will allow an unshriven dead sorcerer to be buried on their property and frankly neither will i and the hellcat girl wont pay we had to do something with him so i thought of the smokehouse so there he lies and there he can stay till his bill is settled and so i told my wife she can flounce off to her sisters in a fury if she wants but i wont be cheated by a dead florentines servant catti crossed his arms to emphasize his resolve i think he eats and drinks but little master innkeeper how much are you charging him for the smoke thur inquired still craning his neck upward yes but you should see how the horse he rode in on gorges groaned catti as a last resort ill confiscate the horse but id rather have the ring for surety the ring wont drop dead suddenly as the nag looks to do he waved an impatient hand against the rising smoke pulled a sausage down off its hook and motioned thur out of the smokehouse ahead of him you see catti went on after drawing a lungful of clear air three mornings ago this halfethiope girl dressed in filthy velvet came dragging him up the road slung across that white nag now in my pasture she said theyd fled the massacre in montefoglia and been robbed and him murdered by lord ferrantes men who pursued them past cecchino except he hadnt been murderedthere isnt a wound on himand she hadnt been robbed for she wears a big gold ring on her thumb a blind bandit couldnt have overlooked i had my suspicions but she seemed in distress and my wife has a soft head and she let her in and got her cleaned up and calmed down the more i thought it over the more suspicious i became you have to get up early in the morning to make a fool of old catti she claimed the old man was a florentine mage and her father the florentine part ill grant i think she was his slave he died of apoplexy on the road or maybe black magic she robbed his body and hid his things and rolled in the dirt and made her hair wild and came in telling this tale meaning to be rid of him at my expense and circle back later for his treasure the proof of it is that gold ring is a mans ring she probably stole it off her masters finger well i saw through her ploy and charged her with it and then what happened said thur she had a screaming fit and refused to give up her stolen ring she said if her father were alive hed turn me into one of my own bedbugs i dont think she could turn beer into piss shes barricaded herself in my best room and screams curses at me through the door and threatens to set fire to my inn and wont come out now i ask you isnt it suspicious is she not a madwoman you would almost think she fears being robbed again thur murmured quite demented catti frowned then his gloomy gaze traveled up thur a dim light animated his eye say youre a big strong lad theres a pot of ale in it for you if you can pull her from my best bedroom without breaking any of my furniture how about it thurs blond brows rose why dont you evict her yourself catti mumbled something about aging bones and hellcat thur wondered if catti were seeing himself as a bedbug could a mage even turn a man into an insect and if so would it be a mansized insect or tiny well hed been thinking about dipping into his coins and buying some ale to go with that toasted sausage tonight the tap room had breathed a delicious aroma from the vicinity of those kegs i could try i suppose thur offered cautiously good the innkeeper reached up and clapped him on the shoulder come this way ill show you where he led thur back inside on the second floor of the inn catti pointed to a closed door and whispered in there how is it barricaded theres a bar though not a very stout one and shes wedged it with something i think she dragged the bed against it thur studied the wooden door from downstairs came a mans voice calling catti hey catti are you asleep up there get your fat self down here and pour me a mug or ill help myself catti wrung his hands in frustration do your best he urged thur and hurried downstairs thur watched the door a moment longer the strange inarticulate longing that he had identified as thirst outside was much stronger now knotting and coiling in his stomach his mouth was dry he shrugged and went up and put his shoulder to the oak he wedged his foot to the floor and tensed the door resisted he pushed a little harder an unfortunate splintering sound came from the other side thur paused worried had he just lost his pot of ale he pushed again against a skreeling of wood across wood that reminded him of the windlass in the mine the gap widened a bit more he stuck his head through and bunked some black iron bolts holding the bracket for the door bar had torn out of the doorframe and the bar swung loose a bed with four posts holding up a canopy had been shoved a little way back by the inwardmoving door standing not three feet from him was a brownskinned girl in a red dress with long linen undersleeves holding a heavy flowerpainted ceramic chamber pot high in both hands its contents sloshed ominously under its ceramic lid thurs breath stopped he had never seen anyone so extraordinary midnightblack hair tumbled like a stormcloud skin like toast breathing the heat of a mediterranean noon a petite alert yet wellpadded body that reminded him of the walnutwood carvings of angels around the altar of the parish church in bruinwald brilliant eyes the warm brown color of his mothers precious cinnamon sticks she looked she looked warm all over in fact she shrank back glaring at him that wouldnt do he squeezed the rest of himself through the door shifting the bed across the floor with another shattering skreek and clasped his hands together in what he hoped was a nonthreatening manner his hands felt as big as cheese paddles and as clumsy he swallowed and remembered to exhale hello he ducked his head politely at her and cleared his throat she backed another step her arms bearing up the chamber pot sank a little you really cant stay in here not forever anyway thur said her arms were shaking does that greedy innkeeper bring you any food not not since yesterday when his wife left she stammered out not taking her wary gaze from him i had a bottle of wine that i was making last but its gone now she was staring at him as if he was some sort of monster really he wasnt that big he bent his knees a little and slumped his shoulders and tried futilely to shrink it was the little room that set him off to such disadvantage he needed a bigger room or the outdoors the gold ring on her potclutching thumb riveted his eye a lion mask with a red gem in its mouth seemed to glow with a saharan heat drawing him like a fire he nodded to it is that the ring catti wants to steal she smiled bitterly he wants to but he cant hes tried twice but he cant keep hold of it only one man can wear this ring ill prove it she tossed her mane of wildly curling hair and set the chamber pot down on the floor i was planning to break this over cattis head but on you i cant reach that high she grimaced and shoved it away with her foot she pulled the ring from her thumb and sourly smug held it out to him just try to put it on youll find you cant it glowed in his palm when he closed his hand over it it felt alive like a beating heart automatically he slipped it over the ring finger of his left hand and held it up to the last sunbeam a golden slice of light that penetrated the rooms shutters and made a bright line on the wall the tiny lions mane shimmered in singing waves and the little gem burned he turned his hand making the red reflection dance like a fairy over the opposite wall he looked up to find the brown girl staring at him with a look of utter horror on her beautiful soft features ohim sorry he apologized he knew not what for you said to put it on here he tugged at it against his wrinkling knuckle a muleteer she whispered still with that aghast look my ring has brought me a stinking muleteer a big stupid german lout swiss thur corrected still tugging a big stupid swiss lout yah she must have been watching him from the window when picos packtrain arrived he grew scarlet like the gem his knuckle was red and white and swelling excuse me its stuck he twisted the ring around in embarrassment but it still jammed maybe some soap i have a bit of soap in my pack you can come with me im not trying to steal your ring madonna i was going to montefoglia my brother has apprenticed me to a goldsmith there or he was going to but now i dont know whats happening my brother uri is a captain in the dukes guard you see and i dont know im afraid i dont know if hes alive or dead right now he twisted and pulled more frantically as her face stunned began to crumple with tears but it was no good the ring was stuck fast sorry can can i help can i help you madonna he opened his hands to her offeringwell he didnt have much offering his hands anyway to his alarm and distress she sank to the floor hands to her face weeping awkwardly he levered himself down beside her ill get the ring off somehow if i have to to chop off my finger he promised recklessly she shook her head helplessly and gulped out its not that its the whole thing thur paused and spoke more gently that really is your father in the smokehouse isnt it im sorry that innkeeper is a bit of a monster im afraid ill break his head for you if you like oh she put her hands out flat on the floor and leaned on them wearily for support she stared down at them then looked up at thur searching his face you dont look much like uri i didnt expect his younger brother to be so much bigger and youre so blond and pale compared to him i worked in the mines most of this winter i scarcely saw the sun he must look as repulsive to her as a white worm winkled from under a rock his thought stuttered jerked about you know my brother uri and more urgently do you have any idea of his fate she sat up straighter and held out a hand to him in sad irony hello thur ochs im fiametta beneforte prospero beneforte is my father you have arrived just in time to become apprenticed to a smoked corpse her lips compressed on an angry sob uris letter didnt mention a daughter thur blurted in surprise he grasped her hand quickly lest she take it away again his letters are always too short mother says her voice lowered i last saw captain ochs take a sword thrust through his chest while trying to defend little lord ascanio from ferrantes murdering men i dont know if hes alive or dead or if he got away with the other wounded to the healers at saint jerome but it was no small wound she released his grip and plucked jerkily at the wrinkled velvet of her skirts bunched in her lap im sorry i have no better news nor more recent my father and i fled away for our lives or we tried to what happened his belly was cold cold in short blunt sentences she stammered out a nightmare account of her last four days thur remembered the grief and loss of his own fathers death in the mines hed been at school with brother glarus that winter day the news of the cavein had come at breathless secondhand after days of frantic fruitless rescue efforts the priest had consecrated the shaft and the lost men been left buried and thur had never looked on his fathers face again fiametta had had to wrestle with her dead alone in the night thur felt both horror for her and a strange envy dead her father was as his but at least not cut off from the last services survivors could bestow though smoking and curing was not exactly on the usual list of comforting ritual pieties properly due a paterfamilias and the second time he tried to twist it from my thumb i kicked him in the knee and barricaded myself in here that was that was yesterday she came to the end of her tale and rested her head on her knees face turned to his rocking a little how did you come here briefly he described his brothers letter and how he had found a guide and company in exchange for his labor with pico but how here to this inn just in time to meet me thur blinked he had an extraordinary knack for finding things yes but surely it would be some land of arrogance in front of a real mages daughter to claim supernatural meaning for a mere knot in his belly and catch in his bream pico always stops here its the only place between bergoa on the border and cecchino have i wrought true after all she breathed in bewilderment her hand closed you put my ring right on thur twisted it ill get it off i promise no she sat up and spread her fingers pink palms down keep it for now anyway fat catti wont try to wrest it from your hand i cant take this its much too valuable not that he seemed to have much choice till his knuckle shrank again i tell you what madonna beneforte i have a few coins i think i have enough to ransom your fathers body from that greedhead innkeeper get him out of the smokehouse at least and help you get him properly buried she wrinkled her brow yes but where the ignorant peasants here all fear to have him planted on their property because he was a mage and i wont have him buried in the middle of the road i passed through the village of bergoa yesterday theres a little parish church there and a priest hell have to take your father in ill help you take him there tomorrow she bowed her head and whispered thank you freed of the stiffening from her isolation and fear thur could see her weariness was near to overwhelming her i ill have to go south after that thur said i have to find out the fate of my brother her head came up it will grow dangerous the closer you try to go to montefoglia lora ferrantes mercenaries will be out marauding pillaging for their needs killing any who resist or or compelling them to their service or do you think to volunteer your service to the dukes guards if they still hold saint jerome against ferrante thur shook his head i have no calling to be a soldier unless i were defending bruinwald the way the men of schwyz fought off the armagnacs at the battle of st jakob and der birs but i cant go home to our mother without sure news of uri if hes hurt i must try to bring him away and if hes dead if hes dead i must know shrugged thur but its certainly too dangerous for you down that way madonna beneforte maybe the priest at bergoa will know of a safe place for you to stay till iwereturn return he smiled in an attempt at reassurance your ring will be your surety if i cant get it off ill have to bring it back wont i her generous mouth pursed in plaintive puzzlement isnt that the wrong way around for a surety a debt is a bond it must be paid you are an unusual man muleteer miner her brow lifted mage oh im no mage i meant to apprentice to your father yes but i figured to haul wood and lift ingots mainly just a workman really i am my fathers only heir she bit her lower lip with strong white teeth your apprentices contracthad it been drawn upwould now be a part of my inheritance i wonder how much of the rest has been looted by the losimons by now there you go then said thur cheerfully well met madonna though the times are ill well met muleteer she whispered her twisted smile was not unkind her brows quizzical as if she were growing used to him or to the idea of him though the times are very ill he lumbered to his feet and gave her a hand up come lets get something to eat i dont think catti will refuse my coins no but with his wife gone the food could be chancy fiametta warned i gather she did all the cooking and a great deal more besides you can have my toasted sausage by picos fire if you will you can share our camp pico wont mind she grimaced id rather sleep under a tree than spend another night under cattis roof thats certain they started for the stairs that gave onto the front taproom mens talk echoed up at the head of the stairs fiametta suddenly froze and held up her hand to stop thur shh she whispered and listened intently head cocked to one side oh god i know that voice that spitty sound it has a friend said thur hopefully no it sounds like the man who led ferrantes bravos the night they killed my father would you recognize him if you peeked through the staircase the wood below the rail had decorative trefoil holes cut in it she shook her head i never saw his face they dont know me murmured thur after a moment crouch here and ill go see whats happening turn the ring inward they might recognize it she whispered and he nodded and turned the lion mask to his palm letting his hand curl she sank to the floor slipped a little way down the staircase and put her eye to one trefoil cutout she drew in her breath and her hands clenched to fists apparently she knew the man after all thur walked openly into the taproom three or four local folk had drifted in and sat on the benches nursing mugs by their workstained tunics and leggings they were farmers or laborers in addition two strangers stood quaffing pots of ale and talking to catti they were clearly horsemen travelers wearing mudsplattered boots short cloaks doublets and heavy hose in addition to the usual dagger that every man carried each bore a steel sword they wore no badge or colors identifying them as lord ferrantes men or any other lords when the senior bearded one put down his mug after a last uptipping draught thur could see he was missing several front teeth thur hung in the background blending in with the local peasantry take us to him then innkeeper and well see if hes the thief we seek said the bearded horseman wiping his lips with his sleeve for the price of his ransom you can have him grumbled catti i knew something stank of old fish this way catti lit a lamp and led the two strangers through tile inn to his back yard thur and after a moment two other of the curious yokels tagged along the sky was still luminous with late twilight though the evening star shone above the western hills catti with the lamp and the bearded man ducked into the smokehouse they emerged again very shortly the bearded losimon spoke to his stubbleshaved companion found him get the horses the younger man glanced around uneasily at the gathering dusk sure you dont want to spend the night here and go in the morning the bearded mans voice fell to a growl if were late or botch this again youll wish for hobgoblins without delay he said get the horses the younger man shrugged and trudged off around the corner of the inn catti rubbed his hands together happily thur drifted over to him catti looked up did you get the shecat out of my best room he asked yes and where is she she ran off up the road in the dark damn i wanted that ring well i have the horse good riddance it looks like ill be quit of both my problems in a moment the younger stranger returned leading three horses two were caparisoned with light cavalry saddles the third bore an empty pack saddle the younger man laid out a large piece of old canvas on the ground and tossed some rope down beside it who are those men thur whispered to catti guardsmen from montefoglia that dead graybeard my smokehouse turns out to be a thief stole a invaluable gold saltcellar from the castle they say theyre taking him off my hands id think theyd want the saltcellar not the body isnt it a little late for a hanging said thur the two men entered the smokehouse after some thumping sounds they came out with the old mans body on its board they pulled the board away and began rolling the corpse up in the canvas what do they want it for and whose guardsmen are they the dukes or lord ferrantes who cares if their coins are good catti murmured impatiently the two men bound the canvas round with rope and lifted the long package they grunted forcing it to bend over the pack saddle while the bearded man tied the canvascovered shape firmly to its carrier the younger man ducked back inside the smokehouse and came out with two hams which he slung over his saddle bow this is wrong master catti thur whispered urgently you mustnt let them take him herei have some coins in my pack ill get them right now ill ransom him from you instead ill take their coins in my hand thank you snapped catti they offer a better bargain whatever they offered ill give you more not likely muleteer catti waved him away and approached the strangers smiling i see you fancy my hams you wont regret them i guarantee now lets see the ransom plus two pots of ale plus two hams comes to he counted on his fingers thur saw it coming he dropped back by the smokehouse and snatched up a long billet of wood from the stack alongside the younger man swung aboard his horse as the older man grasped the counting catti by the shoulder and pulled him toward himself heres your payment innkeeper the steel of his dagger flashed in the folds of his cloak as he stabbed catti in the stomach catti cried out in pain and astonishment and stumbled backwards hands clutching his belly as the bravo flung him away the two watching locals started toward him their reactions slow the bearded man grinned darkmouthed with his missing teeth and vaulted aboard his horse his subordinate was already spurring toward the road yanking the packhorse along futilely thur flung his billet at the younger losimons back with all his strength it rotated through the air and bounced off the cloak and doubletpadded man with little effect clods of dirt spun up from the horses hooves as the bravos fled into the gathering shadows thur pelted around the building in their wake but by the time he reached the front gate the hoofbeats were only a fading echo in the twilight fiametta was standing in the middle of the road amidst the dust hanging in the air peering south after the vanished horsemen her face was drawn eyes big and dark they stole your fathers body thur panted i couldnt stop them i know i saw why its madness they took two hams as well surely they dont plan to eat him on she breathed intensity of thought struggled with dismay in her face i have a guess a monstrous guess he cannoti have to stop she stepped down the road a few paces fists clenched as if in a trance thur caught her by the sleeve you cant go running down the road by yourself in the middle of the night she rotated in his grip looking across to the pasture and the dim glimmer of her white horse among picos mules then ill ride no she stared at him brows lowering her eyes flamed what ill go tomorrow and as her breath drew in angrily he added hastily well both go she hesitated her hands uncurled she stared around into the vast uncertain darkness her shoulders slumped i dont know what to how to yes youre right very well looking stunned she turned to follow him back into the inn chapter six the uproar in the inn was augmented by two families of refugees from montefoglia who arrived just as the wounded catti was carried indoors by the big blond swiss and the locals the chaos did not the down till cattis wife returned fetched by a breathless neighbor fiametta hung back uncertainly as the woman who had been kind to her bustled within but madonna catti though she frowned deeply spoke no blame instead she drafted fiamettas aid carrying and arranging bedding water and washbasins for the mob of new guests while she tended to her husband she emerged from her bedroom several times to keep her stableboys hustling and to direct the montefoglians servants to put together a meal of bread cheese smoked sausage wine and ale served all round fiametta did not partake of the smoked meats at madonna cattis request packmaster pico brought his mules his cargo and his sons within the walls of the compound and the gates were firmly locked for the night the montefoglians were distressed to learn that me marauding soldiers from whom theyd fled were ranging this far north and made plans to move on in the morning in the meantime counting up the fathers brothers servants cattis stablehands the picos and the swiss there were fourteen armed men within the walls tonight nothing less than a large mounted patrol would offer threat but lord ferrante already has what he wanted fiametta thought with numb certainty they wont be back tonight not till ferrante marched up the road a conqueror at the head of a troop no country inn was likely to resist fiametta kept moving like a clockwork doll work was better than thinking or feeling but inevitably she came to the end of her chores the babble and excitement faded and people blew out their candles and went to their beds cattis wife emerged from their bedroom with bloodstained bandages and cattis shirt to put to soak in cold water which fiametta drew for her from the well in the yard they set the bucket down outside the back door in the lantern light how is master catti doing fiametta asked guiltily if the wound doesnt go bad madonna catti sighed hell probably live his fat belly saved him from the dagger going too deep if he asks for food dont give him any she pushed the bundled cloths down into the bucket straightened wearily and wiped her hands on her apron im sorry to have brought these troubles upon you if the greedy old ass had set you on the road to the priest at bergoa that second morning as i begged him to do for charitys sake these troubles would nave gone elsewhere madonna catti said tartly she glanced up at her inn bulking in the dark her mouth flattened if he truly feared a dead sorcerers ghost he should have buried him decently not put him up in my good smokehouse my smokehouse will be accurst now i shouldnt wonder if all my meat goes rotten and maggoty my father was never a man to overlook an insult fiametta admitted reluctantly but i thinki fearhis spirit has greater troubles just now her hand kneaded the folds of her skirt oh madonna catti studied her sharply well go to bed girl but go from here tomorrow may i have my horse fiametta asked humbly horse and all in fact i dont want you to leave anything here that you came with she shook her head fiametta followed her back indoors a secondfloor porch or loggia overlooking the back yard of the inn usually used for drying laundry had been converted into a dormitory for the female servants of the two montefoglian families fiametta had laid a bedroll for herself closest to the railing she now picked her way over the snoring forms of the exhausted women she slipped off her overdress and laid it atop her blanket and pulled down her linen underdress bunched a bit above the snakebelt shed worn concealed from cattis greed despite the night chill she leaned on the railing and looked out over the inn yard the moon waning and dull rode a quarter of the way up the sky along the far wall picos mules stood strung along a horse line fodder piled at their feet to keep them content smoke still seeped from the smokehouse a layer of haze in the dimming moonlight pico his sons and the swiss were bedded down in a little bastion formed of the pack saddles near the mules she could see the blond mans bowlcropped hair gleam as he shifted and turned over in his bedroll she curled her fingers around her ringless left thumb rubbing the empty place what have i done did my ring draw him to me is he really supposed to be my true love does he know this thur wasnt what shed pictured when shed cast the ring and its truelove spell together on the first day of spring she could scarcely say what she had pictured in her inarticulate longing to be loved she stared down at the blanketed lump in the yard and tried to feel ardent or swept by passion or at least impressed nothing it wasnt that she disliked him he was just sort of there alarmingly solid and real friendly certainly after the manner of a big spoiled mastiff pup who a never been cuffed snuffling up to be petted it had never even crossed her mind that she would not immediately love her true love back but shed been expecting someone shorter older more sophisticated better dressed at least and richer he really doesnt smell all that bad for a muleteer she felt a frustrated urge to rip her ring from his hand and tap it on the nearest tabletop as if something stuck inside her spell could so be loosened but she could still feel it even now at this distance the same quiet tiny hum of magic the spell had emitted scarcely a ripple when the swiss had slipped the ring on curling around his finger and purring like a smug and comfortable cat fed on fish and cream a wellcast spell was a barely discernible thing even to the inner eye of a trained mage only when badly botched or thwarted was magic obvious to ordinary senses a jangling discord that wasted power teseos first efforts had been almost painfully loud emitting visible sparks but one scarcely knew master benefortes spells were there flowing as much as possible with nature not wrestling against it you see if a corpse is preserved unshriven and unburied the newriven spirit can be harnessed to the will of a master did lord ferrante seek a new spirit ring a murdered master mage must be a fount of great power the ironic symmetry must appeal to lord ferrante to compel the man whod destroyed his ring to become its replacement and if ferrante had ransacked their house god knew what else hed found to rivet his powerhungry attention she turned the days over in her mind a night and a day for the losimons to ride back with their injured to the castle and return the magic saltcellar to their master a day for the siegepreoccupied lord ferrante to awaken to the fact that theyd left a greater treasure of sorcery to rot in a field a day for them to return and find their prize gone a day to ask up and down the road after a conspicuous corpse she rubbed her aching temples surely her fears for her father should have ended with his death the dead were supposed to be beyond pain healed and comforted in the bosom of lord jesus and the saints that first night mixed with her grief shed felt a curious lightness to her spirit as if an unrealized weight had been removed from her shoulders as if her world had suddenly enlarged a vast vacated space above her freed to grow into her life become unexpectedly her own to choose and order her heart had pulsed with a subdued joy even while her throat choked on sobs surely that joy was a great sin she should feel only grief and fear of the world with her protector removed only grief not resentment now master benefortes troubles flapped back in to settle on her life like a great flock of carrion crows weighing her back down its not fair youre dead i should be free of you now not death but eternal damnation loomed and the danger of a black magic far beyond her depth what can i do im only halftrained you yourself neglected to train me its your fault dont even know where to begin im only a puny girl tomorrow she would attach herself to the servants of the montefoglians and run away to the north let the big stupid swiss go in any direction he chose but the one she took let him lumber into the nearest ditch for all she cared she never wanted to see him again nor montefoglia nor her house nor her own little bedroom warm and cozy shivering her nose clogged with unshed tears she rolled up in the blanket and buried her face as best she could in the thin pillow her spinning thoughts bogged at last in sleep fiametta woke out of a troubled dream of wandering in a strangely labyrinthine version of their house in montefoglia the place was deserted in ruins boards of the gallery rotting treacherously underfoot shutters hanging halfoff walls crumbling shed been trying to light a fire but couldnt and armed creditors banged at the door calling for payments master beneforte had hidden and fiametta could not find though she searched frantically from room to room her pillow was damp and cold and her blanket wet with dew over the inner pocket warmed by her body the waning moon was at zenith casting its sickly insufficient light down into the inn yard still drenched with the unease of her dream she rolled over and peered through the railing slats glancing along the outer wall of the compound no menacing mens shapes moved atop it the wide night sky swallowed sound only her fears drained the scene of peace though the line of hipshot sleepy mules radiated a comforting animal warmth yet something was subtly wrong she stared into the darkness for a full minute before she realized what the last trailing smoke from the smokehouse was curling down not up collecting in a pool like a misted pond in the middle of the inn yard thickening contracting the formless seeking substance her heart lumped against her ribs she caught her breath she scrambled onto her knees careless of the cold and pressed her face to the slats the silvergray smoke coalesced to manform legs in hose a pleated tunic a big cloth hat wound round like a turban with a jaunty fall of smokefabric to the side the hat tilted upward toward fiametta on the loggia a faint smoke beard curled beneath the brim moonlight picked out a gleam like the edging of silver on a high cloud from smoky eyes papa fiametta whispered the word stuck in her throat she swallowed the figure beckoned to her with palpable effort smoke wisping off its arm as it moved the knot in her belly dissolved in a strange cockeyed pleasure im glad to see you werent ghosts supposed to be fearful manifestations instilling terror but master beneforte looked so himself impatient and annoyed as ever she could almost hear his voice ordering her about threatening to beat her for clumsiness or delay a threat he almost never carried out except when he was seriously short of money and on those days shed learned to be careful the translucent figure beckoned again fiametta swarmed over the railing hung from the porchs edge by her hands and dropped into the inn yard she ran to the apparition then stopped longing yet afraid to touch it clearly he was holding the smoke together with great difficulty she could see it in his expression that familiar tense absorption that transformed his face when he worked his subtler spells his gray hands opened to her and he mouthed words papa i cant hear you he shook his head mouthed more nothing he pointed south what are you trying to tell me she danced from foot to foot mirroring his frustration idiot child he mouthed that one she could make out through long familiarity but what followed was too rapid and complex her hands clenched like his picos younger son wakened by her voice sat up rubbed his eyes and peered at the smokeman over a packsaddle he yelled in fright dove for his fathers bedroll and burrowed under waking packmaster pico with a floundering snort openmouthed pico drew his blanket up over his boy all the way to his own chin thur dressed still in his same tunic and leggings sat up then stood staring picos older boy tich snored on oblivious thur took a deep breath and trod warily toward her he came up beside her rather paler even than his usual whiteness and looked back and forth between her face and the moongray one is it your father madonna beneforte whats he saying the hazy figure agonized was beginning to shred away in the night wind his dissolving arms reached for her and she for him then the smoke abruptly contracted to a white sphere the size of a french tennis ball it exploded outward again with a single word monreale the word and the smoke both passed away down a puff of breeze and the inn yard was empty once more monreale said thur blankly what does he mean monreale fiercely fiametta stamped her foot of course monreale hell know what to do hell know how to rescue papa if anyone does except she faltered if those gossipy maids speak truth hes on the wrong side of a besieged wall the swiss nodded solemnly as if he failed to grasp this was not just an interesting fact but a fatal flaw a wall surrounded by ferrantes soldiers fiametta amplified im starting to dislike ferrantes soldiers he remarked mildly im sure theyll be quite alarmed by that news fiametta snapped no doubt theyll run away and let us right through he smiled in embarrassment palms out well figure out something first we have to get there or i have to get there anyway dont you think youd be better off and safer going north with those other montefoglians tomorrow you arent going to dump me in a ditch she cried outraged he took a step backward making little negative naps with his big hands this is my business i just might might let you come with me is all thank you madonna he said earnestly fiamettas lip curled in suspicion dont you dare mock me he opened his mouth closed it then settled on that same safely stupid friendly smile hed favored her with when shed threatened him with the chamber pot she realized she was shivering violently her thin linen rippling in the night breeze the maids in the loggia were awake crying and praying an uproar almost equal to the one following cattis stabbing spread from them through the inn till threefourths of its occupants were roused by the time the story of the ghostly apparition had been told and retold by those whod seen to those who hadnt gaining drama madonna catti was in despair this will ruin my business i doubt hell be back said fiametta through her teeth ill call for the priest and get my smokehouse exorcised what that same priest you couldnt afford to have bury him the two women exchanged tightlipped frowns the maids babbled hysterical nonsense tich was loudly irate that no one had wakened him to see the show fiametta went back to her cold bedroll and pulled the pillow over her head no one dared approach her the interminable night gave way at last to a foggy pinkishorange dawn fiamettas head throbbed vilely her mouth felt full of fustian and her eyelids scratched like sand she dragged on her ruined velvet overdress she wanted nothing more than to be gone from this place the sooner the better at least thur made no demur or delay dressed already he had his bedding rolled and packed within a minute of his rising out of it they sat on the benches in the tap room and washed down a breakfast of dry bread with ale catching the white horse from the pasture proved to be the greatest obstacle to their quick start the innkeepers wife after watching them lunge through the dewwet grass after it for several minutes shook her head and came out with a basin of oats to entice it and bridled it herself she handed the reins to thur who handed them to fiametta cant you ride a horse fiametta demanded of her wouldbe cavalier he shook his head my mother only kept a few goats we couldnt afford a cow still less a horse he added after an uneasy moment i could lead you on it though like the mules well all right fiametta said doubtfully she stood beside the animal her nose level with its withers lead it to the fence and ill climb on oh thats easy said thur he picked her up around the waist and popped her aboard as if shed been a threeyearold at her outraged look he added apologetically youre much lighter than an ox hide full of rocks madonna beneforte she wrestled her skirts around her legs wedged thurs pack in front of her took up a handful of long greasy mane swallowed and nodded lead on then the white horse was loathe to leave the green pasture but once out on the road seemed to become reconciled to its fate and plodded on beside the swiss madonna catti watched them out of sight as if to make certain they and their bad luck were really departing the early morning light was level and golden setting the lingering wisps of mist ablaze in the meadows casting knifedark shadows across their feet from the poplar and cypress trees along the road the damp warming air was redolent with spring flowers and with the green scent of the little rocky streams that crossed the road as it dipped into shaded dells then climbed again the sun and the horses warm back began to drive the nights chill from fiamettas bones if she werent so tired and aching the ride would have been pleasant thur strode along easily beside the horse petting it encouragingly on the neck now and then he at least seemed no worse worn for the nights disruptions he glanced over his shoulder at fiametta as they crested a little hill your father said monreale you called him the abbotis he the same as the bishop monreale my brother mentioned sometimes in his letters yes theres only one of him except unlike the roman bishops he actually serves both of the benefices he holds papa says said abbot monreales father was a savoyard nobleman who married a lombard lady monreale was a younger son so he went off to seek his fortune as a captain in the armies of france back when they drove the english from bordeaux your brother uri used to like to get him to talk about it and it was never too hard to persuade him to reminisce though he pretends to be ashamed of it now monreale kept trying to persuade uri that hed be better off turning monk himself and serving god instead of duke sandrino it got to be a kind of running joke between them except that it wasnt quite a joke fiametta bit her lip it was no joke now that was certain papa and the abbot were gossips somewhat at first because of their being the two best magicians in montefoglia i suppose and papa of course had to stay on monreales good side to get his ecclesiastical license from monreale as bishop but i think they really liked each other when monreale came to town to the cathedral to tend to the affairs of the diocese they would sometimes sit in our courtyard and drink wine and talk and sometimes they would go fishing together on the lake papa was more practical wanting to master material magic monreale was more interested in the theory of sorcery with an eye to his spiritual duties about it i suppose sometimes papa would go to him for ideas when he was stuck working out a new spell monreale must know about spiritmagic hed have to study it to fight it at least spiritmagic black necromancy she described the silver putti ring lord ferrante had worn the casket with the saltshrivelled baby and the connection master beneforte had feared found and severed between the two thats a level of sorcery over my head im afraid said thur humbly yes i can see that fiametta sighed but to be fair was compelled to add over my head too but not over monreales nor master benefortesthere could be no concealments now though fiametta was nearcertain her father had never confessed his experiment in florence to the abbotandbishop if fiamettas vague understanding was correct her fathers spirit dangled now over damnation on lord ferrantes string his soul risked being cut off from god even at this late hour i hope abbot monreale is not too busy with the siege to attend to one poor lost spirit thur frowned thoughtfully down the winding road if lord ferrante succeeds in compelling your fathers ghost to serve his will and if this spiritmagic is as strong as you think it would put all those people monreale is trying to protect into greater danger your fathers fate is near the center of his troubles hell attend determination stiffened his face all i have to do is get you there right fiametta hung on tightly as thur and the horse picked their way across a rocky brook at the bottom of the hill the hazard cleared she asked what is your magic thur your brother must suspect you of some talent or he wouldnt have sought to apprentice you to a mage thurs mouth screwed up in uncertainty im not sure ive never been tested by a real master i can find water with the dowsingstick and i have a knack for finding things mother says i once found a little girl the millwrights daughter helga who was lost in a snowstorm but we were all out searching so maybe i was just lucky and ive long thought he cleared his throat as if embarrassed thought i could sense the metal ore in the rocks but i was always afraid to speak for if i was wrong the men would have been very angry with me a false stringer is the devil to work he hesitated then added shyly i saw a kobold once not long ago he seemed about to add more twisting the lion ring around his finger but then shook his head and you madonna beneforte you must be skilled her brow puckered she should be skilled yes but im very good with fires she offered at last even papa has me light his and my latin pronunciation is good papa sayssaid she brightened in memory the best thing i got to work on so far was papa let me help cast a spell for fertility for madonna tura the silkmerchants wife shed had no children though shed been married for four years the spell required a balance of male and female elements you see we made it in the form of a belt of little silver rabbits he let me design and shape the rabbits all different i got to keep two real rabbits for models white french lorenzo and cecelia they had baby bunnies which i adoredthey were so softit was part of the spell but then they had more baby bunnies and they kept digging out of the run in the back garden and they ate all of rubertas herbs and left rabbit droppings all over the house which papa made me clean up so when the spell was finished papa said we had to eat all the rabbits i suppose thirtysix of them really were too many but i didnt forgive ruberta our cook for weeks rabbit stew rabbit ravioli rabbit sausage i went hungry she said virtuously but then rather spoiled the impassioned account of her pets martyrdom by adding except i helped eat lorenzo because he always bit me she frowned at thurs grin which immediately muffled itself i sneaked cecelia out and let her go at the edge of town and did it work thur inquired as she fell silent what oh the spell yes madonna tura was delivered of a boy just last month i hope theyre all right a silkmerchants shop would be a likely target for looters but perhaps madonna tura had escaped to other relatives he held up the lion ring to the sunlight and wriggled his fingers to make it sparkle and is this a magic ring madonna his words gave her a chill nearly identical as they were to those of hisdeadbrother itas supposed to be but it didnt work so i just wore it as jewelry she glanced down at him warily but he merely remarked its very beautiful she had been surviving hour to hour not looking ahead as a result here she was alone in the wilderness or at least passing through somebodys woodlot with almostastrange man a week ago she would have thought it terribly compromising those careful social safeguards seemed flimsy and false as a stagesetting now yet what fate was she riding toward her marriage portion was supposed to have come from the great bronze perseus which master beneforte had not lived to cast nor duke sandrino to reward him for she would inherit the house presumably though it was surely stripped by now unless papas creditors sued for it and wrested it from her and divided the money among themselves leaving her destitute worse had happened to unprotected widows and orphans in the courts of law that free future she faced was a frightening thing without money a rich young woman had a control over her life equal only to her control over her funds a poor young woman the same only different but if lord ferrantes conquest of montefoglia succeeded all hope was futile only if ferrante fell did she have a chance of regaining any of her inheritance she watched thur marching along his hair gleamed brighter than the lion ring as they emerged from the insecthumming woods into the sun again she felt a flash of guilt for worrying about money when his brother uris fate was still uncertain was it really so uncertain as she had made out in her anxiety to soften the news the thrust had looked mortal enough at least the uncertainty had them both heading in the same direction if hed known his brother was dead what reason would he have had to accompany her she scarcely believed her rings testimony how can you be my true love you dont even know me you must be dazzled by some magic illusion of me and when you find out what im really like youll hate me her eyes blurred with tears idiot child stop your blubbering she thought sternly to herself late in the morning they came to the meadow and coppice where master beneforte had been murdered or died the horse ate grass while thur rested his legs and fiametta walked about but she gained no sense of papas presence here now the meadow seemed only innocent and beautiful in the daylight they went on thur told her a little about his own life as he walked through the warming noon there didnt seem to be that much to tell though clearly thur was not naturally voluble hed had some schooling with the village priestfiametta was relieved to learn he could at least read and write a younger sister had died of plague possibly judging from the dates in the same bad years outbreak that had carried off fiamettas mother his fathers death in the mines had cut short his schooling and sent thur to hard work in the valley and his brother uri off to the more glamorous life of a mercenary the mines sounded tremendously tedious shed never guessed so many mens hands so many steps so many trees burnt were required to bring the little shining bars of metal to their final destiny in her fathers workshop thur had never seen a citynever been out of the valley of bruinwald before he seemed astonished and awed to learn that shed lived in both rome and venice he stared around at the rolling hills and ordinary little farms as if they were wonders for practical purposes the man was a babe fiametta realized with dismay uri had made an excellent perseus she studied thur wondering what statue hed make a model for she couldnt think of a matching greek hero ajax was too warlike ulysses too crafty hercules maybe too dim hector had been a solid family fellow unlucky in his brother hat would be a bad omen considering hectors unfortunate end some northern hero then roland or a knight of arthurs a biblical figure a saint no that would be even more bizarre somehow thur resisted the heroic mold fiametta sighed in the early afternoon the valley broadened and they neared the northern end of the lake and the village of cecchino thur declared himself willing and able to push on fiametta was reluctant to stop at the village lest she be recognized though at this point she had little left to steal and no reason to think any ranging bravo or anybody else would have an interest in her beyond the usual idle malice fiametta held the horses reins and let it graze out of sight from the road while thur went into the village to buy food he came back with cheese bread new radishes boiled eggs and wine it was almost like a picnic in better times he encouraged her to eat up and in truth she did feel better afterwards but sleepiness lost to anxiety and they took to the road again soon after their meal as evening came on they were still six or seven miles short of saint jerome they stopped to nibble the remains of their food and shared the last of the watered wine it must grow more dangerous from here on fiametta said doubtfully as the shadows deepened lord ferrantes sure to have a guard posted on the road somewhere between here and the monastery yet his men were spread thin you thought he only had fifty to start with he may have called more horsemen from losimo but his main body of foot soldiers cant possibly have arrived yet and hell have to keep some in the town it sounds like tonight is the best time for us to try to get to the monastery then if we cant see them they cant see us i dont know theres a little postern door in saint jeromes east wall near to the woods i think its our best chance the main gate will be better watched we can circle around through the sheep pasture and the vineyards lead on then yes but i dont know how soon to get off the road the later the better but thur sniffed the air not yet i think i smell no campfires oh they trudged wearily onward the lake was a darkening gulf beyond the trees on their right the little farmsteads to their left were shut up dark and eerily silent frogs croaked in the reedy margins of the lake the cooling air grew clammy with the moisture from the water the old horse was getting balky and stiff and thur had to practically tow it fiametta dismounted and walked her own legs aching this trip had certainly been easier by boat she sniffed experimentally from time to time she and thur stopped short at the same moment roast mutton thur whispered south upwind yes i smell it too she hesitated that fieldstone wall up ahead is the monasterys outlying sheep pasture were almost there but how are we going to sneak this stupid great horse through the woods leave it in the pasture thur suggested itll be happier there i dont think anyone in their right mind would steal it to ride and the soldiers arent likely to eat it till they run out of sheep thur was perhaps as tired of dragging the beast as it was of being dragged but the idea seemed practical as any senses straining fiametta led them off the road to a low place shaded by oaks thur made the waisthigh wall lower by quietly removing the top couple of courses of stone at last they were able to coax the reluctant horse to step over fiametta removed its bridle and stuffed it into thurs pack which he shrugged onto his shoulders the horse wandered off sniffing suspiciously at the sheepcropped grass fiametta felt much less conspicuous keeping low beyond the wall she led thur up the hill and around the vast pasture peering over the stones thur pointed silently to a dell on the far side the orange glow of a fire reflected up from it mens shadows moved and voices drifted downwind with the smoke some of ferrantes men were at a late supper of stolen holy mutton with only a few clinks fiametta and thur climbed over the next wall and took to the concealing rows of the vineyard beyond the long vineyard carried them in turn to the woods which fiametta skirted to the east above the slope their cautious footsteps pushing through the weeds sounded like scythes to her ears at last she calculated it was time to drop down through the trees hopefully to emerge by saint jeromes back door she peered into the dark leafy shadows with deep unease there must be more guards concentrated nearer the monasterys wall thur after several tries on deadfall branches picked up a stout stick with enough sap left in it to lend toughness oh mary why didnt run away north while i still could holding thurs other hand fiametta slipped with him into the woods chapter seven they were doing well till they fell over the sleeping guard the man was lying on the ground with a gray blanket wrapped around him and in the dim moonlight and shadows looked much like a fallen tree trunk he was positioned in just the lookout spot for which fiametta naturally headed a hollow at the edge of the woods with a clear view of the cut field behind the postern gate two lanterns burned brightly on the stone wall above the little door casting a pool of illumination on the green grass clearly the entry was guarded by men wary of night attack fiametta was so fixed on her goal which was so near so hopeful so thankgod easily found she was already in her mind running across the greensward she didnt even look down till the log she stepped up on for a better view sank squishily convulsed and lumbered up cursing she fell back with a squeak of fear the ominous scrape of sword steel drawn from a scabbard skirled painfully in her ears images of the banquet massacre flooded her mind shining metal piercing flesh thur dropped his pack and stepped between fiametta and the swordsman his grip tightening on the log in his right hand the swordsman yelled losimo losimo at the top of his lungs and swung a powerful blow at thurs neck thur caught the blade in the log it stuck and he wrenched the sword almost from the mans hand then the halfcloven wood broke thur leapt within the swords arc to grapple with the man his hands clamping around the sword wrist the guard kept yelling he must have comrades nearby thur fighting silently tried to butt the losimons mouth with his forehead as the two men wrestled grunting for advantage another guard came running from a concealed position at the woods edge several hundred yards to the south he carried a crossbow cranking it as he ran the rachet clattered like bones he stopped at nearpointblank range and loaded it with a heavy short bolt that glittered in the moonlight raising the crossbow to aim at thur he hesitated for a line of flight that would not risk his comrade thur at fiamettas scream of warning saw the crossbow and wrenched the swordsman around between them the crossbowman was a hairy fellow with a bushy scalp and a thick curling black beard his teeth gleamed in the midst of the thatch as he grimaced for his aim the only thing fiametta could think to do was set his beard afire as he circled the wrestlers to regain his shot fiametta began to muster the oftpracticed domestic spell her eyes squeezed to slits and her hands clenching in concentration against her terror her fathers voice whispered in her ear no fiametta tis star her mouth fell open and she whirled but saw nothing no smokeform out of the ground in front of the crossbowman dirt and dust and leaf litter and little sticks arose and became the figure of a man a whirl of detritus and decayed beech mast formed legs pleated tunic a big cloth hatpapal with an astonished yelp the crossbowman fell back a pace his trigger released and his deadly bolt flew wide into the woods with a crackling pop of wrist bones thurs grip shook the sword from the swordsmans grasp the swordsman screamed in pain the crossbowman howled as the leaffigure dissolved into a cyclone that whirled around his head casting dirt into his eyes and sticks into his beard thur stooped to grab up the dropped sword and sprang back shoving his man away the swiss whipped the sword around in a wild figure eight inexpert but menacing in its momentum the crossbowman clutched at his eyes run master benefortes voice came out of nowhere fiametta darted forward grabbed thurs free hand and yanked run for the gate gasping for breath he nodded they bounded out of the hollow his long legs soon had the advantage of her and she leapt into the air at each stride and let him pull her along her shoulder blades cringed with the expectation of the thunk of a crossbow bolt heavy steel shattering ribs biting deep into her lungsit seemed to take forever to reach the postern door floating in its pool of light like a receding mirage fiametta fell on it pounding and wheezing help but her words seemea a whisper and her blows weak as a babes thurs pounding made the oak shake on its hidden iron hinges help he did not disdain to bellow who goes there came a mans growl from overhead fiametta fell back and craned her neck upwards but could only make out blurred dark heads one tonsured one helmeted against the bright lantern light help sanctuary for the love of god we must see abbot monreale the helmeted head craned outward in turn why i know the girl its the dukes goldsmiths daughter i dont know the man though his name is thur ochs brother of your swiss captain fiametta called back urgently hes come to seek his wounded brother oh let us in hurry theyll be after us we are forbidden by the abbot to open the door said the tonsured head then let down a rope said thur in what started out as a reasonable tone that rose to a yelp on the word rope as a crossbow bolt whanged off the stone a yard from him and ricocheted into the dark they made beautifully illuminated targets thur stepped between fiametta and the night we could at least let the girl in said the helmeted head sinful to have her in here better the man bah your hospice is full of crying women right now brother dont quibble dont delay shrieked fiametta as another metal bolt whacked into the oaken door and stuck there vibrating with a deep bass hum a knotted rope came curling down at last thur boosted her halfway up it indeed her puny girl arms could scarcely lift her own weight but she must climb quickly so he could climb in turn skin scraped from her palms but she flung herself over the top of the wall on her stomach and rolled across in an awkward bundle of skirts hurry thur the soldier and the monk were standing on a mere wooden platform none too solid hastily raised to overlook the postern door the helmeted soldier peered into the night raised his own crossbow and with a curse fired a quarrel in return for one that hummed close over his head maybe that will keep the bastards heads down he growled ducking below the stone thur rolled in turn over the top of the wall and fell to the platform making it shake the monk yanked the rope up handoverhand the soldier peeked back over the wall just the top of his helmet and his eyes exposed fiametta searched thur in panicky haste for blood but none gouted from his back or anywhere else the crossbowmans eyes must still be halfblinded with dirt judging from the force of his quarrels flight hed followed them close to the wall i must see the abbot fiametta panted to the crouched monk its an emergency the soldier snorted gods bones thats the truth the monk frowned just because were granted dispensation from our rules of silence doesnt mean were free to use displeasing language in the cloisters i never took a vow of silence the monk grimaced it was evidently an ongoing argument he turned to thur what does she want to see the abbot for its my father fiametta answered him im afraid hes in terrible danger spiritual danger we witnessed lord ferrante using black magic the soldier crossed himself the monk looked disturbed well tell her to follow me he said to thur he climbed down the platforms triangular braces into the yard below which proved to be the monasterys cemetery why dont you tell her should i come too asked thur sounding confused yes yes said the monk impatiently hes trying not to speak to a woman fiametta whispered in explanation oh thur blinked doesnt he trust his abbots dispensation fiametta smiled sourly down on the shaved scalp perhaps hes a disobedient monk in his heart the monk looked up and shot her an outright glare but then looked doubly unsettled they both followed him thur first helping her jump down safely the last few feet the monk silent again beckoned them through another gate to a corridor through an even darker room and out into a cloistercourtyard he led them up steps to a gallery and knocked on a door after a moment another monk opened it and stuck his head out orange candlelight flowed from the gap fiametta was relieved to recognize abbot monreale s secretary brother ambrose a big man with a kindness for cats rabbits and other small animals whom she had met several times in the abbotandbishops company old habits dying hard their guide monk pointed silently to thur and fiametta fiametta beneforte the secretary said in surprise where did you come from oh brother ambrose help me fiametta said i must see abbot monreale come in come inthank you brother he dismissed their reticent guide you may return to your post he ushered them into a small chamber the abbots study or office it was furnished with a scriptoriumstyle desk with a brace of beeswax candles casting light across a paper and quill the secretary had apparently just put down another candelabrum burned brightly on a tiny altar below a small carved wooden crucifix hanging on the opposite wall abbot monreale got up from his knees in front of it as they entered he was dressed now in the gray habit of his brothers the cowl pushed back only his belt with its keys marking his rank his craggy face looked weary and worried tonsured hair made a gray fringe around his scalp that almost exactly matched his garment the robes made him look bulkier than he was his body was burned lean with years of ascetic moderation as he turned to them his gray brows shot up in surprise fiametta you escaped im glad you are unharmed he came toward her with a warm smile and took her hands she curtsied and kissed his bishops ring is your father with you i could use him now oh father she began then her face crumpled with exhausted tears it was the sudden sense of safety in monreales presence that unstrung her shed done all right in the woods hes dead she gulped monreale looking shocked led her over to sit on a bench against the wall he glanced curiously at thur and gestured him to sit also what happened child fiametta sniffled and regained control of her voice we got out of the castle before you i think yes we fled in a boat papa became very ill suddenly i think it was a sickness of his heart brought on by the banquet and the running and the terror monreale nodded understanding though not a healer himself as the regulating supervisor of montefoglias healers he was well experienced in both the physical and the spiritual infirmities of men papa bought a horse in cecchino and we rode on it into the night but some soldiers lord ferrante dispatched overtook us on the road papa fought them while i hid i found him in the field dead unwoundedi think his heart burst theyd stripped him i took his body to an inn where thur found meoh ask after your brother thur this is the younger brother of captain ochs fiametta explained hastily he was on his way to montefoglia andask thur hers was not the only mortal anxiety here though the swiss had been more patient have you seen my brother holy father thur asked his voice was steady though his hands fiddled with the lion ring is he here monreale turned his whole attention on thur im sorry son i saw your brother fall but he was not among those we carried away i thought it was a fatal blow he took but i was hurried off just then and cant swear to his last breath im afraid i cant counsel you much hope for his life though you must hope for soulhe was a very honorable manif thats a help to you but its barely possible he may still lie with other wounded in the castle his body was not returned with the others during yesterdays parley i in truth i have not heard theres been much to occupy me thats all right said thur he looked a little numb hed expected to be freed of his fears one way or another now it seemed he would be forced to bear them further his shoulders bent and his right thumb absently stroked the ring monreale studied him thoughtfully parley said fiametta whats going on ah well duke sandrinos remaining guards surrounded us myself and lord ascanio we fled through the gate though in hindsight i think we should have stood and fought them there speaking militarily we fought rearguard through the town and retreated to saint jerome a multitude of refugees have sought sanctuary here since were very crowded he shook his head so much bloodshed so sudden like a judgment i must stop it before it spreads like a plague from man to man all over montefoglia what are you doing now lord ferrante also seeks to stop this unlookedfor war he sent to treat with me as de facto chancellor to poor little ascanio the lads asleep in my room right now a truce with lord ferrante fiametta repeated appalled i must consider it were not in a good position here the dukes guards were a match for losimo when sandrino led them but now theyre scattered demoralized separated from their commanders cant you send for helpsomewhere monreales lips thinned bleakly that is precisely the problem for years duke sandrino walked a very careful line between milan and venice call either of them in now to an unmanned dukedom and gobble snap montefoglia would be eaten in a trice call in the other to eject the first and montefoglia becomes a battlefield would lord ferrante really attack the monastery said thur sounding shocked how could he get away with such a deed abbot monreale shrugged easily monasteries have been razed before by violent men and if he succeededwhos to punish him if he establishes his rule in montefoglia and losimo hell be too strong to readily dislodge except by either venice or milan who would then keep montefoglia for themselveswhat gain to lord ascanio in that what about papal troops said fiametta seizing on a hope too far away even if the gonfalonier would dispatch them involved as he is now with the troubles in the romagna but the duchess letitia is the granddaughter of a pope wrong pope sighed monreale perhaps at the next election her familys star will rise again but not under his present holinesss rule the curia will be swayed by arguments of order over right why should they spend troops to restore a weak woman and child to me duchy when if they do nothing a strong experienced man whos a known guelf will assume the government is that your decision too fiametta demanded hotly order over right its practical politics child i dont know if i can save ascanios dukedom but i think i can save his life ferrante treats to send ascanio his mother and sister to exile in savoy with a stipend in exchange for peace its more than a minimal offer in the circumstances almost generous monreale looked like a man biting a lemon compelled by courtesy to pretend it sweet no that gives ferrante everything fiametta cried outraged abbot monreale frowned at this outburst shall i fight to the lastmonk im sorry fiametta but most of my brothers are not ready for such a contest i would not hesitate to urge the least of them to martyrdom for the sake of the faith but to sacrifice them to wrath serves no holy purpose i cede ferrante nothing he could notall too readilytake for himself but lord ferrante murdered the duke you cant expect an ordinary man to not defend himself when duke sandrino attacked him ferrante could not help but draw in return father i witnessed it duke sandrino flung only words if bitter ones lord ferrante drew first and stabbed him outright abbot monreales attention was arrested that was not the story i was told by ferrantes emissary lady pia was with me we both saw ask her if you dont believe me shes not here as far as i know both she and the castellan were taken prisoners along with the duchess and lady julia monreale rubbed his neck as if it ached walked to the casement window and stared into the dark i dont disbelieve you child but it makes little practical difference the troops from losimo are on the march and once they arrive our defying ferrante will only make the final outcome worse ive seen sieges and what they do to men but lord ferrante used black magic didnt you see the dead baby at the banquet didnt i see what monreale pacing jerked around as if waspstung the baby in the box ferrantes footstool that broke open when uri kicked it off the dais just before he was stabbed she tried to cudgel up a precise memory of that chaotic moment monreale had been beyond the upturned table managing ascanio his crozier and a flurry of assailants and helpers seeking an exit while retreating over the far side of the platform i saw the footstool i didnt see it break open i saw it spilled right across my feet my skirt was caught under the tables edge the footstool was full of rock salt and this horrible driedup shrivelled infant papa said its spirit was enslaved to that ugly silver putti ring ferrante wore on his right hand didnt you sense anything ferrante used the ring to blind a man and he tried to use it on papa but papa didsomethingand the ring burned ferrante instead papa said he released the babys spirit but i dont know how abbot monreale turned agitated to his secretary brother ambrose did you see i was on the other side of you holy father a losimon was trying to hack off your head with his sword and i was fending him off with a chair sorry dont apologize monreale paced the ring the ring of course damni mean god bless me thats what it was then you did sense something fiametta was relieved yes but i should have sensed much more what can ferrante have done to conceal he headed for his massive bookcase as if drawn by a string then turned back shaking his head later i wish your papa were here now fiametta what did you see in that ring father it appeared to embody a simple spell to ward off lice and fleas of the sort anyone might carry in an amulet bag in his pocket i thought it an odd vanity to cast such a humble thing in silver it felt wrong thoughi thought it poorly cast but if the verminwarding spell was masking another a spell to ward off attention then beneath that he hissed through his teeth looking sick what did you sense in it child ugliness from the mouths of babes you humble me he smiled sadly but then you are your fathers daughter thats what i was starting to tell you lord ferrantes men came back to the inn where id sought help with papas body quickly fiametta described her unpleasant adventures with innkeeper catti his greed and his smokehouse the bravos bizarre theft and the manifestations of master beneforte in smoke and dried leaves thur confirmed the details of their journey much more hesitantly fiametta repeated what master beneforte had confided to her of his previous experience with spirit rings though she concealed the names of lord lorenzo and florence the medici must be responsible for his own confession she explained her sharp fear that lord ferrante meant master benefortes ghost for his new and more powerful slave abbot monreales shoulders sagged as her story piled up papa called for you fiametta finished he cried out for help from you holy father what do we do next monreale sighed deeply just before you arrived child i was on my knees praying for guidance some sign that my decision to make this truce was correct thats the most frightening risk you take with prayer sometimes god answers he nodded wearily to his secretary tear up the treaty brother ambrose delicately the big monk picked up the paper on which hed been working when fiametta and thur had entered and tore it slowly in half he let the pieces drop to the floor his eyes met monreales in an affirmation tinged with fear so much for surrender holy father what do we do next monreale squeezed his eyes shut and rubbed his wrinkled brow temporize brother return soft answers and temporize he looked up at thur and fiametta take these exhausted youngsters to the hospice betimes im going to the chapel to meditate before lauds assuming weve anyone to spare to sing the night psalms he added under his breath at last i realize why the rule of our order puts so much emphasis on training monks to do without sleep his secretary murmured amen picked up a candle and gestured fiametta and thur out of the room ahead of him on the way to the hospice which was situated near the front gate they passed through a courtyard with a covered well even at this late hour past midnight two monks a soldier and a woman stood waiting to draw up water a monk had his hand on the crank but was not turning it how goes it brother asked brother ambrose in passing not good the monk at the crank replied its coming up muddy were waiting for it to settle between buckets but its taking longer and longer he began cranking at last and poured the well bucket out into vessels held by the soldier and the woman he let the rope down and began waiting again brother ambrose followed after the soldier a water shortage asked thur unless it rains and refills our cisterns said ambrose we normally house about seventy brothers now weve taken in some fifty or sixty of duke sandrinos guards many of them wounded their families others whove fled from the violence in townthere are over two hundred people packed in here right now the infirmary is overflowing abbot monreale is considering giving the hospice entirety over to the women and putting the wounded in the chapel if we get any more the waterlugging soldier turned aside as they passed the infirmary fiametta peeked after him through the door into a long stonearched dormitory straw pallets were set between woodenframed beds most occupied by blanketed forms in the dim light of a couple of oil lamps a mans open eyes glassy and feverish gleamed in his stubbled face a hooded monk moved among the beds toward the end of the row a man in pain moaned continuously like a cow lowing brother ambrose guided them through another door and into the area of the hospice proper ordinarily the only area of the monastery open to visitors he handed fiametta off to a tiredlooking older woman dressed in night robes with her gray hair in a braid down her back fiametta recognized her as a lay sister from the cathedral chapter in town ambrose took thur off with him through the visitors refectory toward the mens sleeping area thur glanced back uncertainly over his shoulder at her as he passed around the corner and waved a lefthanded goodbye the womens dormitory was another stonearched chamber similar to the infirmary but smaller and more crowded again its original beds were supplemented with woven straw pallets and even hastier piles of loose straw with blankets atop some twentyfive or thirty women and perhaps twice that number of children and young girls were bedded down every which way the older boys were presumably housed with the men fiametta picked her way past the strewn bodies through a door at the far end of the room to an overworked and odoriferous latrine she began to realize why the abbot considered holding out through a long siege even without having to repel attack by ferrantes infantry reinforcements a dubious proposition at best this time last night shed imagined that if only she could win through to monreale he would somehow fix everything and it seemed she wasnt the only montefoglian with that idea but now when she emerged from the latrine the lay sister guided her to a pile of loose straw already occupied by two sleeping girls fiametta peeled off her ruined shoes and flopped down between them it was bed enough for now chapter eight uri thur blinked open bleary eyes to see the dim vault of the mens dormitory ceiling and stretched himself on the thin bedding loose straw with a blanket thrown atop the evil dream from which hed wakened vanished away like mist even as he tried to remember it by the aching spots all over his body the straw had done little to protect him from the stone floor though to be fair most of the bruises had been administered by that terrifying losimon swordsman hed fought last night how much pain did uri far worse than bruised lie in right now in the prison of his enemies how much terror thur had straw and a blanket and freedom perhaps uri had only bare stone some men were up and moving some still slept beside thur a stubblefaced montefoglian guard smelling of several days dried sweat squeezed his eyes shut rolled over taking the blanket with him farted and started snoring again creakily thur rose and went to join the line for the latrine at least uris prison could scarcely be more crowded than this he had no problem getting dressed hed slept in his clothes his only clothes since hed lost all his possessions in the fight last night well he fit right in here among the possessionless monks even though his poverty was accidental rather than vowed he would dedicate his poverty to god like the brothers along with a prayer to please make it as brief as possible a monk in the refectory was portioning out brown bread ale and watered wine when thur entered the servings were not large it was good bread but under the circumstances thur hesitated to ask for more the ale was a blessing washing out his gummy nightdry mouth as soon as his voice was his own again thur began questioning men who looked like they might have known uri they welcomed him with interest for uris sake and told thur their own gruesome stories of fight and escape but none of them had any later sight or better guess of their swiss captains fate than had abbot monreale or fiametta the morbid uncertainty made thurs neck ache there were women in the refectory but fiametta was not among them their voices were subdued but for one sharp female whose complaints sounded with nasal clarity till she sat abruptly on the floor and started crying another woman led her away to their dormitory thur rubbed the lion ring and wondered if he might approach a woman to ask after fiametta but as he was working up his nerve brother ambrose appeared and touched him on the shoulder thur ochs abbot monreale would like to see you thur licked the last stray crumbs from his fingers drained his mug and returned it to the hosteller he followed brother ambrose the secretarymonk led him through a courtyard and corridors across the cloister and up first stone and then wooden stairs they came out on a flat roof above the office where thur had met the abbot last night the buttresses of the chapel arched just to the north a wooden dovecote occupied one end of the roof monreale his hood pushed back stood next to it brother ambrose paused signalling thur to wait a speckled gray dove fluttered uneasily on the abbots hand monreale seemed to be speaking to it he touched his lips to the birds head then held his hand aloft with a burbling coo and a thrumming of wings like a drumroll the dove climbed into the sky circled the chapel twice then flew away to the south thur and brother ambrose crunched across a light peppering of sundried guano toward the abbot who turned at the sound of their footsteps smiled briefly at them both and scanned the sky have any returned yet father brother ambrose asked deferentially monreale sighed and shook his head not one not one i fear for my flock ambrose nodded appreciation of the double meaning and they both gazed southward into the pale morning blue their hands shading their eyes with a downward fistclosing gesture monreale at last indicated an end to it and led them back down the stairs to his office and through another door into an adjoining chamber thur stared around in fascination the chamber was well lit from the north through large high windows and lined with chests and boxes for books shelves held a riot of brass ceramic and earthenware jars colored glass bottles and mysterious little boxes with labels in latin two big worktables stood one in the center of the room and one against a wall strewn with clutter and stacked with papers and wellused clothbound notebooks in one corner a narrow barrel held staves of various woods and snout up the long stiff form of a dried and mummified crocodile its leathery lips wrinkled back on a jaw halfemptied of teeth bags hung from the beams including one of red silk netting holding a delicate tangle of papery dried shed snakeskins a corner featured a plastered fireplace the beehive form of a small furnace just the size to fit in the fireplace sat cleaned and ready for use on the slate hearth brother ambrose took a round mirror the size of a platter framed in wood from a cupboard and set it on the center table beside it he placed a small round tambourine of stretched pale parchment monreale cleared away clutter and placed bunches of dried herbs at the cardinal points around the two objects murmuring under his breath in latin brother ambrose closed the window shutters making the plasterwalled room cool and dim ambrose gestured thur hanging back in a mixture of politeness and caution to step up to the table and watch but put a finger to his lips to enjoin silence from a little blue glass flask monreale let one drop of a clear fluid fall to the middle of the mirror it expanded in a bright blink to tile edges monreale blew on the surface and the mirror began to glow with a light that was no reflection of anything in the room thur craned his neck to see barely breathing a dizzy jerky whirl of colors danced in the glass thur squinted trying to make sense of what appeared at first to be yellow and orange confetti then he realized he was looking at tile roofslooking down from above upon a town the town turned in the mirror with the inhuman speed of a birds flight yellow stone and brick castle walls arced into view with a dipping swoop the view sped to the top of a castle tower men blessedly stopped for a moment thur engrossed swallowed a slight nausea he caught a jerky look down into a courtyard with an elaborate marble staircase then the towers twin was framed in the glass atop it two crossbowmen were cranking their winches and a thin dark cleanshaved man in a red robe leaned on the crenellated yellow brick and pointed thur had to quell a startled fear that they were looking straight at him the slight man shouted and the crossbowmen took aim and fired the view jerked turning again another crossbowman behind the bird on the first tower was much closer thur saw and heard his strings twang with the force of his quarrels release then the view in the mirror flared and went dark thur realized suddenly that the sound had actually come from the tambourine but somehow his mind had attached it to the images in the mirror monreale grunted like a man struck in the stomach no not another one groaned brother ambrose monreales fists clenched leaning on the tabletop his lips pinched on words that did not sound quite like prayers they were waiting they were set up and waiting he said angrily somehow they must be able to tell my birds from the others he turned and paced the room with an impatient stride tonight i shall try bats after all not even ferrante has a bowman so quick he can take a bat out of the air in the dark well see little ourselves in the dark said brother ambrose dubiously but hear better snores mostly mostly but if lord ferrante is indeed as far up to his neck in black magic as he is accused night in the castle may be a busier time than we think brother ambrose made a wry face crossed himself and nodded he went to open the shutters again abbot monreale straightened his sagging shoulders and turned to thur with a forced smile monreales face was pale and lined the skin beneath his eyes puffy with fatigue thur had slept on straw and stone and found it a penance he began to suspect monreale had not slept at all and decided not to complain about his bedding youve plunged me into a real dilemma boy you and fiametta monreale observed neither prayer nor reason have yet shown me the way out of it so i pray more and seek to give my poor weary reason some new premise to work upon but as you see my birds do not come back to me they are magic spies thur asked the mirror reflected only the beamed ceiling now they are supposed to be they seem to be meeting the fate of spies discovered certainly he rubbed the deep crease between his eyes ambrose did you recognize that man in the red robe on the tower no father did you no that is i feel i do but i cant put a name to him perhaps i met him in a crowd or long ago ah well it will come to me my poor doves monreale turned to thur i need a subtler spy a human one i need a volunteer someone whose face is not known in montefoglia thur glanced around the room no one here but himself and ambrose and somehow he didnt think the abbot was addressing ambrose you should know its dangerous my birds were not my only trial im missing a brother thur swallowed and spoke up with an effort that sounded unnaturally loud in the quiet chamber father so am i what do you want me to do monreale smiled and clapped thur on the shoulder well spoken bless you boy he cleared his throat its reported that lord ferrantes troops are combing montefoglia for metalworkers and ferrante has posted a reward for any foundry master who will come to him at once your brother talked of the mines and smelteries of bruinwald do you think you could pass yourself off as a foundryman a worker yes i dont think i could pass for long as a master a worker would do i want this to be as simple as possible all you need to do is gain entry to the castle as you move about whatever work you are assigned look for inconspicuous places to put some small objects i will give to you places where men stand to talkguardposts the dining hall if if you can get to the duke s study or whatever rooms lord ferrante now frequents that would be ideal if you can somehow smuggle one in to duchess letitia well its not likely that a foundry worker would be permitted in the prisoners tower but if you can do so what will these objects be father i must think on that and prepare them well let you down over the wall tonight under the cover of darkness and a spell i will devise once you are away from the monastery enemy troops should be few you can try to get into montefoglia when the city gates open at dawn why does lord ferrante want metalworkers i wish i knew maybe you can find out eh my best guess is that its to repair some of duke sandrinos cannon there was a cracked bombast that would make short work of poor saint jerome if it could be made sound again the lighter cannon are all with sandrinos bastards mercenary company in naples or they would be pounding us now who could have forseen what a bad time this would be to hire out the army theyre farther away than papal troops right now yet milan was at peace and venice too busy with the turks in the adriatic to threaten montefoglia this year and losimo was about to be united with ties of blood i should have monreale trailed off staring blindly into the infinite regret of the mighthavebeen ah well he shook off the blackness what have you to wear son thur turned his palms out just this i lost my pack last night outside the walls hm perhaps brother ambrose can help you find something less rural among the men here some clothes to help you look your part by the way monreale paused how did you come by that ring thur touched the little lion mask its not really mine father it belongs to madonna beneforte ah that explains a great deal monreale brightened prospero benefortes work is it i should have realized i urge you to leave it with fiametta its not the sort of thing a foundryman normally wears you should do nothing to bring extra attention to yourself you see i cant get it off father thur tugged at it by way of demonstration hm monreale took thurs left hand and bent over it peering the shaved part of his scalp around the edge of his tonsure was bristly with new growth but the center was naturally hairless smooth and shiny ah ha the true love spell of the master of cluny i wager he straightened smiling and its working oh said thur you must tell fiametta shell so pleased she thought her magic was a failure he paused true love spell what true love spell working how vague fear washed through him had his new longings been manipulated by magic that was an unsettling thought but no real panic came with the notion that fiametta might somehow be taken from him but she didnt belong to him his left hand clenched possessively fiametta cast this not master beneforte excuse me i must have a closer look he took thurs hand again but instead of peering shut his eyes tightly thurs brows wrinkled abbot monreale was silent for a long minute when he straightened again opening his eyes his expression was grave brother ambrose please fetch fiametta beneforte alone with thur monreale crossed his arms and leaned against his worktable he sucked thoughtfully on his lower lip gazed at his sandals then glanced keenly at the young man so how do you like the girl son i like her very well father thur replied sturdily at least i think i do i know i do but whats the ring doing to me to you the ring isnt doing anything to you you however are doing something to it completing it i suppose would be one way of putting it clunys spell is reputed to reveal true love but that is not perfectly accurate more precise to say it reveals a true heart he gave thur an odd smile above intent eyes thur breathed relief he was not enspelled well he hadnt really thought he was but are your intentions honorable asked monreale cluny is not always clear on that point my intentions thur repeated confused what intentions do you think of marriage or are you in danger of drifting into the sin of lust monreale clarified marriage the word had the weight of a rock hammer swung from behind meeting his head thur blinked himself a husband like like a grown man a dizzying gulf of maturity yawned before him quite unexpectedly but i dont father if all had been as it was as id been expecting when my brothers letter fetched me to montefoglia uri had arranged for me to be apprenticed to master beneforte you see as a poor apprentice i could not have hopednot for years and by then she would have been married off to some rich fellow arent we too far apart dare i think i could have her its true madonna beneforte needs someone thur trailed off his head whirling lust in marriage he could have all the lust he wanted presumably and be blessed for it given the death of her father fiametta needs someone very much said monreale she has no relatives here no woman should live alone with no master to her household particularly not a young woman and fiametta beneforte still less a situation fraught with danger there is a gap of rank between you true but the testimony of this ring is unusual what you are though is very young and poor to be thinking of setting up a household he hadnt been thinking of it till monreale brought it up yet not too young for me to send into a danger i fear could be monreale trailed off god help me that was intoned as a prayer his voice firmed its a rare and happy man son who ever finds his true vocation his true love or his true faith he nodded to the ring there is no evil in this for you footsteps sounded in the outer room and brother ambrose ducked into the inner chamber followed by fiametta her wildly curling hair was subdued this morning in a thick braid down her back it made her look serene older an effect slightly spoiled by a few stray wisps of straw sticking here and there to her filthy red velvet dress thur wanted her to look less tired and worried she had laughed once on the road yesterday at something thur had said he wanted her to laugh again her laughter had been like water on the hot day his distress for her weariness and worry became all mixed up in his head with a sudden picture of her laughing in a marriage bed her smooth brown limbs flashing in some froth of nightgown monreale composed his face into stern lines he pointed at the lion ring did you make this fiametta she glanced from monreales face to thurs and back again and said faintly yes father under your papas supervision she swallowed no father well yes and no monreales gray brows rose which yes or no no her sculptured chin lifted but he knew of it it seems to be a beneforte trait to dabble in questionable rings said monreale in a dry tone you know master beneforte had not licensed you as his apprentice ive been learning the jewelers craft for years you know that father monreale the metalwork is not my concern you knew i assisted him in his spells such assistance as was proper under a licensed mage this however is not a work of assistance neither is it the work of a clumsy amateur how came you to know so much i often assisted him father after a long expectant silence she added reluctantly i found the spell written out in one of papas books investing it in the ring was no problem i already knew the goldcasting part i just followed the directions very carefully there didnt seem to be much to it no flash i was disappointed at first because i didnt think it had worked because because uri didnt put it on i tried to give it to him ah said monreale in a professionally interested tone that he converted to a more neutral throatclearing noise but then i gradually realized that no one could put it on that soldier and the thieving innkeeper both tried hard to steal it for its gold but they couldnt she glanced covertly at thur um is it working father we will discuss that later so you read your papas books with his permission uh no fiametta that is the sin of disobedience no it wasnt he didnt forbid me that is i didnt ask but i found out later he was watching me all the time and he didnt stop me so thats almost like permission isnt it thur could have sworn that abbot monreale suppressed a smile at this sophistry but the flicker of expression in the stern visage was gone again almost at once master beneforte never applied to me for your license he was going to he was just so busy lately with the saltcellar and the perseus and all his other commissions im sure he was going to monreale raised his brows again all right fiametta sighed im not sure but we did talk about it i begged him to countless times father monreale i want to be a mage i can do good work i know i can better than teseo its not fair what it is not is properly approved said monreale not properly supervised ive seen souls lost to such hubris fiametta so approve me papas not here to ask for me i suppose i can ask for myself now who else i want to be good let me be monreale said mildly you ran ahead of me first comes contrition confession and penance then absolution i havent even finished my sermon on contrition yet fiamettas brown eyes heated with a sudden glimmer of anticipation at the leakage of humor and hope from behind monreales firm facade she straightened alertly almost bouncing oh get to my penance father quickly your penance will be to go to the altar of our lady in the chapel and pray on your knees for patience and obedience when you feel your prayer has been answered go eat your noon meal then come back to me here i urgently need a talented assistant in addition to brother ambrose who is as exhausted as myself i have a project to complete this afternoon before compline in magic youre going to let me help you her voice thrilled yes child she danced around him and hugged him hard habit and all he fended her off smiling despite himself you must truly compose your mind in prayer first remember demanding mother mary grant me patience and grant it right now wont do how do you know fiamettas eyes sparkled hm well you can try it i suppose who am i to say what the mother of god cant do in her infinite mercy the faster she speeds you to patience the sooner i can put you to work ah one other thing first im sending your friend thur here on an errand and i fear that big gold ring would be too conspicuous on his hand i can draw it off with a little spell but you can just draw it off but its stuck i saw it how can i draw it off if he cant put simply he doesnt want to but i really tried father thur said i know you did i will discuss the inner structure of the master of clunys spell with you in some less hurried time frowning in puzzlement fiametta turned to thur obediently he held out his hand her tapering brown fingers closed over the lion ring it returned to her palm as smoothly as if greased oh she said startled monreale handed her a long thong i suggest you keep it around your neck out of sight fiametta till you come to give it back he gave her an indecipherable look thurs finger felt empty light and cold without hisno herring he rubbed at the lonely spot already missing the reassurance that touching the lion had given him the shuffle of sandaled feet came from the outer room a monk knocked politely on the doorframe then stuck his head through father lord ferrantes herald is at the outer gate i come i come monreale waved him out thur i want you to rest in the afternoon ill send a brother to rouse you when its time fiametta ill see you here after the noon meal go along now he herded them ahead of him out through his office pausing to attend to something at the desk with brother ambrose thur followed fiametta down the stairs into the shade of the cloister walk around the courtyard a few doves paced solemnly about on the lawn in the sunlight pecking vainly for food bits in the grass stone benches lined the walkway between the arched stone pillars enticed thur sat down on one fiametta alighted on the other end her fingers touched the stiff new leather thong around her neck faltered to her lips then settled to the cool stone the sighing of wind in the nearby woods the low twitter and occasional liquid warble of birdsong and the muted voices from the monastery gave a temporary illusion of peace thur wished it were real the beauty of the day seemed a cruel hoax sweating grunting stupid menace of the sort hed wrestled last night patrolled right outside the stone walls he wanted to keep that menace far from fiametta fiametta was still brighteyed and bouncing reminding thur of the lid on his mothers kettle abbot monreale takes me seriously she chortled wants me to helpi wonder what with perhaps those scrying things said thur scrying things he wants me to disguise myself as a workman and take some scrying things into the castle at montefoglia and drop them here and there his spybirds arent getting through you see he wants you to go outside through the siege we got in through the siege all right just barely hes going to send me out after dark fiametta went very still thur imagined her about to say be careful in the tone of voice his mother used every day when he went off to the mine but instead she said slowly my fathers house is on the other end of town from the castle its not likely youd have a chance to get over there and see whats happened to it but if you can its the last house on via novara the big square one she paused again her voice at last growing worried abbot monreale doesnt want you to do anything very complicated does he no he looked away from her into the brightness out on the lawn a very young kitchen cat was stalking the doves it had big ears gray and black striped fur and somewhat outsized white paws its whiskers cocked forward and its eyes almost crossed with the intensity of its gaze it crouched hindquarters wriggling in earnest preparation marriage the heated softness of this girl all his to possess but what if surely abbot monreale would have said something if he blurted madonna beneforte youre not betrothed already are you she drew back and gave him an unsettled look no why do you ask no reason he gabbled good she said in a rather faint tone she rustled to her feet and retreated around the bench i must go to the chapel now goodbye she skittered away out the end of the cloister in the grass the cat pounced and missed the dove burst away in a flurry of wings the cat stared upward tail lashing and teeth chattering till all hope vanished over the rooftops the cat padded off stiffly embarrassed and came and plunked down by thurs feet it looked up at him and emitted a loud and piteous meow as if thur could produce flightless pigeons from his pockets on demand like a magician at a fair thur felt very far from being any kind of a magician at all right now he picked up the cat and scratched its ears what would you do if you caught it anyway catkin hm the bird is bigger than you are the cat purred ecstatically and butted its head against thurs hand there are birds in my mountains that would make a meal of you you must grow up some more thur sighed thur spent the rest of the morning offering minor assistances to the harried monks he cranked the well windlass carried water to the guards on the walls and helped set up the trestle tables for the noon meal and take them down again afterwards he thought he would be too tense to sleep but in deference to the abbot lay down on his straw bed anyway the dormitory was cool and quiet in the warm afternoon the next thing he knew a monk was shaking him awake from another sweaty dream he was just as thankful not to remember the last red rays of the sun touching the western hills fingered straightly through the window slits orange dust motes dancing in their beams after an evening meal consisting mainly of fried bread with a thin sprinkling of cheese and garlic brother ambrose led thur on to the laundry to try on some clothes they found a short padded tan jacket and real knitted hose dyed red that were large enough to fit the clothes were not new but had been washed fairly recently thur had never owned a pair of hose before only the biascut leggings his mother made loose for room to grow he stared down at his red thighs in unease feeling gaudy and exposed a round red cap topped it all they left the laundry and passed through the maze of the monastery brother ambrose paused when they came out in luminous twilight into a small courtyard at the foot of the chapels belltower a monk his robe tucked up into his belt and his white legs scrambling was clambering awkwardly down the thick ivy growing up the towers side he clutched a large linen bag in his teeth ambrose caught his breath as one sandaled foot slipped but the climbing monk caught himselfmand completed his descent safely gasping from his exertion the monk straightened his robe and thrust the lumpy bag at ambrose the lumps were moving heres your bag of bats now may i go eat thank you brother that wasnt so hard was it the monk shot him a look of unbrotherly unlove next time he wheezed you try it i was almost killed grabbing for them and two bit me he displayed minute wounds upon his fingers squeezing them for blood to prove his assertion sing the song you said and theyll fly right into the bag ha they did not you have to sing the spell with true loving kindness brother ambrose reproved for bats the monks lips screwed up in outrage for any of gods creatures right the monk sketched him a mocking salute im going to get my supperif theres any left before the abbot decides he wants a bucket of centipedes he marched away brother ambrose held the wriggling bag carefully and led on abbot monreales workroom was candlelit fiametta sat on an upturned barrel by the center table resting on her elbows thur regarded her anxiously she looked tired but not unhappy the abbot paced ah good he said as ambrose and thur entered thur i want you to look around the room and see if you notice anything new baffled but willing thur walked around the table the dried crocodile still grinned from its corner if monreale had moved his clutter about thur couldnt tell no father monreale smiled rather triumphantly at ambrose what was sitting on the table in front of fiametta dont look uh a tray and what was on the tray i i cant say good monreale passed his hand over thurs eyes thur immediately looked again arranged on the tray were a dozen tiny white parchment tambourines small enough to fit in a palm thur could have sworn they hadnt been there a moment ago did you make them invisible father thur picked one up and turned it over no i wish i could have or made them smaller or disguised them as some other common thing prospero beneforte would have thought of something cleverer im sure monreale sighed regret we ran out of time for experiment but at least they are very hard to notice nevertheless when you place them try to place them out of sight with nothing touching or damping the membrane they must be free to vibrate what do they do they are little ears ears and mouths in sympathetic pairs what each ear hears in montefoglia castle its mouth will speak to a listening monk here at saint jerome since each mouth takes a monk to maintain please try to put them where something important is likely to be said eh ill try father how long do they last only a day or so i must seek some way to make this spell less volatile so dont activate them until you actually place them this is a variation of the scrying spell i use with my birds but ive never heard of anyone attempting it without a live creature at the other end i considered cockroaches but they tend to scuttle away unless they are crippled and then they tend to die and thur had thought that remark about the centipedes was a joke i wonder if anyone has tried this before and failed or partsucceeded and kept it secret there is too much secrecy in this work if all sorcerers pooled their knowledge for the common good instead of each hugging his secrets to himself what practical advances might be made even in the church pride and fear divide us ive been mulling this notion for a time but until it was suggested today to exfoliate the parchment and divide the twinned halves between ear and mouth to harness their natural congruency i had not solved the problem of how to get an ear to hear with life on only one side but now the two are one or the one is two shouldnt i carry a mouth for you to speak to me alas i wish you could but you are no trained mage to continually enspell it to speak loud enough to hear he frowned in worry i hope they will span the distance we could only try it across the cloister i pray it will be strong enough to carry from montefoglia castle to saint jerome monreale began placing half the tambourines in an old canvas carrybag nestled in a pile of clothes and other oddments that a foundryman looking for work might own gently ambrose hung his linen bag from a ceiling beam thur spoke to fiametta did things go well for you today yes she said cheerily though it was much the same sort of work i used to do for papa it seems hed been using me as an apprentice without paying the licensing fee for quite some time thur wasnt certain if she was pleased or annoyed but a subdued selfconfidence glowed in her eyes he found himself smiling back at her she whispered behind her hand peeling the parchments apart was my idea i got it from something papa used to do with leather to make a secret pocket in his purse monreale held up the last parchment circle and gazed absently upon it what a boon it would be suppose every year the church were to publish a book of the best new spells men had devised and send copies to every diocese men might be willing to give up their secrecy to compete for the honor of such fame ah well so monreale closed thurs new pack do you have any other questions no questions really it was all plain enough there wasnt anything monreale could do for the sick knot of worry in his belly but the kobold had promised if he went to the fire hed live what was a kobolds word worth father monreale should i trust the word of a demon what monreale spun around astonished what demon a kobold we call them mountaindemons i spoke with one in the mine oh monreale huffed relief dont frighten me like that boy a kobold is not a demon its not not at all koboldsand sprites and dryads and all their ilkare er natural supernatural races so to speak they have a command of material magic each according to its nature but it is inherent not learned none can transcend their nature as a human mage who combines spirit and material magic can learn to do the church fathers have determined them to be a separate creation of god but neither of the body of christ as men are nor under the dominion of men as say horses are theyre just other they are longlived compared to men some of them but they are mortal of the nature of their souls there are several theories and heresies but no certainty god made them they must have a purpose but then god made lions wolves and head lice too we need not allow them to be a nuisance fortunately the churchs spirit magic can banish their material magic at need monreale was animated clearly thur had tapped an enthusiasm but then what is a demon monreale faltered turning grave ah im afraid demons are to us more as turks are brothers demons have a human origin and so their evil is immeasurably more dangerous to us than the little malicious tricks of the shy folk fiametta glanced up sharply fear narrowed her eyes a fear of something thur barely dared to guess at what exactly are demons father monreale frowned looking troubled fiametta understand you are not to discuss this subject without proper spiritual supervision lest you fall into heresy or error you must be very clear in your thinking if you go on in the practice of magic as you hope to do you will be exposed to certain temptations that do not trouble the ignorant does this have something to do with papa she demanded alas yes monreale paused demons are ghosts papas not a demon not yet no but he may be in danger of becoming one you see shriven spirits go to god some fair souls go on even without any such ministrations but in a few casesalmost always a sudden untimely death accident or murderthe spirit lingers so papa said yes of these most fade in time like smoke on the wind lost to man and god or at least to mans sight such can be enslaved to a spirit ring or other material matrix for a time fed and maintained maintained how oh there are a plethora of rites whats really effective gets mixed in with a lot of damned nonsense harmless or horriblea good bit of the sin of maintaining a spirit ring besides impeding a souls ascent to god is in these rites when the wouldbe mage imagines that great crimes will give great powers he is often addled or mistaken which must surely make lucifer laugh vast vile nonsense i hate the rubbish when the maintenance stops the ringbound spirit will begin to fade doesnt it go to hell hell as the great saint augustine revealed is not a place it is an eternity which is not the same thing as the end of time hell is right here now as is heaven in a sense he took in thurs and fiamettas utterly baffled stares and waved a hand never mind that now there is one other category of ghost somehow sometimes a spirit becomes selfmaintaining without a body or a ring or any other material anchor some become sineaters feeding on fear anger despairand seek to increase such sins in order to sustain themselves some seek out witches and magicians and attempt to seduce them to their aid that is the origin of the true demon they are thank god extremely rare much rarer than the reports of overexcited common folk would have you believe monreale rubbed his face pressing out the deep apprehensive grooves yet as you describe the apparition prospero benefortes ghostly strength is already nearly that great to create a temporary body even from something so insubstantial as smoke was a feat in ferrantes hands enslaved to a ring fed the things he would be fed he could become terrible papa wont do evil prospero beneforte was a man a fairly good man as men go little troubled by sloth or gluttony erhaps a trifle too subject to pride and wrath and avarice we are all even the best of us still sinners he may resist ferrante for a time but sooner or later the allure of life or at least continued existence in the world of will must prove overpowering i could not resist such a reward out of my own strength i could only throw myself upon the mercy of god and pray for rescue fiametta sat chill and stiff thur could see her wrestling with this new and subtle dread he called for you she repeated yes monreale conceded i hope he has not mistaken me for god i shall set you some special prayers fiametta and in the meantime well see what we can do to stop ferrante by all the other means god gives us abbot monreale took thur to a spot on the south wall away from both the postern door and the main gate they had to clamber over the laundry roof to reach it there was no moon and brother ambrose had darkened his lantern thur peered willing his eyes to see into the nearby woods if he couldnt see any soldiers maybe they couldnt see him monreale and ambrose could have been shadowmonks only fiamettas white linen sleeves made a pale blur thur had been hoping monreale would produce a cloak of invisibility out monreale merely intoned a spell over him perhaps he was becoming more sensitive with all this magic about for this time he felt something if only a vagueness settle over him with monreales words can they see me at all thur whispered not readily monreale murmured back this is akin to the spell i laid on my little ears it will pass off in a few hours if ferrantes men see a shape or hear a sound they will attribute it to animals or nerves but if you blunder right into one as you did last night the spell cant help you so watch yourself had it only been last night they had arrived at saint jerome yes father thur took the rope tested it swung his legs up and sat athwart the stone he jammed his cap on more firmly fiametta stood on the roof her arms wrapping her torso against the chill skirt a dark billow thur could not see her face thur she said be careful uh your new clothes look nice thur nodded cheered he let the rope ease through his hands and began his descent chapter nine thur dozed away the last hours of darkness behind a tree near the road a quartermile from montefoglias northeast gate golden dawn glowed up at last from the eastern hills he rolled over and watched the dusty road he did not want to be first through the gate nor second too conspicuous third maybe the road stayed abnormally quiet for this hour of the day so near such a large town everyone who could was staying as far from the soldiers as possible thur guessed but eventually a horseman passedlikely a losimonand then an old man trundling a wheelbarrow full of vegetables thur slipped down onto the road in his wake well back thur swallowed as the town wall bulked up squaredoff stone and brick of various ages ran down to the lakeshore and up and around cradling montefoglia from harm a mile of wall at least was rome this big in the clear morning light the city looked magical excitingmen built this then what other wonders might men do true the wall was in need of repairs in a few spots stones starting to rumble down his heart lifted still why had he stayed so long in bruinwald when this had been waiting on the other end of the road uri had tried to tell him the thought of uri perhaps lying wounded for days among brutal enemies illtended made thur lengthen his stride till he overtook the man with the vegetable barrow the gate was an arched doorway in a tall square tower topped with red tile the barrowman was stopped there by three guards an unarmed man wearing the livery of the city and two swordgirded losimons both still wore the fancy livery issued for the betrothal procession festive green and gold striped tunics and green tabards embroidered with ferrantes arms now dingy and worse for the unexpected wear of a fight and a week of siege and occupation duties radishes said the city guard in a worried tone poking through the contents of the barrow all you bring us is radishes in fact the barrow contained lettuce and spring onions tied in bunches as well our men will bring in something one way or another if the countryside doesnt the taller losimon glowered at the old man tell your neighbors that the old man shrugged not daring any more open defiance and trundled on through the city guard turned his attention to thur whats your business stranger thur turned his red cap humbly in his hands i seek work sir i was told some men in the castle wanted to hire foundrymen the city guard grunted and wrote thurs name which thur gave as thur wyl and business down in his record book and where are you from meissen altenburg thur threw out at random hed once met a crippled miner from the altenburg hands eaten away and halfblinded from the corrosive cadmia it seemed a good place to be from far from german metalworker eh said the shorter losimon theyll be glad to have you thur turned eagerly to him do you know where i should go and who i should see sir go to the castleright and straight up the main streetand ask for lord ferrantes secretary messer niccolo vitelli hes doing the hiring thank you sir thur ducked away the streets were narrow like ravines between the tall stone houses and shops all crammed together the sky was squeezed overhead into a blue ribbon thur recognized nothing of the town at this new angle but the colors there were not many people in the streets this morning on a sudden urgent impulse it occurred to thur that it might be easier to check on fiamettas house first before he became caught up in godknewwhat labors in the castle he stopped a man bent under a load of firewood and asked directions to via novara thur turned the opposite direction from the castle a dry gutter ran down the center of the cobbled main street near the eastern city wall he found via novara and turned upslope to its end that big square house it seemed almost a palazzo to thurs eyes all of cut stone fancy castiron bars decorated with leaves and vines guarded the downstairs windows larger windows protected by wooden shutters ran in a course high above how right a setting it seemed for fiametta this house would protect her like a human jewel at its heart like a little lombardy princess no wonder she was worried about it a thick oak door was set in an archway framed in white marble blocks contrasting brightly with the yellowish native stone of the walls the door stood open guarded by a greentabarded losimon armed a freshfaced young losimon groom stood in the street nearby holding the reins of two horses one animal wore a plain leather headstall the other a big glossy chestnut with a snowy showy blaze and white legs had a longshanked gilded bit and goldstudded green leather reins with a silktassled breastband and crupper to match thur paused uncertainly what do you want the guard seeing him loiter asked suspiciously i was told lord ferrantes secretary messer vitelli wished to hire foundrymen thur began letting his northern accent thicken he was about to add but i got turned around and lost in the city when the guard relaxed and waved an understanding hand go right in startled thur sidled past him he paused in the stoneflagged hallway to let his eyes adjust to the dimness to his right a door led into a deserted workroom with workbenches and a clutter of tools strewn aboutthrown about thur realized from the empty brackets on the walls the benches were shoved out of place one upturned looters had evidently given the room a onceover but not yet stripped it of all tools and function thur walked forward into the brightness of a large inner courtyard the courtyard had its own well a little pool was now dry the court might have been originally designed as a garden room but was very far from gardenlike now it more resembled an infernal workshop housing some satanic project interrupted and abandoned thurs eye picked out meaning from the apparent chaos of cranes brickwork digging and scaffolding master beneforte had built a raised smelting furnace right in his courtyard below it in a deep dugout depression stood a huge clay lump stuck about with thin tubes and fenced with iron bands and girders the lump was vaguely manlike an elemental swampmonster struggling toward form it could only be the great perseus fiametta had spoken of char in the pit revealed where the wax had been melted out of the mold drying and readying it for its molten bronze around the figure was built up a bank of earth pierced here and there with clay pipes the whole was tented over with canvas to keep the nonexistent rain off the baked clay from the wooden gallery circling the courtyard above came a mans deep voice calling no luck here footsteps echoed and thur turned to see the man lean on the rail and stare down at him in turn he was a powerfullooking fellow in his thirties wearing military garb chain mail over a padded coat tough leather leggings for riding below an officer by his sword and confident bearing dark hair was cut plain to fit in a smooth cap under a helmet he was cleanshaved though a natural heaviness of beard darkened his jaw his face was redeemed from heaviness overall by alert dark eyes that studied thur without fear measuringry his right hand resting on the railing was wrapped about with a white gauze bandage more footsteps and another man appeared on the gallery opposite thur schooled his face to reveal no twitch of recognition it was the redrobed little man he had seen atop the tower in monreales mirror directing the crossbowmens fire nothing here either he said then looked down and noticed thur he frowned whats this thur doffed his cap again excuse me sir im a metalworker the guard at the town gate told me to see messer vitelli oh the little man grew less stiff they sent you on eh well youve found me it seemed to thur that his damnable talent for finding things lacked discrimination he was not at all sure he was ready to deal with messer vitelli yet the fellow was slight clericish not too well endowed with chin brighteyed and jerky as a blackbird why should he make thur uneasy are you a foundry master by chance asked vitelli no messer pity well you look strong enough youre hired how are you at solving puzzles eh strong but not too bright come up here obediently thur mounted the stairs to the gallery and presented himself to the man in red the soldierly fellow strolled around to join them were looking for something vitelli told thur a book or possibly a bundle of papers it will be well hidden a pile of books and papers overflowed from a chest that sat waiting on the gallery thur pointed to it not one of those messer no but similar those are valuable but theyre not what we seek the soldierly man rumbled how can you be so sure it even exists niccolo i think you have us on a wild goose chase or beneforte may have burned it years ago it must exist my lord if hed had it he wouldnt have destroyed it no mage could not if hed already gone so far my lord so this was lord ferrante himself thur wondered if he should pull out his little dagger and attempt to assassinate the man on the spot his dagger was more used to cutting bread at dinner the soldierly man scarcely looked the devil incarnate that thur had been expecting an ordinary man even attractive and ferrantes mail protected him nor did he turn his back that seemed a quite casual habit as he slid past them toward the next room but he didnt let anyone not even vitelli get behind him then another greenclad guard came out of the room and the moment of opportunity was gone help him vitelli directed thur to the guard tap every brick try every board dont skip a one yes messer the boredlooking guard motioned thur to follow him and so thur found himself licking on stone and knocking on plaster and crouching on the floor sliding his dagger between the boards inch by inch they did one room then another vitelli stuck his head through the door finish this floor were going to try the cellars id go up not down thought thur automatically and choked the words on his lips now was not the time to let his talent or luck or whatever it was shine forth of that he was certain he bent his head to the floorboards and ignored the ceiling the next room he realized with a little shock as they entered it was fiamettas own the wooden bed had been broken apart the mattress knifed open in the first excited search for the goldsmiths treasures a couple of chests had been upended and emptied out but nothing remained of their contents now except a few old linens strewn on the floor surely fiametta had owned more clothes than that the good cloth must have been taken disturbed by an obscure sense of violation thur righted the chests gathered the undergarments back up and clumsily folded them away had the soldiers laughed clowned around with her womens clothes thur didnt want anyone to laugh at fiametta with her sturdy dignity so hardheld he frowned deeply come on here the impatient guard sensing shirking demanded help thur dutifully started tapping the walls there was nothing behind the walls of that he was sure one wall two three ah ha cried the guard from the floor in the corner got it he jimmied a short floorboard out of its slot with the tip of his dagger a bundle of paper tied about with silk ribbon rested within the space he snatched it out and brandished it triumphantly grinning and hurried out to find his master thur followed they found lord ferrante and messer vitelli in the kitchen just climbing out of the root cellar looking dirty and disgusted here my lord the excited guard thrust the bundle of papers forward ha vitelli snatched it ripped off the ribbon and spread the papers across the kitchen table the cracks of the wood were yellow with the flour of many batches of bread and noodles vitelli read eagerly turning papers over then his face fell damn rubbish thats not it the guard whod been fingering the flat purse at his belt said in discouragement i found it hidden under a floorboard its not benefortes writing it must be the girls diary peh notes on magic yes but its all apprentices rubbish gossip and love spells and like muck contemptuously vitelli flicked the papers away as ferrante and vitelli turned away thur surreptitiously gathered the sheets back up wound the ribbon around them and tucked them back out of sight in a cupboard housing dinged and battered old pewter ferrante paused to let thur and vitelli and the bitterly disappointed guard exit the kitchen first thats all the time i can waste this morning said lord ferrante as they walked into the courtyard you can take some men and try again this afternoon niccolo if you insist but then well just have to go on without it it must be here somewhere it must said the secretary doggedly so you say maybe he kept all his notes in his head eh vitelli groaned at the thought ferrante stared absently around perhaps when im duke here ill give you his house that would content me my lord said vitelli growing a shade more serene good vitelli wandered into the sunlight and glanced under a pile of canvas should i have these pigs of tin moved to the castle along with the books my lord the gleaming metal bars in the stack weighed about a hundred pounds each thur estimated doubtless the only reason they hadnt been carried off in the first wave of looting before some officer had arrived to assert ferrante s rights leave them for now ferrante shrugged theyre not going to march away until we can find a foundry master who can cast a cannon that will be more dangerous to our enemies than to ourselves they might as well sit here as anywhere ferrante turned away come along german thur picked up his pack ferrante paused at the oak door to speak to his guard posted there i know youve been poking about in here looking for jewels no lord said the door guard in a shocked voice eh dont lie to me or ill have you stretched you and your friends pocket a garnet or a coin or two i dont care but if i find that anyone has carried out a single scrap of paper even if its an inventory of the chamber pots ill have his head on a stick before sundown understand yes my lord the guard stood frozen to attention till ferrante and vitelli swung aboard their horses two breastplated and helmeted soldiers who had been searching the garden and toolshed appeared when the groom ran to fetch them and fell in behind the two horsemen thurs guard and the boy groom marched ahead at ferrantes hand motion thur walked beside his stirrup through the town the guards glowered suspiciously at any citizen who strayed too near the little procession the montefoglians in turn tended to fade away at ferrantes approach turning in to shops or side streets or stepping back to flatten themselves against walls no one hissed no one cheered it was as if a circle of silence surrounded lord ferrante moving as he moved only four guards was lord ferrante so brave he rode straightbacked not deigning to glance about like his escort thousands of montefoglians lived in this city if they all turned out into the streets at once surely ferrante and his men could not stand against them despite the disparity of weapons why didnt they thur wondered had duke sandrino been so unloved was one tyrant the same as another to the citizens for all practical purposes maybe ferrantes abrupt reversal of status from soninlaw to usurper friend to foe was simply too sudden to assimilate what hold had ferrante on the montefoglians fear clearly but all very well to imagine a mob of irate citizens taking to the streets to avenge their duke but who would volunteer to be the first to run up on the enemies swords thur was an outlander this wasnt really his fight was it does uri live a bend in the street brought the castle into view on its steepsided rocky hill and thurs belly shivered so german lord ferrante spoke agreeably from his horse what do you know of cannon foundry thur shrugged adjusting his pack more comfortably on his shoulders he tried not to think about what was in the pack ive worked in smelteries my lord parting metals and ores cleaned the furnaces and helped stack the fuels and metals run the bellows ive helped with some casting in sand pits but only little things plaques and candlesticks except i once helped with a church bell hm how would you repair a cracked bombast if you had to i it would depend on the crack my lord if it ran lengthwise ive heard of heating iron tyres and binding the barrel around if the crack ran crosswise maybe use the old bombast as a pattern and remelt and cast it you would need some fresh metals to add because of the waste in the furnace and channels i see ferrante regarded him with mild approval ive seen military engineers do the trick with the tyres you seem to know your work good if i can find no other master you may find yourself promoted i would do my best my lord said thur in an uncertain tone ferrante chuckled id make sure of it he seemed in a fairly mellow mood for a murderer thur ventured what were you looking for in that house my lord ferrantes smile thinned no concern of yours german thur took the hint and stayed silent they were nearing the hill where the road climbed to the castle from the corner of his eye thur saw a man dart and crouch behind a water trough one of a group of three young men waiting by a crosscorner was staring hard at ferrante the others seemed deliberately turned away ferrante became conscious of the starer though he did not return the look his chin rose and his jaw tightened he switched his reins to his bandaged right hand his left touched the hilt of his sword another group of half a dozen young men seemingly drunk were lurching down a side alley singing they bumped and jostled each other but their voices were too subdued ferrantes guards bristled like dogs but did not draw glancing to their master for orders thur looked around for someplace any place a shop or alley to duck away in nothing the building on his right hand was solid doors and shutters locked ahead the three men joined the six and they all lumbered into the street all had swords out none were smiling or joking or singing now determination anger fear and second thoughts flickered in their faces one boy no older than thur looked so greenwhite thur halfexpected him to bend over and start vomiting a couple of the gang members made little rushes forward then stepped back again when their company did not follow fast enough a few began shouting insults at ferrante and his guards more to encourage themselves thur feared than to annoy their enemies ferrantes face was set like iron he nodded his guards drew their swords vitelli who bore only a dagger reined in his horse ferrantes veterans kept a silence more ominous than the attackers shouted threats the guards were tensethey might be illiterate but at least they had enough arithmetic to know the difference between six and ten yet they seemed more intent than fearful as if they faced an unpleasant but familiar and wellpracticed task ferrantes boygroom drew his dagger and glanced back over his shoulder at his master for reassurance ferrante gave him a nod thur gibbered in his throat should he draw his knife or not he was on the wrong side the street gang surged toward ferrante at last prodded by a screaming leader who switched his colorful insults from the losimons to his unforward comrades the three guards rushed ahead and engaged them with a clang and scrape of steel a welldressed young man in blue doublet and bright yellow hose slipped between the embattled guards his eyes on ferrante the little groom ran forward to meet him brandishing his dagger the contest was unequal the dagger parry futile the montefoglians sword buried itself in the boys chest the little groom screamed yellowhose paused as if shocked and astonished by his own effect ferrante turned scarlet coward he bellowed snatched out his sword lefthanded and spurred his flashy chestnut horse on his hot dark eyes focused on yellowhose with terrifying concentration yellowhose took a look at his face yanked his sword from the little groom with a spatter of blood turned and ran he almost succeeded in drawing ferrante out from his screen of guards hands reached up to grab for the horses gilded bridle and the street men roared ferrante swung at them and spurred again his horse reared and kicked squealing connecting at least once with a solid juicy thunk the guards ran forward to catch up a montefoglian swordsman popped up in front of thur thur whipped out his dagger and knocked the blow away barely in time and then not knowing what else to do lunged forward and wrapped his assailant in a bear hug trapping the sword arm his prisoner heaved and struggled and they gasped garlic and onion exertion and terror onto each other not me you idiot thur groaned into the montefoglians nearby ear im on your side the montefoglian tried to butt him with his head a flash of color and movement to the sidethur wrenched his prisoner around just as another montefoglian thrust at him the mans sword ran clean through his comrades back and pierced thurs belly thur sprang back with a cry of pain and surprise and the man hed bearhugged slumped to the cobbles the second swordsman wailed and drew his sword out hurriedly as if he might so take back his misaimed disastrous blow thur touched his belly his shaking hand came away red as the stain spread on his new tan tunic but it was only a surface cut he could feel it no organs touched he could straighten and move and did snuffling backwards the montefoglian didnt follow up but crying tried to drag his injured comrade away thur whirled around as a scraping clatter grew deafening it was the scrabble of hooves on the cobblestones half a dozen greenclad losimon cavalrymen were riding down from the castle to succor their lord they slammed into the street men from behind scattering them and totally disrupting their attack each man turned from the assault on ferrante and began to try to save himself losimons chased them severally up the alleyway thur felt around himself he had not thank god dropped his pack nor spilled its incriminating contents across the cobbles ferrante breathing heavily soothed his pawing horse the animals eyes rolled white nostrils flaring with the scent of blood the boygroom wheyfaced eyes fixed and staring lay now across ferrantes lap ferrante sheathed his sword and murmuring turned the boys head around to his he stared for a stunned moment into the dead face then growled like a wolf two of the guards were injured three dead montefoglians lay on the stones including the one thur had wrestled two dismounted cavalrymen held the struggling yellowhose a prisoner ferrantes face went from red to livid gray he pointed to the prisoner and spoke to his cavalry captain squeeze that one find out the names of his accomplices then hunt them down and kill them the chestnut horse danced uneasily beneath its rigid rider my lord messer vitelli resheathed his dagger which he had not used and pressed his horse up beside ferrantes a word his voice fell hold this one yes learn what he knows but dont spend men pursuing them now it would just plunge their families into vendetta against you thur breathed covert relief a voice of reason and mercy to stop this monstrous cascade of violence his respect for vitelli rose a notch when your troops arrive then take the assassins and all their relatives at once vitelli went on leave none alive to seek revenge it will make a good strong first impression after which your rule will be less troubled ferrantes brows went up he studied his secretary as if slightly bemused at last he grunted assent see to it niccolo vitelli on his restive horse bowed his head briefly in acknowledgement that reminds me we should let the late dukes enemies out of the dungeon were going to need the space take care of it sighed ferrante the excitement and energy of the fight were visibly draining from him leaving a kind of lassitude he glanced down at thur youre hurt german he sounded if not exactly concerned at least mildly interested its just a scratch my lord thur managed to choke out ferrantes warexperienced eye summed thur and concurred he gave thur a brief nod good i like a man who doesnt whine despite himself thur felt inanely warmed by the mans approval remember who he is remember uri he gave ferrante a stiff nod in return which for some reason caused ferrante to smile dryly to himself with a last thinlipped look of grief ferrante smoothed back the boygrooms hair from his white forehead and gave his body over to one of the cavalrymen he frowned at thurs palm pressed to his red belly and extended his left hand climb up ill give you a ride to my surgeon so thur found himself not an inch away from ferrante himself athwart the chestnut horses muscular haunches as the beast climbed to the castle his fingers clung to the saddles carved cantle not daring or wishing to grip the lord of losimo ferrante rode through the towerflanked gate and let thur down in the castle courtyard and detailed a guard to guide him when youve got a patch on that belly find my secretary hell show you the work chapter ten thur followed the guard across the courtyard a servant led lord ferrantes horse in the opposite direction on his left thur recognized the elaborate marble staircase that hed glimpsed in monreales mirror ferrante mounted the steps two at a time and disappeared into the castle in his guides wake thur entered a much humbler portal on the north side of the court into what was apparently the servants wing they passed through a stonepaved whitewashed kitchen where half a dozen sweating and cursing men wrestled with firewood and the carcass of an ox a couple of frightenedlooking old women kneaded a small mountain of bread dough beyond the kitchen a butlers pantry was taken over by a camp apothecary and a few steps up and a turn through another corridor brought them to the late duke sandrinos state dining room it had been converted to a temporary hospital a dozen sick or wounded men lay on woven straw pallets upon the frescoed walls ruddy halfnaked gods and pale greenish nymphs smiled and sported among the acanthus leaves indifferent to the fleshly pain under their painted eyes while his guideguard spoke with ferrantes surgeon thur anxiously scanned the pallets all strangers uri did not lie among these men so and how many men had thur seen counting the troops besieging the monastery more than ferrantes original honor guard of fifty surely some of the swifter cavalry must have already arrived from losimo how many days behind them did ferrantes infantry march he should try to find out these things thur guessed ferrantes military surgeon was a squat swarthy sicilian who moved with bustle he seemed more a barber than a healer or mage not at all like the learned and robed paduan doctors who took pulses sniffed urine and pronounced gravely this man looked like hed be more at home digging graves he wrinkled his full lips and shrugged when thur removed his jacket to display his cut the first profuse bleeding had stopped and the elasticity of the skin pulled the edges of the wound apart thur stared with morbid fascination at the glimpse of his redbrown muscle sliding beneath the gaping gash the surgeon laid thur down on a trestle table muttered a perfunctorysounding spell against suppuration and sewed the edges of the cut together with a curved needle while thur eyes crossed and teary bit on a rag his breath whistling through his teeth the surgeon had thur sitting up again within moments and tied a linen bandage around his waist cut the stitches and pull them out in about ten days if the wound doesnt go bad the surgeon advised thur if it goes bad come see me again all right run along the pain dulling with use thur managed a thank you sir he folded up his bloodstained tan jacket and rummaged carefully in his pack for his spare a shabby gray linen tunic should he attempt to plant a little ear in this chamber would it hear anything of value but for its frescoes this seemed much like the infirmary in the monastery the men all looked the same stubbled and shocked or flushed and fevered the smell was the same sweat drying blood the tang of urine and feces a burnt whiff suggesting some recent cautery the surgeons back was turned thur palmed a little parchment disk and looked around for a place to hide it a mess of equipment was piled in a corner behind the trestle table a dented cuirass somebodys empty pack a pike and a couple of stretcher poles thur started to stoop but was stopped abruptly by the twinge of his belly he caught his breath murmured the activating words abbot monreale had given him and dropped the little disk in behind the pile he straightened up more carefully the surgeon finished putting his needle away in its little leather case which contained even larger and more unnerving implements of the sort and stuffed the bloody rags into a laundry bag thur laced up his jacket and asked casually how many of these men are lord ferrantes and how many are your prisoners prisoners up here the surgeon raised bemused black brows not likely dare he ask after uri by name did you take many wounded prisoners not too many most ran off after that militant abbot and we traded back all the ones that were so bad off as to be no further threat to us let them consume the enemys resources just as well id rather serve my own uh where are they now the few you did take the dungeon of course officers too even the dukes captains and officials all the same enemy the surgeon shrugged wont lord ferrante risk criticism for such harshness the surgeon barked a short humorless laugh not from his soldiers lookyou read dont you yes sir a little thought so or you wouldnt be repeating such priests and womens twaddle i got my start as a surgeon in the camp of a certain venetian condottiere will not foul my lips by naming him we were pursuing some bolognese dogged em for days caught up with them by a marshand our dear commander stopped and let them prepare for our assault he got a reputation for chivalry out of it and retired rich i got a tent full of dying men who should never have been wounded a fiasco peh give me a captain who puts his own men first the enemy can have the crumbs of any sentimentality left over then you admire lord ferrante hes a practical soldier the older i get the better i like that the surgeon shook his head thur puzzled this over but now lord ferrante has to be more than a soldier now he has to be a ruler whats the difference the surgeon shrugged im not sure it just seems there ought to be one power is power my young philosopher and men are men the surgeon smiled halfsour halfamused im a foundryman you reason like one the surgeon clapped him on the shoulder in a gesture copied thur could swear from lord ferrante just make us some cannon foundryman and leave the aiming of them to your betters thur smiled dimly in return and clutching his pack escaped the painted chamber he found himself wandering through a bewildering succession of rooms some bright and panelled and frescoed others plain and dim in a tiny hall a couple of losimon soldiers dozed atop their blankets in the heat of the afternoon while a couple more pursued a desultory game of dice they barely glanced at thur down i must find a way down somehow beyond the soldiers thur found a largerthanusual chamber with a marblepaved floor double doors stood open to the breathless air and a hazy brightness thur peeked through into a garden bounded on the other side by a high wall insects hummed sleepily in the white afternoon a few wilted crossbowmen manned turrets atop the stonework thur oriented himself by the shadows the garden wall must run along the cliff which fell sheer to the lake there was little fear of assault from that quarter there was very little fear of assault from any quarter thur admitted grimly to himself but perhaps lord ferrante didnt know that off the larger chamber stood a smaller one woodpanelled a desk with piles of papers shelves of books and a mapstrewn table marked it as a study duke sandrinos office jolted by his opportunity thur danced around and nipped inside he dug a little ear from his pack and stared about peculiar brown stains were spattered over the wooden floor caked in the grain of the oak a set of shelves stood taller than thur he reached up and swiped a hand across its top and found only dust footsteps sounded on the marble outside hastily thur murmured the words and pushed the little round tambourine out of sight above a man would have to be half a head taller than thur to see it he stepped away from the shelves messer vitelli entered the study and frowned suspiciously at thur what are you doing in here german lord ferrante told me that you would show me the work messer thur replied trying not to sound too breathy huh the little man rummaged among the papers on the map table found the one he was looking for and motioned thur out into the sunheated garden thur bit his lip in frustration and followed he glanced back at the bulking brick and stone of the castle so close i must find a way down vitelli led thur to the bottom of the garden opposite to the stables through a locked gate a couple of sunreddened workmen naked to the waist torsos shiny with sweat were slowly excavating a hole nearby piles of sand woodstacks brick and broken brick indicated a foundryinthemaking a bronze bombast weathered green sat on a sledge its wide black mouth gaping to heaven thats the piece vitelli pointed to it an ogres stewpot thur knelt beside the cannon and let his hands trace over its scaleencrusted ornament animal masks knobs vines cast in relief winding about the barrel the crack was obvious a jagged spiral that ran halfway around the damage must have propagated while the ordnance was cooling after a bout of firing a flaw that severe which occurred when the bombast was actually being fired would have torn the bronze apart and killed its artillery master another firing would do just that but an iron ball belched forth from that pot could crack stone as thick as saint jeromes walls no question how often could it be fired thur asked vitelli about once an hour im told its previous owner tried to exceed that limit such a battering kept up night and day could breach saint jerome in less than two days thur guessed the spiral path of the crack made quick and easy reinforcement with iron tyres a doubtful proposition or duke sandrinos artillery master would have already had it done the bombast had obviously been set aside to await recasting what do you think foundryman vitelli was watching him closely thur realized might he tell ferrantes secretary the bombast could be bound with iron and so lure the enemy into blowing it up themselves no thur decided regretfully from the preparations it was clear the losimons already knew what had to be done but a complete recasting would take time and much labor and ferrante was manshort and many things could go wrong of that thur realized he could make sure he was no foundry master but for such sabotage he scarcely needed to be the clumsier the better in fact he brightened it will have to be recast can you do it ive never done anything that large before butyes why not very well take over make a list of what you need to finish the job and bring it to me and foundryman vitellis secretive smile twitched a corner of his mouth our artillery master has an iron chain about six feet long one end will be bolted to the caisson the other ends in a manacle that will be locked around your ankle it will be your honor to light the match the first time your new piece is fired immediately afterwards you shall be given a purse of gold thur grinned uncertainly that is a joke messer no it is lord ferrantes order vitelli favored thur with a small ironic bow and turned back toward the castle thurs grin turned to grimace the two workmen thur discovered upon inquiry were already digging the pit for the proposed sand casting thur fended off the pointed offer of a shovel by displaying his new bandages and poked around the piles of supplies trying to look shrewd and unimpressed like master kunz plenty of brick though the firewood was scant a couple of barrels of good clay wellseasoned the sand pile was clean and dry but should be covered with canvas in case the rain the monks were praying for to fill saint jeromes cisterns ever came thur tilted his face up blinking the sky was cloudless if hazy all right canvas to keep out foreign matter thur still remembered master kunzs plaque casting the time the village cats had gotten to his sand pile and the workmen had failed to sift the sand before shovelling it into the pit molten bronze had met cat turd instantly creating a steam explosion the casting had been ruined the workmen beaten and master kunz had spent the next two weeks heaving cobbles at any stray cat unwise enough to show its whiskers near his shop or perhaps thur ought to salt ferrantes sand pile with say old fish heads here kitty kitty thur recalled vitellis sixfoot chain and set the idea aside for now his preliminary inventory finished thur returned to the castle in search of messer vitelli reminding himself to look for more good places to conceal the little ears as soon as he had them all distributed he could be gone and the devil take ferrantes cannon foundry as soon as he found uri unfortunately thur found vitelli in the first place he looked the dukes study ferrantes secretary was penning letters by the window in the last light he turned his paper face down as thur entered yes german you asked for a list of needs messer vitelli took a fresh quill and a scrap of paper say on a crane or the long timbers fittings and chains needed to build one iron pipes for the channels enough canvas to protect the work in progress and scrap bronze or new copper and tin to add to the melting to make up the waste in the melting and the channels and vents more firewood whats there will only be enough to dry the mold charcoal and fine lute clay to line the bricks of the furnace a rammer a couple of good big bellows made of oxhide and enough strong workmen to take turnabout to keep them pumping during the tricky parts six men would do i can lend you some soldiers for that how much more bronze im not sure a couple hundred pounds at least at vitellis pained look thur added whats over too much you can recover from the channels but if youre under the casting will fail and the mold will be destroyed and since the old bombast would be melted down by then you could not make another more bronze then resignedly vitelli bent his head over his scratching quill thur schooled himself not to glance at the top of the shelf across the study vitelli frowned up at him carry on german no escape from this pantomime yet thur retreated to the garden where he marked out the dimensions of a furnace on the high side of the pit and directed the workmen to begin building up its base with their dirt pile by then it was nearly twilight and the workmen led him off to the kitchen where a curt camp cook issued them fried bread a few scraps of meat and cheap wine thur ravenous ate his portion out of hand as they took him to the workmens dormitory over the stables shared with the grooms thur found an uninhabited straw pallet to claim for his bed at least he trusted it was uninhabitedhe peered suspiciously into its weave for signs of life in an unobserved moment he concealed another little ear under the foot of the tattered quilt he was issued by a senior groom and tucked the remaining three into his gray tunic leaving his pack he escaped his new acquaintances offer of wine and a game of dice i have to go talk to vitelli about cranes he excused himself actually the unnerving little secretary was the last man thur wished to see again right now he descended the ladder from the dormitory and passed uncertainly through the stables crowded with losimon cavalry horses a few overworked grooms carted fodder and water these could only be a portion of ferrantes horses thur realized counting under his breath the rest must be pastured outside of town somewhere with yet another complement of guards the stables opened onto the entry court with its two massive towers and its marble staircase the red tile fringing the tower tops blazed like enamel in the last high light of the setting sun then faded to a shadowed earthy tone against the cool sky a couple of helmeted heads moved in the crossbowmens platforms crenellated brick boxes open to the air that stuck up out of the skirts of sloping tile a faint golden glow of candlelight reflected from two shadowed slots halfway up one tower did it mark the chamber where the duchess and lady julia were kept prisoner nothing thicker than candlelight or a crossbow quarrel was likely to escape from those pinched stone mouths soft and insistent as a heartbeat thurs sixth sense drove him onward through the service entry on the other side of the courtyard this time he turned away from the kitchen into a dim stonework corridor at its end he found a thick wooden door a tiredlooking losimon with a short sword sat on an upturned barrel his pike leaning against the wall the pikeman gave thur a hard stare his hand going to his sword hilt what dyou want boy im lord ferrantes new foundryman im supposed to check the bars and metalwork down there and submit a list of repairs to messer vitelli there that was the likeliest lie thur could come up with if that one didnt work thur eyed the pike uri im coming oh yes i know the cell they mean the guard nodded knowledgeably ill take you to it he rose from his barrel and pushed the door open a shout echoed up the stone stairs beyond the door another losimon guard was toiling upward holding a lantern he paused to catch his breath when his comrade appeared at the head of the stairs carlo the lunatics out again keep a watch up there he hasnt come this way all right then he must still be hiding down here well keep looking ill lock this door till you find him the first guard motioned thur through heres my lords workman come to check the cell good the second guard beckoned and turned back down the stairway thur descended bewildered but as his shoe leather scraped across the gritty stone every step echoed his certainty down yes this way behind him the thick door swung shut in the gloom and its iron bolt grated home into its slot the two men went down a second turning and the corridors walls changed from cut and fitted stonework to solid native sandstone the corridor narrowed then turned again and flared to accommodate a guardpost and a garderobe a barred window overlooked the lake admitting the dim blue light of early evening the window had to be cut right into the cliff face beneath the garden wall the garderobes stone chute for slops tunneled through nearby the corridor sank a little further and passed a row of unusual doors each cell door was a rack of vertical iron bars their iron hinges set deep into the sandstone the cells too had tiny barred windows making them not so airless damp or horrible as thur had expected in conjunction with the airy ironwork of the doors the ventilation was excellent but the cells were crowded four or five men in each thur slowed trying to make out faces forms ferrante only held about twenty prisoners here uri was not among these here workman the guard frowned back at his laggard steps and thur hurried to catch up on his left he passed another narrow corridor leading up into the castle too dark to tell the guard pointed into an empty cell at the end of the row this one whats wrong with it thur asked it looked identical to the others except for being empty nothing i wager said the guard darkly i think its magic magic and madness glumly he rattled the door on its hinges took a key from his belt and unlocked it see it was locked just like this yet the madman hasdare i sayflown nervously thur entered the cell a vision of the guard clanging the door shut behind him with a cry of ha caught you spy flashed in his mind but the guard merely rubbed his nose and stared helpfully hoisting the lantern high thur stepped to the cubitsquare window and traced over and shook the iron bars set therein solid there was a couple of feet thickness of solid stone between the cell and the cliff face the window was like a little tunnel a slice of lake glimmered in the gathering doom in a tiny patch of sky one star shone thur jerked his hand back as a large centipede scuttled from a crack and flowed over the stone to disappear over the outer edge of the window tunnel thur gazed around the whitewashed walls of the cell the chamber was small but not inhumanly so there was room for a taller man than thur to lie down on the usual woven straw pallet and standing up thurs head didnt brush the ceiling the walls seemed solid thur chafed under the gaze of the guard go away you he was close close to uri he could feel it if only he could win a few moments unobserved rough voices echoed down the corridor blended with a much stranger noiselaughter a high shriek rang eee eee eee ah they got him the losimon guard grimaced he doesnt get far but how does he get out he shook his head and backed out of the cell thur followed dogged by the darkness that seemed to seep from the corners as the lantern was withdrawn two losimons were manhandling a third fellow toward the cell their prisoner was a middleaged man tending toward stoutness in another time he might have been grave and stately the torn and soiled velvet tunic decent skirts to the knee and silk hose he wore marked him as a man of rank his graying hair as a man of dignity but now his hair stuck out wildly uncombed and his beardsalted jowls were shrunken redrimmed eyes stared out from bruised hollows he shrieked again twisted and flapped his hands below the guards solid grip on his arms where did you find him asked the guard with the lantern downstairs again panted the younger guard same corner we missed him first pass but he was crouching there the second time i lookedgod maybe he does turn into a bat dont say the word youll just start him up again began his partner their sergeant but it was too late excitement flushed their prisoners face and he began to jabber and mutter beneath his breath his body jerking a bat a bat a bats the thing the black vitelli is a false bat but i am a real one ill fly away fly away from you and youll be hanged fly to my wife and you wont stop mevermin murderers his conspiratorial grin gave way to incoherent rage and he began to buck and fight in earnest the two guards flung him into the cell and slammed the door shut he banged into it with a velvetcovered shoulder over and over while the two junior guards leaned against the bars to hold it closed while their sergeant thrust the key into the lockit took three triesand turned it the losimons stood away from the door relieved as the bolt caught the madman continued to bang and shriek his wordless batcry alternated with stamping in circles and shaking his whole body as if he were a bat flapping its wings it was absurd but somehow thur didnt find it funny tears leaked down the mans ravaged face as he piped his strange cries and his indrawn breath churned in a raw throat i will fly i will fly i will fly he trailed off at last he crouched to the floor then sat heavily weeping and exhausted who is the poor fellow thur whispered staring through the bars he was the dead dukes castellan lord pia shrugged the sergeant catching his breath from the wrestling match i think the battle and the bloodshed turned his brain he doesnt half care for being locked in his own prison i can tell you but he doesnt stay locked in is the trouble muttered his younger comrade how does he do it vitelli swears theres no trace of magic on the lock the prisoners eyes flashed up at the secretarys name a scarlet lucid malevolent glare that crossed thurs startled eyes then buried itself in downwardlooking muttering again is he really mad or only pretending or perhaps the castellan was both strange thought it was no wonder he was kept alone though even as crowded as the prison was now thur examined the iron door the bars were oiled free of rust and corrosion the hinges were deepset in solid rock and sound he tapped down the long vertical rods all rang true no hidden hollows for a secret slide he was no locksmith but there was nothing wrong with the lock that he could see weve done all that said the guard with the lantern impatiently watching thur have you searched him for a key searched the cell to the skin twice to the skin um i dont suppose he could have that is uh did you no hedidnt stick a key up his ass said the guard sergeant dryly amused he didnt swallow and gag it up again either thur decided not to ask how he knew somebodys just going to have to watch him day and night the sergeant went on ive got to go fetch dinner said the younger guard nervously the sergeant eyed him in an ominous sergeantry manner but then shrugged were shorthanded all around ill ask the captain to assign us a convalescent it would be easy duty just sit on a bench opposite the door and watch and stay awake i wouldnt sleep down here said the younger guard fervently afraid of the spiders his comrade with the lantern mocked or the rats we ate the rats roasted in the prison in genoa and fried the spiders in garlic and axle grease no doubt his comrade returned testily nettled by what was apparently an ofttold tale of manly endurance its not the spiders that bother me but theres things in the walls uncanny things it disturbed thur a little that no one denied this nor accused the guard of drinking leave me the lantern thur suggested and ill watch him for a while maybe ill get some clue as to how he does it the castellan was seated crosslegged on the floor now rocking from side to side gaze fixed on nothing face like stone the guard sergeant nodded and his subordinate yielded the lantern to thur dont get too close he can grab you through the bars ill yell only if he doesnt grab you by the throat the guards returned to their immediate duties under the close eye of the sergeant who held a cocked crossbow they traded dinner pails into the crowded cells in return for full slops buckets which they carried off to empty in the garderobe none of the prisoners seemed inclined to try a violent escape attempt this evening though thur watched the rocking castellan a while then leaned against the wall opposite and closed his eyes he hardly required the lantern now he could find his destination with his eyes shut he was certain it thumped in his head so close down down at a moment when the guards were thoroughly busy at the far end of the corridor out of sight in the garderobe or their guard post thur picked up the lantern and trod silently into the dark crosscorridor the walls brushed his shoulders and the cut rock seemed to slant up toward the castle for a moment he doubted his underground intuition as the lantern cast a pool of orange light on the rising floor in front of him but then he found the stairs one set going up one down he went down a narrow hall at the bottom had four doors leading off it all solid wood this time two were not locked neither unlocked door was the one he wanted thur was heartcertain but he peeked within anyway storage chambers barrels of flour dusty wine casks provisions for the castle against a siege of man or weather green sparks flung back his lantern light from a corner the jewel eyes of a scuttling rat spider webs festooned the corners the spiders were smaller than the rats but not as much smaller as thur would have preferred he returned to the hallway this door he tried it again rattled it futilely then attempted to force it with his shoulder the iron lock groaned but held he should have borrowed some tools from the other workmen and tucked them into his tunic before hed started out if he went back and got some could he bluff his way back in here a second time how long before the guards above noticed his absence now now or never uri im here he squatted trying not to pull his aching cut and called softly under the crack of blackness at the bottom of the door uri uri why do i fear an answer the twisting sensation in his gut had nothing to do with his gash the dust on the floor beneath his nose moved swirling there was no draft thur lurched hastily to his feet sending a hot flash of pain ripping along his stitches he stepped back till he was stopped by the stone wall icy against his shoulders he swallowed a cry and stood silent heart pounding wait and see the dust swirled upward each tiny mote spinning in the lantern light into a familiar tenuous figure big cloth hat curling beard dont think of him as a ghost think of him as as your future fatherinlaw thur told himself wildly hello sir thur whispered panic and politeness squeezed his throat m master beneforte i came the faint suggestion of a hat seemed to dip in acknowledgement thur pointed to the lock can you help how powerful a poltergeist was the dead mage could this be the secret of the mad castellans escape it was only slightly better than imagining lord pia turning himself into a bat and slipping between the bars the ghost of a figure seemed to shrug like a man girding himself for a difficult task the dustfeatures anticipated pain a moment of preparation and the dust contracted and fell from the air inside the lock metal scraped stopped scraped again a clank and the door fell open a fingers breadth then silence utter as the stone thur took a deep breath reached and pulled the door open holding tightly to the lantern he stepped over the threshold and softly drew the door almost shut again behind him the room was larger than the other storage chambers and had a barred window tunnel to the cliff face like the cells above allowing good air a trestle table was shoved against one wall cluttered with boxes jars books papers a brazier it all reminded thur uncomfortably and exactly of abbot monreales magic workroom a leathertopped footstool in the shape of a small carved chest sat among the papers two iron candle racks held a dozen thick fine beeswax candles halfconsumed good work lights for things done in the night thur eased his tallow candle from the lantern and lit a few only then did he force himself to cross the room and examine what lay along the opposite wall two oblong crates lay side by side each upon a pair of trestles the crates were about six feet long cobbled together from coarse pine planks the pine lids were held on only by a single rope circling the middle of each crate cautiously thur touched one rope it did not rise to wind about his neck or any other trick of ensorcellment he yanked the slip knot and the rope fell to the floor thur had no cloth tucked in his tunic to press to his face so he merely held his breath and slid the lid aside well not altogether unexpected this the body of master beneforte still wrapped in the gauze from its smoking lay in a bed of glittering rock salt thur wondered vaguely why the apparition always appeared in the clothes hed died in and not this thin shroud which seemed more ghostly maybe the velvet court dress was a favorite the smell was not nearly so bad as thur had feared mostly the clinging notunpleasant scent of applewood stillthur counted over the summerheated daysferrante or vitelli must have added some powerful spell of preservation the tanned and bearded face was chill no ghost could animate this thick and heavy clay the way it animated weightless dust and smoke thur searched his heart for superstitious dread but the object before him seemed more sad than fearsome a battered old naked man whod lost everything even his vanity thur covered him back over with the pinewood lid reluctantly he turned and rugged the slip knot of the second crate then stood a moment screwing up his not courage exactly hope maybe it isnt uri many men have died this week in montefoglia for one moment longer he could hope then he would know you know already youve known from the beginning and no it wont be him thur shoved the lid back on a huff of decision his brothers face jutted from its matrix of salt both familiar and alien the oncehandsome features were all there undisfigured but the animating humor the sparkle and shout hungers and ambitions quick wit how empty this strange drawn pale visage was without them he died in pain that quality alone lingered in the stiff face thur looked down the nude body a single wound gaped darkly in its chest of which thurs hot belly cut seemed a thin parody he died swiftly long ago at least that half of the nightmare of uri suffering as a prisoner could be laid to rest if only you could have waited brother hung on i was coming i was there was no shortage of new nightmares to take the emptied place what did ferrante intend this chamber and its strange equipment for his own face feeling nearly as numb as his elder brothers thur walked around once more a cleared area in the center of the stone floor bore traces of chalk and lessidentifiable substances black necromancy indeed grimly thur took a little tambourine from his tunic whispered its activation and on tiptoe found a place for it on a high shelf behind a jar there that one ought to give monreales listening monks an earful he returned to his brother and for the first time touched the cold face only a husk uri was gone or at least gone from this clay but how far thur stared blindly around the chamber realizing abruptly that both his nightmares were literally true uri was dead and uri was a prisoner in this terrible place how do release you brother the muffled reverberation of a bass voice and the stony echo of a brief laugh sounded from beyond the chamber door appalled thur hastily pulled the plank cover back over uris crate banging his thumb painfully between box and lid to quiet the clatter too late to escape he turned around eyes raking the chamber for cover the candles blew themselves out all at once without a puff of breeze plunging the room into darkness scarcely relieved by the night glimmer of starlight reflected up from the lake through the deep barred window embrasure a hand that thur did not think he could have seen even in daylight grasped his shoulder down boy a whisper that moved on no breath tingled in his ear too frightened to argue he crouched and shuffled under the table the door clicked closed and the lock snicked shut thur shrank back against the wall and a piece of cloth poked into his hand with the insistence of a dog snuffling up to be petted it was light and soft like linen and he pulled it up over himself a real and solid iron key scraped in the lock and the bolt clacked back again thur peeked over his cloth cover at the wavering yellow glow reflecting from a handheld lantern the guards come looking for him two mens footsteps crossed the floor ones booted ones slippersoled i wish it were the guards he thought in sudden sick perception messer vitellis voice rang hollow in the stonewalled chamber do you smell hot wax my lord chapter eleven fiametta rubbed her drooping eyelids and stretched her arms high in an effort to fight off drowsiness the watered wine and bread shed had for supper was not so grand a feast as to induce torpor but shed slept poorly last night turning over and over on the crackling straw worrying about thur constantly disturbed by the rustling and coughing and movements of the other women in the overcrowded dormitory not to mention the fleas she scratched a red welt on her elbow abbot monreales workroom was warm the plastered walls of the secondfloor chamber still retaining the heat of the day and the light from the single candle beside her was golden and cozy she wriggled her hips on the hard perch of her barrelseat planted her elbows on the table and let her chin sink back into her hands on the tray before her the three remaining tambourines the mouthtwins to the little ears thur carried remained stubbornly mute were they still working yes her days practice at keeping them enspelled had made it an almost automatic process like absentminded humming they conveyed nothing because they had nothing to convey in the next room she could hear abbot monreale pause to cough pace and continue his dictation to brother ambrose a letter to the bishop of savoy describing their desperate situation calling for help magical if not military a futile letter how did monreale propose to dispatch it the day had passed in an ominous overheated quiet without even the usual desultory exchanges of curses and crossbow bolts between the besiegers and the defenders on the monastery walls no new herald or emissary had come to the gates today no new refugees no one at all it was as if lord ferrantes grip tightened chokingly around them she stared at the little circles willing them to speech three had come to life today two in the afternoon and one at dusk when shed been gone to supper initiate brothers had taken each one off to their cells where they sat with quills and paper ready to take note of important secrets she trusted the brothers were all staying awake too but anyway thur had still been alive and free at dusk she stifled a yawn if monreale glanced in and saw her fading he would send her to bed and she might miss the next word from thur why didnt the big fool think to speak into the eartambourines when he activated them and report on himself she gritted her teeth on her next yawn the white parchment circles swam before her eyes then without other warning oneflared fiametta supposed she must describe it though it was not an effect she saw with her eyes she took a deep breath of anticipation and sat up straight thurs voice whispering his badly accented latin drifted up from the tambourine to her straining ear talk to me thur but there followed only a scraping sound as of a jar shoved across a shelf footsteps crossed a stone floor then a sad meditative silence fell desperately fiametta tried to generate a picture in her mind from the mere sound stone floor harsh echoes a stone chamber rock wallsthe dukes dungeon true intuition or selfdelusion her hand pulled at the thong around her neck drew the lion ring from its warm hiding place between her breasts and closed over it what was thur seeing talk you swiss lout but the deep buzz of a voice that came suddenly from the tambourine was not thurs she could not make out words a tenor laugh followed then a muffled clatter hasty steps a clunk and a clack words rang in her mind that did not come through her ear down boy she stiffened in panic papa the sound of a door opening then and a strangers light voice do you smell hot wax my lord my lord where was thur had he fled her heart hammered from your lantern niccolo the bored bass voice was lord ferrantes his romagnan accent was distinctive she heard an odd muffled thunk as of something heavy being placed on a wooden table i think not returnedniccolosvoice these candles are warm then ow a scuffle of slippers as of a sudden recoil did you do that niccolo asked ferrante in an interested tone no ferrante laughed unkindly beneforte is playing his little tricks again his voice went mocking fiamettas imagination supplied a sweeping ironic bow thank you my servant for lighting my way a sucking soundburned fingers being licked hes not our servant yet growled niccolo abbot monreale fiametta whispered frantically then reminded herself that sound only flowed one way through the little earandmouth setscould that be alteredfather monreale she shouted come quick its lord ferrante himself monreale hurried through the door from his adjoining office followed after a scrape and crash of a chair falling and being righted again by brother ambrose still clutching his inky quill they bent over the tray of tambourines are you sure asked monreale i remember his voice from the banquet i dont know the other mans voice though ferrante calls him niccolo i think they are in a chamber beneath the castle ambrose take over monreale nodded toward the mouthtambourine i can enspell it as well as he can father fiametta wrenched held her tongue and passed the spellkeeping to ambrose his lips moved silently a moment then he settled in ferrantes voice asked how much more dare we strengthen him then before i do control him niccolo replied grumpily he must be fed and the very feeding brings him nearer to us its under control i admit i wish we could find his own damned notes on spirit rings we could catch him by his own magic most finely but he cant know that much more than i do well have him under our thumb soon enough none too soon for me ive had about enough of this midnight skulking ferrante spat eloquently great works require some sacrifices my lord hang the three bags on those hooks take care with the leather one to be sure rustling noises followed as the two men arranged whatever mysterious burdens they had been carrying abbot monreales eyes narrowed and his lips parted in concentration like fiametta trying to guess at actions from their sounds talk some more blast you he muttered under his breath oh for a dove now mourned ambrose they would not fly in the dark and theres no time to launch a bat nor could it see or hear much more than this sh monreale waved him to silence as the tambourine spoke again well said ferrantes voice shall we conjure beneforte now and compel him to tell us the secret of this saltcellar of his im certain i understand the secret of the salt my lord our trials with the animals and the prisoner were most convincing alone its ability to detect poison would make it a treasure for your table but its ability to purify as wellpure genius fine and good but i do not understand the secret of the pepper and i am not inclined to trust my life to something that holds secrets from me salt is white and pepper is black what more logical than that the salt embodies a white magic and the pepper a black slander fiametta hissed fool does he think papa would monreales hand on her shoulder tightened and she swallowed her outrage possibly allowed niccolo beneforte would have had to smuggle it past inspection by that prig monreale though monreale should have been an inquisitor he has the long nose for it he lacks the stomach for it so he would have men believe said ferrante sourly i know that voice muttered monreale by fiamettas ear niccolo niccolo what ambrose offered lord ferrante has a secretary named niccolo vitelli father hes said to be ferrantes shadow i was told hes been in ferrantes employ for about four years ferrantes men are wary of himi thought it was for his slyness but now it seems theres more to it monreale shook his head thats not what i but i suppose this vitelli could be the reason that ferrante who was never rumored to have any use for magic in his condottiere days seems to be up to his ears in it now the pepper did no harm to the animals lord ferrantes voice came persuasively from the parchment of course not fiametta muttered they have no power of speech and the spell engraved on the bottom of the saltcellar worked fine for the salt ferrante continued the second one must work for the pepper i think we should try it again upon a subject more capable of reporting subtle effects than lady julias lap dog we said vitelli in a suspicious tone i will speak the spell said lord ferrante and you shall place the pepper on your tongue but dont swallow it i see an unenthusiastic silence was followed by a very well lets get it over with there are more urgent tasks waiting tonight now fiametta could picture the chinks and thunks as ferrante squinting at the bottom of her fathers saltcellar by candlelight returning it to its ebony base and installing a bit of pepper in the little greek temple under the golden goddesss hand in a rapid whisper she interpreted the sounds for monreale and ambrose sure enough ferrantes voice soon intoned the latin prayer of the pepperspell try it now ordered lord ferrante after a moment vitellis voice reported in the odd muffled intonation of a man trying not to dislodge a pinch of pepper from his tongue i feel nothig my lor it cant be doing nothing pepper tongues do you feel inspired to eloquence perhaps no hm do you feel you could sway mens minds tell me a lie and convince me of its truth what color is my hair black mlor say red rrr black this last was sputtered out so as to almost lose the pepper but say red i cant black a brief silence my god whispered ferrante can the pepper compel truth took you long enough muttered fiametta truth is not something that much springs to his mind it seems observed ambrose no dont spit it out yet ferrantes voice ordered firmly i must be sure what what is your age thirtytwo mlor your birthplace milan youroh your name jacopo sprenger what ferrantes voice from the tambourine blended in astonishment with monreales as the abbot slammed his fists to the table and cried what it cant be fierce sputtering sounds emanated from the parchment circle and muffled noises as of a man frantically wiping his mouth out with a cloth does the spell compel truth ferrantes voice demanded of his secretary it seems so my lord said vitellisprenger in a distinctly surly tone after a short pause filled by whoknewwhat boiling glance from the lord of losimo the secretary went on reluctantly i took the name vitelli in my youth after a little difficulty with the law in bologna well so it is with half the scoundrels in my army but i didnt think you had any secrets from me my pet ferrantes tone was judiciously forgiving but with a dangerous hint of steel underneath all men conceal something vitelli shrugged uneasily his voice went bland would you care to try the pepper for yourself my lord no said ferrante the irony in his voice matched his secretarys i do think i believe you or believe beneforte anyway but god what a treasure can you imagine how valuable this could be when questioning prisoners or people who are attempting to hide their gold or goods the excitement of this vision sharpened his voice god abbot monreale moaned in quite a different tone is any magic any intention of men ever so white that it cant be perverted if even truth itself isnt godly his lips drew back on a grimace of pain who is jacopo sprenger brother ambrose whispered apparently like fiametta unable to quell the secret conviction that if they could hear ferrante ferrante could hear them is it possible the fellow on the towerbut hes grown so thin ill tell youlater sh monreale bent his ear to the tambourine again trying like fiametta to guess what the rustling noises of ferrante and vitelli s next preparations meant this time the occasional muttered word or order or scraping sound seemed to convey more to abbot monreale than to fiametta for he began to murmur interpretive guesses for ambrose and fiamettas benefit i believe they are drawing a sacred diagram upon the floor lines to contain the mystic forces of the planets or of their metals sacred names to compel or contain the forces of their spirits a peculiar combination of higher and lower magics i must say are they going to try and enslave papas spirit to that awful putti ring now asked fiametta unhappily no not tonight i think i dont hear anything that sounds like them setting up a furnace do you the ring must be newcast from molten metal at the time of the investment you see the metal must be fluid to take up the internal form of the spirit fiametta remembering the making of her lion ring nodded they could not recast that putti ring for your father anyway monreale went on silver is for a female spirit they should use gold for prospero beneforte ideally if they have any idea of what they are doing which unfortunately they seem to if vitelli is sprenger thats no surprise he was a brilliant student of monreale broke off as voices began again the black cat for the sorcerer the black cock for the soldier said vitelli hand me the bag with the cat my lord across the lines after i enter the square and close it his voice went off into another string of latin far more purely intoned than thurs or even ferrantes he enspells his blade monreale muttered what is he going to do with it asked fiametta tensely sacrifice a cat its lifei hesitate to call it its soul but anyway its spiritwill be given to your fathers ghost to strengthen it like a meal is it still alive demanded vitellis voice uncertainly a weak and piteous meow full of suffering and pain was made to answer him just barely said ferrante fiametta and ambrose exchanged a look of horror unlucky cat said ambrose his thick hands wrung just what are they doing to it asked fiametta enough for two men to burn for sh said monreale impatiently the cats voice rose to a terrified squall cutting across vitellis latin drone then went abruptly silent surely papa would refuse such an unclean offering said fiametta he wouldnt eat the poor kitty monreale shook his head face grim as granite but his brows wrinkled in puzzlement as vitellis chant started up again what are they can there be two the mysterious scene was reenacted but this time it was the squawking and flutter of a cock that fell to silence at the bite of vitellis darkly blessed blade a familiar name flashed past embedded in vitellis pure latin uri ochs fiametta repeated in horror oh no is heis captain ochs dead then he must be said monreale blackly to be a recipient of that spell that would explain why he was neither among the wounded prisoners or the dead who were returnederrante fancies a spare ring it seems poor thur breathed fiametta where was thur hed had scarcely time to escape between the time his breath had activated the little ear and the time ferrante and vitelli had entered the chamber of dread yet he must have escaped or hed have been discovered by now no monreale corrected himself judiciously captain ochs must have been selected first by ferrante on the very day he fell he had no known relatives in town to demand his body for burial it was your father fiametta who was added as an afterthought there vitellis voice sounded satisfied slapping sounds followed as if he were rising and dusting chalk and worse from the knees of his robe how much longer must we spend on this pedantry ferrante asked querulously i want my rings events of state will not wait on your thaumaturgic fiddling benefortes is a very dangerous ghost to attempt to invest my lord he is hostile and he knows far too much one little mistake vitelli paused reluctantly then added i think we can invest the soldier as early as tomorrow night that is the sensible order of things for then we can use him to help control the mage you bring the new bronze for the ring ill see to the fuel then you will have at least one ring ah to hand id rather have the swiss anyway ferrante remarked in a brighter tone hes not such a tricksy weasel as the florentine as a soldier he will doubtless understand obedience better perhaps i should keep the mages ring then suggested vitelli in a casual tone that did not quite hide an eager quaver there are two rings two of usit would be difficult for you to manage both said lord ferrante distantly no i dont think so the silence after that was distinctly sticky till vitelli broke it with a curt let us be done if you will take down the leather bag with the adder my lord the next noises were very hard to interpret until vitelli said are you quite certain you have the head end pinned through the leather this time my lord yes snapped ferrante impatiently open the bag and reach in or would you rather i did iwell if you wish my lord ill get the knot ah ha got him right behind the head see him grin for you niccolo hehheh ahnot so close if you dont mind my lord his venom would be wasted on me come along were almost done for tonight and i am weary to the bone ferrante grunted reluctant agreement a clattering sound like pine boards being wrestled about was followed by actions fiametta couldnt even guess at plus more of vitellis latin sprinkled with some hebrew or perhaps it was outright gibberish fiametta could scarcely tell what are they doing now she asked monreale i believe it is a spell based upon the principle of contrarity monreale listened intently it seems to be quite original i believe they are forcing the puff adder to er im sorry fiamettabite the corpse or the corpses it seems to be part of the preservation spell more rattling about and then suddenly a shout watch out it lashes dont drop the rapid scuttling of feet catch it you catch it its going under the table a brief silence you have boots on my lord said vitelli suggestively they will not protect my arms reaching under there in the dark if that is what you are implying said ferrante coldly you reach under there for it or enspell it out my little mage i am exhausted with spells vitellis voice sounded like it low and slow ferrante spat again but did not deny this after a pause he said come back and clean this place up in the morning when you can see better catch it then or perhaps by then it will have escaped slithered under the door come down from there now yes my lord said vitelli wearily a careful thumpvitelli letting himself down from a tabletopwas followed at length by a bit more rustling and rattling footsteps a door closing and the grating of a key in an iron lock then unbroken quiet when a nightingale warbled from outside monreales own workroom windows fiametta jumped the candle guttered low ambrose shook himself from his concentration and went to light new candles from the old before it went out the added illumination seemed to bring everyone back to the present monreale rubbed his face grooved deep fiametta stretched muscles gone rigid with tension the tambourine spoke no more surely thur must have somehow escaped the chamber before ferrante and his pet sorcerer had entered fiametta could only be glad he could not have witnessed the dreadful abuse of his brothers corpse and spirit papa resisted that horrible offering ferrante made didnt he father monreale monreale made no immediate answer though he gave her a small strained smile the two necromancers thought their effort a success he said at last but they could be mistaken selfdelusion is a common fault of those who dabble in the black arts fiametta judged this weak reassurance to be the desire to comfort her warring with honesty monreale being monreale honesty had the edge in a way she was glad ambrose drew up a wooden chair for the abbot and a stool for himself and sat heavily his brow channeled with dismay who is jacopo sprenger father besides apparently niccolo vitelli the clerk monreale settled back wearily looking deeply disturbed for a moment i thought he must be a demon himself till more natural explanations occurred to me about ten years ago the order sent me to study advanced spiritual thaumaturgy at the university of bologna under cardinal cardini that the church might qualify me to issue licenses to such master mages as your father fiametta in my college at that time was a brilliant young student from milan named jacopo sprenger he was of humble origins but had completed his bachelors work in the seven liberal arts and was close to being qualified as one of the youngest doctors of theology and thaumaturgy ever too young in my opinion brilliant but not wise that happens sometimes monreale sighed he was training to be an inquisitor again too heavy a burden for his age though i fear his intellectual pride was such that he would have been the last to recognize it he was drawn into a deep study of black witchcraft ostensibly to aid the inquisition as a specialist witchsmeller to stamp out the evil of witches perverted by the service of demons he was working on a treatise which he meant to dedicate to the pope that hed titled the hammer of witches the subject excited him greatly too greatly we finally recognizedtoo late he fell into the temptations of the object of his study as wizards sometimes do he began to actually experiment with demonology and it soon got out of hand who shall guard the guardians monreale stared into the candle flames and rubbed his exhaustionnumbed face with tired hands i fear i had not a little to do with the discovery of his er afterdark career he was expelled and brought to trial very quietly so as not to damage the reputation of the school i testified against him but before the verdict was issued he suicided in his cell swallowed a poisonous sublimate smuggled in to himor so i was told now i think his body must have been carried out still alive counterfeiting death through some combination of medical and magical means a committee consisting of cardinal cardini myself and a doctor from the college of law took up the problem of his papers cardinal cardini thought at first merely to put his book on the index until we examined it more closely sprenger had a hungry mind and a phenomenal memoryhis accumulation of spells anecdotes folklore and hearsay could have filled ten volumes but he had no sense his style was facile even compelling but his scholarship was weak his credulity unlimited his practical understanding of real courtsthe doctor of law threw up his hands sprenger seriously recommended that accused black witches be compelled under torture to name accomplices i know the tortures the holy inquisition uses and the sort of men that apply themcan you imagine the spate of wild accusations that would result each triggering more arrests more accusationswhy in a little time an entire district would be in an absolute uproar it was all incendiary to the point of hysteria i think it represented sprengerthe daytime sprengerstruggling desperately against his nightself i recommended the book and all his notes be burned ambrose himself a scholar in a minor way winced monreale spread his hands what would you have better to burn the book than the poor old hedgewitches who in my experienceyours too youve worked in the country districtsare nine times out of ten either mumbling old women with foggy minds or the malice of a neighbor trying to fix blame for the death of her maltreated cow or for some perfectly natural event like a hailstorm and the book was bad theology to boot ignoring the power of the name of christ tremendously dangerous we burned it all cardinal cardini was not so sure but i felt like a surgeon who had successfully stopped a gangrene through a timely amputation be that as it may sprenger himself was by the time of hiswe thoughtdeath utterly corrupt his will given over entirely to the pursuit of demonic power yet i felt id personally lost a soul for god the night i heard hed suicided and the devil laughed at me monreale shook his head in memory what are we going to do now father fiametta asked as the silence lengthened an ironic smile full of pain twisted monreales lips god knows i can only pray he will confide it to me but you have to do something to stop them quavered fiametta its black magic its in your holy vows to fight black magic tomorrow they mean to enslave poor captain ochs then papa and then ferrantes troops will arrive and then there will be no chance if we are to try anything it must be before the losimon infantry arrives ambrose agreed diffidently i dont need you to tell me that snapped monreale he controlled his nervous irritation with a visible effort squaring his slumped shoulders its not a simple problem its hard to conceive of a force sufficient to stop ferrante that does not itself partake of black magic some evil intent seeping through to imperil the soul but everyones depending on you like a soldier soldiers do awful things but we need them to protect us from from other soldiers said fiametta you need not tell me what soldiers do said monreale dryly fiametta flushed im well acquainted with the whole vile argument ive seen it used to justify crimes you can scarcely imagine and yet fiamettas eyes narrowed there is something you have it in mind something you can do dont you something magical i must pray on it you pray a lot will you still be praying when ferrantes army marches to the gate of saint jerome and batters it down when ferrante commands spirits with the wave of his hand fiametta demanded hotly if all youre going to do is pray why not hand over lord ascanio and everything now why not yesterday we might said brother ambrose slowly live to fight another day lay charges of black magic later upon lord ferrante and what herculean sergeantatarms shall we send to arrest the miscreants after they have made themselves undisputed lords and masters of two states said monreale softly staring again into the flames sprenger must remember me as surely as i do him i know he must hes been so very careful to keep from my sight i wonder if i would live to lay charges anywhere well then said fiametta his fingers told over the beads in his lap he glanced up at her from under tufted gray brows i am not a powerful mage fiametta not as powerful as your papa or even some of the lesser mages here in montefoglia god knows i tried to be once it has been my burden to have an understanding greater than my talent those who can do those who cant ambrose interjected a little negative huff spreading his hands in denial not so father one corner of monreales lips twisted up my good brother by what standards do you imagine you judge did you think it was only a monastic calling that holds me here in montefoglia firstrate talents go to rome go to the sacred college lesser men find themselves buried in rural provinces in my youth i dreamed of being a marshall by the time i was twentyfive i put away those military follies only to replace them with dreams of becoming a cardinal thaumaturge before i was thirtyfive god gave me humility at last for god knew i needed it sprengerif vitelli is indeed hehad a talent stronger than his understanding now after it has had ten years to grow cunning in dark and secret hes found a powerful patron who protects him funds him lends him his animal vitalityfor ferrante has great strength of will make no mistake add to that a spiritslave of the order of master beneforte and their potency will be he broke off ambrose cleared his throat i confess father your words unsettle my stomach my calling is to save souls not lives monreales fingers worked souls can be saved later fiametta pointed out urgently when you lose lives you lose lives and souls both monreale shot her a peculiar grin have you ever considered taking up scholastic studies fiametta but no your sex forbids an insight shook her youre not afraid of losing your soul youre just afraid of losing afraid of having his selfaccusation of secondratedness finally confirmed ambrose drew in his breath at this blunt insult but monreales grin merely stretched his eyes were lidded unreadable go to bed fiametta he said at last ambrose i will send brother perotto to watch and maintain this ear through the night though i suspect the show is over for the moment he stood up shook out his robes and rubbed his face ill be in the chapel chapter twelve thur sat very very still the puff adders earlier agitation had passed off but now instead of burrowing under thurs crossed legs as if beneath a little cave ledge it had looped itself entirely around his calf and thigh for warmth presumably thur could feel the cool waxy scales through his fine hose as the snake hitched itself up another couple of inches as long as thur remained the best source of heat in the room the viper seemed disinclined to move away thur dared not even move the dark linen cloth still draped stuffily over his head and body he needed to piss and his nose itched abominably he dreaded a sneeze he tried to wriggle his nose twitching and stretching his lip but it didnt help greatly how much time had passed since the two necromancers had left this rockcut chamber an eternity still the pitchy darkness was unrelieved by the slightest gray hint of dawn if he could just see the cursed reptile he would match his hand against the speed of its strike and try to grab it behind the head but to grope for it in the dark yet he could not sit like this much longer the cold stone floor stole the heat from his numbing buttocks and his leg muscles unrelieved for too long by any change of position threatened to spasm movement when it came was not the prayedfor departure of the adder but the scrape of a key in the lock again the snakes coil tightened around thurs leg light booted footsteps crossed the floor and stopped at one side of the room a faint crockery clatter was followed by a tiny gurgle as of someone pouring liquid from a jug thenthur froze if possible more still though his heart beat fastervitellis voice in a brief latin chant the snake twitched a pause in more impatient tones vitelli repeated his words the snake unwound a little more but made no move to leave thurs lap well it was probably just a country snake maybe it didnt understand vitellis fine school latin thur suppressed an hysteric giggle vitelli swore under his breath damned stupid snake probably escaped by now have to send a pigsoldier to venice tomorrow to buy another the footsteps departed in an irate shuffle the door was locked once more the snake vented a surly hiss thur blinked tears of frustration and fear which trickled maddeningly down the inside of his nose he must try a grab a tiny scuttling noise crossed the chamber only in this stonesilence and nightstillness could thur have heard it exacerbated though his senses now were the snake seemed to hear it too its head rose and wove from side to side then coil by coil it slid from thurs leg and out from under the linen cloth it seemed to take an age for it to remove its entire length thur held his breath for several more seconds then let it go with an explosive huff in a frantic fluid motion he rolled out from under his cramped tableprison and vaulted atop it instead he grabbed for a dislodged iron candelabrum felt but scarcely seen before it could fall with a clang his eyes straining in the utter darkness beneath the cloth for so long could actually make out dim shapes in the faint starlight reflecting from the lake through the deep window his table the crates on their trestles the light was not good enough for him to see the adder though master beneforte he quavered will you light me one candle no response more hesitantly uri please his hands shaking thur felt along the tabletop papers knives cool metal tools a little box a tinder box thur opened it but found it contained only a soft powder he almost licked his fingers to try to identify it but on second thought wiped them on his tunic instead odd scrabbling noises came from the floor clicking and a weird tiny animal shriek which thur tried to ignore could snakes climb table legs hed heard of snakes in trees another heavier box proved more lucky flint and steel made familiar weights in his hands he struck sparks found the tinder in their light and managed after several tries to ignite a splinter it almost went out before he could raise it to a candle wick but after dying to a tiny blue globe the yellow flame flared up from the wax thur kneeling on the tabletop decided it was the most beautiful flame hed ever seen he reignited the splinter and lit the entire candelabrum six short slagged and nearly spent beeswax lumps then he looked around for the adder no wonder the snake had seemed to go on forever the creature was four feet long it was coiled to one side of the floor near a saucer of milk its jaws were stretched wide its throat distended the back half of a very large rat stuck out of its mouth the rats rear legs spasmed and its tail twitched in a wild leap thur sprang upon the snake grabbed it tightly with both hands around its stuffed throat to keep it full of rat and unable to twist and bite ran to the window and crammed it out through the bars after a moment a faint splash echoed back from the lake below thur sank to the floor gasping for breath several minutes passed before his other troubles began to crowd back into his mind again looking around thur decided vitelli must have brought the saucer of milk for the snake it certainly couldnt have been meant for the cat thur grimaced at the gruesome pile of animal parts left to coagulate in the center of a complicated diagram drawn on the floor in red and white chalk stepping carefully around the marks he tried the door the lock did not open from this side without the key either how much time had really passed the guards upstairs must have missed him by now searchedthough not in here thur was fairly sure no one came in here voluntarily except ferrante and vitelli master beneforte thur whispered uri master beneforte can you open this lock again no response from the spirits this time either yet thur had seen beneforte earlier his intense sense of uris presence had driven him down here thur eyed the papers scattered over the table a conjuring compelled a spirit to appear whether it wanted to or not thur didnt suppose hed be so fortunate as to find such a recipe jotted down he turned the papers over more latin mostly he knew words here and there master beneforte please what the irritated tone was sick shaken but somehow stronger not so effortful as benefortes earlier desperate attempts to communicate thur turned staring into every corner of the chamber but no dustghost wavered in the draft that fluttered the candles only the voice where where is my brother can you see him from where you are why doesnt he speak thur asked the emptiness a long silence thur began to fear that benefortes ghost had fled the chamber and left him when the reluctant reply whispered he is a weaker shade he has not had the lifetime of the spiritual manipulation of the world of matter that my profession my art gave to me now my clay has dropped away my blind eyes are opened to such visions but oh i did not think i would miss the sensations of my gross flesh so much the slow voice died away in longing it seemed to be centered in a position over the chalk diagram how can i rescue you what should i do vitelli says he means to enslave my brother tomorrow night ferrante might not be so bad a lord to serve benefortes voice murmured judiciously ferrante sandrino lorenzo a prince is a prince service is service ferrante talks of having my perseus cast id think hed be more likely to melt it down for cannon said thur true hes been more a patron of the art of war than the art of sculpture but he is not immune to the attraction of glory in that form glorifying himself with my perseus he would immortalize me but youre dead thur pointed out inanely three nights ago you cried for help as if to save your soul literally well souls now the ghostly voice trailed off why hurry to that world after all can you see another world thur asked awed frightened i glimpsed a light it almost hurt did hurt but youre supposed to go there not stay here this was not the urgent apparition of three nights ago speaking now thur realized with a chill how much had the necromancers black rites already sapped benefortes will vitelli is no prince do you itch to serve him that milanese dabbler secondrate scumi could have him under my a glow like a dazzled afterimage in the eye zigzagged through the chamber a flash of anger pure will your papa could be in danger of becoming a demon thur felt a cold knot twist in his gut if benefortes spirit was already becoming corrupted for how much longer could thur trust him he scarcely seemed to be struggling against ferrante any more not too late no but what could thur do the bodiesvitelli and ferrante seemed to need the bodies to complete their vile rites could thur steal them away somehow he could not lift even one of those salt crates by himself let alone two and there were the stairs to climb and the guards to get past a wild vision of setting the chamber afire and reducing the corpses to ash foundered on an obvious lack of sufficient fuel if the bodies were only partly destroyed could vitelli still use them thur was crouched before the lock smiling in his desperation when an oddly familiar flicker tickled the corner of his eye he tilted his head staring into the wavering candlecast shadows across the room could beneforteor uribe struggling to take up material form that liquid moving shadow by the wall was no rat nor unsettling thought another snake the shadow stepped from the wall taking on dimension as it did so and skittered to hide coyly behind a trestle leg a little mannikin not two feet tall good god said thur in startlement i didnt know you had kobolds here theres quite a little colony of them in the hills west of town benefortes ghostly voice remarked eerily conversational i thought they only lived in mountain wastes didnt go near mens towns thats generally true but they are attracted to magic i had rather an outbreak of them for a while they came up under my house to spy on my doings in my shop pesky and they move things about but not malicious if you dont attack them yes thats the way ours are in bruinwald agreed thur the shadowy little figure flickered to shelter behind a nearer trestle leg beady eyes flashed at him i trapped one once beneforte reminisced i made it bring me some raw silver and beryls it claimed there is no gold to be had in the ground in these parts i finally let it go and after that its kin grew wary and stayed away from my shop and i was not troubled further i thought they were mainly attracted to milk which they cannot get underground or so it is in the mountains they sometimes steal from unguarded pails after the cows or goats are milked and there was a wet nurse in the village who got in a lot of trouble when she was found to have silver nuggets in her possessionshe was accused of stealing them or of tying with the miners who had stolen them from work but she claimed she was trading her milk to the kobolds milk yes came a thin hopeful voice from behind the trestle we like milk i used milk to bait my kobold trap beneforte confirmed at home they mainly eat a bread made from fungus which they grow underground in their colonies milk is better man wine to them i never heard of them stealing wine my mother leaves milk out for them in secret on all hallows eve thur confessed with a prayer for safety in the mines brother glarus would not approve its always gone the next day they swim through the rock as a man might swim through water strange benefortes voice hesitated i can see them now though my eyes are see all around see through the rock there have been half a dozen of the rockfolk hanging around under the castle since vitelli arrived and began his activities i think vitelli worries them a little vitelli worries all of us a twiggy finger pointed from behind the trestle toward the saucer of milk not a trap my lords it inquired you dont want it yes its not my milk said thur you can have it for all of me vitelli put it there for his snake but i cant guarantee its not poisoned or something you need my saltcellar beneforte said smugly thur glanced at the table they took it with them solid gold ferrante would hardly have left it lying about even without its magic properties do i even need the salt now to focus benefortes voice went meditative my eyes are wide if i dare see thur saw nothing but a felt presence near the saucer of milk made the hairs stir on his arms the opaque white surface of the liquid shivered vitelli has laced it with an opiate to stun the snake benefortes voice reported can i dare i a blue flame rose from the surface of the milk and burned off in a long streamer its purified now said beneforte his voice was elated i couldnt have done that when i was clouded by my flesh thur glanced uneasily at the diagram and its spent unclean offering on the floor nearby you could not have done that yesterday ill wager the kobold crept warily out to the saucer thank you my lord it addressed beneforte wherever he was a second kobold and a third oozed up out of the stone beside the first they all knelt down on their gnarled little hands and lapped at the milk for all the world like three scrawny barn cats around a bowl these hillkobolds were lighter in color than the granitegray little men of bruinwald with a yellowish cast to their skins like the montefoglian sandstone the two new ones were naked though their leader wore an apron much like its mountain cousins the milk level dropped rapidly the leader picked up the saucer as large as its head and licked it clean it gave thur a blackeyed stare over the rim of the crockery then abruptly all three melted down into the stone and were gone without even a thankyou thur blinked and tried the door lock again it still held fast master beneforte how should i save you and my brother and myself i grow weary the ghostly voice breathed i cannot speak any more evasive is what master benefortes shade grew thur decided unhappily not good he tried to think through the haze of exhaustion that numbed his face and filled his head with fog he was swaying on his feet he felt in his tunic he still had two little ears left three should he chance upon some better place to hide the one hed left in the grooms loft abbot monreale had explicitly urged him to try to smuggle an ear to the imprisoned duchess if he could up in her tower well ned made his way down to the dungeon right enough it was monreales job to fight black magic it was thurs job to follow monreales orders if he could his jaw tightened he could not get past the guards till he solved the problem of getting out of this room enough odd tools were scattered on the table and shelves if nothing else he could simply take the blasted lock apart but when thur approached it with a hastily grabbed awl in his hand he found he could not make the metal penetrate the keyhole nor dig beneath the nails the lock was ensorcelled protected as if by some invisible unbreakable glass benefortes ghost of course had not had a problem with it benefortes ghost walked through walls if it chose thur ground his teeth master beneforte thur made his voice placative plaintive please let me out no response for fiamettas sake all he could hear was the blood beating in his own ears uri if you love me he swallowed the harsh edge of panic in the unanswering silence the horror of being trapped in this cell with the dead and the subtle aftershock of black sorcery bore in upon him help me this time the felt presence was not benefortes cool coherent power but something raw and wild a strange blue glow like miniature lightning writhed over the iron lock when the bolt clacked back the presence fell away like something wounded pain the action had cost pain and will uri was truly here mute but by no means impotent and not vitellis creature not yet thur bowed his head thank you brother he whispered staggering a little thur relit the guards tallowcandle lantern it had sat on the floor by the table the whole time unnoticed why should ferrantes eye be caught by something so humble and familiar as his own armyissue equipment thur blew out the remains of the beeswax lights and slipped from the chamber as silently as he could he pulled the door shut behind himselfill be back somehow uri with a plan with the abbot with an army it took thur a moment to reorient himself in the hallway he trod cautiously up the narrow stairs his ears straining for the slightest breath or creak of a guard waiting in ambush none waited in the corridor to the prisoners cells the stairway twisted around itself like vitellis snake rising into the castle in the pitchy darkness at the top thur found a solid oaken door locked of course he retreated to the corridor on the prison level it was his aching bladder that finally decided his course of action from the pungent aroma the dark space at the end of this corridor had been used as a makeshift garderobe by men before thur he relieved himself in the same spot trying to splash quietly he then blew out the lantern tiptoed down the corridor set the lantern down lay on the stone floor pillowed his head on his arm closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep weirdly distorted images of the nights events flickered through his imagination as he waited for a guard to discover him he told over his tale to himself for practice but his thoughts tailed off in darkness an explosive curse brought thur blinkingly awake his body ached with the cold and pressure of the stone his first attempt to lumber up was sabotaged by twinges of pain a booted foot kicked him though not very hard what what thur choked blearily his disorientation only halffeigned he had slept in truth the guard sergeant was looming over him with a lantern and a hard frown his shout brought a second guard running with a drawn dagger thur sneezed where did you come from demanded the guard sergeant harshly where have you been a volley of sneezes delayed thurs answer long enough for him to get his thoughts in order mother of god he wheezed with feeling i have just had the strangest dream he sat up rubbing his eyes and nose did i fall asleep im sorry i promised to watchthe madmans not out is he thur clutched the guard sergeants boot no oh good thank god for a minute there i for a minute you what for a minute i thought it was real my dream what time is it almost dawn it cant be i just went down the corridor to piss a couple of minutes ago you disappeared youve been gone all night no you were just serving the prisoners dinner i went down the corridor and i was coming back i heard the pails clanking and then nd then then what i felt so tired all of a sudden it was as if something came over mei just lay down here on the floor for a moment and i had this wonderous dream and then you found me and woke me the two guards eyed one another uneasily what was your dream foundryman asked the junior man the mad castellan changed into a bat before my eyes and then he changed me into a bat too we flew south to rome absurd ive never been to rome thur ran his hands through his hair in a dazed way we could see it all at a glance from the air watchlights gleaming on the tiber the pope all in glowing white robes was standing on the balcony of a great palace the castellanstill in the form of a bat with batears but he had the face of a manlanded on his holinesss shoulder and whispered in his ear and the pope whispered back and touched him with his ring and then we flew home thur ended simply he stopped his tripping tongue just short of adding oh my arms are tired ferrantes guards had good reason to be credulous of the uncanny but not infinitely credulous but weve been over this corridor ten times said the younger guard you werent quiet giovanni the sergeant cut across him he hauled thur roughly to his feet the sergeant was shorter than thur but strong he stared at thur with angry worried eyes do you think you might have been ensorcelled foundryman i i dont know ive never been ensorcelled before i thought it was a dream i must have you checked by an expert that was not in thurs plan almost dawn my god ive got to get to work lord ferrante demands his cannon without delay where will you be working inquired the sergeant narroweyed in the garden or back courtyard or whatever you call it i must build the furnace tomorrowtoday that is very well so long as i know where to find you giovanni escort my lords foundryman to his work eh speak of this to no one ill do the reporting thur had a strong sense that he had not much time left he found his work mates from yesterday just rising to go to a kitchenbreakfast of hot mutton wrapped in bread whatever ferrantes other sins he made sure that his men were wellfed thur took care not to bring up the topic of where hed spent the night thur and the laborers went out in the cold dawn fog to the foundry site at the end of the walled castle garden the trampled grass was slippery underfoot but the moisture was a tease when thur looked directly overhead he could see through the mist to the high blue vault of a cloudless heaven already illuminated by a sun that had yet to clear the eastern hills glad as thur was to see light after the nights dark doings he wished time would slow down pink rays touched the castle towers thurs new goal all too soon thur directed the workmen automatically all the while trying to figure how to get away from them and into that tower he stacked bricks around the proper curve of the oventobes walls and tried to think through a throbbing head he must deliver an ear to the duchesshide the extra twoand be gone from this accurst castle by noon at the latest then make it somehow back to the monastery and demand magical help for uri could they sneak a boat with muffled oars to the base of the cliff wall after dark climb or levitate to the tombchambers window and then what or should thur try to assassinate vitelli this afternoon before he could perform the next set of vile rites ferrante though he was involved to the eyebrows did not seem to be the driving will behind this wholesale foray into the black arts thur shivered at the thought of a blade in his hand driving into the thick resistance of a mans flesh was it even possible to murder a mage foolish questionthink of master beneforte death came to mages as to other men or perhaps not quite as to other men would another murder create another malevolent ghost or worse maybe monreale could shrive it and send it on its way shrive them all thur fitted the bricks for the furnace floor and plotted his escape as soon as he reached the end of this row by excusing himself to go to the garderobe a pounding noise came from the heavy timber gate to the stables at the end of the garden someone was unblocking it with a mallet thur looked up a couple of big loud losimon soldiers in steel and leather backed through pulling on a rope their whoops seemed too goodnatured to go with some combat and thurs work mates after first freezing at their shovels relaxed and leaned on them to watch following the losimon soldiers came a train of mules roped together packsaddletohalter the first mule was a distinctive gray the second honeybrown with a creamcolored nosethe gailystriped saddle blankets were all too familiar oh jesus it was picos mule train would the packmaster blurt out recognition of thur would thur be dangling by his neck from the castle wall hanged as a discovered spy within the halfhour thur crouched down in his halfbuilt furnace and stared wildly damn it pico had said he was going to cut over the hills to milan what bad angel had inspired him to bring his load of copper to sell in montefoglia instead now of all times but the eighth mule walked stiffly through the gate with no sign of pico or of his two boys only a quartet of dismounted losimon cavalrymen tugged the animals along thur stood up from his crouch wary and confused hey foundryman shouted the lead soldier where do you want us to put this thur almost answered stack the pigs in pairs over there but gulped down his mistake and said instead put what he walked toward the mule train the mules were sweaty and dirty under their harness iridescent green flies were already plaguing new pink raw spots showing under the edges of the leather straps one mule had been limping and now stood with a hind hoof held gingerly tiptoe all dove their heads to the grass and weeds at their feet smacking dry and thirsty lips my lords new copper the soldier flicked up the canvas of a packsaddle and pointed proudly to a thick metal bar thur stared at the lathered and exhausted animals pico would never have permittedwhere is piis the packmaster thur demanded dread lent his voice an unaccustomed harshness gone to god grinned the soldier he left us these in his will eh thur swallowed where did you find them we were on patrol foraging up north of the lake yesterday too damn far from home we were just about to quit and go back when we came upon this fellows camp in the hills our lieutenant fancied thisd be a gift to my lords taste so we took em we ran them all night to get here stubborn beasts we had to beat em with the flats of our swords to keep em moving toward the end yes several of the animals haunches showed long bloody welts thur had to allow ferrantes cavalrymen were just as cruel to their own beasts and to each other the sweatstained filthy soldiers features were lined with a fatigue scarcely less than that of the drooping mules but the mules lacked his greedy elation pi didnt the packmaster i take it the packmaster objected thur struggled to keep his voice cool disinterested a length of my officers spanish steel settled the argument soon enough the soldier paused thoughtfully didnt much care for what he did to the boy the lad wouldnt stop trying to fight us after it was over halfmad i think though his elder brother had a better head and tried to hold him well twas no worse than some of the things that happened after the last siege of pisa did he what did he do to the boy half chopped off his head it stopped the screaming right enough which was a relief killed him thur choked outright the soldier spat reflectively couldve been worse thur gripped his hands behind his back to hide their trembling did he kill both boys naw the smarter one ran off the soldier glanced up ah here we go thur followed his gaze to the doors to the castle just descending into the garden was lord ferrante dressed in the same fine mail tunic and leather leggings as yesterday morning a clean white linen undercollar shone at his neck and a gold badge in his green hat winked diamonds in the sun flanking him stamped another dirty and fatigued cavalryman a dusty black beard framed a dark smile missing several front teeth thur stiffenedbut there was no reason to suppose the man would recognize him from cattis inn it had been dusk in the innyard and thur had hung in the background till things went so terribly wrong i should have recognized the man from his methods though thur thought wearily so said ferrante bluffly coming up to thur what value have we here german thur walked to a saddlebag and pretended to examine its contents finest swiss copper my lord is it fit for our needs is it sufficient more than sufficient thur fingered master kunzs mark stamped on the soft red bar ive heard of this forge very pure very good lord ferrante turned to his men and took a purse from his waist he poured gold coins into his hand held them up for all to see poured them back and handed the purse to his gaptoothed minion for distribution the men cheered unload these beasts then send your men to eat ferrante directed his lieutenant deliver the mules to my quartermasters constable outside the walls ferrante frowned walking down the line of mules see that they get water and hay and their harness off before you eat tell my head groom to check that duns offhind hoof my mules must be made to last ferrante wheeled away and strode back into the castle under thurs wooden direction the hungry men made short work of unloading and stacking the copper pigs on the ground beside the furnace laughing and joking about their newwon gold the soldiers led the mules back into the castle stable a bird trilled from the white blossoms of a plum tree espaliered to the garden wall the workmen returned to their digging shovels scraping through the hardpacked earth the line of light creeping across the ground as the sun rose higher reached the stack of copper edging it with blinding red fire thur swallowed nausea im going to the garderobe he said turned and stumbled from the garden chapter thirteen thur really did go to the garderobe a slit cut into the castle wall at the back of the stables and used by the grooms and the workmen but he exited again without as he had at first feared being violently ill he leaned shakily against a stall partition and listened to the steady munching of a horse eating its hay the presence of the big animals soothed him a little the dumb beasts were innocent though god had made balaams ass speak out against injustice or so brother glarus had told the story why not picos mules an unfamiliar trembling shortened thurs breath hatred wrath as the list of the seven deadly sins had it the murder of picos boy zilio so bluntly described burned in his imagination angered him almost more than the death of uri uri had been a man taking a mans risks the losimons hadnt any call to kill a child they could have knocked him aside or tied him up or something his righteousness died as an image of the wheyfaced boy groom across ferrantes saddlebow troubled his mind he shook his aching head in bewilderment he made his way to the stable door into the main court a couple of grooms had taken picos mules outside and tied them to ringbolts in the wall in the narrowing shade they had watered them and stripped them of their harness and now were rubbing them down and daubing goose grease on their sores the mules snatched at little piles of hay and grumpily laid their long ears back and nipped at each other thur squinted into the heat of the courtyard and the light reflecting blindingly off the bulbous marble staircase the sun was higher did it always climb this fast of a morning across the pavement at the base of the northern gatetower two guards stood flanking a small entry arch thur felt in his tunic for the two remaining ears and studied the men they looked harderfaced more alert than the fellow whod been sitting tiredly by the dungeon door last night dare thur try his thin story about checking the bolts and bars a second time while thur stood trying to muster up his courage the little door swung inward and the guards came to attention a losimon officer exited followed by three women who stood blinking in the light two women and a girl thur corrected himself the first was a darkhaired prettily plump matron of perhaps twentyfive wearing a crocusyellow linen gown the second older woman wore black and white silk she was a little faded blonde sandyhaired sandycomplexioned her face drawn and stiff in the shade of a brimmed hat the girl almost as tall wore pale green linen and a close cap a braided rope of gold hair falling from her nape she clung tightly to the faded woman s arm the officer gestured them onwards palms open like a man herding sheep frowning at him they scuffled across the courtyard and up the marble stairs disappearing into the castle thur bit his lip then walked quickly back through the stable and climbed over the rear gate into the castle garden his work mates made a few sharp comments about shirkers as he hurried past the brick pile but he had not strode half the length of the garden when the women reappeared at its main entry and then descended into the open still dogged by the officer thur hesitated and bent to pretend to knock a bit of gravel from his shoe the silkgowned woman went to sit on a marble bench under a grape arbor the tender green leaves making a woven shade the girl and the dark woman in crocusyellow linked arms protectively and strolled upon a gravel walk the noble prisoners were being aired it seemed for how long dare he just walk up to them the officer lingered close by within hearing confused by this ambiguous nearopportunity thur retreated to his brick pile and made to lay on another course all the time watching down the garden the duchesss hat turned toward him once then away the strollers paused by her bench then they strolled toward him thur held his breath the officer made a step to follow but then changed his mind and waited near the duchess leaning on an arbor post with his arms crossed the two young women drew nearer the girl must be lady julia the matron some sort of ladyinwaiting one or the workmen made a coarse comment under his breath lamb or mutton its all for my lords table his companion murmured back with a sour grin not even a scrap for us ill wager shut up thur growled the laborer frowned back but perhaps daunted by thurs size swallowed whatever insubordinate jape was on his tongue and bent again to his shovel thur walked around his furnace base with a judiciously measuring glance trying to look like the man in charge he evidently succeeded for upon coming up the darkhaired woman inquired of him what are you doing here workman tearing up our poor garden thur ducked his head in a clumsy halfbow and immediately trod nearer to her were building a furnace madonna to repair that bombast yonder thur pointed to the green pot by whose order she asked stepping back lord ferrantes of course thur gestured expansively and stepped close enough at last to lower his voice he blurted out quickly my name is thur ochs brother to your guard captain uri ochs abbot monreale sent me im only passing myself off as a foundryman the dark womans hand tightened on the girls arm go fetch your mother at once julia no thur began to protest but the girl was already scampering away we mustnt be seen to be conversing in secret it will give all away he turned and began pointing at various parts of the foundry operation as if still explaining its function the workmen just beyond earshot turned their curious eyes away to follow the gestures and thur slipped a little ear from his tunic and whispered its activation spell into his palm he let his concealing hand drop casually to his side flashing it briefly toward the woman this is a magic ear when you talk into it abbot monreale and his monks at saint jerome will be able to hear you hide it quickly staring at the bombast she pulled a handkerchief from her sleeve and touched it to her face as if she were feeling the heat it fell from her hand thur bent to retrieve it ear and handkerchief disappeared into her sleeve again she save him a polite nod of thanks but stepped back as if repelled by his peasant stench or perhaps she really was repelled by his peasant stench his gray tunic was stained with the sweat of the hot mornings labor duchess letitia arrived in tow of lady julia the older woman at least had the wit to gaze out over the work site first instead of directly at thur this foundryman claims to be an agent of bishop monreales the darkhaired woman murmured thur swallowed and made an unfeignedly awkward bow worklout introduced to duchess the play might well pass at a distance letitias redrimmed faded blue eyes grew hard as steel she stepped to thur and gazed up into his face her hand clutched convulsively at his sleeve monreale she breathed does he have ascanio yes lady safe at the monastery her puffy eyelids closed thank god thank the mother of god but the monastery is besieged by losimons i have to get back there to get help my brother is killed and ferrante and vitelli are trying to enslave his ghost to a spirit ring i have to stop them but i dont know how the duchesss eyes opened again killing them would do it she observed dispassionately i havent had a good chance thur stammered only halftruthrully hed had chances they just hadnt been good enough i bet they would have been good enough for uri if i could but lay hands on my ebony rosary i swear i would make my own chance letitia stated her eyes turned away once again concealing the intimacy of this conversation the woman in yellow folded her arms beg pardon said thur see you mando you think you could make your way in secret to my chambers there is an ebony rosary in my escritoire or there was if it hasnt been looted by now its very distinctive with gold wire flanges on its end hangs a little ivory ball cunningly carved if you could find it and bring it to me the cracked bombast itself will be melted down to make up part of the metal thur interrupted her loudly he widened his eyes at her desperately signalling lord ferrante had just exited the castle he looked around and spied the women waved away his officers salute and started down the garden the guard followed to take station discreetly beyond hearing leaning up against the outer curtain wall ferrante held a small rather scruffy dog with protuberant brown eyes under his arm thur continued the rest we shall melt new lord ferrante deals us no shortages in our work julia at first shrank nearer to her mother but then saw the little dog pippin she cried the dog wriggled frantically ferrante scratched its ears to calm it then bent and released it it ran to its mistress and jumped up on her skirts yipping then tore around the garden in circles it returned to julias calling at last and she picked it up and cradled it in her arms dropping kisses on its head the darkhaired woman made a scandalized face dont kiss the dog julia i thought hed killed poor pippin a fierce glower toward ferrante identified the accused tears sparkled in her eyes i only said i wished to borrow him said ferrante in a reasonable indeed kindly tone see here he is back safe and sound you must learn to trust my word if we are to get on lady julia all three women gave him identical repelled glares as if forced to look upon a centipede or a scorpion ferrante shifted and grimaced are we to get on inquired the duchess coldly consider the advantages ferrante shrugged and added with a matching glint of ice consider the disadvantages if you dont choose to strike some devils bargain with my lord and husbands murderer never never is a long time life goes on you have children to provide for its very true we have all suffered an unfortunate accident its not one i looked for and im sorry i lost my temper but i was goaded what would you wrath is a mans sin yet you dare still suggest i bind julia to a life under that threat snapped letitia to become the next victim from my family to your wrath and how did your first wife die my lord truly you are mad ferrantes jaw clamped he produced a strained smile and drew a leather ball from the figured purse hung from his belt here julia he turned to the girl his voice deliberately gentled i brought you a ball for er pippin why dont you take him down to the other end of the garden and see if he will fetch it for you i wager he will julia glanced uncertainly at her mother who had locked eyes with ferrante yes love letitia agreed thinly do that reluctantly the girl put down her dog and obeyed with a backward glance or two pippin reeled around her following my lady the woman in yellow raised her brows with a nod after julia stay by me lady pia said the duchess i would have a witness to this mans next crime whatever it turns out to be ferrante rolled his eyes in exasperation think letitia whats done is done and no one can call it back you must look to the future and let the past go his hand tightened then stretched out carefully flat on the leather legging of his thigh next to his sword his eye fell on thur standing there trying to look invisible go back to work german ferrante waved him curtly away thur bowed and retreated to the nearest spot his broken brick pile crouched and pretended to be sorting them by size ferrante glowered over the work site a moment then followed lowering his voice so foundryman when will my cannon be cast never you bastard if i work steadily through the day my lord i might have the furnace built by sundown then it must be lined with clay and the clay dried and fired could you do that tonight i could but to fire it while still damp risks cracking mm risk it ferrante ordered with a quick glance at the sun time bit at his heels too it seemed theres still the bombast mold to make my lord the furnace may as well dry slowly while thats being done ah yes ferrante frowned at the brickwork his face abstracted was he seeing in his minds eye his bombast battering down the walls of saint jerome and then what the breach in the wall fought for taken monks and sandrinos soldiers slain womenfiametta godtormented refugees chased from corners put to the sword while crying futilely for sanctuary in the chapel would fiametta be among them surely she would fight like a cat and be killed for it not prettily thur did not think fiametta had the knack of surrendering a frightened ascanio dragged out from under the priors bed to have his throat slit like picas boy though neither guards nor stone walls had defended zilio not that it seemed to alter the end result killing them would do it thur was alone beside ferrante his knife in its sheath on his belt pressed against the small of his back like a compelling hand what more chance do you want than this ferrante wore mail true but his neck was bare as as a boys but could thur escape afterwards over the stable gate say out through the entry court before the alarm went up an image of the blackmouthed cavalrymans lance driving between his shoulder blades as he fled down the road made thurs muscles stiffen he did not want to die on this bright morning maybe ferrante did not want to the either this isnt my calling i came to montefoglia to make beautiful things out of metal not corpses out of living men oh god thur stood up but ferrante had already turned away and was striding back to the duchess another chance lost right or wrong did angels weep or devils gnash their teeth thur bent and worked around his brick pile to keep ferrante in sight straining his ears to catch the next words we can yet arrange things my lady in good public form ferrante continued to the duchess his voice and temper controlled again sandrinos death was an accident he fell on the knife in a scuffling fall we had both drunk too much unwatered wine at the banquet my lieutenant misunderstood the situation we all know those are lies said letitia flatly but we are the only ones who know ferrante argued smoothly after a glance at lady pias stone face apparently convinced him denial would be fruitless if we all say otherwise why then so it will be as far as any outsiders know you can save your familys honor and position in this awkward event if i wed julia and become ascanios guardian why it will be clear to all that sandrinos unfortunate death was an accident you lose nothing not even your home and gain a protector in me so you can go on to cheat my son out of his patrimony so you can murder him at your leisure i could murder him at my pleasure right now ferrante snapped give me credit i am trying to save you all you are merely trying to save yourself from the just retribution that must fall on your head if god has not abandoned the world altogether ferrantes nostrils flared but he reaffixed the smile that had slid from his face im not inhuman i desire your goodwill see i have even brought you your rosary that you asked for my men and i are not the thieves you accuse us of being he pulled a string of polished black beads from his purse and held them out just beyond her reach letitia mined pale controlled her hand in midsnatch and accepted the gift with a small curtsey thank you my lord she stammered you cant know what these mean to me i think i do smiled ferrante she drew the beads through her soft white hands came to the enda black bead stopped with a gold flangehastily reversed the string and came to tine other end also a plain black bead her face came up wideeyed with anger as ferrante held up a small carved ivory ball between his thumb and finger do you seek this he inquired sweetly give me letitia surged forward in a hiss of silk then stood still hands clenched to her sides a very interesting object this ive had vitelli examine it thoroughly lady pia crossed her crocussleeved arms tightly under her breasts but remained standing sturdily behind the duchess a fascinating spell ferrante went on hugely ironic a way for a woman to kill a man many times stronger than herself a poison that is neither food nor drink against which my saltcellar would be quite useless the woman holds the poison locked in this little ivory ball under her tongue then she induces the man who is her enemy to kiss her was that task to be yours or julias or lady pias here a pretty scene to be seducing me while her husband lies imprisoned below her very feet she whispers the word which unlocks the ball and breathes into her unsuspecting lovers mouth the poison flows into him in the form of a snake made of smoke he dies strangled unable to breathe i suppose she must take care not to inhale while this operation is in progress eh his fist closed around the ivory sphere if ever a man deserved such a death it is you hissed lady pia oh were you to have been my executioner purred ferrante ill remember that but no when you add this to the evidence of a very curious painted cabinet kept locked in your boudoir my lady letitia it seems to me a very convincing charge of black witchcraft and poisoning might be got up against you think on that by you you hypocrite god cleave your lying tongue one would think god is your personal bravo the way you call on him snarled ferrante sarcastically you keep your secrets well i had no hint before this that you had a talent for the black arts but this he rolled the little ball between his fingers is quite a pretty piece of work i didnt make it denied letitia then however did you come by it i had it from a girl who burned for it she had it from a moorish magician in venice she had used it to kill her unfaithful lover i visited her in her cell the night before her execution for mercy and our lord jesuss sake the inquisitor himself for all his hot irons never found out how she did it but she confessed it to me she gave it to me i kept it for a curiosity to make such a thing is quite beyond my power letitia pressed her lips tightly together you must of course say so but look at it from my point of view a man who has his motherinlaw privately strangled must expect harsh social disapproval from her numerous cousins however much envious men may secretly applaud the deed but a pious fellow who has her publicly burned for black witchcraft against his life can only gain solemn sympathy judicial murder said letitia frozenly is murder still lady pia was pale breathless but my hands wul not be stained with it eh and hasnt there been enough murder in montefoglia come my lady let us cry peace today i ask humbly and grant you the dignity of free compliance ferrante s effort at goodwill was brightly strained letitia turned tier face away i have the headache you have kept me too long in the sun ferrantes voice hardened tomorrow i shall have the means to compel cooperation and youll wish youd struck your best bargain while you could i wish to go in letitias face had less animation than one of the marble statues tucked among the garden walks so that you can continue to poison your daughters mind against me ferrante tucked the ivory ball away in his pouch and gave her a courtiers bow letitia and lady pia glanced down the garden to where julia now sat on the bench fearfully clutching her lap doe ferrante followed their gaze his eyes lidding i think the time has come to separate her from you and your soloyal handmaid before you force me into the same rough courting our noble roman ancestors used to gain their sabine wives it took a moment for the import of this threat to sink in letitias eyes went luminous with anger you dare and would you then dare deny me permission to wed her afterwards ferrantes brows drew down considering this inspiration perhaps not is this the solution to your stubborness letitia drastic but if you force me to be cruel to be land monster cried lady pia and swung a clawed hand at his face he caught her arm easily and wrenched it downward his lips compressed with annoyance a white circle fell from her crocus sleeve and bounced on the dry ground she gasped and stamped her foot upon it too late a liquid orange light flared around her slipper and was gone whats this ferrante asked holding lady pia onehanded at arms length despite her struggles he stooped to retrieve the crushed tambourine shoving her away his part as spy must be revealed in moments thur stood up and felt for his knife hilt hed last used it to cut roast mutton at breakfast it needed sharpening why hadnt he thought to sharpen it he could not breathe he drew and lunged just as ferrante straightened up too far a strike the guard by the wall starting forward cried a warning ferrante halfturned and flung up a mailclad arm deflecting thurs thrust the blade skittered across the links and grazed the side of ferrantes throat in a desperate bid to recover the chance thur turned the blade and recoiled it bit the back of ferrantes neck but ferrantes grip astonishingly strong for the awkward angle was already wrapped around thurs wrist and the knife did not bite deep they wrestled for the hilt then thurs groin exploded with blinding pain like lightning chewing up his nerves as ferrantes combatexperienced knee hit its target with force and precision a boot met thurs chin as he sank snapping his head back it was worse than meeting a rockfall a second kick found his belly his stitches burst and the hot cut bled anew the tip of a long shining sword pressed into the hollow of thurs throat as he lay blinking up at the bright blue sky and ferrantes dark face swimming overhead ferrante pressed a hand to the side of his neck glanced at the sticky blood staining his palm and cursed he swung his sword up and stepped back a pace as a couple more guards came running up and redundantly began kicking thur the noblewomen were screaming and clutching one another fiametta at least would have picked up a brick and tried to help bash ferrantes head in thur deeply regretted his shyness if only he had been more forward he might have won a kiss from her or more before this death ferrante leaned on his sword breathing heavily the whites of his eyes showing after a minute when it was quite plain thur would not rise to try again he waved the guards back take them to the tower he dispatched two men to remove the crying women gathering up the terrified julia and her dog the officerguard hustled them from the bright garden thur blinked madly watering eyes and tried to memorize the sky he wanted to fall up into it go to god hed rather his last sight be the face of fiametta but he certainly did not wish her here so blue sky must do the faces of enemies wavered over him there was ferrantes blurred and doubled brick red with rage and fear why german ferrante grated the bright sword pressed thurs throat again it looked like the chute to heaven foreshortened in the sun you could slide up it into the blue sky swiss thur corrected thickly his mouth was numb and gritty with dirt why did you just try to kill me why why well it had seemed like the proper thing to do everyone had wanted him to he hadnt really wanted to he wanted uri back far more than he wanted ferrante dead you killed my brother thur spat out in a gobbet of blood ah not sandrinos swiss guard captain ferrantes teeth gleamed in a weird satisfied grimace apparently vengeance for dead brothers was reason enough to make more dead brothers in his world did ferrante have a brother would this chain go on forever vitelli the secretary his red robe flapping came running up my lord he cried in a voice edged with panic its not as bad as it looks niccolo ferrantes voice was controlled again a bored drawl youre bleeding its not deep you there go fetch my surgeon let me staunch it vitelli passed a hand across ferrantes neck and the bleeding slowed to a dark ooze ferrante scratched carefully around the cut with gory fingernails his face screwed up in irritation that was too damned close search him for hidden weapons he nodded to a soldier who knelt cautiously by thur and began prodding around his bruises he discovered thurs thin purse tucked in his tunic which he handed up to the secretary he laid a white parchment circle absently on the ground thur moaned vitelli himself had to look three times what he bent to pick it up after a moment he swore his hand closed on the parchment tambourine crushing it the orange light leaked briefly between his fingers where did you get this he demanded of thur thur smiled dreamily afloat in a sea of pain answer a guard yelled lacking him again thur grunted and paddled after a receding darkness that would take him away from all this never mind vitelli put out a hand to stop the guards helpful efforts if there are more i can use this to find them what are they asked ferrante taking and comparing the crumpled circle with the other i believe it is some kind of device for eavesdropping my lord its rather fine work i feel there are more about ferrante glanced from the tambourines to thur pursing his lips he is a spy without doubt said vitelli he said he was sandrinos guard captains brother of course he could be both ferrante beckoned to his soldiers hang him from the south tower on the side where he can be seen from the north tower guards reached for thurs arms to drag him upright thur dimly recalled praying to god to save him for hanging i take it back surely hed been promised death pressed in earth and water not death dangling in the air wait my lord vitelli advanced to peer down into thurs swollen and bloody face brother to captain ochs really they dont look much alike well perhaps the chin does it matter there is an opportunity what said ferrante in exasperation i get no pleasure in dragging this out he is a spy and an assassin fine let him be executed at once as a warning to others execute yes but i believe we can make better use of his death belowstairs eh cats and cocks are but trifles compared to a man and if the man be truly a brother to another why then i will have to recalculate all my diagrams oh its excellent my lord oh ferrante rubbed his chin thoughtfully i see he stood a moment in uncharacteristic indecision i wonder if he has another brother who will come popping out of the dark at me well he is a condemned criminal after all too bad i rather liked him all the better my lord vitellis eyes glittered ferrantes lips thinned but he turned to his soldiers take him to the dungeon well question him later and execute him privately two losimons forced thur to his feet the garden spun around him in slow jerks and his stomach heaved his new gray tunic was all spoiled with bloodstains too now he saw with tearful regret mother would be unhappy they frogmarched him up the garden the dimness of the castle swallowed the day the hollow echo of plastered corridors floated past him he stumbled down stairs into a perpetual stone night around a corner past familiar barred cells an argument hurt his ears irritated voices too crowded not in there why not we have to watch him all the time anyway maybe this will stir something up dont want him stirred up the world in the form of cold stone came to rest at last pressing against thurs face his hands felt across the gritty chill and he turned his aching head carefully to the side a little dim blue daylight reflected through a tunnel in the wall above him somewhere a metal lock clanked shut and footsteps receded a thick warm hand gripped his hair and turned his face around thur looked wearily into red eyes in an unshaven face a beard like salt and pepper scattered across sagging jowls tufted brows rose a bats the thing the mad castellan advised him kindly opened his hand and let thurs cheek slap back to the stone chapter fourteen there goes the last of them said brother perotto grimly a blaze of orange light evaporated from the surface of the parchment tambourine on the table before him the haze flickered uncertainly in the cool northern daylight of abbot monreales work chamber and was gone all that work moaned brother ambrose the other monks ringing the table each clutching a nowsilenced mouth grimaced in agreement fiametta fingered the last tambourine before her place dead it had never even started to speak but now its magic aura was not merely inactive it was gone without trace where are you thur fiametta had just turned over to monreale the mouth speaking alternately clear and strangely muffled from lady pias sleeve when it had emitted a cry and cut off abruptly monreale had hastily gathered his other listeners together to follow vitellis destructive progress through the castle sandrinos office the infirmary the grooms dormitory the words the little mouths emitted before going dead had been few and businesslike heres another my lord under the blanket ha till the last damning one found on its shelf in the chamber of necromancy fiametta understood that mouth had kept brother perotto tinglingly awake last night even after she had gone to bed by monreales orders but perotto had been maddenly vague about the events it had reported at least to her vitellis last whispered message had been brief and horrible it is you monreale isnt it i recognize your style its done you no good your fate is sealed and your stupid spy shall die directly a crackling cut off and the mouth in front of brother perotto had given up its sopainstakinglyinvested magic monreale sat bent over pale as if pieces were being torn bit by bit from his belly brother perotto sat back and turned his palms out in helpless frustration what happened father it seemed to be going so well and then i greatly fear for poor thur said monreale lowly into his lap fiametta wrapped her arms around her torso pressing the lion ring secretly between her breasts she could still sense its warm musical hum its tiny heartbeat if thurs real heart stopped would she know she stared around the table at the array of graycowled men solemn authoritative and helpless whats the use of you she demanded in sudden anguish what said brother ambrose sharply though abbot monreale merely looked up whats the use of you the church is supposed to be our defense against evil oh you ride about the countryside terrorizing old hedgewitches about a plague of lice in their neighbors hair or some stupid love potion which half the time doesnt work anyway and threatening their souls with hellfire if they dont cease and desist youre fine at pestering men at work in their shops but when real evil comes what good are you youre too afraid to fight it you persecute the little crimes of little people thats safe enough but when great crimes march in with an army at their backs where is all your preaching then strangely silent great stupid louts ofof boysare hanged while you sit and pray tears were running down the inside of her nose and she sniffed mightily wiped her sleeve across her face and bit her lip oh whats the use brother perotto began an angry lecture on the proper humility due from ignorant girls but abbot monreale waved him to silence fiametta is partly right he said in a distant tone then looked around the table and smiled bleakly all virtues come down to courage at the sharp end of the sword but courage must be tempered by prudence courage wasted by misdirection is the most heartbreaking of all tragedies if there is an eighth deadly sin it ought to be stupidity by which all virtues are run out into dry sands yet where does prudence end and cowardice begin you sent thur in there alone said fiametta breathlessly to confirm my charges of black magic and murder since my ignorant girls word was not good enough against so great and virtuous a lord as uberto ferrante now my charges and much more are confirmed through their own mouths what do you wait for now there is no reason to wait and every reason to hurry monreale laid his hands out flat palms down upon his worktable and regarded them gravely quite he sucked a little air through his teeth then said brother ambrose fetch the prior and the lieutenant of sandrinos guards brother perotto fiametta you shall assist me begin by clearing all the rubbish from my table for all her passionate plea for action fiametta was taken aback by this sudden response her belly fluttered with fear as she busied herself scurrying around the chamber putting away ordering and fetching the objects of his art at monreales overtheshoulder directions monreale was prepared mentally at least apparently all that time in meditation had been spent on more than prayer when the lieutenant of the refugee montefoglian guards arrived monreale sat him down with a map of the town and exact instructions for coordinating their magical and military efforts the ring of losimon besiegers encircling saint jerome was known to be thin monreale urged the montefoglian guards to leave just enough crossbowmen to keep the enemy away from the walls and breaking through the ring make a sally toward town with ferrante and vitelli incapacitated by the spell he planned to cast and in the face of this sudden attack monreale hoped the losimon troops would be thrown into confusion sandrinosnow ascaniosmen could then rouse the townsfolk to their support the losimons have made themselves odious enough monreale judged all our people need is some real hope of success to quell their fears of reprisal and they will pour into the streets for you drive all the way through to the castle and the duchess on the first rush if you can though with their leaders gone the losimons might be willing to surrender on terms even from behind sealed gates fiametta grew chill listening to this well ferrantes losimon bravos were ruthless but perhaps their loyalty did not run to selfsacrifice they wouldnt hesitate to sacrifice others though the complexity of the military situation daunted her heart there was more to fighting their way out of this monstrous coil than merely waving a magic wand yet if anyone could pull all the disparate threads together it was surely abbot monreale even papa had called on him monreale blessed his empty worktable while brother ambrose chanting circled the chamber with a thurible dribbling incense smoke to clear away the lingering echoes of previous spells ambrose explained fiametta nodded her father had practiced a similar sort of housecleaning now and then before casting particularly important delicate or complex commissions or ones of which he was not too sure of the outcome the ritual seemed to order the mind more than it did the room fiametta reflected coughing in the smoke monreale himself laid out the props of his intended spell it is to be a spell of spirit over spirit as much as spirit over matter the symbols must be chosen correctly to concentrate the mind still i could wish for some material connector a lock of hair an article of clothing actually worn i might as well wish for the papal army to appear over the hill while im at it he sighed then brightened still i have vitellis true name this would have miscarried for certain without it and i would not have known why he took a new stick of white chalk and began to laboriously trace a diagram upon the tabletop when hed finished the chalk pattern monreale laid a knife with green and gold thread tied around it parallel to a wand of dry willow circled with threads of red and black ferrante and vitelli the soldier and the spiritually sapless mage monreale stood back and studied them is it enough such a distance we must carry over a mile they should be crossed upside down to represent their entanglement and their evil thought fiametta but did not speak her father had severely chastised her for daring to offer suggestions in public surety monreale knew even more about what he was doing monreale folded a gauze cloth beside the knife and wand it was actually a piece of cheesecloth fetched from the monastery kitchen silk would be better monreale muttered but at least it is new spidersilk would be even better fiametta thought but she quailed at the thought of volunteering to go collect some though there were plenty of odd corners in the monastery where spiders might be obtained very odd corners it will be a spell of deep sleep monreale explained the same basic spell as that used by our healers when a patient fears some little surgery powerful enough but we must strive to make it more powerful to overcome two men at once neither anxious to cooperate and one fully capable of the most strenuous resistance and he may have set wards why not enspell them one at a time vitelli first of course my greatest worry monreale muttered is to this spells quality of whiteness or spiritual benignity its very doubtful what said fiametta why it wont kill them unless one is leaning over a balcony as it strikes which seems unlikelyit wont even hurt them they just go to sleep a healers spell what could be whiter monreales lip twisted and in the endif we winboth men must eventually burn at the stake hardly harmless in intent even if legal in means if they win are they even likely to bother with legality to hold what they have taken they must wrap their crimes in some cloak of public pretense eyewitnesses to the contrary will be in very grave straits that includes me fiametta realized with a shiver it includes enough by now to guarantee a very massacre monreale sighed well i am ready until the lieutenant reports his men assembled let us compose ourselves in prayer i might have predicted that but fiametta settled herself upon her knees before the crucifix on monreales office wall without demur she did not lack things to pray about she thought sadly of all the prayers shed wasted in the past on her small desires a lace cap a silver bracelet like maddelenas a pony a husband yet in a backhanded way all had been forthcoming the cap and the bracelet from papa the white horse thur what was this strange girlpower to make the intractable world spit forth her wishes ok i wish it were over at length sandrinos surviving senior officer returned to confer briefly with monreale the soldiers eyes glinted grimly in the shadow of his steel helmet his dented breastplate was dull and leaden more determination than enthusiasm tightened his jaw but perhaps that was the more durable emotion under fire the tenyearold dukes offer to lead his troops himself had been tactfully turned down the lieutenant reported but the mans spine seemed to stiffen in memory of it monreale blessed him and sent him on his way with a slap to his cuirass that echoed hollowly in the plastered office monreale then led perotto ambrose and fiametta into his workroom the prior followed as a witness the prior was more an administrator than magician or healer or even fiametta suspected monk but he had been monreales practical right hand throughout the crisis managing men and space and the daily bread monreale arranged his brothers standing around the table laden with the simple set for the spell he bent his head in one more blessedly brief prayer and extended his right hand to ambrose and his left to perotto brothers lend me your strength fiametta stepped to the tables fourth side father i will gladly lend mine monreale frowned his brow furrowing no no he said slowly i dont want you exposed to the danger of the backlash if this effort fails my little mite could be the difference between failure and success and not such a little mite as all that either monreale smiled sadly though brother perotto frowned repellingly you are a good girl fiametta said monreale but no please do not distract me further his raised palm blocked her protest which she swallowed back into her tight throat she stepped away from the table to the priors side and locked her hands behind her back ambrose perotto join hands monreale instructed and they reached across to each other to complete the ring monreales grip tightened the first strike requires all our hearts to overwhelm sprenger he bent his gaze to the symbols on the table knife and wand and began to chant in a healers low drone fiametta could feel the power build as if an invisible sphere were forming above the table monreales control seemed very precise meticulous almost finicky compared to her papas flowing sweeping gestures monreale wastes nothing and yet his economy wasted time and attention it seemed to fiametta abundance can afford to be daring the sphere began to glow with a visible corruscating white fire shimmering in waves both upon its surface and within its heart as its power built up and up now that was wasteful papa had always insisted that a properly cast spell should be heatless and invisible perhaps it was some inevitable friction from trying to combine strengths from ambrose and perotto fiametta held her breath oh strike now or vitelli will feel it and be warned still monreale held his hand building up his power the lacy sphere cast the monks shadows on the walls then the light began to pour down like water into the vessels of knife and wand they filled the knife blade gleamed like moonlight soundlessly the gauze lifted and drifted across the two glowing objects and settled gently over them monreales eyes opened he breathed the last syllable of his chant ambrose grinned in triumph and even surly perottos eyes lighted monreale inhaled smiling to speak the dry willow wand exploded into flame which flashed across the gauze consuming it to crumbling blackness white fire tainted with red flared up into monreales face like a powder flash from a misfired hand cannon his features lit from below contorted red and green afterimages swirled in fiamettas eyes and she squinted futilely against them her hands pressed to her mouth to stifle her scream monreales eyes rolled back and he fell unaided since ambroses hands were clapped to his eyes and perotto too was toppling monreales forehead cracked the table as he collapsed all three mens faces were reddening from the burn fiametta and the prior jostled each other in their rush around the table the prior knelt beside monreales bleeding head but hesitated to touch him still fearful perhaps of being guilty of interrupting some magic in progress but there was nothing left to interrupt fiametta could feel it the circle and the spell were broken father monreale father monreale cried the prior in anxiety monreales face was dead white mottled with red patches his singed eyebrows came off an acrid whiff of burned hair overcoming his hesitation the prior pressed his ear to monreales robed chest i hear nothing fiametta ran to the cupboard and snatched up a fragment of broken mirror stored there and thrust it under monreales nose it clouds he breathes perotto moaned ambrose lay as oddly as his abbot what happened asked the prior did vitelli counterattack them somehow yes but vitellis countersurge might have been contained should have been contained it was the excess heat and the tinderdryness of the willow abbot monreale let too much heat build up the prior frowned at this critique and wiped the blood away from the rising lump on monreales forehead he palpated the skull not broken i think he should come around soon i dont think so it wasnt just the crack on his head that was incapacitating monreale it was the spell turned back on its source she wasnt sure how vitelli was doing it but it was almost as if she could see a dark hand pressed to monreales face as a man might hold his enemy under water strange she shook her head to clear it of the ghostly impressions shed been steeped in too much magic of late it was as if her senses for it had been sanded to an almost painful new receptivity maybe ambrose could lift the spell hand when he recovered if he recovered brother perotto sat up on his own brother ambroses eyes opened at last but he was dazed and incoherent after another moment of uncertain observation the prior ran to fetch the senior healer brother mario the healer directed several more monks to gather up the stricken men and take them to their beds fiametta waited for mario to ask her what had happened but he didnt so she tried to tell him you perotto supported between two brothers turned on her you ruined the spell you dont belong in here me abbot monreale ordered me to be here said fiametta impure moaned perotto fiametta drew up indignation how dare you i am a virgin mores the pity and doomed to remain so for all the rescue thur seemed likely to receive now at least until the losimon soldiers took the monastery by storm ought she to suicide before saint jerome was overrun but that way lay damnation too her heart burned in rage and outrage why should she have to the and be damned for the crimes of men she would rather fight claw and run away from the dismal fate of women and orphans the prior took her by the arm and steered her out onto the gallery overlooking the cloister yes yes he meant no insult but truly it is improper for you to be in this part of the building go back to the womens quarters fiametta and stay there till when till the losimons come over the walls if the abbot does not regain his senses from that knock soon the prior licked dry lips he is enspelled he wont come round until the spell is lifted it must be possible to determine how to lift it vitelli labors under the same disadvantages of distance as we do i will have the healers do what they can it will take more than a healer be that as it may healers are what we have left unless ambrose recovers first what will you do if neither man recovers soon or at all the priors shoulders bent as the full weight of monreales burdens seemed to fall on them i will i will wait the night perhaps the morning will bring better counsel but if ferrantes emissary returns to plague us again perhaps it would be better to surrender on terms before it is too late to ferrante you think he would honor his terms for five breaths cried fiametta the priors hands made impotent fists by his sides go back to the womens quarters fiametta you understand not the first principle of the affairs of men what first principle save your own head and let the devil take the hindmost i understand that very well thank you go to the prior began to roar then dropped his voice to hiss between clenched teeth go to your quarters and hold your tongue will you at least let me try to lift the spell of sleep if the healers fail fiametta begged desperately perotto is right you do not belong in here go to in a moment he would beat her in his frustration and call it a just chastisement fiametta could see it coming she bared her teeth at him and ducked away and stalked stiffbacked out of the cloister she should have kept silence she should have spoken up she should have she should have in the womens quarters two children were puking three were crying and a sharp argument between two mothers over the last of the clean swaddling cloths had degenerated into hairpulling and shrieking fiametta fled again her attempt to see abbot monreale in the infirmary was turned back sternly by brother mario a montefoglian guard in the refectory tried to squeeze her breast in passing and whispered a lewd jest into her ear as she twisted away from him the old lay sister in charge capped and kirtled gave him a box on the ear and a sharp rebuke invoking his mother by name he fell back grinning and holding his nose as fiametta dove into the chaotic infantsqualling voracious sanctuary of the womens dormitory she flung herself down upon her pile of straw and burrowed her face into it her teeth gritted against tears a stick poked into her neck and a flea jumped upon her sleeve and then into her hair before she could crush it turning over she was elbowed by the girl next to her keep to your own side blackamoor the girls snarl was angry but her pale face was furrowed with suppressed grief and fear strained with the waiting along with the rest to be murdered fiametta almost set her hair afire with a word she clamped her lips on the heat boiling off her tongue and curled in a tight ball trembling in the practice of magic monreale had said you will be exposed to temptations that do not trouble the ignorant indeed yet what of the spell embodied in her silver snake belt still concealed under her velvet bodice its effect had been far from benign though it fell short of lethal had her papa allowed himself to be just a little bit damned after all as the price of his magic if he could do it why couldnt she mother mary keep me from harm at monreales order fiametta had prayed to the virgin for patience settling to the pavement in the chapel and arranging her skirts and gazing up earnestly at the serene white marble face of the statue holding the child patience was apparently another one of those womens virtues for she could not recall it as ever being one of papas fiamettas eyes fell now on that same velvet skirt bunched in her fist stained and tattered mother mary mama who were you this red dress was less faded than the fragmented images in fiamettas mind of the woman who had first worn it her mother had died when fiametta was eight in rome of the fever that had carried off so many a bad year and august had been its worst month with hard times upon them papa imprisoned in the gastel sain angelo upon those deadly dangerous charges fiametta could not remember anything about her mothers death someone else must have been taking care of her for the sick woman she held only a scrapvision of following the cheap and simple bier through hot stifling smelly streets dressed in stiff and uncomfortable clothes and holding some big womans hand it bothered fiametta that she could recall so little of rome venice now she could picture clearly even how papa had taken her there perched upon the packhorse the excitement of the journey the wonder and glitter and arrogance of the city but there had been nothing of mama in venice fiametta had watched from her upstairs window as gaudily turbaned moorish merchants were poled down the canal in their gondolas or the occasional blackamoor slave of some great lord or lady citysmooth and almost as proud as their masters and once the floating entourage of an ethiopian ambassador but none of these seemed to have any connection to mama the slim dark witch from brindisi fiametta was accustomed to thinking of her papa as the powerful one but mama had been a sorceress too fiametta touched the lump of the snake belt the silver work was papas yes but the original spell was it mamas yes indeed the dark woman smiled at fiametta over the shoulder of the beneficent white statue mama why did you give up your power to marry papa i traded it for you love and never regretted the bargain magic is power but children are life itself without which there is neither magic nor any good thing papa regretted i was not a boy did you no never fear not fiametta the fullness of her power comes late to a woman you must live your way to it grow and get more life then all that was mine shall be yours at the still center no not all the power had been papas for he had circled that center as if swung on the end of an unbreakable silver cord till death had broken it fiamettas drifting calm was swallowed by panic but i need power now power not patience mama mother mary the two faces cool white marble soft brown smiling flesh fused together in a land of maternal sisterhoodyou are my golden child fiametta snapped awake at the wail of an infant shocked at her fleeting dream soggy with weariness appalled anew at the noise the edgy din in this crowded chamber would surely drive her mad the light of the setting sun was knifing through the window slits on the western wall fiametta rolled back off the pallet and visited the latrine which stank even there she was not alone she eyed the dark squares of windows cut high in the wall for ventilation just under the eaves and wished they were larger the other two women left another screaming argument started in the adjacent dormitory dizzy with tension fiametta reached high over her head and curled her hands around a dirty ledge and heaved herself up and half through she hung on her belly over the stone and stared around the eaves of the leaded roof overhung these tiny windows like a tent concealing them from outside view beams from the ceiling thrust out to meet the roof making triangular braces far below fiamettas nose the monasterys outer wall met the ground weedy rocky deserted with difficulty fiametta wriggled her hips through the little window and laid her body across the bridging beams narrow precarious but might it make a hiding place if the monastery were overrun by losimons maybe till the beams burnt and the roof collapsed but at least she was alone the mindnumbing uproar of the womens dormitory muffled to a blur of sound she allowed herself to weep at last though silently lest some guard stationed on the roof above or the ground below overhear and investigate her tears dropped away and fell in the sunset light like molten gold in her papas shop falling into the basin of cold water to make the tiny round beads the droplets puffed into the dust far below the tears became pearls then disappeared in the shadows as the light went her head and chest and belly ached with pent sobs every dependency had betrayed her her trust had been mocked by one failure after another papa monreale thur poor thur drawn all unprepared into this it was hardly his fault a large spider making its web in a triangle to the west of fiamettas head dropped upon a strand of silk and bobbled a moment before reclimbing the thread reminding fiametta horribly of a man hanged a blond young man all blueeyed and feckless and unlucky in love i could have fetched such a spider for abbot monreale fiametta decided so what if id had to touch it if only she had spoken up maybe it would have made the difference in the abbots spell the spider sat upon its web which was moving gently in some faint draft the creature was fading to a black blot as the shadows deepened im only a puny girl somebody is supposed to save me im not supposed to have to save myself or them she could do nothing clapped up in this stone pile of a monastery master mage or puny girl demonstrably one had to get closer to the target risking the journey risking what death she risked that staying right here torment likewise damnation not a worry that stopped ferrante obviously or even slowed vitelli down nor their murdering bravos id split those bastards with steel if i were a man if she were a man a priest would sprinkle holy water on her bloody sword and pronounce her forgiven before the bodies had cooled but she wasnt a man and she doubted shed get ten paces with a sword in her hand not man but true mage and if god wanted to damn her for using the only strength hed given her that was gods choice her belly filled with fires of resolution in the gathering dark she reached out and closed her hand over the faint suggestion of a spider hanging before her nose it wriggled and tickled the flesh of her palm there was more to a spell than pure will there was focus and the accumulation of power within symbolic structure bene she whispered to the spider forte barely able to see it she squeezed its abdomen fine silver thread spun out from her hand looping around a beam she kicked her skirts free and dropped upon the spiders thread toward the ironhard ground her arm yanked up as the thread stretched and held she rotated once twice her feet struck the ground with a thump and she staggered for her lost balance the drop should have broken both her legs her impromptu spell had worked she opened her right hand upon a gooey crunchy smeared blob oh im sorry spider a wave of nausea nearly overwhelmed her and she rubbed her palm hastily upon the warm rough stone of the monastery wall to scrape off the remains dizzied with the drop and the afterburn of magic along her nerves it took her a moment to realize she was standing openly in the dusk against the wall a clear target for any losimon crossbowman sharp enough to have noticed the movement of her controlled fall the spider thread its enchantment consumed had blown to dust upon tile wind she could not climb up it again nor make that poor squashed spider spin another she dropped flat to the ground panting oh god are you revenged for my pride already mother mary but no quarrel hummed viciously above her head no shouts rained down only the first croakings of frogs and the last twitterings of buds floated upon the cooling darkness she waited several minutes rigid with fear the darkness deepened now youve done it you cant get back in you have to go on she wriggled around until she freed the silver snake belt concealed under her bodice and wound it back openly around her waist she took a breath swung to a crouch bundled up her skirts and scurried toward the woods the shade was blacker under the trees but her footsteps crackled among the leaf litter weeds and sticks she stepped as carefully as she could if she could slip through the losimon lines and reach the road to town she did not scream when the dark man in soldiers leathers leapt upon her it wasnt as if she werent expecting something of the sort still her breath caught in her throat and her heart pounded as he spun her around ha he cried got you no i have you she stated then stopped taken aback even in the dimness it was clear that the man was bald as a plate and cleanshaved but he wore a woolen shirt under his leather vest she could smell the dried sweat in it piro she said clearly his sleeves burst into flames twining around his arms like orange flowers in the dark fey she walked off into the wildly wavering torch shadows while he was still screaming and rolling on the ground she didnt even run his cries would bring his comrades to his aid even now she could hear them crashing through the brush behind her but not she thought after her few among the losimon rank and file would be fool enough to chase an unknown sorceress through the dark fast enough to risk actually catching her she strolled on awash in a land of disconnected lassitude very much like the times shed drunk too much unwatered wine she was without fear and wanted to sleep her fingers felt thick as sausages her legs felt like wood this woodlot to the south of the monastery featured a ravine which ran down to the lake where the ground flattened out and the road crossed she slipped and scrambled down the slope scraping her hands on the rough tree bark to slow herself she could feel stickiness from the blood but her hands seemed numb to pain at the bottom a nearly dry stream oozed slimy black around pale blotches of rocks she picked her way among them she froze crouching among some fallen logs her white sleeves crossed under her breasts when a couple of losimon soldiers clanked past swords drawn intent on the shouts echoing faintly from the vicinity of the monastery uphill they ran by without seeing her they must have been guarding the road for when she reached the dusty track a vague ribbon in the moonless dark it was deserted the lake lay like black silk she turned south and started walking home chapter fifteen after an age the reverberations of pain through thurs body died away enough for him to uncurl from around his throbbing crotch and try to sit up the northfacing window of the cell admitted no creeping patch of sunlight to mark the time but the deep blue color of the bit of sky he could see suggested that the afternoon was waning gingerly he put his hand to his swollen lips touched loosemoving teeth and winced sheer chance he had not bitten his tongue in half his sides and back and kidneys ached from booted kicks almost eclipsing the clamor of yesterdays sword cut broken open again his red cap was gone likewise his shoes his knitted hose were torn and unraveling badly by pushing himself up sideways he got his back to the wall and his legs out in front of him he looked around at last lord pia sat crosslegged upon a straw pallet which had its own scrap of blanket the castellan rocked gently back and forward and nibbled at the blankets corner in much the same absent way as a man might bite his fingernails his redrimmed eyes were fixed unblinkingly on thur his fine silk hose were all riddled and ruined too thur noticed with a sense of dreary fellowship who are you lord pia husked not dropping his unnerving stare nor ceasing his rocking my name is thur ochs thur mumbled muffled by his puffy mouth brother to captain uri ochs i came seeking my brother but lord ferrante has killed him his tale sounded almost mechanical in his own ears leaden so often had he repeated it uris brother truly lord pias stare sharpened he spoke of a brother i saw him die he mentioned your name from time to time in his letters lord pia thur ducked his head respectfully both men had been sandrinos officers they must have worked together daily uri was a good fellow lord pia remarked staring now into the middle distance sometimes he helped me to catch bats in the caves west of the lake he was not afraid of the caves after the mines he said he fingered the silver embroidery on his tunic the glitter thur realized upon a closer look of tiny bats ranked wingtip to wingtip edging collar and cuffs had lady pia stitched them oh said thur neutrally remembering how mention of the little flying animals had set lord pia off last night a bats the thing you know clever creatures i think a man might fly as a bat flies without feathers if he could but devise wings light enough yet strong the leather was too heavy even for uris sword and shield arms next time i shall try parchment do you know bats eat the marsh mosquitoes that plague us their fur is very soft like a moles and they can be trained not to bite the hand that feeds them unlike men the castellan brooded to think that men dare to call them evil only because they fly in the night when men do murder in the broad daythe hypocrites they are gods creatures too i am sure thur said warily ah so good to find a man who is not prejudiced by idle superstitions i often saw bats in the old mineshafts they do no more harm than the kobolds you are a miner eh so uri said not afraid of the dark either good fellow the castellan brightened lord pias fellowfeeling for the bats seemed more enthusiastic than irrational but for a certain skewed intensity of gaze when he spoke of them i saw lady pia earlier today thur offered even more hesitantly she seemed unharmed she stays bravely by the duchess and lady julia ferrante is keeping them all together in the north gatetower my apartments said pia ah he tensed blinking tears and bit on his fingers red gaze becoming withdrawn thurs hands flexed together mad or not the castellan had demonstrably escaped this cell twice before my brother thur began and stopped at a creak of leather and a smothered belch a losimon guard sat just outside the cell on a bench against the far wall watching them and listening his left arm was bandaged and his face bore weekold bruises but a short sword hung at his belt thurs lips tightened what the devil let him get an earful my brothers body lies in a chamber just below this one he continued more loudly ferrante and vitelli practice some terrible necromancy upon him magic black enough to burn for even louder aye and burn those who aid them too he wasnt certain in the dim light but he thought the bandaged guard flinched they have also stolen the corpse of prospero beneforte the master mage they mean to enslave his spirit to a ring for lord ferrante ah said lord pia distantly i have seen that chamber so thats what they are about youll all burn thur yelled out to the guard then huddled back coughing from the effort he doubtless looked and sounded as mad as the castellan he lowered his voice to a whisper lord pia help me they hold poor uris spirit through his body and mean to drag him to some damnation he is a prisoner imperiled even in death i have to free him somehow and master beneforte too ah said the castellan arching his brows free thats the trick of it isnt it thur paused confused the castellan hunched a shoulder turning away on his pallet and resumed nibbling on his blanket and staring into space he is mad this is useless thur sighed he added tentatively abbot monreale holds lord ascanioduke ascaniosafe at saint jerome for now but they are besieged by losimons but to this lord pia made no response abbot monreale enspelled some bats to be his spies but i dont know if they have come this way ah said the castellan they are good and gentle creatures dont you see to so serve the holy abbot monreale knows lord pia nodded sagely and gnawed wool thur lay back down on the stone and throbbed awhile despairing he was roused by steps and voices from the corridor a couple of big losimons loomed beyond the door followed by messer vitelli in his red robe vitelli held a small green glass flask padded with woven straw the little man stared through the bars at thur yawned and sucked on his lower lip go ahead he directed and stepped asideto let the prison sergeant unlock the door the sergeant one eye on the castellan waited warily for the big bravos to enter the cell but lord pia never even looked up at this invasion one of the bravos got behind thur and yanked him to a sitting position his arms locked behind his back vitelli leaned against the wall yawning as if his face would crack then touched something under his robe he shook his head like a dog shedding water damn the man he muttered and straightened up inhaling deeply the hairs stirred on the back of thurs neck as vitellis dark aura disturbed something subtler than his senses there was neither heat nor flash sound nor scent yet it was as if an aroma of magic rippled thurs belly without first passing his nostrils vitelli was maintaining a spell not invested and constrained and supported in some symbolic object but held in his own liquid thoughts a spell powerful and oppressive and yet he was still able to walk and talk smooth and ordinary the impression faded even as thur grasped at it giving him hallucinatory vertigo maybe it was just another aftereffect from his beating he squeezed his eyes shut and blinked rapidly and the dark aura receded to linger on only in vitellis dark eyes the man behind thur grasped his lank blond hair and pulled his head back and the second stepped forward to force a stick between his teeth and pinch his nostrils shut vitelli unstoppered his flask and sloshed its contents into thurs aching mouth it was a sweet dark wine with a bitter undertaste thur choked and sputtered and bucked and gagged and swallowed good vitelli stepped back and turned his emptied bottle upside down a last drop shivered on its lip and fell like a starburst of blood upon the cell floor that should do it even for so large a lout return in half an hour and cart him downstairs he exited the cell leaving his men to lock it the dark distracted look spread out from his eyes across his face again as he turned away their scuffling footsteps faded again down the corridor leaving only the sitting guard thurs head sinking inexorably met the cool stone the castellans face came up and he giggled quite distinctly his giggles became hoots then high screams he jumped to his feet a bats the thing he cried snatched up the slops bucket from the corner of the cell and skipped around the little chamber with a cunning grin he stopped by the door yanked off the buckets lid and flung the reeking urine upon the startled guard the guard came up off his bench with an outraged yell unfortunately meeting rather than dodging the vile wash the castellan leaned through the bars his hands opening and closing then danced backward as the soldier drew his blade and lunged at him lord pia pounced upon the sword arm and wrested the blade away and waved it in the air striking sparks from the ceiling swearing and screaming for the prison sergeant to bring him the key he was going to kill this madman despite all the guard retreated up the corridor brushing at his tunic in disgust and almost crying quickly lord pia dropped the sword and turned to the swooning thur who had watched the whole performance from a numbing huddle on the floor strange patterns like watered silk swirled and wavered across his vision lord pia slapped the slops bucket upright under thurs nose yanked his head back by the hair rather less gentry than had the losimon bravo and thrust his thick and filthy fingers deep into thurs throat he kneed thurs belly for good measure thats it boy bring it all up he crooned encouragingly as thur retched into the smelly bucket thur didnt even need a second stimulus to empty his stomach altogether the sickly sweet wine bile and poisonous acridity of the drug filled his mouth and he spat wildly eyes watering nose running lord pia turned his head listening then grabbed the bucket away to toss its revolting new load quite accurately and neatly through the bars of the outside window before they get back listen to me lord pia pulled thur up by the hair again hissing thurs eyes still swam with tears lie still pretend it is yet working upon you go limp as a slug dont cry out even if they stick an iron needle into your flesh and they will carry you out of here themselves then keep pretending till i call you to rise and strike do you hear do you understand his red eyes were fierce thur nodded dizzily it took no effort at all to pretend to swoon a dark haze fogged his brain at least the numbness muffled the pain of his bruises and knocks he wiped his lips on his sleeve eliciting another lie still lord pia snatched up the sword and bounced from wall to wall waving it and ululating as the guard and the sergeant returned the sergeant peered through the bars looking very annoyed stupid fool to let him disarm you now how dyou think im supposed to get it back for you from a howling lunatic ha wait for him to cut his own throat i ought to both men jumped back as the castellan on his breathless circuit clattered the sword across the bars the iron continued to ring faintly as he stopped tilted his head cunningly and blatted his lips in the direction of the losimons the guard wild grabbed for the sergeants key ring but the sergeant slapped him down witless nit ill have you flogged if you dont obey orders here you this last was directed at lord pia who with a weird snicker danced to the window and stuck the sword out through the bars and let it go the guard yelled in incoherent rage shaking the door bars and the sergeant cuffed him ninny go and get it you can wash in the lake while youre down there in fact youll have to that steel will be sunk ten feet down at least and dont take all day ill get him snarled the unhappy guard but was driven off with a stream of vicious invective and personal abuse from the sergeant who then stared at the castellan shook his head and plunked down on the bench in weary obedience to his orders to keep the elusive madman under continuous observation lord pia wheezing and sweating gray hair disordered flung himself back down upon his straw pallet and stared at the ceiling with empty eyes vitellis two big bravos came back before the disarmed guard returned the castellan ignored them completely as they stopped by thur one kicked thur in the belly not viciously just testing thur could not help flinching but he let his eyes roll back and he stayed limp it wasnt that hard trying to stand up that would have been hard night was falling the light from the window was a strange salmonpink afterglow the sergeant held up a lantern like a smoky gold animal eye in the growing shadows one losimon took thurs shoulders the other his feet it was good to be carried he felt waterlogged every breath an effort as he was hoisted up thur let his dazed eyes pass across lord pias who lay on his side and stared back expressionlessly his fingers tracing and trapping out an odd little rhythm on the stone floor as formlessly compulsive as his blanket chewing why am i going along with this madmans plan if he even has one but here he was just as lord pia had forecast being carried out of the cell his porters bumped him down the narrow stone stairs in the black dark to the familiar underlevel with its four doors too much to hope they would just lock him in with the wine casks no they lugged him through the door into the magic workroom leave him there vitelli waved in the general direction of the rooms center they dumped thur down ungently is there anything else messer one of the soldiers asked cautiously deferential no go they did not linger to be told twice their bootsteps scuffed up the stairs in double time thur lay sprawled his face mashed to the floor and let one eye slit open vitelli was turned away lighting a few more bright beeswax candles to add to an already brilliant array the little man had exchanged his red robe for a gown of sable velvet gold embroidery glittered here and there in its folds symbols magical or merely decorative lord ferrante entered swinging a small leather bag in a way that suggested it did not contain wildlife this time the cut on his neck had been cleaned and stitched closed with silk threads of extraordinary fineness he wore a clean shirt unstained with blood but had donned his chain tunic and sword belt again and leggings of black leather do you have everything he asked vitelli did you bring the new bronze yes ferrante let the bag twirl on its strings then we have everything ferrante nodded and bent to lock the door he placed the big iron key back in the pouch hung on his sword belt thur almost moaned aloud how the hell was he supposed to get out of here this time pretend till i call on you to rise and strike how the hell did lord pia think he was going to get in stay said viteiji as ferrante started toward the salt crates i must divest this damned awkward sleep spell into something that will hold it for a little cant you just let it go even bound it must distract you not nearly as much as monreale would distract me should he recover quickly enough to interfere at some critical moment and it is easier to maintain than it would ever be to recast prudence and patience my lord ferrante grimaced hitched a hip on me tabletop and let one blackbooted foot swing he frowned down bleakly at the little footstoolchest beside him and shoved it away after a moment he drew a slagged silver ring from his belt pouch and turned it broodingly in his hand his right hand was no longer bandaged thur realized though it still looked red and barely halfhealed for all your troubles niccolo beneforte set the spirit of this ring free most readily a wave of his hand and none of your antics with the corpse or ring since have sufficed to call the power back yes ive told you we must find benefortes hidden notes on spiritmagic i have said it repeatedly i think it was no bargain said ferrante quietly to trade my damnation for so brief and volatile a power he closed his hand over his palm vitelli facing away from ferrante rolled his eyes up in exasperation then carefully composed his features to proper deference and turned weve been over this my lord the infant was sickly its mother lay dying it would not have lived the night would you rather have let that death go to waste what merit in that and it was only a girlchild anyway ferrante said dryly i would hardly have let you persuade me to do that to my son and heir niccolo sickly or no he blew out his breath i want no more such sickly girls youre a magician how do i assure a strong son next time vitelli shrugged tis said a womans part is to supply the matter and the mans to supply the form with his seed all things struggle toward the perfect form the male even as metals in the ground strive to grow to be gold but many fail and females thus result are you saying i should have added more form ferrantes brows rose she was too sick vomiting all the time revolting i had no heart to plague her besides there were plenty of women in town its not your fault im sure my lord said vitelli placatingly ferrante frowned well i want no childbride next time the pale and whimpering julia is unfit to bear vitelli said sharply with julia comes a dukedom give her a little time i hold the dukedom now by force of arms or will shortly ferrante shrugged what other right do i require what other right would even avail if i had no army true lord but the sforza did both in milan and left too many visconti alive who now skulk about half the courts of italy trying to brew trouble ferrante turned the ring in his hand without looking at it as if wondering if it sought some such subtle revenge vitelli paused and said slyly give me the silver ring my lord and i will try to see if anything may yet be salvaged ferrante smiled not pleasantry no he said softly but very firmly it was fair and just that my dead daughters spirit serve me no other i would not bind one of mine to serve a baseborn milanese damned dabbler vitelli bowed his head his jaw tight as you will my lord there will be other opportunities better ones he turned to clear a place on the boards to his other side dusted it with a gray powder and then wiped it clean he then arrayed a simple spellset a tiny gold cross facedown and a gauzy silk cloth his features sharpened in concentration he began murmuring after a few moments the silk gauze rose in the air like the head of a questing snake and settled gentry over the cross vitelli s muttering died away he took a deep decisive breath and turned to ferrante done it will hold monreale forlong enough shall i light the furnace then asked ferrante no ill do that strip the swiss spy of his clothes ill help you hoist his brother momentarily ferrante tossed him his purse which he caught onehanded a little jewelers furnace sat upon stone blocks near the window vitelli had already laid in the fuel now he bent to the lower hearth opening and whispered piro blue flames licked the pine and charcoal which caught and burned steadily vitelli emptied the chinking contents of ferrantes leather purse into a new clay firing pot no bigger than his fist and popped it into the oven thur bore being stripped willing his limbs to flaccidity his breathing to a deep slowness ferrante was quick and businesslikehad he practiced on corpses in the field of battlethough truly there was little left to take just the ruined red hose and the gray tunic the floor was chill on thurs bare skin did drugged men shiver this play could not go on much longer he must throw off his seeming sleep and strike soon or die or strike and die one last chance he was being given one last chance to be a hero like uri vitelli pumped the furnace bellows a few times then turned to help ferrante lift uris stiff gray corpse from its bed of salt and lay it out faceup on the floor near thur a few dislodged salt crystals fell and bounced scattering across the stone with a muted glitter ferrante returned to arrange thur facedown and where the hell was the ghost of master beneforte while all this was going on indeed if only beneforte were lodged in hell none of this would be happening for a mad moment thur wished him there with all his heart no helpful dustman rose from the floor now take over the bellows said vitelli to ferrante a tense edge to his voice warned thur that the enspelling was about to start in earnest vitelli arranged three sticks of new chalk green black and red in a fan in his left hand and stepped forward to crouch beside uri his latin chant sounded almost like a prayer thur didnt think it was a prayer at least no prayer to god vitelli took a clay ring mold from his robe and set it on the floor midway between the quick and the dead he placed a longbladed and very shiny knife with a bone handle near thurs head what kind of bone it was getting very very hard to keep his eyes from focusing and tracking and vitelli kept glancing at him murmuring again vitelli began to trace his chalk diagrams upon the floor around the two brothers thur thought of the cat and the cock this floor had been well scrubbed since last night and not he suspected by any servant unless vitelli employed a man with his tongue cut out the bellows wheezed steadily the fires husky sound deepened the devil ferrante ducked a bat had flitted in through the window and was circling the room in rapid silent swoops as a child might whirl a toy on a string vitelli engaged in his chant and unable to stop gave ferrante and the bat both a glare ferrante drew his sword and swung at the flying target missing three times he swore and lunged after it vitelli came to the end of a stanza and drew breath long enough to snarl its only a bat leave it damn it over his shoulder then resumed chanting ferrante grimaced pausing but on the bats next circuit his sword licked up again only halfaimed in a lucky blow it whacked the shadowy animal out of the air a wing broken the bat chittered across the stones and one of vitellis chalklines smearing it vitellis teeth clenched he broke off his chant his words felt to thur like a line of marching soldiers stumbling into each other as their leader stopped without warning vitelli opened his hands and let the terrible tension leak away before moving clumsy he cried to ferrante in real agony well have to start over you get the sponge and mop these lines face working he strode over and stamped on the injured bat killing it he picked the little corpse up by one wing holding it delicately away from his robe and flung it out the barred window ferrante was clearly not pleased by this abrupt order to a menial task from his subordinate but stifffaced he obeyed out of his depth in this complex magicking perhaps he did a neat job though and within minutes the floor was dry and ready again vitelli picked up the ring mold and the knife and started anew this time he had ferrante stand within the lines by thur as he drew them thur kept one slitted white eye on that bonehandled knife he must reach for it before ferrante did come what may he wished desperately he were in better shape could he even stand up let alone fight the miasma of magic in the room was so thick he could scarcely breathe as if vitellis dark aura had expanded to the walls vitelli appeared in the corner of thurs vision with a pair of tongs clasping the cherryred clay cup holding the molten bronze sweat trickled in shiny tracks down his face when he poured the ring would freeze almost at oncetrapping uris spirit the chanting rose to a crescendo ferrantes leather leggings creaked as he knelt behind thur awaiting his signal to take up the knife thur must strike nowa scrambling noise and puffing came from the window that faced the lake much too loud for a bat rise and kill the bastards lord pia roared ferrante wheeled and drew his sword rise was not quite the word for it but thur lurched forward in a sort of frogflop fell upon the knife and rolled the bone hilt in his hand sent a paralyzing jolt up thurs right arm notquitepain shuddering along his nerves his hand spasmed open and the knife clattered across the floor out of sight under the trestles the chalklines burned his skin like whips as he pressed across them ferrantes sword struck sparks and a white scar on the stone where thur had just lain vitelli bent and choked convulsively the tongs fell from his grasp the clay cup cracked on impact and its molten bronze spattered across the cold stone floor the castellan squeezed from the window and stood hair waving eyes alight the guards short sword was in his right hand and an iron bar from the window was in his left his legs were bare and hairy his lips were drawn back on a feral snarl reaching a trestle that held a salt crate thur at last pulled himself to his feet his legs shook but held him ferrante started to lunge at lord pia stumbled across the chalk lines and recovered just in time to parry lord pias sword with his own blade then catch the murderously swinging iron bar with an upflung arm ferrante stepped back absorbing the shock of pias onslaught in a hastily ordered defense pia was a soldier yes and a match for ferrante with the sword but older and fatter already his breath pumped like the bellows vitelli was halfsprawled halfkneeling by uri doing something to uris mouth thur staggered over to him grasped him by the padded shoulders of his velvet gown and heaved him into the wall win or lose you will not have my brother thur meant it to be a defiant shout it came out a croak he grabbed uris rigid ankles and dragged him toward the window he glanced out surprising a kobold shadowman who was drawing the last iron bar down into the solid stone like sinking a spoon into porridge the kobold grinned at him and melted away after its prize thur heaved uri up and stood his joints cracking and popping like the mine timbers he aimed his brother at the little square window and charged forward as if he were carrying a battering ram his aim was good the corpse shot through the narrow opening without catching or dragging and arced into the night air after a moment a great splash sounded below thur pushed himself back upright from the window ledge and turned to seek his enemies lord pia was still engaged with ferrante their swords clanging like a couple of demented blacksmiths thur mothernaked bore nothing to attack a swordsman with what about a black magician vitelli had regained his feet and started toward lord pia muttering his hands gesturing with one hand thur grabbed an iron candlestick and with the other he swept the spellset of gold cross and silk gauze from the tabletop vitelli yelped stumbled and turned toward thur thur swung doing his very best to take vitellis head off with the first almighty blow he did not think hed get a second chance vitelli ducked and thur was twisted offbalance by his own momentum he came around just in time to see ferrante stab lord pia through his sword arm nailing him to the oak door pia did not cry out ferrante left his own sword quivering in flesh and wood and caught lord pias short sword as it fell without a pause he whirled and lunged at thur thur knocked the sword aside with the candlestick once twice ferrante pressed him swiftly across the chamber backing him into the furnace thur could feel the heat on his bare haunches he sidestepped to put the window behind him instead ferrante had regained his balance moving smoothly and confidently he almost seemed to study thur at his leisure vitelli moving up behind ferrante pointed a finger at thur and began to scream in latin his dark aura spun around his head like a cyclone thur did not think he had better be standing there when this spell whatever it was arrived at ferrantes next thrust he swung his candlestick with all his remaining strength and knocked the sword wide ferrante still covered himself with a knife not the bonehandled one that had somehow appeared in his left hand thur spun on his heel and dove through the window after uri his aim was not so clean this time the rough sandstone shredded the skin of his shoulders and knees in passing then he found himself flailing in the dark air a man might fly as a bat flies without feathershad the castellan flown down where the hell was the water he smashed into it bellyflat after the suffocating heat of the magic chamber the cold was confounding it closed over his head and stopped his breath he fought his way through a wash of tickling bubbles to the surface and gasped for air cold but clean it seemed to flush the dizzying sickly drugtorpor from his limbs at last thur splashed and turned about trying to reorient himself the night was moonless the stars muffled by haze fog tendrils steamed from the lakes surface obscuring what vision was left against a looming black bulk thur made out a few dim gold blobs of candlelight the cliff face with its windows and the castle wall above he had to get away from that he paddled as silently as he could in the opposite direction just his eyes and nose breaking the surface of the dark and quiet water he bumped into a floating log no not a log it was uris body somehow in the frantic fight thur had imagined it sinking beyond vitellis reach but it was quite buoyant he tried to push it under but it popped back up any losimon with a rowboat could pick it off the surface of the lake tomorrow morning and return it to vitelli and all this would be for nothing no not nothing not nothing but not enough he had regained uri only to lose lord pia mad perhaps but clever and bold as abbot monreale was holy duchess letitia defiant ascanio innocent and fiametta fiametta and all all sacrifices to ferrantes towering selfconceit his fame what gave ferrante the right to ride over all those lives right has nothing to do with it he fights to survive and the more he drifts into wrong the harder he will fight must fight so spoke reason reason was no practical help thur was drifting too he began to shiver as the chill lake water drew the heat from his body at least it wasnt as killingcold as the water in the mine would uri become waterlogged and start to sink or rot uncertainly thur began to kick propelling himself and his brother log gently along he was no longer sure where the shore was no lights or lanterns shone bright enough to pierce the mist but he achieved after a little experiment a sort of equilibrium kicking just fast enough to keep warm just slowly enough not to outpace his breath he felt he might keep it up for hours but then what by the time he bumped into the quay he knew neither how far he had come nor how long he had been about it he felt like he had paddled halfway to cecchino a town loomed beyond the steps and docks and pebbled beach the stones bit his naked feet as he rose dripping and the water no longer supported his weight he dragged uri along horizontally as far as possible then pulled him ashore like a fish he was almost as slippery as one thur stood his legs trembling and stared into the dark tinged here and there with some faint illumination escaping through a closed shutter big buildings too big for any village a dog barked twice and stopped what town damn it was only montefoglia still montefoglia had he been swimming in circles quite possibly he stared up and down the shoreline mentally placing landmarks he could not now see with his eyes to his right the castle hill to his left the big docks the lower walls and the high outer town wall at the very end that ran right down into the harbor ahead lay narrow winding streets dark and strange well they couldnt be any stranger than what he had just escaped he stood a moment in indecision water lapping his ankles where should he be trying to go anyway he had to hide uri he wanted he wanted to talk to fiametta he wanted to find fiametta yes reason therefore said he ought to paddle back out into the lake and swim to saint jerome he emptied his mind of reason knelt got uri up on his shoulder grunted to his feet and started walking up stone steps from the quay his feet banged down hard with their doubled weight guards there ought to be a guardthere thur ducked into the nearest alley as a man with a lantern appeared near the quay an old man a town watchman not a losimon thur walked on without looking back placing his bare feet carefully in the dark but suppose he aid meet some urban danger in these passageways he had a sudden picture of himself a naked swiss madman carrying a corpse well he had nothing to attract a robber certainly turn here turn there where the devil was he going he would not go back to the castle no matter now his sixth sense clamored he stumbled over a blanketed lump in the alley which gave a muffled cry thur burdened barely saved himself from landing hard enough to shatter his kneecaps on the cobbles damn it no be quiet i wont hurt you forget you saw me go back to sleep said thur panicked at the thought of an outcry thur said a familiar youthful voice is that you tich thur stopped stunned what are you doing here why youre all naked picos elder boy scrambled to his feet his face a white smudge in the dimness what are you carrying uri my brother youve met uri havent you said thur dizzily its a corpse said tich in horror after a verifying touch yes i stole him back from ferrantes black magician why are you here thur those thieving losimonsthey killed my father and zilio they cut his throat like a dog his voice grew louder in his excitementit had been a couple of days since hed met any man he dared called friend thur guessed sh sh i know i saw your fathers mules yesterday when they brought them to the castle yes i followed them and theyre my mules now i want them back i want to kill the bastards ive been trying to figure out how to get into the castle sh no that accursed castle is no place to try to get into i barely got out with my life tonight where are you going asked tich sounding quite as bewildered as thur felt im not sure but i cannot stand naked in the street till the dawn finds me you can have my blanket tich offered immediately though in a rather dubious tone thanks thur wrapped it about himself and suddenly felt much better and not just for the warmth i look i hate to take your only blanket why dont you come along with me but where are you going tich repeated to a house in town that i know the vision of fiamettas home came clearly as he spoke the words aloud finally unconfused by the overlapping call of tich yes it was no accident that hed stumbled over tich in the dark any more than when hed stumbled over little lost helga in the snow but he knew where he was going now theres no one home except maybe a losimon guard thur added in sudden doubt maybe reason ought to prevail just this once i have a dagger said tich if hes a losimon ill kill him for you i well see it may not be necessary lets just get there first eh um ill take his feet said tich reluctantly thanks thur realized he was going to have to give up the blanket again awkwardly they slung uri between diem and walked on not talking except for a few whispered directions from thur turn here down this street ight up this slope were almost there quiet neighborhood tich commented the houses are like forts the familiar walls of master benefortesfiamettashouse rose up at last there was the marblearched oak door glimmering even in the dark no lights shone it was surely both locked and guarded they set their burden down and thur borrowed the blanket back how do we get in whispered tich thur was not sure he could even climb into bed at this point let alone climb a wall he stepped forward and knocked on the door are you mad you said it would be guarded hissed tich yes he might be a little mad by now but it wouldnt do to tell tich so thur only knew he was very very tired so if there is a guard this will bring him to us then you can kill him thur promised he knocked again and propped uris body up beside him supportinghim with a brotherly arm over his cold and waxy shoulder he waited for the guard to greet them and vice versa he knocked again harder at length came the sound of the bar being drawn back and the snick of a bolt tich tensed his hand clenching and unclenching on his drawn dagger the door swung open fiametta stood holding a lantern in one hand and a long kitchen knife in the other she was still wearing her red velvet dress missing its outer sleeves she stepped back a halfpace and her eyes widened as she played the lantern light over her visitors thur felt doubly grateful for tichs dirty blanket now wrapped like a skirt about his waist fiametta looked back and forth between the two brothers dear god thur how do you tell which of you is the corpse uri is better looking thur decided after a moments serious thought i fear youre right come in come in get out of the street fiametta waved them urgently inside chapter sixteen what did you do to the guards thur asked staring blearily around the darkened entryhall he and tich laid uri down upon the flagstones as fiametta locked and barred the door again behind them guard fiametta corrected turning there was only one hes locked in the root cellar under the kitchen right now i hope hes drinking himself senseless i wasnt able to get his sword away from him she glanced curiously at tich did you magic him down there asked thur impressed tichs brows rose oh said thur im sorry this is tich pico dont you remember him from cattis inn the muleteers son a gang of ferrantes bravos killed his father and brother and stole his mules tich this is fiametta beneforte her father was the master mage catti smoked this is his house was his house yes i do remember seeing you said fiametta we have a thing in common against ferrante then all of us yes madonna beneforte tich nodded do you want me to kill that losimon in the cellar for you i dont know but he has to be better secured im afraid hell get out oh thur im so glad youre here she flung her arms around him and hugged him thur blushed with pleasure and grunted with pain are you really he said feeling suddenly shy did i hurtoh what a horrible gash it should be closed and bandaged at once you look terrible she jumped back but he managed to retain a clasp on her warm hands he was still chilled from the lake and the night air but he had to let go as his blanket slipped down further to catch and clutch it to himself for decency fiametta paused in sudden puzzlement but why are you here i wanted to find you but how did you know to come here i wasnt sure i could get here myself till an hour ago do you think is it still my ring she touched her chest yes the ring hung there under her linen and velvet thur was sure of it but he had not thought about the ring he shook his head i dont know this house was the only place i knew of in montefoglia to hide i mean i knewi felt this was how to find you but i dont know how i knew im good at finding things always have been lately ive been getting better at it i found uri it is a talent it must be uri did right to apprentice you to my father oh if only he had lived she rubbed her eyes smeared wet with anger weariness and grief hurriedly thur launched into a brief tangled account of his sojourn in montefoglias castle culminating in his escape with uris body tich listened openmouthed fiamettas teeth clenched we knew you were taken this afternoon before he destroyed the last ear vitelli used it to tell monreale he was going to put you to death she said i thought he meant to hang you i didnt imagine anything so evil buthow did you come to leave saint jerome asked thur her brows rose quizzically i was looking for you i was going to save you from being hanged i hadnt figured out how yet i thought they would do it at dawn a slow grin pulled up the corners of his mouth well nobody else was willing to tryoh dear strange thumping noises echoing distantly through the house interrupted her i think that guard is trying to get out come on she picked up the lantern and led the way through the courtyard into the kitchen thur limped after tich bringing up the rear the wide polished boards flooring half the kitchen jumped as something hard struck them from below the guards head thur thought dizzily obscene curses drifted up not quite muffled enough as the losimon heard their footsteps after a moment a sword blade thrust up through a thin gap between two boards questing blindly for a target thur glanced down to make sure he was standing on the tiles how did you get him down there tich asked also stepping cautiously around the wood not magic said fiametta she lit a candle stub stuck in a bottle on the kitchen table from the lantern flame i was going to use magic i was going to set him on fire it s the only spell i know that i can work entirety in my head without any material symbols to hold it its a talent but when he came to answer the door i thought id better get inside first so i told him i lived here and id come back to see if any of my clothes were left but then the talk went strange he just let me in and said hed help me look for my dresses if id let him do things to me letting tich kill the losimon seemed suddenly a much better idea to thur he set his teeth then unset them again immediately as the loose ones twinged i told him ell i told him all right her hand touched the head of a striking silver snake belt looped around her waist but i told him there was a wine cask my father had hidden in the root cellar behind the turnips a special vintage there really was one you see it might even still be there when he went down to look i clapped the trapdoor closed and dragged the pewter cupboard across it she nodded toward the large painted cupboard pulled out from the wall he almost pushed it up enough to get his fingers out but then i jumped up and down on it and then you came i thought if it didnt hold him i must set his hair on fireat least he has hairand then try to stab him she paused as the sword thrust up again i could still set him afire and you could stab him she offered to tich thur remembering his experiences with ferrante shuddered at the thought of little fiametta attempting handtohand combat with an infuriated losimon veteran just wait a minute he said he borrowed the lantern and hobbled back to the courtyard he recalled glimpsing es there in a pile of tools beneath the gallery rested a goodsized sledgehammer he carted it back to the kitchen at least lets get his sword away from him first for bait he walked out on the floorboards taking care not to step on a crack sure enough the sword blade and curses came up through the slit again just in front of him he raised the sledgehammer familiar in his hands to his side and swung it down hard it clanged off the swordblade and thur almost toppled he clutched again at his slipping blanket and lightheaded from the effort handed the hammer off to tich who caught on at once enthusiastically he whacked at the bent blade as the losimon tried futilely to withdraw it on the third blow the metal broke a crash from below and more curses as the losimon fell backwards why thur that was clever said fiametta sounding rather astonished thurs brow wrinkled a little less astonishment would have been a little more complimentary now were even tich grinned breathlessly waving his dagger lets get him wait said thur what do you have around here to bind him fiametta bit her lip in thought if they havent taken itit was only iron not silver or gold maybe they leftjust a moment she scurried out with the lantern the losimon stopped thumping fiametta returned in a few minutes draped about with a long iron chain its a manacle my father was working on for the duke it doesnt have a key it opens with a spell do you know the spell asked thur well no i know where it is in papas notebooks but ferrante and vitelli have taken all papas notebooks away but do you need the spell to lock them no they just lock thats builtin thur regarded the handcuffs then stepped to the door to glance into the courtyard with its pillared stone arches supporting the wooden inner gallery all right he returned to the kitchen to shout down through the floorboards hey you losimon a surly silence resulted there are two armed men his hand closed on the haft of the sledgehammer and a very angry sorceress up here she wants to set you on fire if you come up and surrender without giving us any more trouble i wont let them kill you a mans gruff voice responded how do i know you wont just tie me up and loll me my word suggested thur what worth is that more than yours i am not a losimon thur snarled a long silence as the losimon crouching in the dark contemplated his options lord ferrante will have my head for failing him maybe you can desert later the losimon made an obscene suggestion which thur ignored thur whispered to fiametta do you think you could like just warm him up a bit not really set him on fire but demonstrate ill try she closed her eyes her soft lips moved a cry and slapping noises echoed from the cellar all right all right i surrender thur let tich and fiametta drag the pewter cupboard off the trapdoor and stood with his sledgehammer raised slowly the trapdoor creaked upward and the losimon cautiously poked his head out he was a grizzled man strong but no youth little red sparks still glinted in his curling hair which gave off a singed stench he did not bother to carry his broken sword hilt but crawled out and stood emptyhanded thur had tich clap one end of the manacle around the mans wrist and lead him to the courtyard where he wrapped the chain around a stone pillar and attached the other cuff thur did not put down the sledgehammer until tich yanked the chain to be sure the cuffs would hold mashing the losimon against the pillar tich put one foot to the pillar and held the man while fiametta gagged him he rolled his eyes at the sledgehammer and did not attempt violence against the girl fiametta led them back to the kitchen here sit on this chair she said to thur ruberta had a healing salve for bruises oh your sides look like a piebald horse are any ribs broken i dont think so or i wouldnt have been able to get this far thur settled himself very cautiously fiametta rummaged in the cupboards her voice wafted out that ugly gash wont heal unless the edges are held together at least it looks clean im no healer but i know my needlework if if i can stand to sew it up can you stand to let me thur choked down an anticipatory whimper yes ah heres the ointment she emerged from the recesses of a carved sideboard clutching a venetian glass jar a pale cream inside emitted a faint pleasant scent like wildflowers and fresh butter delicately she daubed some upon thurs ribs a warm relaxing numbness penetrated from the spots where she spread it ill go get my sewing kit if the losimons havent taken it she set the jar down and hurried from the kitchen surreptitiously thur scooped up a large glob of ointment and stuck his hand under his blanket to rub it on and around his aching swollen crotch it helped a lot and thur sighed relief you should have gotten her to rub it on there tich snickered settling crosslegged on the floor that might have done more harm than good thur grunted charmed by the idea but offended by tich having suggested it hell he hadnt even kissed fiametta yet hadnt even tried to he remembered his deep regrets about that when hed been facing death in the castle god i hurt all over fiametta returned in a few minutes carrying a small covered basket were in luck i found the curved needle ruberta uses to sew up the stuffed goose when she roasts one sounds perfect said tich his brows going up in black amusement thur decided his lips hurt too much to smile i think youd better lie flat on the kitchen table fiametta directed just like the goose tich commented fiametta grimaced at him halfamused halfannoyed and he subsided thur climbed up and arranged himself while fiametta threaded her needle she studied the two stitches at one edge of the gash surviving from ferrantes surgeons work yes i can do that her lower lip stuck out in determination she took a deep breath and made her first jab thur sucked in his breath gripped the table edges and stared at the ceiling do you think anyone is going to come around and check on that guard tich asked standing up to watch fiametta shoved a candle into his hand to light her work not before morning said fiametta tying a knot she was neat but much slower than ferrantes surgeon maybe not at all thur managed in a strained voice theyre undermanned and this house has been stripped of valuables except vitelli might come around to search it again he s convincedah sorry keep going hes convinced your father has hidden some secret notes or books on spiritmagic somewhere in the house thats how i met them here day before yesterday secret books fiametta frowned deeply papa well maybe do you know of any such no if so hes kept them secret from me thur stared at the kitchen ceiling through eyes watering with pain i think they do exist i think theyre up somewhere i felt it when vitelli had me trying to pry up boards i didnt tellahvitelli of course fiamettas eyebrows lowered in concentration up huh she tied off another stitch and glanced at the ceiling half done slow but sure slow anyway vitelli wants them very badly im certain hell be back gasped thur but maybe not as early as tomorrow he looked pretty sick when i broke up his spell that close to completion so complex fiametta nodded thoughtfully ill bet hes sick right now silence fell as she worked her way meticulously across thurs belly cut the last one at last pale was not in fiamettas repertoire but there was a distinctly greenish tinge beneath her toasted skin she pursed her lips and rubbed a goodly handful of ointment across the cut before sitting thur up and tying a protective strip of cloth that looked suspiciously like a bit of former petticoat around his waist thats thats good thur wheezed gallantly better than the surgeon a pleased smile curved her full lips really yes he swung his legs off the table and stood up pink and black clouds boiled at the edges of his vision and the room tilted he found himself bent over clutching the table tich help fiametta rushed to thurs side he waved her away afraid he would crush her if he fell but she ignored the wave and put her shoulder sturdily up under his arm you are going straight to bed she decreed ill put you in rubertas room its right off the kitchen here its the only bed the losimons didnt break up looking for hidden treasure tich the lantern by the time thurs head had cleared they had maneuvered him into the housekeepers bedchamber no he protested your fathers secret books fiametta weve got to find them to keep them from vitelli im sure its important i have to help you look you have to lie down here fiametta pulled back blankets on the first real bed thur had seen in weeks it had linen sheets oh murmured thur overcome the bed seemed to suck him down it was a little short but wonderfully soft fiametta pulled the coverings over him and whisked tichs blanket out from under them in one smooth movement she gave the blanket back to its owner but the notebooks thur said weakly ill look for them fiametta said they were up above the second floor this house only has two floors doesnt it tich craned his neck as though he might see through the ceiling i have an idea or two said fiametta go to sleep thur or youll be useless persuaded thur sank back fiametta and tich tiptoed out thur was weary beyond anything hed ever known but disorderly images from the past few days whirled in his thoughts hed rescued uri but master beneforte still lay in danger the duchess lady pia lord pia with his strange passion for bats stuck to the oak door with his blood running down vitellis dark aura growing in menace and power but in a few minutes fiametta returned carrying a large clay mug she set the lantern down as thur with difficulty sat up have you eaten i didnt think so theres no food in the house right now but some flour and dried beans and tired turnips but i found that wine here she sat on the edge of the bed and helped him get his hands around the mug shed brought it unwatered it was thick red dense a little sweet thur gulped it down gratefully that helps thank you i was starving you were shaking she watched him with concern he watched her in return over the rim of the mug their lives had been tangled together by this treachery in montefoglia and by the peculiar prophecy of her lion ring was the master of clunys spell meant to be a prophecy of the selffulfilling kind thur had been at first struck by fiamettas prettiness amiably inclined to love anybody who even suggested that she loved him yet now he was not so sure that she did love him despite the ring what did she think he was uneasily aware that he had not more than halfwon her mind it was all so complicated she was a complicated girl would life with fiametta always be this confusing he was beginning to suspect so he remembered staring up the length of ferrantes shining sword in the castle garden now that had been simple awkwardly he slipped his free hand around fiamettas waist leaned forward and kissed her their noses bumped and he halfmissed her mouth her big brown eyes widened and he waited in resignation for her recoil instead she kissed him back vigorously and she managed to hit the target square his arm tightened joyously around her shoulders her hand closed firmly over the silver head of her snakebelt it felt strange kissing through a bruised grin when he broke off her eyes were alight i did something right thur thought in delight i wonder what it was but before he could explore further she jumped up considering his battered physical condition this was perhaps just as well she bent over and dropped a kiss on his forehead go to sleep thur at least she left still smiling a mysterious girl smile thur lay back this time sleep came almost simultaneously with the darkness he woke to an uncertain gray daylight seeping through the rooms halfopened shutters creakily he sat up he hadnt been this sore since the day after the cavein and flood at the mine but he felt much better than last night the sick dizziness was gone from his head still he decided another handful of that ointment would be welcome he swung his bare legs out of the little bed at least he wasnt going to have to wear the quilt laid across the bed were clothes of a sort a threadbare mans gown of timesoftened dark wool thur slipped it on over his head it had clearly been made for a smaller fellow probably prospero beneforte for the hem meant to brush the floor in a dignified scholarly sweep rode at thurs calves and the sleeves wouldnt fit over his arms at all he left the sleeves on the bed and tied a bit of cord around his waist to make a sort of tunic he peeked out the window into the walled garden behind the house yes there was the outhouse the grayness of the sky was not dawn after all but a steely midmorning haze had he slept too long worried he walked into the kitchen and stopped short a strange woman wearing a cap and apron and holding a wooden spoon turned from the bluetiled stove to glance at him without surprise ah the young man she gave him a cordial but measuring nod as if he were a bolt of cloth she was considering purchasing but was doubtful of the fastness of his dye she was sturdy rather than stout of middle years er said thur the porridge will be a few moments yet she pointed with her spoon to a black iron pot atop the stove therell be a dried apple tart sweetened with honey after a lot of tart not much apple but one must make do and i brew a posset of herbs thats better to drink in the morning than that strong red wine which is all we have in the house there is no ale she nodded firmly and bent to tease open the iron door to the stoves firebox with her spoon handle and poke briefly at the coals thurs mouth watered the odors were delectable youll be wanting the outhouse first i expect right out there she waved the spoon vaguely toward an ironbound door that led into the garden yes i was heading there uh maam thur paused my name is thur ochs poor captain uris brother from bruinwald yes i know are you by chance ruberta the masters housekeeper yes or so i was before those thieving murdering losimons broke in upon us she frowned tensely crime upon crime prospero beneforte was not an easy man to work for but he was a great man not another like him in montefoglia run along now when you get back wash your hands in that basin yonder and go fetch fiametta to eat where is madonna beneforte somewhere about the house trying to find what of her papas tools those cursed robbers somehow overlooked thur did as he was told returning through the kitchen to the courtyard their prisoner lay on a blanket ungagged but asleep a cheap wineskin clutched to his chest not the good red wine thur guessed someone had been out foraging since last night fiametta probably she must have fetched ruberta thur hoped shed had the sense to take tich with her for protection not that a boy with a knife would be much help against swordsmen he stepped onto the flagstones in the entryway uri was not mere he glanced into the room on his right which had its own fireplace in the corner and rugs and chairs clearly where important guests or clients were received a sheeted shape lay upon a makeshift bier of boards laid across two trestles thur sighed entered and lifted the sheet to look upon his brother and frankly to check for rot he was touched when he discovered that uri had been decently dressed in more of prospero benefortes leftovers knit hose a shirt a short tunic not new or fineor the soldiers would have taken thembut arrayed with care the womens work no doubt vitellis preservation spell appeared to be holding he covered his brother again and crossed the hall to check the workroom opposite fiametta sat perched on a high stool her elbows planted on the worktable she had not taken time to change her own clothes but still wore her ruined velvet with the outer sleeves lost thur wondered if shed taken time to sleep open upon the table in front of her was a large leatherbound book and scattered in a circle about it was a litter of papers and parchments she was frowning fiercely as she read she looked up at the sound of his footsteps thur you were right i found them her face was haggard where he came to her side did you notice the little corner room with the two windows off papas bedroom that he had fixed for a study yes vitelli did too he had it stripped out ithe feeling was very strong in there so i made sure not to look very hard the ceiling is covered with squares of wood with rosettes carved in the centers we tapped them all they all sounded solid we even pried a couple down then i persuaded the losimon guard that they were all the same if youd pried them all down you would have found it if you turn one of the rosettes it releases a latch and a square comes downits the bottom of a box not a very big box it was crammed with all this no wonder it sounded solid her hand opened to wave at the papers papa would have been in serious trouble if these had ever been found thur cleared his throat a burning matter not quite i think depending on the prejudices against florentines of the inquisitor but enough to endanger his license and his livelihood there are recipes for spells records of experiments journal entries about two night trips to graveyards though the results seem not to have been satisfactory there is a complete account of what i take to be the casting of the great spirit ring for the lord of the medici with a record of payments though there are no names just initials but the dates match the last time papa lived in florence dangerous evidence against men who yet live papa seems to have done some things with animals that were most questionable not just rings far beyond rings my poor bunnyhere she opened to a page in the book densely scrawled with latin is an account of how he invested the spirit of one of my rabbits to animate a brass hare he cast its nose twitched it moved her finger stopped at a line and she translated it hopped upon my worktable for a quarter of an hour before its spirit was consumed and my spell failed the stiffness of the cooling brass seemed to tire it more quickly next time i shall attempt to keep the casting hot to improve fluidity dear god thur its incredible and he never so much as let oni mean this very table and we must have eaten that same rabbit for stew after and i remember the exquisite detail of that brass hareit sat upon his windowsill for a year and a half until the losimons looted it horror pride and exasperation mingled in her face her hand pressed possessively upon the notebook whether to contain or retain it thur was not entirely certain what should we do with these notes then turn them over to the abbot your father is beyond earthly prosecution i think if we can if we all live ithere are things herethere is a lifetimes thought and work bound up in these pages i could not bear to see them destroyed butthur the possibilities are horrid vitelli would not limit himself to rabbits suppose he decided to make an army of brass soldiers spirit slaves papa speculatesan army of golems he calls them i do not know that word i dont think its even latin papa danced so delicately to try to use this magic power without damning himself but others would see only the power and reach for it regardless she took a deep breath id give the book to monreale before id see it destroyed but id burn it myself before letting it fall into ferrantes or vitellis black hands all montefoglia is falling into their hands said thur bitterly and nobody seems ableor willingto stop them i tried god help me and i failed even with a cowardly knife to the back with a sledgehammer i might have done some good you dont need me fiametta you need a hero like uri trained to the sword the wrong brother lies dead in the next room thur dont blame yourself lord ferrante has been a soldier in the field for twenty years how could you expect to best him in anything like single combat lord pia held his own for a little we almost had him between us till i deserted him left him nailed to the wall like a martyr surrounded by his enemies but it was close fiametta lord ferrante is not invincible not till his army gets here anyway tonight tomorrow thur grimaced not tonight said fiametta ruberta says the rumors in the marketplace have it that the losimons are held up getting their cannon across the ford at the border but tomorrowtomorrow they may be here wearily fiametta rubbed her face i found ruberta this morning at her sisters i thought thats where she must have gone if shed lived she told me what happened here when the soldiers came that idiot teseo panicked and unbarred the door to them ruberta barely got over the back wall with her life well it saved our poor door from being battered in i suppose and made no difference in the long run oh speaking of ruberta she says to come eat fiametta sighed i suppose we must to keep up our strength our strength to run away if nothing else her face crumbled she brought her clenched hand down on the tabletop with a bane making the notebook jump no she cried i dont want to run away this house is the only dowry i have left ferrantes bravos have taken everything they could pry loose i will not marry dowerless like a beggars brat like a slave then she just cried fiametta fiametta thur opened his hands hardly daring to touch those shaking shoulders your talents your art and magic are dowries in themselves any man must see if he isnt a complete fool and youre too good to wed a fool though i would wed you in a moment but i havent got a penny either i havent even got any clothes or shoes if we could live in bruinwald i could go back to the mines or the forge i admit theres not much call for goldsmiths in bruinwald fiametta raised a tearstained face but wouldnt you like to live here thur i could take over papas shop in a small way at first but most of the tools are leftyou could haul the wood and move the furnaces and carry out the big projects and be my hhhusband the guild council would issue you the shop permits in a minute as a minor orphan the guild would control my property but if i were married you would and and ruberta could still come cook and we could be happy here thur was taken aback by all the practical detail embedded in this picture of wedded bliss she must have been thinking about it a lot hed scarcely dared let himself go beyond the vaguest physical longinghe had to admit it was a wonderful house as far above a miners cottage as as montefoglia castle was beyond a goldsmiths mansion there were a lot of repairs to be done after the looting of course he could do repairs his hand and eye were clever enough for that id like it fine he said his mother would be astonished for him to marry so well so soon could my mother come live here bruinwald winters are so cold and lonely yes sooner or later it must be his burden to tell her about uris fate his stomach knotted at the thought fiametta blinked well theres lots of room and more doubtfully do you think she would like me yes said thur firmly he saw his mother dandling a grandchild on her knee as fiametta chinked away at some elegant goldwork ruberta cooked and he ran a furnace pouring pewter platters and candlesticks and other sturdy practical things the colored vision faded at the thought of the advancing tramp of losimon troops fiametta shared that dread the fight faded from her eyes all for nothing if ferrante wins she sighed yes lets go eat shyly defying ferrante and all the fates he took her hand as they went out into the courtyard she gripped his hand in return she paused to stare into the casting pit at the big clay lump the fragile mold for the great perseus so many works my father left unfinished if i could do one thing to ease his poor shade i would have this statue cast for him before the losimons destroy the mold or time and neglect crumble it away well never get the metal for it now thur said glumly its too bad we cant invest uri into that old greek hero like the brass hare hed make ferrante run fiametta froze what he stood very still well we cant can we i mean that would be serious necromancy black sin any more sinful than assassination thur stared uneasily at her intent face and suppose suppose the spirit uris spirit was not bound against his will suppose he was invitednot a slave but a freewill volunteer like the spirit of lord lorenzos great ring she said huskily uris spirit has already been strengthened for binding if vilely by vitelliwe have the mold the furnace the wood the spell is written out oh i understood it thur its not just words it has an inner structure her shoulders slumped but we still dont have the metal not vitelli himself could conjure a heros weight of copper out of the air a vision danced and dazzled in thurs mind like a lightning flash a grinning kobold drawing an iron bar down into solid stone as if it were porridge i cant conjure it out of the air thurs breathless voice seemed to his own ears to be coming from a great distance as across a sea but i swear i can conjure it out of the ground chapter seventeen now this is truly and straightly forbidden said fiametta glancing around the front work chamber at her companions friends allies ruberta and tich sat on opposite sides of a double diagram fiametta had drawn on the floor in chalk in the center of one axis lay uris body on an absurd indefensible impulse she had placed a pillow beneath his head as if he were sleeping he didnt look asleep that gray stiffness was unmistakably death thur sat crosslegged in the center of the other axis looking scared but determined the rooms shutters were closed and locked candles at the diagrams cardinal points gave practical as well as symbolic illumination if anyone wants to withdraw youd better do it now tich and ruberta shook their heads identically tightlipped im ready said thur sturdily we must all be mad thought fiametta well if they were ferrante had driven them so thus evil bred evil not all evil i do not compel uris soul i only beg of it she once more checked through the recipe for a seance in her fathers notes if he had left nothing out then neither had she are you sure i dont do anything asked thur plaintively you do nothingin a a positive sense i think it must be harder than it sounds you have to give up control fiametta reflected on this you have to really trust your your guest thur shook his head smiling sadly any otherguest no uri yes yes she pursed her lips abbot monreale starts every spell with a prayer it seems a little hypocritical here but what to say she could hardly ask for blessings upon this enterprise she bent her head and her companions followed suit in the names of jesus and mary we beg god have mercy upon us god have mercy upon us god have mercy upon us all amen murmured around the room and an anxious unvoiced presence assented too she glanced for the last time at the notes written in her fathers flowing latin hand the spoken part of the spell was brief she ran over the syllables in her mind testing each one and had a sudden insight the substance of the spell was not in the latin but in a kind of understructure of thoughtwas the insistence upon latin merely a device to keep power from the ignorant uri did not speak latin anyway just german and italian and a smattering of barracksfrench but now was surely not the time for experimentation her lips formed the words anyway a bridge of sound across a pattern held from second to second in her mind of which the chalk tines were only a mnemonic reminder uri enter these were magic words so blunt and plain her impulsiveness had spoiled the spell they must start all over again thur jerked his eyes widened his lips parting his stoopshouldered slump partly weariness partly a habit from ducking his height through unforgiving low mine tunnels vanished his spine straightened like a soldiers on parade an eager hungry almost frantic possession fiametta i am here it was thurs voice but with uris accent and intonation polished smooth and mellowed by his time in the south and his eyeshis eyes were intent and bright and very very angry its hard to stay hurry oh uri im so sorry you were killed not half so sorry as i am the flash of wry humor was all uri truly his anger was not at her it was my fault i distracted you when i screamed it wasnt you it was what fell out of that accursed footstool horrible a knot of guilty regret loosened in her heart urithurs eyes closed bless you brother for wresting me from the necromancers the eyes pressed shut more tightly as if in residue of some agony i tried to resist them they did not fight fair i imagine not said fiametta faintly god grant you grace it was hard to think of god in that dark place some men find grace in dungeons and mineshafts as if the color and noise and distractions of life blind them and only in the darkness do they see clear but i came too late and to the wrong dungeon vitellis shadow is a darkness empty even of god his face was set with the memory of that emptiness of that dark shh its all right now well hardly that fiametta thought glancing at the gray corpse but could youdare youface him again urithur flinched vitelli yes but not so unevenly matched this time uriwe have discovered a spell of papas a wonderful spell instead of casting your ghost into a ring i think we can use this spell to open a way for you into the great perseus he was you after all but for the face and the pock marks a body not of flesh but of bronze tireless and immensely strong it cannot be for long though i plan to use my firespell to keep it hot and moving for as long as possible but in that time youd have a chance one chance to strike back at ferrante and vitelli i cannoti will notcompel or bind you in any way but i will beg you uri help us make me a path to that end breathed urithur and i will fly down it great sorceress his eyes burned sandrino trusted me with his life and i stood right there openmouthed like a country buffoon as ferrante took it from him i failed my oath i was dishonored by surprisei did not trust ferrante i should have been more forward oh fiametta to wash out my dishonor in ferrantes blood id give my soul for the chance dont say that fiametta cried panicked i dont want that but if the crusaders can be soldiers for god i dont see why you cant vitelli is worse than any saracen but we need even more help than that papa would have employed ten strong workmen on this casting we have only four three because i will be attempting the spell you were there in the castlecan you tell us how lord pia compelled the kobolds in his aid lord pia has a longstanding friendship with the little rock people thats why they are so thick about the castle they had a mutual interest in caves and in the creatures that live in them urithur raised his hands and made a little batwingflapping gesture i once visited the kobolds colony in lord pias company how you may compel them i am not sure especially to work for they are lazy and flighty and would rather play tricks theyll play nasty tricks on you if you cause them pain trying to compel a kobold is a bad idea his browsdown expression became muddled all of a sudden and confused thurs voice pushed out of his own mouth with difficulty slow and slurred bribe em mothers milk theyd do anything for it his jaw opened closed then uri was back looking surprised that would work better than stealing a nanny goatits not something they are often offered they would flock to you but where would we getoh this is getting so complicated it is strange urithurs gaze grew distant what i can see now more less other walls are like glass stone is like water but i can see the kobolds in their shadowform inside the rocks and they seem oddly solid peopleyou in your fleshare like shadows used to be all garbled and distant and out of reach except right now looking through these eyes its good to see you once more he smiled briefly then grew grim all but vitelli his shadow is solid inside his flesh solid and dark of him i am afraid urithur sighed a long controlled breath you must hurry even now vitelli is moving toward binding your father in his ring its like a wrestling match and master beneforte is losing with your fathers spirit bound to his will vitelli will own all his powers and knowledge and who would doubt master benefortes power to defeat his own spell your spell our spell when does vitelli now plan to cast the ring fiametta asked intently do you know can you tell tonight tonight oh no can you see or speak to papa at all tell him but urithurs face writhed a last plaintive i cannot hold goodbye broke from his lips and he fell backward gasping all and only thur once more god god he almost wept did it hurt asked fiametta anxiously hurt thur shook his head from side to side in bewilderment dazed eyes jerking i feel sick uriuri hurts vitelli has hurt him can we move now asked tich breathlessly is it safe yes its over nodded fiametta tich stuck his legs out in front of him and bent and stretched and ruberta hitched around in her bundle of skirts and petticoats no its only beginning fiametta realized and we have so little time its grown so complicated and ferrantes soldiers might descend on us here at any moment and oh she shuddered nearly overwhelmed well do it step by step fiametta said thur the last wont look so big once the first is done whats first the copper for which we must have the kobolds for which we must have hmm he frowned at the ceiling i dont think a wet nurse will drop down from the sky said fiametta tartly following his gaze at least not one who would be willing to put a nasty little rockdemon to her breast and we cannot involve an unwilling soul which means we must reveal what we are doing and if told and if she does not agree she could betray us ruberta snorted oh you children fiametta looked up puzzled at her dry tone do you think you are the only ones hurting from this evil the housekeeper asked ferrantes soldiers have been swaggering around town for days making enemies for him they dont act like the guard of a new lord theyve been acting like an occupying enemy i could lay hands on a dozen unhappy women who would be willing to do far worse things to strike a blow in return you leave this to me girl ruberta grunted up and stood with her hands on her hips id do it myself in a trice but that i gave up wetnursing four years ago to become your papa s housekeeper i was getting old for it anyway its not a job for the squeamish i dont know why they encourage maidens to be squeamish theres no place in womens work for someone afraid to get her hands dirty she nodded shortly and marched out looking quite steely tich raised his eyebrows as if amused or at least bemused by her military stride dont you look like that at her said fiametta sharply some of ferrantes drunken men raped her niece two nights ago took her right off the street when she ventured out to get food for her family the girl was still in bed crying all bruised and beaten when i went there at dawn to look for ruberta the whole familys in an uproar tich hunched contritely thur took a deep breath and heaved himself up tich we can start laying the wood in the furnace while we wait and shift that stack of tin ingots right tich scrambled up too fiametta slumped exhausted oh thur i feel like ive just kicked a pebble off the top of one of your mountains and watched it start two other rocks which struck fivea mountain is going to fall on someone tonight will it be us on ferrante if i can help it he offered his hand to her she took it and he pulled her to her feet as lightly as a straw doll she bent and gathered up the precious book i had better study the spell some more and gather what i can of the necessary symbols wed best not go in and out of the house any more than we can help the smoke from rubertas cooking fire will be put down to the guard but whats going to happen when we light the smelting furnace it s bound to attract attention it will likely be dusk by that time its past noon already thur pointed out you should also take a little time to rest before yes there was no more time for halfefforts or doubts fiametta squared her shoulders she must dance atop this falling mountain or they would all be buried in it may god have mercy upon us amen the knocking on the door from the street was unmistakably ruberta her habitual loud thump followed by three short taps repeated impatiently fiametta hurried from the front workroom to let her in the afternoon was waning truly ruberta had not been gone all that long considering the complexity and delicacy of her errand but the passage of time was making fiametta frantic hardly the calm and ordered state of mind ideal for a master mage to cast a major enchantment fiametta thought drearily but then she was hardly a master mage she hoped ruberta had remembered the dried rue tich not knowing rubertas knock had run to the entryway too his knife clutched in his hand fiametta waved him back to work and unbarred the oak door she swung it open to reveal ruberta capped and shawled and burdened with a basket and a large jug behind her stood a tall silent woman in a long cape with a big hood pulled up over her head shading her face ruberta gave fiametta a reassuring short nod as if to say this is it ive done it fiametta beckoned the women inside and locked and barred the door again hello said fiametta to the strange woman woman not girl there were gray streaks in her black hair drawn back in a bun and braid lady fiametta refined her evaluation her clothes were as finely made as fiamettas had been before the losimons had stolen most of them thank you for coming bless you for coming has ruberta explainedoh excuse me my name is roberta held up an interrupting finger we have agreed to name no names that was understandable fiametta nodded i havent a prayer of being anonymous but you shall be as nameless as you wish call me fiametta the woman nodded back has ruberta explained what we ask of you surely this lady was not a professional wet nurse yes i handed off my babe to my motherinlaw and ate well before i came i brought some good ale to keep up her strength ruberta added hefting the jug has ruberta explained what it is we ask you to nurse fiametta reiterated making sure yes rockdemon gnome kobold the devil himself i dont care what you call it as long as it rebounds to uberto ferrantes everlasting sorrow she had that same burningeyed look fiametta had seen in all too many faces in montefoglia of late the losimons killed my husband on the first day they murdered my firstborn my bonnie boy my blooming young man in a street fight these two days past the plague took my middle two babes years ago only the toddler is left and now i shall get no other her hands clenched fiametta knelt and kissed them each then you are as ready to start as i am she rose again come with me fiametta led them through the courtyard toward the kitchen she walked wide around the chained losimon who was awake and gagged again he made a menacing lunge toward them was brought up short by his chain and sneered the tall woman garnered her cloak away not in fear but as one might draw away from a leper and gave him a direct and murderous stare despite his bindings he managed to return an obscene hand gesture but then gave up and sat down sulkily as thur appeared hefting his sledgehammer thur and tich accompanied the women into the kitchen where thur raised the trapdoor for them fiametta lit the lantern and led the woman down into the root cellar a chamber half the size of the kitchen partly lined with shelves and stone jars thur also let himself down the narrow stair almost a ladder ruberta and tich watched anxiously from above fiametta upended a crate and the woman seated herself on it as gracefully as on a velvetcovered chair the walls were surfaced with cobbles the floor was beaten earth but for an outcrop of stone montefoglian soil was thin fiametta set the lantern down and squatted next to thur who was staring at the rock as if he might see through it however limpid it might look to uris ghost the rock remained stubbornly opaque to her thur spread his hands out on the rough surface and cocked his head as though listening smear some milk on the stone thur suggested after a moment the nameless lady rose undid her bodice and leaned over to place a squirt of milk where he pointed fiametta rubbed it about and rather desperately called here kobold kobold kobold youre not calling a crowd of alley cats criticized tich looking down into the cellar shouldnt you chant something all the more stung because she was wondering the same thing fiametta snapped if you know so much about it you chant something here kobold kobold kobold dimness the wavering glow of the lantern silence not even the scuttle of a rat or the skitter of a roach they waited and waited its not working said tich nervously biting his finger fiametta glanced apprehensively at the tall woman maybe just a little longer im not in a hurry the woman said patience for her vengeance dripped like vitriol from her voice even tich was quelled here kobold kobold kobold fiametta tried again tich screwed up his face apparently deeply offended by this dreadfully domestic unsorcerous proceeding but then his eyes widened dark shapes twisted upon the wall and upon the sloping outcrop shapes not made by the lantern light two three four six twiggy little men rose up as if instead of casting shadows they were cast by their shadows silently they crept up around the tall woman seated on her crate the boldest reached out to touch her skirt and tilted his head in a shy sly smile lady he piped nice lady she gazed back gravely and did not flinch you shall have milk said thur but not yet who are you to say metal master asked the kobold leader it frowned at him thrusting out its bony chest he speaks for me said the tall woman quietly the kobold hunched and shrugged as if to say no offense meant its bright black eyes were avid upon her thur said in the garden court at montefoglia castle sits a stack of copper pigs each of you who helps to bring them through the earth to the courtyard of this house will be permitted to drink his er her its fill when the copper is all transported and not before too much work too heavy whined the kobold not if you work together we cant run in the sun the day is cloudy and almost done the shadow of the wall is across that end of the garden by now just a little sip on the lip first metal master thur wiped his fingers across the milk smear on the outcrop and twiddled them under the kobolds nose you like this good then bring us the copper first youll trick us cheat us eh the tall woman said if you do as he asks you shall have your reward you have my word on it her eyes held the kobolds its eyes darted away as if scorched ladys word you heard it chanted to its comrades be careful little ones thur warned avoid the dark man called vitelli i think he could hurt you the kobold gave him a pained stare its lips twisting this we know metal master have you thurs eyes went suddenly intent have you seen lord pia is he killed or does he live the kobold ducked away crouching friend pia lives but does not rise many tears are in his eyes and lady pia the duchess and julia what of them they are kept too high in the air kobolds cannot venture there very well go the sooner you return the sooner you will have your reward thur sighed and stood mindful of his head on the beams above they all climbed again to the kitchen where ruberta carefully wiped and poured ale into a venetian glass slapped tichs hand away from it and gave it to the tall woman who sat and sipped obediently fiametta thur and tich went back out into the courtyard she and papa used to take breakfast on a rustic wooden table in this courtyard when they first moved to montefoglia the space had been almost a garden cool and soothing with potted flowers and a gurgling fountain now the perseus project filled it from wall to wall the old breakfast table was shoved away under the gallery halfburied under a pile of tools and trash the furnace a beehive of bricks as tall as thur sat on a mound of rammed earth dug from the casting pit the pretty paving stones had been torn up and incorporated into its base fiametta peeked into the furnace thur had already laid in the first layer of seasoned pine tich had carefully swept and covered the channel made of wood thickly lined with clay sloping from the bottom of the furnace to the gates at the top of the mold the bigbeamed crane that had lowered the mold painstakingly into the casting pit and was intended to raise the finished statue was rotated out of the way for now the huge clay lump was wound round with iron bands just like a bell casting papa had said to prevent the mold from bursting when the great weight of molten metal poured into it fiametta walked around the pit planning her spell she would lay uris body on the side opposite the furnace no need to include the furnace itself in the diagram of forces for one thing thur and tich would have to cross and recross her lines to add wood stir the melt and adjust the play of the bellows there was no call for magic in the purely physical process of melting the bronze the moment when thur knocked out the iron plug at the base of the furnace and the metal flowed across her line that would be the proper moment to start channeling uris urgent ghost into this creation fiametta realized she was really vague about cooling times those iron bands would have to be broken loose to release uri but if done too soon the mold might burst and the statue slump if too late it might grow too stiff scaling up was always a problem papa had said and she was scaling up this spell with a vengeance i must be mad an unexpected sharp noise came from the chained losimon that fiametta finally realized was a shriek pushed out around his gag the startled guard had recoiled to the end of his chain on the other side of his pillar two kobolds lugging a bar of copper recoiled from him with twittering cries the losimon tried to cross himself and gargled through the cloth in his mouth demons demons in broad day ugly ugly man squeaked the kobolds it was dusk really fiametta decided dancing at the sky the courtyard was in shadow and overhead thick clouds scudded across a purpling sty it was growing chill she could smell rain in the air over here thur motioned to the kobolds to bring their burden to the furnace tich ran to the kitchen with the news by the time he returned with ruberta and the nameless woman a second pair of gnomes were emerging from the ground beside thurs feet there was something revoltingly organic about how the earth squeezed them forth reminding fiametta of the clown in the marketplace who extruded whole eggs from his bulging mouth for a trick but they brought another copper bar with a giggle the first pair dove back headfirst into the earth then the third pairemerged cheerful as cicadas thur began stacking the copper carefully in the furnace alternating with more wood master beneforte had filled a downstairs storeroom with select pine laid in to dry especially for this project the losimons had taken somehow closely had her father calculated his fuel they would find out more kobolds or the same kobolds popped up like weasels fiametta soon lost count but thur did not thats the last he said fiametta came to his side as he backed out and closed the iron door to the furnace through which hed been squeezing to load ingots and fuel he rubbed his hair out of his eyes with the back of a dirty hand he was big and warm and his blue eyes were exhilarated even the absurd undersized robe he wore like a tunic with his bare calves sticking out could not quite make him look silly he could burn for this for her there was a momentum in this moment that had nothing to do with ferrante she could feel it the drive of art from the inside out the determination to complete she had hated her father some days for being as willing to consume others as himself to fuel that drive and what shed hated in her father she was not at all sure she liked finding in herself are you scared she asked thur no yes im scared i might do something to spoil all this beautiful preparation i mean the furnace alone is a work of art no wonder his ghost lingered cut off so close to this being finished its a wonder hes not howling around it if i can bring this offit would be a brideprice for your papa worthy of you poor miners son be damned be not thur you realizei have no idea what the effect on the statue will be when the spell wears off nor on uri the little brass hare was fine you said its going to be magnificent youll see he paused we can light the furnace now thats a job for me fiametta brightened in a whiff of nostalgia i used to light all of papas fires for him they gripped hands then thur stepped back fiametta closed her eyes for you papa and for abbot monreale and ascanio and his mama and poor lord and lady pia and tich and ruberta and her niece and the lady with no name for all of montefoglia piro the furnace roared then the sound dropped to a busty hiss thur started pumping one bellows and on the opposite side of the beehive tich began working the second pair in a private spot beyond the furnace sheltered by the gallery the nameless lady sat watching with interest the first light from the furnace picked out an approving glitter in her dark eyes she drew her cloak around a kobold one of a cluster at her feet who turned its wrinkled face up to her adoringly in the twilight one could almost imagine them as children almost a few sparks wavering in the heat rose from the furnace vents but not much smoke the wood burned hot and dry and clear just as it should not not too conspicuous fiametta hoped but we had better not be too long at this she rounded up ruberta and together they carried uris bier into the darkening courtyard enough light leaked from the furnace to prevent stumbles but fiametta decided to have ruberta hold a lantern for the next part i can draw the diagram and lay out the symbols and then rest while the bronze is melted as long as we are all careful not to step on them ill draw them as close and tight to the bier and the pit as i can you hold the light so i can be sure there is no break in the line wheres your chalk girl asked ruberta this spell doesnt use chalk she knelt and took a small sharp knife from the basket of tools and objects she had made ready she rolled up her right sleeve and turned her palm out to expose her wrist she studied her veins um ruberta held her hand to her lips in dismay but suggested faintly parallel to your tendons dear not across them if you still mean to be able to write or do anything else after uh right good idea thank you this was hard think of it as practice for childbirth the lines had to be drawn with the mages own blood no one elses would do she had to give papa credit for that one anyway no easy way she dug the knife in pointfirst and dragged it through her flesh she had to do it again before the blood was flowing freely enough down her hand for her to write with her index finger she cleared her mind stepped to uris head and began her head was swimming by the time shed murmured her way all around and closed her circle at the starting point another problem of scaling up she stopped squeezing her arm and the blood oozed to a halt she sat a moment on the ground to recover is it melting yet wheezed tich to thur sagging on his bellows is it time to add the tin not nearly thur poked his head around the side of the furnace and grinned at him if you add it too soon the tin exhales from the alloy and you lose your trouble and expense weve hours to go yet tich moaned but after a few moments of whispered conversation a couple of smirking kobolds crept out of the corner by the lady and took over his bellows jumping and hanging off the handle like monkeys tich sweated and rested by fiametta the rest of the kobolds pitched in alternated with diving in and out of the furnace in their shadowform hooting and giggling the orange glow from the flames lit the demonic scene the losimon prisoner also saw it as a vision out of hell it seemed for he had given up his surly sneer and cowered snivelling and weeping on the far end of his chain the whites of his eyes wide in the dare ruberta brought watered wine and bread and hard garlic sausage all around fiametta ate gratefully but thought we have to speed this up papa its a wonder hes not howling round this thur had said in all innocence a wonder indeed where was master beneforte why was his shade not drawn to this his obsession she could scarcely imagine a more potent conjuring for him it wasnt a problem of range he had appeared as far away as saint jerome she closed her eyes and tried to empty her mind to listen and feel papa nothing if he did not come to this it could only be because he could not bound or partly boundshe pictured vitelli winding him into smaller and smaller confines a room a diagram finally to a fingersbreadth how soon very soon she thought queasily and what of vitelli himself there was enough to her quiet preparations to draw his supernatural attention if he were actively looking vitelli and papa must be fully occupied with each other to be so conspicuously absent here its like a wrestling match and master beneforte is losing she opened her eyes rose and walked over to the furnace thur had folded down the top of his robe and was now naked to the waist his body glistened in the light and heat as he poked a long iron stirringrod through the access window is it melting yet fiametta asked anxiously starting to she closed her eyes concentrated deeply and recited piro piro piro she stopped dizzied when she opened her mouth her breath steamed the furnace roared orange sparks spiraled up out of the vents into the night air and were whipped away by the rising wind fiametta save your strength thurs big hand closed in concern on her shoulder we havent much time left i can feel it i am afraid his grip tightened we can do this thing he breathed in her ear its going to be magnificent in the bright blue light of his eyes she could almost believe tich staggered out under a huge double armload of pine which he dropped at his feet with a clatter this is the last of it he gasped what said thur surely not already he peered through the furnace window again with troubled eyes sorry said tich not another splinter well lets load it in together they heaved the wood into the furnace while the kobolds manned the bellows thur stirred with the iron rod maybe wed better put in the rest of the tin now it shouldnt be long alter that fiametta she nodded and stood back she watched the hot light play over his intent absorbed face as he stirred the flux again he feels it too the passion of making her heart grew warmer and her lips curved up in unexpected pleasure he is beautiful right now like carved ivory my muleteer who would have thought it suddenly thurs lips rippled back in a snarl no he groaned he stirred harder then stepped back driven away by the heat its caking what does that mean asked tich bewildered but frightened by thurs expression of despair it means the casting is ruined the metal is curdling ah he stamped his naked feet threw the rod on the ground and stood stiff and trembling tich slumped fiamettas breath stopped ruberta moaned the kobolds chittered in confusion thur threw his head back no he roared there must be something we can do to save it more tin more wood there is no more said tich timorously the hell theres not ill give you more wood fiercely thur rushed across the courtyard to the old rustic table and upended it clearing it of its contents with a crash yelling like a madman he took the sledgehammer to it dry oak nothing burns hotter more tich fiametta ruberta anything oak in the house benches worktables shelves chairs bring them hurry kobolds to me pump those bellows you little monsters shove these boards under the grating where the ashes fall that the heat may rise up the next few minutes were like an orgy of destruction thur dragged a big shop workbench by himself with strength gone halfberserk so that fiametta feared he would burst her careful stitches again thur tich even the kobolds helped whack the furniture apart the kobolds seemed to enjoy it squealing and shrieking ruberta even threw in her wooden spoons the fire thundered sparks and flames flying up out of the vents in a river coursing skyward it must look like a signal fire from outside panting thur opened the furnace window and stirred again his face fell and his shoulders slumped he crouched his smudged scorched face sagging almost to his knees its not enough he gasped its over he curled there staring at nothing fiametta bent over a belly that ached in sympathetic synchrony to come so close and fail now god did not wait for death to damn them to eternal torment it was present in life pewter thur whispered in the smoky silence what pewter screamed thur bring me every scrap of pewter you have in this house not waiting he leapt for the kitchen to return juggling an enormous armload of old plates platters and porringers he threw them through the furnace mouth as fast as he could and ran back for more fiametta sprinted up the gallery stairs and through the upstairs rooms she returned with a mug a battered basin and a pair of grubby old magic candlesticks that lit themselves with a word from anyone that the losimons had not recognized as valuable ruberta brought more spoons in all there must have been over a hundred pounds of metal thur stuffed it all into the furnace crying ha ha he stirred jammed more oak into the grate stirred again the roar of the conflagration was omnivorous ominous drowning out the distant thunder that echoed across lake montefoglia its melting thur howled joyously his lips drew back in a demented grin it liquifies oh its beautiful beautiful fiametta get ready she scurried to her chosen spot the apex of a triangle halfway between uris head and the casting pit and knelt on the churned earth how she was supposed to think evoke a master mages serene control in this screaming satanic chaos she did not know thats why you memorized this spell dont think just do she touched the six herbs arranged in front of her the knife the cross she touched the powders to forehead and lips on impulse she swiftly crossed herself fathersonandholyspirit god god be god be praised for all wonders she closed her eyes opened her heart and mind uri was a pressing force a towering will hovering at her hand three parts rage and one part terror his dear humor almost gone i did love you in some way she opened her eyes looked at thur and nodded tich swept the cloth cover from the channel thur grasped the crooked iron bar and hooked the plug from the bottom of the furnace whitehot fire streamed out driving back the shadows it ran down biting through the line of fiamettas drying blood and poured into the gate of the great clay mold a river of light as swift as hot oil uri flowed through fiametta a thousand thousand images of memory climaxing in the mortal wrenching dark of his death all in the midst of motionher mouth opened and her back arched in agony it burns oh it burns mother mary mother above them in the roaring rising heat the wooden gallery caught fire yellow flames licked over the balustrade and railing the door to the street began to shake with great blows and the yells of men still the fire in fiamettas veins coursed on and on she dared not move she dared not break surely she was about to ignite like the gallery explode like a human torch tich ran to the stairs with a futile little bucket of water thur picked up his sledgehammer in the paved hallway the door burst inward three losimon soldiers holding a battering ram stumbled in on their own momentum behind them strode their shouting officer his sword drawn a bearded savage blackmouthed man swearing furiously in the channel the last of the bright metal sucked away into the mold her spell released fiametta as abruptly as an opening hand she slumped to the ground unable to move barely able to breathe and not even knowing if she had succeeded or failed the losimons ran to the courtyard and hesitated doubtless stunned by the incomprehensible scene before their eyes the burning gallery the shrieking women for ruberta and the nameless lady were running after tich with more water kobolds flying every which way the spasming chained guard howling through his gag and bucking wildly fiametta her face sideways on the ground giggled thur stood gently swinging his hammer one man with a workers tool against four swordsmen fiametta stopped giggling and rolled over to gaze glassily into the casting pit what had happened down there let me out something called fiametta didnt think she heard it with her ears let me out thur she wheezed jump down and knock off the hoops the iron retaining hoops he glanced back and form at her at the mold at the advancing losimons with their swords cautiously the spirit ring feeling in front of them as if for invisible enemies he slid into the pit and began clanging at the clasps of the reinforcing iron bands fiametta s heart raced suppose it was too soon suppose the mold shattered and whitehot molten bronze spewed out drowning him one band sprang apart then another another the point of a sword touched fiamettas throat pressing her to the ground she looked up into a dark bearded face devoid of humor devoid of intellect almost devoid of humanity put down that mallet and come out of there or ill run her through the losimon lieutenant snarled thur abandoning his hammer lifted himself out and rolled away on the opposite side of the pit he crouched froglike on his hands and knees and grinned eyes glaring catching his breath in the pit the clay began to crack apart with a sound like shattering crockery it scaled away fragmenting and powdering deep within the cracks something glowed red as blood something shrugged off its clay tunic like a dog shaking off snow a severed head appeared first at the top clutched and brandished in a strong hand bronze snakes cherryred writhed upon its mythic skull shoulders hunched pulled back a muscular arm holding a curved sword broke free then a winged helmet and with the jerk of his chin a mans face but not the serene face of the bland greek no its uri thought fiametta complete with his pock marks she was insanely glad to see those pock marks the molten gaze rose and found the gaptoothed lieutenant remember me the burning eyes silently cried for i remember you the bronze lips smiled a terrible promise the losimon broke at last and ran screaming chapter eighteen fiametta pushed herself up to her hands and knees then sat up on her heels the gibbering gaptoothed losimon was caught and held by two of his men who had not seen what was happening in the casting pit the third soldier finished breaking the prisoners chain with blows from his sword against the stone pillar the freed man repaid his comrades pains by knocking him down in his rush for the exit thunder rolled close overhead in the midnight sky shaking the house uris hands burdened each with the curved sword and the fiery head of the medusa came up over the edge of the pit red bronze muscles rippled as he heaved himself out a glorious nude hero even in the glare from the burning gallery he glowed with his own dark red light except for his eyes which were yellowwhite it must be the magic holding him together at that temperature fiametta thought woozily his outlines were crisper more perfect even than her papas fine wax copy of his body had been thur jumped lightly down into the vacated pit to retrieve his sledgehammer which evidently gave him quite as much comfort as it gave his enemy onlookers unease the hot bronze uri gazed down upon the cold fleshly uri then raised his eyes to thur the two brothers exchanged a look and even in the blank moltenyellow radiance of the metal fiametta read regret and sorrow and something like love mixed with the determination and rage thur his blue eyes flashing with the water standing in them raised his sledgehammer in solemn salute lead us captain ochs in the name of god bruinwald and duke sandrino follow me boy uri responded with a slow smile and ill give you a show to tell my nieces and nephews mind you do his bronze voice reverberated tike a blast from an organpipe deep loud with undertones to raise the dead yet still somehow uri his yellow eyes found fiametta scrambling to her feet i havent much tune let us be about it lead we follow said fiametta breathlessly her house was burning down so what she turned her back on it uri bent his gaze upon the four losimons who supporting each other had somewhat regained their nerve they took a stand in a cluster backs prudently to the exit hall uris fingers flexed on his sword hilt and he strode toward them the churned earth blackened steamed and smoked in his deep footprints the blackmouthed lieutenant took his sword and his bravado and made a rush at the approaching apparition his sword clanged off uris nude side jolting his arm uri raised the head of the medusa and brought it down upon his murderers skull smashing him to the ground the losimon convulsed once his legs kicking then lay without moving the survivors retreated crouching and covering each other in an almost orderly fashion till they reached the shattered oak door to the street the semblance of discipline burst as they sprinted away fiametta almost grabbed up the dead fellows dropped sword just in case uris ruddy weapon was impressive but she was uncertain how bronze and heatsoftened bronze at that was going to stand up to weapons of tempered steel then she realized uri could not exchange his sword it was melded one with his hand thur hugged fiametta around the shoulders as they followed uri into the street fiametta stopped taken aback by the sight of the crowd which was assembled there a couple dozen people milled about men boys even a few women in every sort of dress and halfdress and nightshirts fiametta recognized the faces of several neighbors lorenzetti the notary who lived next door rushed up to her the losimons had looted his house too his head was still bandaged from some illadvised resistance fiametta what is happening what have you done my house is on fire she said numbly with frightened cries the crowd fell back from around uri though not very far back they goggled and shouted amazed queries we have made a bronze hero a soldier to fight the losimons for us and free montefoglia were on our way to kill ferrante now please stand back the three remaining losimons had stopped and formed ranks again in the dark street on the far side of the crowd they hovered on the balls of their feet watching and waiting a man among fiamettas neighbors bembo the wax chandler held a torch aloft more torches arrived from where fiametta did not know and the fire was shared doubled and doubled again lorenzetti squinted gaped and stammered isnt that uri ochs sandrinos swiss fellow i played dice with him he died owing me half a ducat hey uri uri gave him a cheery salute with his sword hand in exchange for the recognition lorenzetti backed a step wildeyed and opened his hands in a bow well you have my blessing hey make way there he gestured the crowd apart the losimons were suddenly framed by two ranks of their victims an odd abrupt silence occurred half by chance a cobblestone flew out launched by an angry young man it bounced off a losimons breastplate with a clank the losimon staggered uri began striding up the street between the people fiametta and thur holding hands like two children in the dark followed close on his heels a roar went up from the montefoglians that reminded fiametta of the furnace in full flux the losimons turned and ran this time in earnest no stopping or looking back shouts echoed through the streets above shutters banged open and nightcapped heads crowded the windows cries of curiosity and fear rained down fiametta glanced over her shoulder people were following them first in ones and twos then a stream then a river doors flew wide and more men issued knives and daggers appeared and a few swords and other weapons even more extemporaneous axes and hammers clubs hoes a mattock a rusty sickle one fat woman joined the throng armed with a large castiron frying pan more torches sprang up held high fiametta had no idea what the people at the back imagined they were following halfparade halfassault exhilarated ugly determined and confused and not at all the silent secret midnight skulk through the streets of montefoglia that fiametta had pictured and planned uri could hardly march unseen anyway fervid red in the dark like that if the inquisition ever brought her to trial for this nights work there would be a thousand witnesses lightning cracked the sky the first few fat cold drops of rain fell slapping fiamettas upturned face they boiled off uri instantly and he trailed tendrils of gaunt steam his feet hissed on the cobbles as they grew wet and shining too cold fiametta thought to the rain stop go back not yet she stumbled and thurs grip tightened and held her on her feet they came to the base of the hill and began climbing the road to the castle no hope no hope at all of sneaking in and taking ferrante by surprise losimon soldiers were already running along the walls lighting torches she could hear the rusty shriek of the portcullis being lowered as she watched the big heavy oak doors swung shut with a boom that matched the thunder echoing across the black lake no she cried agonized now what do we do ferrante can just wait in there until until uri smiled over his shoulder let us see he paused a few yards from the castle gate from above a steel crossbow quarrel whacked into his shoulder and stuck there he shrugged and brushed it away like a biting fly and studied the gate fiametta warm me he said piro said fiametta ordering the spell in her whirling mind with the greatest difficulty but its familiarity steadied her piro piro uri held up his swordhand tis enough for now he walked to the oak doors and leaned into them the wood charred and burst into flame he twisted his arms through the hole thus made and began elbowing and lacking the wood apart as if it were rotten punk burning chunks flew wide fiametta and thur chicked and crouched in the ditch uri stalked into the dark passageway between the two gate towers a few paces further on the entrance to the courtyard was blocked by the grid of the portcullis from the murderhole above a terrified losimon soldier upended a pot of burning oil on uris head uri threw back his face and laughed a great bronze trumpeting he turned under the stream of flame as under a refreshing shower as a man might sport naked in a waterfall in whoknewwhat frenzy of mind the losimons upended a second and third pot of oil after the first before it dawned on some officer that it was doing them no good flames flared up dancing and twisting from uris glistening body as he swaggered salamanderlike to the portcullis he stuck his sword arm through one square of the castiron grid wrapped it around a bar and heaved backwards the iron tore apart with a crack then another another another till he could walk through upright shoulders square fiametta picked up her skirts and dashed after him through the dying flames on the passageway floor thur on her heels thur paused to widen the gap in the portcullis with a few wellplaced blows of the sledgehammer for the convenience of those who came after and there were men coming after daring the few crossbow bolts from above that ferrante s witscattered men managed to loose they ran right and left in groups of three and six spreading into the castle to hunt down montefoglias tormentors the mob behind them clogged the gate then broke through fiametta crouched on the cobbles panting and watching uri strode into the courtyard lighting it like a human torch a gust of rain made him steam like a fumarole uberto ferrante he roared the stones bounced back shuddering echoes uberto ferrante come out half a dozen losimon swordsmen exited the castle door and spilled down the marble steps their offensive onslaught slowed and froze to defensive postures as they saw what called them they glanced at each other in horror lord ferrante stepped outside and swept his gaze over the court he wore his gleaming chain mail silvergilt in the springing firelight and his black leggings and boots he wore neither hat nor helm and a few raindrops glittered in his dark cap of hair like diamonds he stood very still for a moment then drew his sword with a slow deliberate scrape that seemed to go on forever and made fiamettas teeth ache he turned his head and shouted over his shoulder niccolo he then raised his chin and stared briefly at the north gate tower and lifted his blade in salute to someone fiametta could not see as if to say i dedicate this death to you then alert sword ready he stalked slowly down the stairs his guards with backwards nervous glances spread out in a screen before him for a little time till uri raised his hands and started toward them to a man they broke and ran ferrante watched them go without surprise a little ironic smile playing about his lips but he did go so far as to open his mouth and bellow niccolo again louder niccolo to me now did ferrante sense himself to be outmatched fiametta thought so and yet still he stood there on the last rainsilvered marble step and did not retreat hes evil whispered thur but fiametta felt it too brave or fey no wonder men followed this man fiametta had sometimes wondered why angels were reported to spend so many tears on sinners they do not weep for the evil they weep for the good that is wasted in it so said ferrante and moistened his lips sandrinos incompetent guard captain rises from the waves like venus i thought wed killed you so said uri with an attempt at matching irony my incompetent murderer care to try again he lifted his red sword in invitation ferrante fiametta thought did irony better he had the style for it but uris rage burned visibly in rising waves of heat and what his words lacked in bite they made up in power ferrante cocked his head halfsmiling and stepped off the stairway i think you are in my secretarys department but i shall do my best to entertain you till he arrives and over his shoulder his brows lowering and his lips rippling in irritation niccolo what so occupies mm that he does not come running whispered thur i think i know fiametta whispered back heartsick but she could not yet race off through the castle searching for papa she had to stay with uri and keep him heated ferrante lunged the first flurry was brief ferrantes blade flicked past uris guard but then clanged uselessly off the bronze skin ferrante skipped backwards his stunned fingers flexing on his sword hilt and the last irony left his face to be replaced by an expressionless concentration he closed again to try for a stab at uris yellow eyes then recoiled teeth clenched hissing with pain as uris attempt to brain him with the head of the medusa brushed past his cheek and raised a swathe of instant white blisters he cannot win hes got to run why doesnt he run fiametta whispered fiercely she wanted ferrante to run be a coward yes and utterly contemptible but instead he closed on uri again clanging thrust and parry parry hes testing himself thur said suddenly he wants to be the best he wants to know hes the best and he wants everyone else to know it too hes mad what is uri about why doesnt he just pick up ferrante and crush him the method in uris attack came clear finally as he forced ferrante to trip and fall backwards on the marble steps uris sword lashed out and pinned him there pressing into his chain mail in the identical spot to uris own mortal wound uris face tightened in wrath and he leaned on his sword with all the inhuman weight of his dense metal body niccolo screamed ferrante at last a timbre of purely human terror he is brought down thought fiametta he is brought down but it gave her no joy the chain burst and the sword drove through ferrantes chest searing flesh and quenching blade in one motion uri stood bent holding ferrante in place for one long long moment vitelli flew out the castle door and cannonaded off the marble balustrade his black symboldecked robe flaring he brandished his right fist in triumph upon his index finger gleamed a gold band with a mask in the shape of the face of a bearded man my lord i have it fiametta breathed a silent wail her fists clenching hopelessly we were too slow ferrante rolled his eyes up toward him and gasped out youre late niccolo on purpose no lord vitelli screamed in horror seeing him pinned there a beat too late for conviction dont lie to me niccolo i hate a man who lies i saw you hovering in there waiting saw the whites of your eyes damn your eyes niccolo his mouth opened and his face contorted in rictus agony as uri put his foot to his chest and drew the sword back out for just a moment uri hesitated staring warily up at the sorcerer with a face so strangely set as to almost make him appear inert metal in truth then in two bounds the marble cracking under him uri leapt up the stairs between vitelli and the door vitelli launched himself onehanded over the balustrade and jumped to the cobbled court his knees bent and he grunted with the force of his landing but he straightened and danced back with room to move his hands sweeping his velvet robe straight i have you simulacrum he screeched at uri cold will freeze you where you stand and birds will nest in your ears he muttered gestured uri advancing determinedly upon him down the stairs slowed uris red glow faded and his new bronze gleam shone instead on his nose ears toes with a tortured effort he raised his sword arm piro piro piropiropiro fiametta cried uri shook himself redhot all over and began to move again catfooted across the stones maneuvering for his cut fiametta fell to her hands and knees vitelli shot fiametta a look that saidlater and youll wish that youd never been born but then was forced to turn his entire attention upon uri he trod backwards and rubbed his new ring his lowvoiced muttering became intent then rose to a shout thus i release you fry unbonded and be free the bronze uri stopped short vitelli his eyes narrowing in triumph straightened and strolled closer to inspect the frozen hero no groaned thur he has your papas spell fiametta the one you said he used to release the baby spirit from ferrantes first silver ring we are undone god help us and uri too he hefted his sledgehammer eyes rolling at vitelli and inhaled ready to strike against the impossible odds the smirking necromage circled around in front of the silent statue no wait hissed fiametta scrambling up and clutching thurs arm thats not right its not right wait the bronze uri grinned his whisper reverberated off the castle walls you cannot release me i am not bound in a vicious whistling flat arc he swung his sword fullforce and took vitellis head but not before his words were heard and understood so that the last expression on that blackbrowed face as it rotated through the air was of the most confounded dismay it landed rolled stopped silence fell and gusts of rain fiametta looked around about a hundred people were watching standing back all around the perimeter of the court three smudged white women s faces were pressed to the window slits in the north gate tower most of the witnesses were montefoglian townsmen with a few dazed losimons being held at swords point distant shouts screams and crashes wafted from odd corners of the castle as the last of ferrantes men were winkled out by the mob vitellis blood pooling on the cobbles steamed gently in the cold night air uri steamed too standing back in the rain his red glow was darkening and the gleam of metallic bronze beginning to frost his edges and surfaces cold and a kind of lonely premonition quenched the bright triumph of his eyes he must go soon from his temporary metal body go where and where was papa she thought of the new gold ring on vitellis dead hand and started toward it she must retrieve it maybe abbot monreale would know what to do with it it had to be possible to release papa from the ring and the ring from vitellis will for how could one dead man be bound to another ferrante too was crawling toward vitellis decapitated body fiametta saw with shock the lord of losimo was not as dead as shed thought the hot blade must have cauterized as it cut so that despite his crushed ribs ferrante was not bleeding to death as fast as uri had his face was a claycolored mask of determination and pain she raced him toward the ring thur followed with his hammer though she did not think ferrante was in any condition to offer further physical threats still there was a kind of weird glory in his unyielding will that dragged his useless body across the rainsucked stones but as she reached for vitellis right hand a cold blast knocked her backwards with the force of a club ferrante too jerked back one hand flung up to ward the invisible blow the effort broke something loose inside for he gasped once then his dark eyes grew fixed and closed no more fiametta crouched openmouthed her eyes filling with the impossible a form was condensing over vitellis body as if night were being made palpable a dark man a blackness much deeper than any shadow in this torchlit courtyard inside the black man it seemed to fiametta that she saw other little halfdigested ghosts dozens of them deformed and agonized oh no choked thur weve made another ghost will it never end no breathed fiametta her chest tight with terror worse much worse weve made a demon where was papa inside the dark man one of those subghosts was very fresh and in terrible pain the dark mans face awoke sharpening into definite and familiar features vitellis black eyes opened and glittered with their own red glow he looked almost as surprised as fiametta he turned his hands over and stared at them in wonder a shining light encircled one black finger vitelli threw back his head and laughed as he realized his continued existence and power it worked i live i am immortal now the dark man actually capered and swept a wild ironic bow toward uri who stood freezing and stunned i thank youl shed done it now fiametta thought miserably abbot monreale in one of his many sermons on the subject had once described a sin as the making of a really irrevocable mistake with permanent consequences she stared out at her vast mistake and thought the eighth deadly sin really is stupidity and ignorance she had no idea how to fight a demon none but she was heartcertain that if vitelli once escaped the consequences would be dreadful what have you done with my papa she quavered to the vitelli demon she should not have attracted its attention she realized as it bent those red eyes upon her his will is mine now vitelli whispered in a voice like ice you are too late it smiled a hellish smile he is too late also its face rose toward the gate a horses hooves clattered and scraped on the cobbles fiamettas heart leapt up and she wanted to scream triumph and relief it was abbot monreale riding to their rescue on a white horse fiametta thur he shouted her scream melted away in her throat as she took in the doubtful details in the first place there was the horse she knew that horse even the cavalry saddle monreale had borrowed from somewhere failed to conceal its swayed back it stood wheezing and blowing its nostrils red and round in its gray muzzle its expression mournful and its legs trembling abbot monreale must surely be a miracle worker beloved of god for he had somehow forced the beast to trot uphill monreale wore his gray monks robe nicked up with his bare legs sticking out and his sandals all awry from beating at the old horses sides his hands were a tangle managing his crozier the reins and a couple of bottles his hair stuck out as wildly as his bushy eyebrows and he had a big lumpy purple bruise on his forehead fiametta he cried again and choked as his eyes took in the tableau in the courtyard i was going to say he continued in a strange mild conversational tone fiametta whatever you do dont kill vitelli his gray eyes locked with the red ones of the dark man fiametta gratefully felt herself slide from vitellis dangerous attention everything about monreale looked absurd just now except for his eyes never breaking his gaze monreale swung his right leg over the white horses sagging neck and jumped lightly down he tucked the bottles into his robe stood his crozier upright and ran a hand thoughtfully down its length he walked forward then stopped with a jerk as if feeling the same cold blow fiametta had jacopo sprenger though your spirit is parted from your body you still partially exist in the world of will while your will is free you may yet effectively repent confess your sins and profess your faith i swear to you god is greater than any evil you can encompass stop stop now and turn your face around monreale s voice was anguished in its sincerity he had ridden through the night not to destroy vitelli but to save him fiametta realized and she saw too a dreadful danger in it vitelli might try to trick monreale challenge him into dropping his guard despite all doubts monreales own conscience would compel him to try vitelli in all good faith but vitellis pride in his power scorned to dissemble the dark man crossed himself mockingly with an obscene gesture the next gesture was something more effective and when the swirling colors departed from fiamettas eyes and the roaring from her ears abbot monreale was on his knees and not in prayer he brandished his crozier though and counterattacked vitelli seemed to shrink into himself but only for a moment uri could be no more help he was freezing to cold bronze even as fiametta watched and there was not enough fire left in her spirit to make him hot again she could not even stand up but sank to her knees then her hands and knees and finally to the wet cobbles any passing losimon could cut her throat this moment and she might do no more than look dully at him thur crouched worriedly beside her and caught her shoulders the spirit ring the gold gleamed on the corpses hand not two yards off no wonder spiritmagic was so rare so hard to accomplish so fragile when invested if only she knew her papas spell of unbindingshe pictured the moment ferrantes upraised hand the crack and flash of the silver ring the smell of burning flesh but she did know rings she had laid a little part of herself into the gold of her lionring it was held there by held there by structure she muttered muzzily the spell had fallen into the molten metal like a seed crystal into the alumwater that the dyers used and from it structure had feathered out like frost intricate and beautiful the reverse must be the reverse must be she rolled over on her face on the pavingstones a little way from that dead adorned hand she had not enough power left to reanimate uri no but she had some gold was a softer metal than bronze and there was little more than a thimbleful in that ring it was enough it would do piro she whimpered piro the gold mask sagged slagged the metal dripped as the flesh it encircled scorched spattered steamed and blackened the acrid scent of burnt meat seared her nostrils the dark vitelli screamed as the band of light on his shadowhand vanished he whirled his red eyes flaming rage and focused on fiametta she smirked at him from the circle of thurs arms quite unable to move he seemed to inhale towering up and up into a spindle of black smoke that slid sinuously into the open mouth of the bronze medusahead held high in uris frozen left hand the little snakes upon the skull turned cherryred and began to squirm the heads eyelids slitted open in hot white lines the face twisted slowly and the ghastly eyes opened wide and found fiametta he will burn me to ashes where i lie thur get away get back she tried to twist from his protective arms which tightened in distraught confusion and then between her and that obscene head the rain man appeared he was made all of dense suspended diamond droplets that glittered like tiny rainbows in the torchlight he shone as bright and brilliant as the shadow vitelli was dark he was amazingly beautiful he wore a glittery pleated tunic a big round hat like rainbrocade his beard was fog and his eyes were liquid and luminous papa fiametta breathed happily he blew her one kiss or was it a raindrop landing chill on her skin she rubbed her cheek in wonder trembling a beam of incandescent fire lashed out in a double line from the medusas eyes all the rain in its path turned to steam boiling clouds of it but the rain man reformed unharmed only whiter for the added fog come out of there demanded master beneforte querulously thats mine he crouched his hands cupped with the slowness of tar the black shape was drawn forth from the medusas mouth again the rain man encompassed it fiametta could see it inside him a spasming black mannikin screaming in silence master beneforte turned to abbot monreale quick monreale send us now together while i hold him i cannot hold him long monreale his face stunned levered himself up on his crozier where where does your body lie prospero the swiss boy knows thur abbot monreale turned to him go at oncetake these menfor a couple of panting monks had arrived belatedly in monreales wakeand fetch forth master benefortes mortal remains hurry thur nodded clutched his hammer and ran across the courtyard waving the monks to follow him he disappeared into the castle by a side entry gingerly monreale went to vitellis head picked it up and laid it beside the severed neck he knelt and made the rites sprinkled water from one of his jars and bent his head in prayer the mannikin inside the rainman convulsed but then went quiescent when monreale rose again master beneforte remarked i liked your little sermon on will just now but then i always liked your sermons monreale they made me good for half a day after at times i would you could have heard them more often then a brief smile quirked monreales lips you did warn us how death comes suddenly to the unprepared i was not prepared for it to come m this strange halfmeasure though he stepped closer to monreale in a liquid shimmer to be private for the awed and astounded onlookers were venturing nearer he lowered his voice to a whisper no louder than rain runneling on a shutter bless me fattier for i have sinned monreale nodded and bent his head close the voice rilled on until thur appeared with a stiff gauzeswathed shape on a makeshift bier that looked like the lid of a pine crate monreale blessed the rainshape then turned to duplicate the rites upon the notquiteabandoned body fiametta crept to the rain mans side and asked tremulously did we cast it well papa your great perseus an awful risk for a couple of beginners he began then stopped his critique in midword he tilted his hat down at her curiously as if he were really seeing her for the first time and halfsmiled well enough only well enough well that was papa he added marry the swiss boy if you will hes an honest young lout who will not betray you you will not do better for any money speaking of money ruberta is to be given one hundred ducats it is listed in my will lorenzetti the notary has it goodbye be good his form wavered as the dark mannikin raged within and fiametta if you cant be good at least be more careful he turned to monreale father your sermon is wearing off speed us while i can still will to hold him go with god my friend whispered monreale and made the last sign of blessing the rain fell and then there was nothing there at all thur raised his hands in supplication to monreale father spare a blessing for uri my brother monreale blinked and seemed to come back to himself of course boy he turned awkwardly almost stumbling thur caught his arm together they inspected the statue it was solidified in the pose in which it had first been cast but the tiny glimmer of intelligence yet lingered dimming in its eyes what sensations did that metal body bear him the very heat that animated it made it impossible for uri to embrace his brother or kiss fiametta goodbye fiametta on her knees prayed for strength and murmured piro one last time only the bronze lips flushed dark red father bless me for i have sinned the hollow voice whispered like the faintest flute though not nearly as much as i would have liked the corner of monreales mouth flicked up but he murmured dont joke it wastes your little time all my little time was wasted father the fading voice sighed monreale bent his head in acknowledgement tis a fair complete confession do not despair for it is a sin hope boy shall i hope to rest i am so tired you shall rest most perfectly by the time monreales hands had passed nothing stood before them but a lifeless casting not quite as it was first cast fiametta realized looking up the bland greek face had not returned instead uris own distinct alert imperfect features were stamped permanently upon the bronze there was even a touch of humor about the curve of the lips most alien to the classic original and she saw with a shiver the medusas face too had changed blackbrowed vitelli had the immortality hed craved of a sort chapter nineteen thur held his palm near the statues face the bronze though no longer glowing with its own light was still too hot to touch but uri was no longer there to touch even if thur could the streaming rain would cool the metal soon enough thur raised his face to the sky and let the cold drops mix with the hot ones from his eyes disguising his grief before all these strangers their world would know uri no more would soon forget that hed ever lived or laughed but i swear i will remember when hed blinked his vision clear thur saw that soldiers montefoglian soldiers were arriving through the ruined gates a couple of them pointed at the statue in startled recognition of their late captains features but then hurried about their work fiametta stood in the scintillating rain looking small and exhausted and very wet her crinkly black curls escaping her braid only to be plastered flat to her skin thur wanted to offer her a cloak but he himself possessed only the sodden old robe turned down around his loins he rucked it back up over his shoulders and stood barefoot in the puddles and shivered partly from cold partly from reaction fiametta turned her wan face to monreale how did you come here father when they carried you off to the infirmary at saint jerome under vitellis spell you were lying almost as pale and still as a dead man yourself brother mario wouldnt let me see you monreale hung on his crozier his sandaled feet apart he tore his pensive gaze from the cooling bronze the spell was broken late yesterday evening was that your doing thur i think it may have been father i did not know for sure what spell was broken but it distracted vitelli when i swept a spellset from the table it was just before i escaped from the castle dungeon with my brothers body indeed said monreale i woke but i was very sick hie healers kept me abed until morning when i finally regained enough strength to ride over them it was not until afternoon that i discovered you were gone from saint jerome fiametta and no one seemed to know for how long i sent out my birds but could learn little except that vitelli and ferrante were not abroad and thur was not yet hanging by his neck from the castle tower sandrinos officers and i agreed we must attack try as wed planned yesterday but i decided i must close the distance before attempting to grapple again with vitelli his powers had clearly grown to an extraordinary degree we made ready settling on a night assault to disguise our thin numbers wearily he rubbed the back of his neck his eyes narrowed and glinted with the press of these recent memories we sallied out at dark and had a sharp fight with the besiegers that delayed us again we finally broke through and made for town the soldiers needed the few horses we had but a brother found that white one wandering among our sheep our remaining sheep is that the beast your papa bought in ceccnino fiametta he was robbed well it saved my strength i suppose but when we all came up to the town gates expecting a desperate battle the losimons were gone from them pulled out by a mob of townsmen so instead of leading the populace to the castle we followed them i had by then gained the idea that you were mounting some sort of magical attack fiametta and i rode ahead as fast as i could in great fear that vitellis demonic powers might indeed have grown so transcendent as to conquer death and so it proved monreale vented a depressed sigh not that this secondrate old man imagined himself a match for that dark power yet you came anyway said thur father we would have been destroyed without you in fact fiamettas brows drew down puzzling this out none of us alone was a match for vitelli i could release papa but i could not hold vitelli papa could hold vitelli but could not exorcise him you could speed him to banishment which thing neither papa nor i were capable of but only if he were held and we could never have entered in here at all without uri who would not have been made without thur we may all of us be lesser folk but we were a firstrate company together huh monreale smiled slowly his eyes halflidded could that be the lesson god had been trying to teach me all this time from the mouths of babes i am not a babe said fiametta with some determination child from the vantage of my halfcentury you all look like babes monreale pulled himself up by his crozier straightening painfully he gazed a moment more at the bronze statue no you are not a babe and so you stand in a grown womans danger father said thur theres something you had better see right away before it gets disturbed i left one of your monks to guard the door monreale nodded lead me boy for there is much yet to do thur beckoned him into the castle by the servants entry and down the nowfamiliar corridors into the dungeon at least they were out of the rain a monk held a torch for his abbot thur was not sure how the stonecut halls could be any darker at night than in the day but they seemed so the strength that relentless terror had lent him was passing off and he bumped into the walls as he walked limped every muscle he owned seemed shot through with rust and grit twinging when he moved aching when he stood still the racks of iron bars that were the cell doors stood open the prison was halfemptied of prisoners the hale had already departed to join the fray the injured were being helped out by montefoglian townsmen some of them relatives thurs little procession wound down the stairway to the lower half a whitefaced monk stood holding thurs sledgehammer outside the shattered splintered door to the necromancers magic work chamber they all entered after monreale and thur took the one burning candle and lit the slagged remains of others from it monreales breath hissed out between his front teeth the trestles were knocked over and the salt crate dropped and split and spilled where thur and a monk had snatched the lid in their haste to bring out master benefortes body upon the floor spiraled a complex double diagram one lobe was emptied thur had lifted up master benefortes remains himself when the frightened monk had refused to touch themthe other lobe framed yet another corpse a naked young man dreadfully mutilated his throat slit that was the power by which they finally forced papa into the spirit ring breathed fiametta peering fearfully around monreale the new ghost i saw him inside vitelli oh father she turned and closed her eyes and swallowed hard that could have been himself thur thought looking but out of the corner of his eye who is this poor wretch father monreale moistened his lips and cautiously approached and knelt by the dead mans head but whatever magic had been generated by this dark deed was apparently now consumed yes i know the boy hes one of my brethren his name was luca he is the monk i sent to spy two days before you thur and heard no more of vitelli must have selected him for this from among the prisoners after you escaped he has a family in town parents and brothers and sisters murder murder of the blackest he bent his head in deep sorrow and began the rites of blessing when he rose thur asked in worry should we have this room boarded up or something monreale sucked grimly on his lower up and walked around muffling his shock examining the evidence with the cool thoroughness of one who realizes he must soon write an official report upon it all hm no he gathered up the notes and papers on the worktable these should not be left about however no thur quite the contrary this room should be left open and every guard and citizen who can should be brought to view it let the evidence of vitelli and ferrantes wrongdoing be made public before as many witnesses as can be gathered he paused as many witnesses as saw a bronze statue get up and walk and slay two men at least that many witnesses he turned on his heel to face thur and fiametta you two know what you have done and we will talk of it further later the first reports to the archdiocese the curia and the general of my order will be written by me in the meantime you may be certain that the most fantastical rumors will be flying among the people about tonights events i hope as many of those rumors as possible may attach to vitelli and not to yourself do you understand fiametta nodded rather doubtfully thur shook his head in honest bewilderment monreale motioned him over and lowered his voice look boy it is absolutely essential that fiametta never come to be questioned by the inquisition they would burn her for her hot tongue alone at the end of the first day the evidence go hang understand oh thur could see it yes if you love her help her keep her head down and her mouth shut church politics are my department if necessary well a man or two owes me a favor or two but fiametta must take care not to offend her neighbors or to appear too unusual or i might not be able to control all of the consequences uh would getting married and setting up shop in her fathers house be too unusual no that would be ideal her setting up shop without getting married now that could be dangerous thur brightened ill help her all shell let me father youd better be prepared to help her more than that boy if necessary monreale murmured dryly with all my heart sir monreale gave thur a short nod and turned to go out thur paused for one last disturbed sidelong look at the sacrificed man lying in his pooled blood he was my scapegoat luca he must remember that name even as he hoped others would remember uris monreale pursed his lips yes in a sense though if you had died yesterday it would not have saved him tonight still i charge you to light a candle for him each sunday in montefoglia cathedral and pray for his soul yes father said thur comforted monreale nodded and led them out while passing again through the now nearly deserted prison corridor one level up thur heard a faint moan wait he ducked back to the end cell sure enough a bundled shape lay on the woven straw pallet why has this door not been opened where is the key thur called an elderly townsman appeared from the guard station rattling the key ring they told us he was mad sir is the proper sergeant coming to take these ill take them said monreale unburdening the townsman of the ring he passed it to thur who bent and opened the lock lord pia lay alone in the cell under a thin blanket his face was very gray and his glazed eyes seemed not to recognize thur the wound in his arm had never been bandaged and was thickly clotted with blood judging by his mottled bruises he had been badly beaten upon his final recapture to satisfy his mind thur stuck his head out of the cefl window one bar remained at the side around it were tied the points of a stretchedout silk hose leg its foot in turn tied to another to make a rope of sorts now hanging limp and wet against the cliff face how very simple thur was both relieved and slightly disappointed lord pia had not flown down like a giant bat to vitellis dark chamber window last night after all thur imagined he would have liked to monreale sent for help and soon had the poor castellan laid on a plank and carried out of the dungeon before them by a sturdy monk and another townsmanparishoner they all arrived back at the courtyard to find a swirl of shouting people coalescing around duchess letitia who had been released from the tower she had called sandrinos surviving officers to her and was organizing them to regain control of her castle first from the remaining losimons and then from the montefoglian townsmen the montefoglians while scorning to steal from their late duke directly were not above relieving any captured or killed losimon looters of their booty monreale was promptly drawn into the duchesss whirlwind lady pia ran to her husbands side looking distressed lord pia seemed to recognize her despite his debilitation and uncertain mental state he smiled weakly up at her and grasped her hand as she knelt by him she immediately browbeat some passing men into carrying him upstairs to their apartments in the tower once more a home and not a prison and ruthlessly diverted a healermonk in monreales train to her aid somehow the center of all this midnight chaos had shifted from them to monreale to the duchess thur was just as glad the rain was letting up turning to a fine misting drizzle thur put his arm around fiamettas shivering shoulders i guess we can take your papas body home now if my house is still standing what hat of uri you mean the statue leave it i suppose its only a statue now nobodys going to steal him without the aid of a couple of yokes of oxen she nodded her eyes wide in the wavering halflight they picked their way to the crate lid resting on the cobbles with its shrouded burden thur i dont think i can carry my half she worried i dont think i could either right now thur said honestly dyou want your horse back the white horse was sniffing dolefully at the cobbles where no grass grew it had not wandered far and for some reason no one had attempted to abscond with it while monreales back was turned thur captured it by walking up to it and scratching it behind the ears it rubbed its head against him scraping thurs skin on the bridle studs and shedding wet white hairs thur handed the reins to fiametta and went to look for a piece of rope he found a coil hanging on a nail in the stables no one disputed his claim of it he tied one end of the rope to a stirrup wound it around the headboard of the crate lid and tied the other end to the other stirrup converting the lid to a makeshift drag or sledge the white horse flared its nostrils in worry at the scraping sound behind it and sidled giving thur a mad vision of the beast bolting across the country with master beneforte thudding and bouncing along behind in one last wild ride but after a moment the horse settled down to its usual tired plod and thur judged it safe to help fiametta aboard she wrapped her hands in the long mane and drooped over the animals thick neck thur led them out the ruined castle gate and down the hill the streets of montefoglia were growing quieter as the night waned they passed only two small groups of excited men with torches who yet swung as wide as the narrow streets permitted around thurs little cavalcade thur was too tired to do anything but ignore them they arrived at the wrecked oak door to fiamettas house without being accosted the walls were still standing nor had the tile roof fallen in that was nice if unexpected thur helped fiametta down she stumbled inside his fingers numb thur picked at the knots in the rope and freed the crate lid by that time tich came out with a lantern and led the horse around to the high gate into the back garden together they tied it out of range of the spring onions and lettuces of the kitchen vegetable plot tien brought the beast a bucket of water which it drank thirstily with a grateful snuffle that blew slobber all over him in the general filth and soot of tichs tunic it was scarcely noticeable well have to find it fodder in the morning tich said in a tone of judicious expertise this little bit of grass wont last not the way it eats ill help you go look for your mules tomorrow too tich nodded satisfied and they locked the garden gate tich helped thur carry master benefortes plank inside to lay in the front room next to uris someone had moved him to rest again in this quieter place they should be buried soon said thur properly theres going to be a lot of funerals tomorrow in montefoglia from what weve heard said tich theyll make room for these two said thur ill make them make room ruberta has put bedrolls for us in the front hall said tich she says we can guard the door that way till its fixed thur halfsmiled i dont think anyone is going to bother this house bedroll what a beautiful word thur could have wept at the beautiful charity of someone making a bedroll for him tich retired to his bedroll before it had entirely cooled but thur stumbled one last time into the courtyard a light shone there candle or lanternboth he saw entering fiametta had stuck a candlestub upright in the dirt beside the empty casting pit and was holding up a lantern for closer inspection of the damages the place looked like a midden abandoned furnace empty casting pit brokenup furniture scattered tools the center of one side of the gallery was gone the whitewash above it was black with smoke stain and charred timbers swung dangerously loose in the corners they got the fire out thur noted brightly yes said fiametta ruberta and tich and the neighbors i did not know i had such friends she sat down heavily upon the cinderscattered flagstones in her sodden velvets oh thur my poor house is a shambles now now gingerly he eased himself down beside her and stroked her shaking shoulders maybe it wont look that bad in the morning ill help you fix it up that gallerys the easy part i used to help build minetimbering you know i can build you a gallery that wont ever come down her breath puffed out between her quivering lips whether in a laugh or a sob thur could not tell is there anything you cant do i dont know thur considered this i havent tried everything her brows rose quizzically do you want to try everything he took a breath for courage id like to try being your husband she blinked rapidly and rubbed her eyes with a sootsmudged hand id be a bad wife my tongue is too sharp everybody says so youd get henpecked thur wrinkled his brows was that yes or no come where else will you find a fellow brave enough to marry a girl who can set him on fire with a word id never her spine straightened but truly i talk a lotpapa said soand im not very patient im very patient thur offered im patient enough for us both you werent very patient with the caking bronze her lips curved up yes well it wasnt right i needed it to be excellent he needed to be eloquent he shouldnt be trying to say these things when he was so damned tired he couldnt even see straight he looked up and was startled by an orange tinge outlined by the shadowy black square of the tile roof was the town afire why is the sky that funny color fiametta looked up too its dawn she said after a long moment the clouds are breaking up so it was an apricot luminosity edged slateblue masses oh his brains felt like porridge fiametta giggled and sniffled she ought to be in a bedroll and in a dry gown too he gathered her into his lap and hugged her for warmth she did not object in fact she twined her arms around his neck and so they sat for a time while the sky lightened it looks worse fiametta observed in a dreamy voice huh thur jerked awake it looks worse in the morning he stared over her rats nest of hair at the wreck of a courtyard well yes fiamettas nose wrinkled yes yes what thur asked after a minutes pause decided him that he no longer had any idea what they were talking about yes i want to marry you too oh good he blinked and hugged her closer i think its because you understand excellence what it takes what is why i love you a slow grin fought its way onto his exhaustionnumbed face of course thats why i love you epilogue by design the high light of midsummer morning falling through the clerestory windows sent a beam directly down upon the altar of montefoglia cathedral the light caught the garnet of the lion ring as fiametta slipped it onto thurs finger the gem blazed like a ruby like a star the gold lion mask seemed to purr under fiamettas hand like the most satisfied and creamstuffed of great cats thur felt it too fiametta thought for he smiled like a great creamstuffed cat himself he caught her in an embrace that bent her ribs till bishop monreale cleared his throat and they took the hint and turned obediently hand in hand to receive his final benediction fiametta could not decide if monreale looked more at home in his plain gray monks habit or as now splendid in the flowing silk red cloak and high mitered hat of the bishophric equally easy perhaps monreale was not made by his garments and so his clothes always conformed to him thurs clothes did not make him she mused so much as reveal him she kept sipping little contented glimpses from the corner of her eye even while bowing her head he had not let her see his wedding garments till this morning a conspiracy between himself ruberta and the tailor fiametta and thur had frugally divided the purchase of a length of silk between them so his green tunic matched her overgown still the clever tailor had squeezed enough material for proper pleats thurs upright bearing made the modest decorative braid on the sleeves and hem look restrained rather than plain and many a spindleshanked rich lord might envy the calves that most perfectly filled those white silk hose new polished shoes and no one needed to know he only had one other pair of boots his bright blond hair was topped by a fine big dark green cloth hat with a coppergilt badge of fiamettas own design eat your hearts out ladies of montefoglia hes mine fiametta had cast her own wedding ringwithout ensorcellments this timein the mask of a lioness its tiny gold teeth closed on a greenfaceted chip borrowed from the eye of her silver snakebelt the gems upon testing had proved to be real emeralds that chaste snake must just wink a while till she could afford a replacement stone she turned her hand a little to make the green flash and smirked into her lap they turned from the altar to collect kisses and hugs and hearty congratulations from the witnesses each according to their style lorenzetti the notary shook hands tich pecked her cheek ruberta embraced everyone and dabbed at her eyes thurs mother grasped fiamettas hands and gave her a warm smile though her swimming eyes were still tinged with a searching doubt time would put those doubts to rest monreale had assured fiametta privately fiametta smiled back in earnest hope thereof tich had escorted mistress ochs personally from bruinwald on his first roundtrip with his pack mules he had finally managed to recover all but two of the lost beasts his eager personal persuasion and good offices had much to do with prying the aging woman from her familiar cottage and carrying her on this mixed adventure fraught with both sorrow and joy to visit one sons grave and the others wedding thur and fiametta had awaited her arrival anxiously as the date of their wedding had been agreed between them to be the day after her arrival she seemed a quiet woman obviously devoted to thur perhaps that was enough mutual interest upon which to start building her acquaintance with her new daughterinlaw she had clearly been thrilled by his new clothes before leaving the cathedral they stopped into one of the side chapels this holy chamber had been the recipient over a year ago of a noble gift from master benefortes hand a fine carved marble crucifix with a white christ upon a black marble cross now affixed to the wall with its iron clamps in exchange the building committee had permitted his humble request space for a stone sarcophagus beneath our lords feet fiametta did not think this represented morbid premonition exactly because he had not then ordered the sarcophagus the stonecutters shed hired had placed the tomb only a week ago but at least it was in time for her to kneel and lay her wedding flowers upon it peace papa she whispered to her gnawing regret she had not found her mothers death mask again it had been nowhere in the patiently sorted shambles of her house nor had her inquiries among neighbors who had recovered portions of their looted possessions borne fruit even thurs peculiar talent proved no help this time though he had walked for hours absentfaced with concentration quartering montefoglia the bronze mask must have been carried out of the city i am a sorceress if i truly seek i must find you at last mama fiametta made silent oath someday someday when she rose she found monreale standing back looking at the christ meditating artistically rather than theologically for he said its very fine the proportions are strange yet they hold the eye and the mind he did not use a model it was from a vision papa told me that he had when he was in prison in rome once upon uh what he said were false charges yes i heard that tale from him the vision at least was true monreale mused well he rests now under better eyes than mine it is good for him to have such a guardian speaking of guardians he turned to her i have a wedding present for you from his robe he drew a folded piece of parchment and handed it to her she cracked it open eagerly read and bounced twice into the air wonderful my guild permit now i can make and sell spells as well as metal bagatelles only such as are inspected and approved for your level of license he cautioned you are officially listed as my apprentice so i am in part responsible for the consequences of your actions i will not be able to watch you daily as an ordinary master would but you may be sure i will inspect your shop frequently he mustered a stern frown for emphasis ill have no more such beneforte tricks as your papa played upon me now no sir fiametta danced and hugged thur now were truly in business he grinned reflecting back her shining delight monreale lowered his voice to her ear alone i mean that most seriously fiametta i had to use the utmost care in dealing with the committee from the inquisition over the matter of the late and damned vitelli to keep you out of it as far as any official report states uris spirit got into that casting by itself as an accidental result of vitellis machinations i do not recommend that you draw their attention twice it was by itself fiametta argued sotto voce i did not compel i only channeled him i tried not to trouble their minds with that subtle distinction consider the matter sealed under my authority as your master and do not discuss it without my permission eh fiametta smiled yesmaster monreale nodded grimly satisfied with blessings all round he excused himself to attend to the diocese and the chancellory business that had come upon him as he found himself chief advisor to duchess letitia in her unaccustomed role as regent for little duke ascanio the wedding party spilled out into the beautiful morning light on the cathedral steps ruberta and lorenzetti headed back on foot to the house to supervise the laying of the tables and the tapping of the wine cask respectively before all the neighbors who had helped put out the house fire arrived for the fete i dont trust that hired girl with my pastries ruberta sniffed the kobolds had not been invited in fact fiametta had not even seen one of the shy gnomes since that wild night of spell and metal casting but the bowl of goats milk she laid out nightly on the floor of the root cellar was always empty the next morning thur helped his mother up onto a white mule borrowed from tich and fiametta up onto their white horse fiametta herself had spent yesterday afternoon shampooing both beasts and scrubbing them clean of every manure stain shed pinned old sheets around them overnight to protect her labors both animals hooves were blacked with polish and their manes and tails braided with colored ribbons the white horses swayed back was built up with enough pads and flowers to look almost normal and fiametta happily arranged her green brocade outer skirt and creamwhite inner skirt over the rugs as if in response to all this attention the old horse arched its neck and stepped out finely thur walked between the two mounted women they wound through the streets and headed up the hill toward montefoglia castle the battlements seemed to glow sunny and open not the midnightsinister pile of stone they had been in the rainswept dark of that terrifying night six weeks ago only six weeks ago it seemed a world past when the word of the deaths of their leader and his dark advisor had arrived the losimon army had turned away at the border fords and marched back to their own capital a ferrante cousin appointed heir by the curia was presently scrambling for political control there and in no mood to seek extra trouble from his new neighbors the animals hooves clopped echoing off the stone walls as the women rode through the towerflanked gate into a busy and noisy castle courtyard blacksmiths were at work repairing the portcullis and their laborers stoked a portable forge lord pia dressed in summer linens and an egyptian cotton shirt leaned on a cane supervising under his wifes devoted care hed made a good recovery though appearing more frail as his hair was grayer and hed lost some of his robust girth except for a certain uncharacteristic hesitancy his tone of mind was much improved from the overstressed dementia of those days of madness magic and murder he recognized fiametta and favored her with a friendly wave of his hand fiametta waved back while trying to look very busy lest he come over and corner thur again for more talk of his proposed batwing experiments the bronze perseusuri had been raised to its stone plinth square in front of the marble staircase and so duke sandrinos captain guarded his house for all time fiametta still bit her lip in frustration that the duchess had chosen to entrust the finishing details to di rimini and not to fiametta she trusted papa was truly sped far from this world of woe even his ghost would nave been livid at the thought of his greatest work fallen into the hands of his rival though he would probably have been almost equally horrified at the thought of it in the hands of his daughter well di rimini appeared to have done a competent job so far at least the thing hadnt fallen over yet one could only carry on the duchess frugal in the uncertain days of her new widowhood had elected not to have the body of the medusa cast to lie at the perseuss feet and complete the tableau but to mount the statue as it was this saved that work from going to di rimini but also gave her the excuse to knock a full half off the payment papa had thought to get from duke sandrino thur read these tense thoughts from fiamettas face shed expressed them often and vigorously enough to his ear lifting her down from the horse before the bronze he kissed her forehead and whispered daily bread love she nodded and sighed in resignation the halfpayment plus the residue of monies still owed on the saltcellar had at least settled all of papas debts after buying new tools for the shop and setting aside enough to live on until business was established thur had stretched it further by doing repairs on the wrecked house himself his new gallery looked sturdy enough for the sultans elephants to dance upon new furniture and fine clothes could wait thur had cooled her tongue by pointing out that god only promised daily bread not a bakery and indeed the duchess had soon given her a commission for some silver and pearl jewelry for julia and where the duchess shopped all the great ladies of montefoglia must soon follow they laid the armload of flowers theyd brought at the bronze uris feet and fiametta stood back respectfully to let thurs mother gaze one last unexpected time upon the features of her lost son would she appreciate the beautiful flowing form the dramatic pose the perfection of the casting would she be moved at this monument to his memory and his courage thur the aging lady said in a choked voice hes naked her hand touched her lips in dismay well yes mama said thur placatingy phlegmatic thats the way the italians make their statues maybe its because of the hot climate oh dear thur scratched his head looking as if he was wondering if he ought to jump up on the plinth and affix a bouquet in a strategic spot to console her but she overcame her horror enough to quaver politely its its very fine im sure but hes naked fiametta could almost hear her wail in her thoughts fiametta uncertain whether to smile or snarl bit her fingers and said nothing she raised her eyes to the bronze face under the winged helmet those metal lips curled faintly at the corners and knew uri would have laughed authors note for the curious book lover id like to add a word on the principal historical sources for the spirit ring this novel started with a bookthree books to be precise all with family connections which sat side by side on my bookshelf for years the first seed from my family tree and surely the rarest book among my inspirations was a scholarly monograph published in titled the grateful dead the history of a folk story written by my great uncle gordon hall gerould b utt oxon preceptor in english in princeton university it came down through my mothers side of the family in densely written pages uncle gordon traced the history through about twenty countries and twenty centuries of a very old folk tale of that name the fastforward version goes young man goes out to seek his fortune and comes across an altercation where the body of a debtor lies unburied until his debts are paid our hero forks over his grubstake varying wildly depending on the version but always the whole of his resources and gets the debtor planted he goes on down the road to further adventures in the course in which he finds himself supematurally aided by the grateful ghost of the dead man in reward for his pious deed it was quite clear from the wide range of versions studding the monograph like little dried raisins and crying out to have the life pumped back into them that here was a universal theme of great power enter two more books inherited from my engineerfathers extensive and eclectic bookshelf de be metallica by agricola is a th century latin treatise on mining and metallurgy translated into english by herbert and lou henry hoover yes the president he was a mining engineer before he was a politician his wife was also a latin scholar agricola inspired the spirit rings hero the selfeffacing swiss miners son thur ochs the kobolds came from a footnote therein and the autobiography of benvenuto cellini of course yielded up prospero beneforte and a great deal more besides agricola is not light reading but i highly recommend cellini to all comers in it you will discover the golden saltcellar the bronze perseus the mad castellan the vision in the dungeon of the castel sain angelo and a thousand other delightful or horrifying details of the times as well as that wonderful egotistical monster cellini himself a couple dozen more research books followed in my reading you will find lorenzo dmedicis spirit ring in the gorgeously illustrated europe by franco cardini but these three were the generative seeds cellini leaves no record of ever having had a daughter fiametta is my own creation
