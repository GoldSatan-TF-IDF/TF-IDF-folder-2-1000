chapter one bus to las vegas the first time i saw terry lennox he was sitting in a rollsroyce in front of a fancy restaurant and he was very drunk he had a young mans face but his hair was white as snow you could see he was drunk by looking at his eyes otherwise he looked like any young man who had been spending too much money in a place that was there to take your money there was a woman beside him her hair was a pretty dark red and she had a distant smile on her lips i have a wonderful idea darling the woman said trying to be nice why dont we take a taxi to your place and get your little car out its a wonderful night for a ride up the coast the man said awfully sorry but i dont have it any more had to sell it he spoke clearly sold it darling what do you mean she slid away from him but her voice slid even further i had to had to eat oh i see a piece of ice wouldnt have melted on her now right then the car door seemed to open itself and the young man fell off the seat and landed sitting on the ground so i went over and stuck my nose in their business although its always a mistake to interfere with people who are drunk i picked him up and put him on his feet thank you so much he said politely i thought i heard an accent he is so english when hes drunk she said in a hard voice thanks for catching him ill get him in the back of the car i said sorry mister but im late for an appointment she started to drive off hes just a lost dog she added perhaps you can find a good home for him and then she was gone and the guy was asleep in my arms i carried him to my car he was heavy as i put him in the front seat he woke up and thanked me again and went back to sleep he was the politest drunk id ever met while i drove i looked at him once in a while the right side of his face was one big scar that the doctors had worked on they hadnt failed but they hadnt succeeded either i was living that year in a house on yucca avenue in the laurel canyon area the rent was low partly because the owner didnt want a written agreement and partly because of the steps she was getting old and they were too steep for her i got him up them somehow inside i put him on the sofa and let him go back to sleep he slept for an hour when he woke up he looked around and at me and wanted to know where he was i told him he said his name was terry lennox and that he lived in westwood alone his voice was steady he said he could handle a cup of coffee when i brought it he asked me why he was here i told him he had passed out outside a restaurant and his girl had driven off and left him he said he couldnt blame her you english i asked i lived there once i wasnt born there he finished the coffee and i drove him home he didnt say much on the way except that he was sorry he had probably said it so often that it was automatic his apartment was small and empty there was a little furniture but no personal items at all it didnt look like a place where anybody lived he offered me a drink i said no when i left he thanked me again but not as if i had climbed a mountain for him and not as if it was nothing at all he was shy but very polite whatever he didnt have he had manners driving home i thought about him im supposed to be tough but this one bothered me i didnt know why unless it was the white hair and the scar and the clear voice there was no reason i should see him again though he was just a lost dog like the woman said it was a month later when i did see him again about three blocks from my office there was a police car stopped in the middle of the street and the men inside were staring at something on the kerb that something was terry lennox or what was left of him his shirt was dirty and open at the neck he hadnt shaved for four or five days his skin was so pale that the scar hardly showed it was obvious why the policemen were looking at him so i went over there fast and took hold of his arm stand up and walk i said can you do it he looked at me and nodded slowly i wasnt even sure he recognized me im just a little empty he said he made the effort and let me walk him to the street there was a taxi there i opened the back door and got him inside the police car pulled up a cop with grey hair asked me what have we got here hes not drunk i said hes a friend thats nice the cop said sarcastically he was still looking at terry whats your friends name pal philip marlowe terry said slowly he lives on yucca avenue in laurel canyon the cop stared at us both he was making a decision it took him a little while ok get him off the street at least the police car drove away we went to a place where you could get hamburgers that you could actually eat i fed lennox a couple and a bottle of beer and took him to my place an hour later he was shaved and clean and he looked human again i made two very mild drinks and we talked as we drank lucky you remembered my name i said not only that he said i looked up your phone number too so why didnt you call i live here all the time why should i bother you looks like you ought to have bothered someone asking for help isnt easy he said especially when its all your own fault he looked up with a tired smile maybe i can stop drinking one of these days they all say that dont they it takes about three years three years he looked shocked he turned and looked at the clock and changed the subject i have a suitcase worth two hundred dollars down at the hollywood bus station i could get money for it maybe not two hundred dollars but enough for a bus ticket to las vegas and i could get a job there i didnt say anything a man i knew well in the army runs a big club there his names randy starr something must have shown on my face yes he continued hes part gangster but they all are and the other part of him isnt bad i can give you the bus fare and some extra i said he shook his head i want you out of my hair i explained ive got a feeling about you you have he looked down into his glass weve only met twice what sort of feeling a feeling that next time we meet ill find you in worse trouble than i can get you out of i dont know why i have this feeling but i do he touched his scar gently maybe its this makes me look like trouble i suppose but i got it honestly its not that i said its this im a private detective and youre a problem that i dont have to solve but the problems there maybe that girl didnt drive away that time just because you were drunk maybe she had a feeling too he smiled faintly i was married to her once her name is still lennox i married her for her money when he saw my face his smile disappeared youre wondering why i didnt ask her for help did you ever hear of pride youre killing me lennox my pride is different its the pride of a man who has nothing else sorry if it bothers you it bothered me and he bothered me too although i couldnt understand exactly why any more than i knew why a man would starve and walk the streets before hed sell a suitcase whatever his rules were though he played by them i went down to the bus station and got his suitcase for him when i came back he said he had called his pal in las vegas he was sore at me because i hadnt called him before it takes a stranger to help you i said and put a hundred dollars in front of him and take the suitcase with you you might need to sell it later i dont want it he said if you like you can keep it for me he changed his clothes and we went out for dinner no drinks afterwards he caught the bus and i drove home thinking about this and that at ninethirty the telephone rang and the voice that spoke was one i had heard once before is this mr philip marlowe it is this is sylvia lennox mr marlowe we met for a moment one night last month i heard afterwards that you had been kind enough to take terry home i did that ive been a little worried about him nobody seems to know where he is i noticed how worried you were the other night i said hes on a bus to las vegas las vegas this news seemed to cheer her up how sweet of him thats where we were married i guess he forgot that i said or he would have gone somewhere else instead of hanging up she laughed it was a pretty laugh are you always as rude as this to ladies i dont know that you are a lady the man was living in the streets he had no money none at all you could have found him if youd really wanted to he didnt want anything from you then and he probably doesnt want anything from you now that she said coolly is something you know nothing about mr marlowe goodnight she was completely right of course and i was all wrong but i didnt feel wrong then i just felt angry chapter two an englishmans drink three days before christmas i got a cheque on a las vegas bank for one hundred dollars a note came with it he thanked me wished me a merry christmas and said he hoped to see me soon the surprise came at the end sylvia and i were married again she says not to be angry with her for wanting to try again i read the rest of the story on the society page of the newspaper all are happy with the news that sylvia and terry lennox have remarried at las vegas the darlings sylvia is of course the youngest daughter of millionaire harlan potter and what does daddy think of the marriage one can only guess potter is one person who never ever gives interviews well i thought if he wants her money let him take it i just didnt want to see him again but i knew i would if only because of the suitcase it was five oclock on a wet march evening when he walked into my little office he looked changed older more serious but calmer too like a man who had learned a hard lesson lets go to some quiet bar he said as if he had seen me ten minutes before we didnt shake hands we almost never did englishmen dont shake hands all the time like americans do and although he wasnt english he had their manners we went to victors on the way i said something stupid about his new life and he said that if he wasnt happy at least he was rich and he said that he wasnt having any trouble at all handling his drinking these days perhaps you were never really drunk i said at the bar we drank gin and lime an englishmans drink lennox said they didnt know the right way to make them here i wasnt interested in talking about drinks so i asked him about his pal in las vegas down my street i said starr was known as a tough customer randy in las vegas hes a straight businessman you should drop in and see him next time youre there hell be your pal not too likely i dont like gangsters thats just a word marlowe we have that kind of world the wars gave it to us and were going to keep it randy and i and another guy were all in a little danger once together its different for the three of us so why didnt you ask him for help when you needed it he finished his drink and signalled for another because he couldnt refuse i didnt want to beg from him you begged from a stranger he looked me straight in the eye strangers can keep going and pretend not to hear when he finished the second drink he drove me back to the office from then on it became his habit to drop in around five oclock we usually went to victors i didnt understand why he enjoyed being with me instead of being in his big expensive house i asked him about that once nothing for me at the house he said drinking his usual gin and lime am i supposed to understand that a big film with no story as they say in the film business sylvia is happy enough but not with me in our circle thats not too important you see the rich dont really have a good time they never want anything very much except maybe someone elses wife and thats a pale desire compared with the way a butchers wife wants new curtains for the living room mostly i just kill time a little tennis a little swimming i told him it didnt have to be the way it was he said i should wonder why she wanted him not why he wanted to be there you like having servants and bells to ring i said he just smiled could be i grew up as an orphan with no money i began thinking i liked him better drunk hungry and beaten and proud that night he would have told me the story of his life if id asked him if i had asked and if he had told me it might have saved a couple of lives it might have the last time we had drinks together was in may it was earlier than usual and the bar was nearly empty i like bars at this hour he said i like to watch the man fix the first one of the evening i like to taste it slowly alcohol is like love the first kiss is magic then he started talking about her i feel sorry for sylvia shes so terrible but i think i like her one day shell need someone and no one else will be there and ill probably make a mess of it whats this about i asked shes scared i dont know of what maybe her father hes a cold man he doesnt even like her if she annoys him too much something might happen to her youre her husband i pointed out officially nothing more i couldnt listen to this i stood up and dropped some money on the table you talk too much and its always about you see you later i walked out ten minutes later i was sorry but ten minutes later i was somewhere else i didnt see him again for a month when i did it was early in the morning the doorbell woke me up he was standing there looking like hell and he had a gun in his hand the gun wasnt pointed at me he was just holding it youre driving me to tijuana to get a plane at tenfifteen i have a passport but i dont have transportation ill pay you five hundred dollars for the ride i stood in the door and didnt move to let him in how about five hundred dollars plus the gun i asked he looked at it and then dropped it in his pocket come on in i said and he came in and fell into a chair im in trouble he said its going to be a beautiful day cool too yeah i guessed you were in trouble lets talk about it after coffee i always need my morning coffee he followed me into the kitchen i poured him a big drink from a bottle off the shelf he had to use two hands to get it to his mouth didnt sleep at all last night he said weakly i poured him another drink and he drank this one with one hand when he finished it the coffee was ready i sat down across from him without warning his head came down on the table and he was crying he didnt seem to notice when i took the gun from his pocket i smelled it it hadnt been fired he lifted his head and said i didnt shoot anybody i held up my hand wait a minute its like this be very careful what you tell me if you want me to help you i cant be told about a crime youve committed or a crime you know has been committed not if you want me to drive you to tijuana he looked straight at me for the first time since he had come in i said i was in trouble i heard you i dont want to know what kind of trouble its a matter of law i cant know i could make you drive me with the gun he said i grinned and pushed the gun across the table he didnt touch it im a man who sometimes has business with guns id look stupid trying to tell the police i was so scared i had to do what you told me to listen he said they wont even look in the bedroom until midday she wont be there the bed will be too neat so theyll look in the guest house servants always know what goes on and when they see her i said theyll think shes drunk right and thats the end of the story thats all i want to hear youre sick of it all youve been thinking of leaving for some time i called her father last night lennox said remembering i told him i was leaving what did he say he was sorry he wished me luck oh yes he also asked me if i needed money thats all he ever thinks about did you ever see her with a man in the guest house i asked suddenly he looked surprised i never even tried ok so this is how it is you came to me this morning and wanted a ride to tijuana you couldnt bear life with her anymore where you went was none of my business we are friends and i did what you asked me how does it sound he looked at me hopefully depends on whos listening im sorry he said your types always sorry and always too late ive still got that suitcase of yours you need luggage itll look better i got it from where id kept it and put some things in it nothing used nothing marked then i got the car out locked up and we left we didnt have much to say to each other on the way down the border people had nothing to say to us either when we reached the airport the plane was there but no one was hurrying terry went to get his ticket and came back there were only a few people waiting with us ok im ready he said this is where i say goodbye we shook hands he looked tired very tired i owe you he said but you dont owe me we had a few drinks together and i talked too much about me i left a fivehundreddollar bill in your coffee jar i wish you hadnt ill never spend half of what i have good luck terry go get on the plane i know you didnt kill her he stared at me he turned away then looked back im sorry he said quietly youre wrong about that im going to walk slowly to the plane you have plenty of time to stop me he walked i watched him he went through a door he was outside now he stopped there and looked towards me he didnt wave neither did i then he went up the steps into the aircraft the engines started and that big silver bird began to roll away the dust rose in clouds behind it i watched it lift slowly into the air and disappear into the blue sky going south then i left chapter three simple justice it was two in the afternoon when i got home and they were waiting for me you marlowe we want to talk to you this one was greyblond and looked hard his partner was tall handsome and just looked nasty they both had watchingandwaiting eyes they showed me their badges sergeant green central homicide this is detective dayton i went on up and unlocked the door you dont shake hands with the police they sat in the living room and green did the talking man named terry lennox you know him right we have a drink together once in a while he lives in encino married money ive never been there i filled my pipe this is where i ask you what its all about and you tell me that you ask the questions right thats right so you just answer them i dont know i guess i was tired maybe i felt a little guilty i dont have to say anything dayton spoke up answer the questions marlowe just cooperate its healthier right away i didnt like him his voice was a hard dont foolwithme voice i went to the book shelf and took down the big state law book i held it out to him find me the part that says i have to answer your questions theres no such law sit down green said impatiently lennoxs wife has been murdered ugly job murderer used something blunt must have hit her more than a dozen times husband is missing we find your telephone number in his desk marked with todays date shed been seeing other men we found that out too terry lennox wouldnt do anything like that hes known about the other men for a long time hes not going to tell us anything sergeant dayton said hes read that law book he thinks the law lives in the book dont you marlowe i said nothing i wasnt going to help him stand up he said i started to get up i was half way up when he hit me i sat back down and shook my head dayton was smiling green was looking away lets try again dayton suggested i didnt move or speak if i stood up hed hit me again but if he hit me again id hurt him he couldnt hit me hard enough to stop me from hurting him next time that was stupid green said to dayton thats just what he wanted a good reason for not talking i nodded terry lennox is my friend maybe you have enough evidence in court ill answer questions but not here not now youre not a bad guy green your partner has psychological problems thats all and if he hits me again hell have medical problems too they had no choice they put the bracelets on me and took me in at the station i still didnt feel like talking but now the person i wasnt talking to was a captain thinks hes tough the captain said we could change that he didnt sound as if he really cared guess wed better you can talk now i didnt say anything he reached for the coffee cup on his desk i was in a chair facing him the bracelets were on tight thats the way he wanted them but when he threw the coffee at me i was faster than he was most of it missed doesnt like coffee look pal youve got some information that i want saying nothing at all is no good if i tell you what you want i asked will you take the bracelets off maybe maybe not tell me first if i say i havent seen lennox today would that satisfy you it might but he was losing patience if i believed you id like to talk to a lawyer how about that the captain laughed it was a short ugly laugh he leaned across the desk and hit me with a hand of stone there was thunder inside my head when he spoke to me again the words seemed to come from far away i used to be tough but im getting old you take a good blow marlowe and thats all youll get from me we have younger stronger guys for this work ok you wont talk to me but youll talk to them i promise you that the telephone rang green handed it to the captain yes sir the captain said hes here really is that an order his face was red and getting redder fine sir he put the telephone down with a bang he was shaking with anger when he turned to speak to me the da wants you for himself youre his headache now he told green to get me out of there before we reached the door however one of those stone hands and we stopped youve got something to say right your type always does say it yes sir i answered him politely you probably didnt intend to but youve done me a favour youve solved a problem for me no man likes to betray a friend but i wouldnt even betray an enemy to you i might have told you something before you hit me now i wouldnt tell you what day of the week it is green marched me out i spent the next three days in jail it wasnt so bad it was quiet and it was clean no one bothered me on the third day a guard unlocked my door in the middle of the morning your lawyer is here and dont throw that cigarette on the floor he took me to the conference room a tall man with dark hair was standing there looking out of the window he turned and waited for the door to close he took out a fancy cigarette case and looked me over sit down marlowe cigarette my name is endicott sewell endicott ive been told to help you it wont cost you anything i guess youd like to get out of here i sat down and took one of his cigarettes he lit it for me i asked him who had sent him he wouldnt tell me i guess that means they caught him he shook his head if you mean lennox and of course you do no they havent caught him if they havent got terry why are they holding me he frowned i think i can help you get out of here so lets work on your problems and not terrys dont you want my help no i told him i didnt when a clever lawyer gets you out of jail before the police are ready to let you go people talk they say unkind things listen i said im not in here for lennox im in here for me im in a business where people come to me with troubles troubles they dont want to share with the police thats why im not talking you can tell terry that i see your point endicott said but i have to tell you im not in contact with lennox if i knew where he was id have to tell the police im a lawyer and thats the law you believe in the law the question annoyed him the law he said is not justice its just a halfbroken machine if you push the right buttons and youre lucky at the same time you might get some justice now do you want my help or not i still didnt ill wait a few more days if they catch terry they wont care how he got away and if they dont get him theyll want to forget it all fast by the way why havent any reporters been in to see me i thought the old man harlan potter owned nine or ten newspapers with all that money and power he should be able to make this into a real party endicott looked at me coldly youre strange marlowe you know so little all that money and power can also buy a lot of silence he opened the door and went out the guard took me back and locked me in again i had said i would wait a few days but it turned out i didnt have to a few hours later another guard came and took me to see someone in the das office we went through the door without knocking a fat man with a square chin and stupid eyes was pushing something into the drawer of his desk the guard left and i pulled a chair over and sat down i didnt say you could sit down the man said sharply i took out a cigarette and i didnt say you could smoke he shouted at me i lit my cigarette take another drink from that bottle in the desk i said itll make you feel better he waited a minute then he said a tough guy huh some hard guys come in here but thats not the way they leave they leave here small i want a full statement from you i get so tired of it i said looking into those stupid eyes tired of what hard little men in hard little offices talking hard little words that dont mean a thing you think a few days in here is going to make me cry on your shoulder forget it and forget the threats if youre big enough you dont need them and if you need them youre not big enough to scare me the fat man played with some papers on his desk then he looked up smiling it doesnt really matter if you dont talk weve found your friend i didnt believe him and i let him know it believe me believe me too that we have people that saw you with him at tijuana airport you want the whole story lennox got off the plane in mazatlan he disappeared for about an hour then a tall man with black hair and dark skin and a scar maybe a knife scar booked to torreon under the name of silvano rodriguez he was too tall to be so dark the pilot turned in a report on him the police were too slow in torreon but they followed him to a little mountain town called otatoclan he rented a hotel room there he was wearing a gun too but thats not unusual in mexico but the police were right behind him see they found him in the hotel i laughed thats a terrible story lennox is too smart to try to be a mexican in mexico you dont know where he is thats why you want my statement he took the bottle out then and had a drink then he picked up one of the papers from his desk grabbed a pen and signed it ive just set you free want to know why i stood up if you want to tell me the investigations finished lennox finished it he wrote a full confession this afternoon in his hotel room in otatoclan then he shot himself i stood there looking at nothing the fat man watched me nervously i think he thought i might hit him i didnt i just walked out and closed the door i closed it quietly as if on a room where someone had just died i met a friend downstairs on my way out he wanted to know why i was there so i told him morgan is a reporter and he gave me a ride home because he is my friend and because he is a reporter very neat dont you think he asked after he had listened to my story you think this isnt straight two things harlan potter is a very rich man who hates having his name in any newspaper even his own newspapers so the trial would have annoyed him now lennox is dead and theres not going to be a trial convenient for potter he continued after a minute then theres a chance that the poor fool had a little help shooting himself i didnt think he had needed help he hadnt thought much of himself lately but maybe morgan wasnt all wrong before he dropped me off he had one more thing to suggest if i were a clever reporter instead of a stupid one id think maybe he didnt kill her at all it was something to think about but i was too tired to think i went in and made some coffee drank it and took terrys fivehundreddollar bill out of the coffee jar i brought in the newspapers that were on the front steps and read about lennox there was even a short story about me one thing bothered me though the way shed been killed i was still sure terry couldnt have done that but no one was going to explain it to me because no explanation was necessary now the murderer had confessed and he was dead it was good work either way if he had killed her it was simple justice if he hadnt that was fine too he couldnt deny it now chapter four letter from a dead man the next morning i was back at the office business as usual when i thought about terry i tried not to let it hurt but i still felt i owned a little piece of him so it did the bell and the telephone rang at the same time i answered the telephone first mr marlowe this is sewell endicott good morning mr endicott glad to hear youre free i guess its over but if they bother you again about this call me the mans dead i said they wont bother me again they have their confession yes i know he said im flying to mexico today to look at the body for them but let me give you some advice before i go dont be too certain they wont make trouble for you private detectives arent their favourite people and stubborn private detectives well he hung up without finishing the sentence i opened my office door the man had let himself into the waiting room he was sitting by the window reading a magazine he looked quite comfortable he had thick dark hair and was very brown from the sun his clothes probably cost more than i earned in a couple of months he threw the magazine onto the low table the stuff they write these days what can i do for you he looked at me for a moment and then laughed a hero on a bicycle what you marlowe a hero on a bicycle did they hurt you much why do you care he didnt answer instead he stood up and walked into my office i followed him youre a little man look at this place you dont make much money do you a cheap little man i let him talk and sat down behind my desk thats it youre a cheap guy cheap feelings have a few drinks with somebody and suddenly youre his pal you have nothing a hero on a bicycle he leaned over the desk and slapped me it didnt hurt and i didnt move you know who i am cheapie your name is menendez they call you mendy yeah thats right he took a gold cigarette case out of his pocket and lit a brown cigarette with a gold lighter im a big bad man marlowe i make a lot of money i have to make a lot of money so i can pay the men i have to pay so i can make a lot of money i have a house in bel air that cost ninety thousand and that was before i fixed it up ive got a beautiful wife and my children go to private schools my wife likes diamonds ive got six servants five cars what do you have marlowe why dont you tell me what you want he put out his cigarette and lit another let me tell you a story in the war there were three guys in a hole it was cold very cold it was snowing randy starr terry lennox and me something lands right in the hole but it doesnt explode the germans had a lot of tricks sometimes you think it wont explode and then three seconds later youre wrong anyway terry grabbed this one and jumped out of the hole he was quick very quick he threw it and it exploded in the air a piece got him on the side of the face right then the germans attacked and we had to run we left him we thought he was dead the germans found him and had him for a year and a half they did a good job on his face but they hurt him too much thats why his hair was white randy and i spent money to find him hed saved our lives all he got from his share was half of a new face and then when hes really in trouble he doesnt come to us he comes to you cheapie that makes us mad see i couldve helped him instead hes dead and you think youre a hero i shook my head no i dont of course you do the story is over marlowe even if he stopped in the middle of the sentence even if terry didnt kill her i said if thats the way terry wanted it then thats how it stays see you around cheapie i felt old and tired i got up slowly and picked up his cigarette case from my desk you forgot this i said going towards him so what ive got a dozen he said he didnt even reach for it how about a dozen of these i asked moving in fast and close and hitting him as hard as i could in the stomach he fell back against the wall making the sounds a cat makes when its sick then very slowly he straightened up i patted his cheek gently he didnt push my hand away i didnt think you had the courage he said weakly next time bring a gun i got a guy to carry the gun he said maybe youll meet him one of these days he walked out slowly after that nothing happened for three days sylvia lennox was buried the press was not invited to the funeral and her father as usual gave no public statement in the afternoon of the third day the telephone rang and i found myself talking to a man named howard spencer a new york publisher who said he had a california problem we agreed to meet in the bar of his hotel the next morning i needed the job because i needed the money or thought i did until i got home and found a letter the envelope was covered with mexican stamps i recognized the handwriting in the address i was holding a letter from a dead man i opened it and read it didnt start with my name it just started im sitting in a hotel room in a town called otatoclan theres a mailbox just below the window and when the boy comes with the coffee i ordered he is going to mail this letter for me im going to watch him put it in the box and then ill pay him i cant mail it myself because i cant leave my room theyre outside waiting for me i want you to have this money because i dont need it and the police would steal it if i kept it maybe you think i didnt kill her it doesnt matter though her father and her sister were always good to me a trial would hurt them i dont want that i dont care what happens to me im disgusted with my life ive written a confession you read about this in books but you dont read the truth the truth is i feel sick and very scared but im going to do it anyway so forget it and me but first drink a gin and lime for me at victors after that forget the whole thing goodbye that was all that and a fivethousanddollar bill i looked at it carefully i had never seen one before lots of people who work in banks havent either menendez probably had a dozen i met mr howard spencer at eleven the next morning i was early and he was late while i was waiting i looked at the people who come to a hotel bar at eleven in the morning there were two young men with a telephone at their table they took turns making calls and shouting at each other and at the people they called there was a man sitting at the bar who was telling the story of his life to no one in particular a long sad story i had almost become tired of waiting when a dream in a white skirt walked in there are blondes and blondes different kinds i know ive studied the subject there are blondes who read big long books and write poetry there are blondes who like parties and laugh loudly at all the jokes even the old ones there are blondes too who marry millionaires and live on the south coast of france and kiss their husbands goodnight downstairs but this one was not any of these kinds she was unique she was quite tall and had eyes like a summer sky she smiled gently at the old waiter who pulled out a chair for her i just held my breath and watched i was still watching when a mans voice said close to my shoulder i must apologize for being so late mr marlowe im howard spencer i had trouble tearing my eyes away from the dream to look at him he was about fortyfive years old wearing a suit that was fine for boston but all wrong for california he was carrying an old leather case two new books in here he said patting the leather im sure they are awful but i dont suppose you care about publishers problems i could i said if it has anything to do with the job i admired the way spencer was looking right at me not giving any attention to the blonde he ordered drinks and explained the job one of his authors lived out here a man named roger wade i knew the name but hadnt read the books apparently everyone else did though because wade was one of spencers biggest writers except that wade had been having a bad period lately he drank too much spencer said and went a little crazy sometimes he had hurt his wife more important to spencer however he had also stopped writing all that spencer wanted was for me to save the wife from the writer the writer from himself and a halffinished book from the bottle in wades desk thats all it was interesting it was also impossible i told him that what he needed was a male nurse not a detective i couldnt stop a man from drinking and if the wife was living with him i couldnt protect her either not day and night your answer is no then im sorry mr spencer i dont think id be able to help suddenly a voice that was not spencers said youre wrong mr marlowe im sure you could help it was a voice like honey i looked up into a pair of violet eyes he doesnt want to help eileen spencer said she smiled i disagree i stopped staring long enough to answer i didnt say i wasnt interested mrs wade i just dont think it would work im sorry i thought she would argue but she didnt she gave me her card in case i changed my mind thanked me and left just like that i sat down grabbed my whisky and watched her walk out of the hotel what a walk when she had gone spencer turned to me something new in his eyes nice i said but you shouldve looked at her once or twice while we talked shes much too pretty to ignore spencer went red in the face shes married mr marlowe i smiled that doesnt make her ugly mr spencer we did not shake hands when he left that night i received a telephone call from green thought you might want to know they buried lennox down in mexico today some lawyer took care of it endicott i thought thanks for telling me sergeant anything else just this lennox is buried and so is the rest of it leave it alone sweet dreams to you too i thought chapter five dr verringers farm next morning the bell rang just as i finished shaving i opened the door and looked into a pair of violet eyes again she was wearing a brown suit this time come in mrs wade like a cup of coffee she came into the living room and sat down thank you black coffee please i brought the coffee in my good cups they were the only two in the kitchen that matched the last time i had coffee with someone was just before i went to jail i said i guess you knew id been to jail mrs wade she nodded they thought you helped him escape didnt they he must have been insane i filled a pipe and lit it yes he must have been he was badly hurt in the war but i dont think you came here to talk about that it took a little more conversation and another cup of coffee to find out what the problem was roger wade was missing spencer hadnt told me because spencer didnt know this was mrs wades little secret apparently wade did this often but this time his wife was worried something was wrong she said mr spencer said the same thing mrs wade he thought it might be some hidden guilt that makes your husband drink so much what do you think she said she didnt know she added that if wade had a secret even a bad secret something criminal for instance she wouldnt care she just wanted him back lets say i say yes this time i asked her where would i start do you have any idea where he is yes and no she replied after thinking hes at some doctors place im sure he goes to them when hes been drinking heavily and they help him stop for a few days at least but i dont know these doctors she did however have a note she found in her husbands desk he had written i do not like you doctor v but right now youre the man for me we had finished all the coffee please she begged find roger and bring him home how could i refuse a lady like that twice i couldnt i said i would try and she thanked me and left no matter how clever you think you are you have to have a place to start from a name an address something all i had was the letter v so i did what i do when i need help i called a friend and asked george peters worked for a big detective agency but he hadnt forgotten the old hard times sure he said he could give me ten minutes if i came to his office he hadnt changed much with the years he was still thin he was still all smiles and he was still a busy man what can i do for you he asked from behind a desk like a football field id like to see your file on the doctors in the hotel business you know the ones where you go when no one knows where you are ive got a missing man whos probably trying to stop drinking hes rich and his wife is worried peters found the file and we looked at it together there were three names and addresses under the letter v i copied them down thanks pal ill do the same for you one day forget it peters said by the way i heard something about your friend lennox that might interest you one of our men knew a guy in new york five or six years ago hes certain it was lennox except his name wasnt lennox then it was marston of course he could be wrong i said i doubted it was the same man our man thinks it was hes in seattle now but i can have him call you when he returns if you want sure why not and i left to check on the doctors if you are an honest doctor in california you might get rich or you might get poor if you are a dishonest doctor you are going to make money i had three names varley a bone doctor vukanich ear nose and throat and verringer who called himself doctor but didnt say of what i started with vukanich an unpleasant character who pretended not to understand that i wanted more than an examination he did not seem to be my man anyway he had nothing more than a small office not fancy enough varley was in another class he ran a private hospital and was very friendly he smiled when he said he couldnt help me and he smiled as he asked me why i was looking for wade here i explained that the hospital was on a list of places where certain things had happened in the past things involving the police dr varley became suddenly less friendly we ended our conversation there but i had already seen enough of varleys hospital he took care of the old and the weak he wasnt tough enough to handle real trouble i crossed him off too and went to find dr verringer his place was out in the hills i liked that and not just because the air was cleaner there i liked a place where people wouldnt bother to look for a man i got there just as it was getting dark verringer had a farm with a circle of small buildings surrounding the main house this time i decided not to be polite i drove past the front gate parked off the road and came back on foot i climbed the fence behind the farm and went slowly towards the lights of the buildings it was dark and i had a pocket torch but i didnt want to use it i was carrying a gun too and i didnt want to have to use that either i stopped at the edge of an empty swimmingpool i heard a door open so i hid a light went on outside the main house a single bright light that made a circle in the dirt between the buildings into this circle stepped a cowboy dressed like a movie cowboy with an enormous hat a pair of silver guns at his side and a rope that he swung over his head he played with the rope for a few minutes and then practised taking his guns out of his gunbelt as quickly as he could he was fast he was also obviously a little crazy when hed finished his game whatever it was he went back into the house the light went out as he went in there was another smaller light on in one of the buildings far from the big house i walked over moving as quietly as possible i didnt want to be in the cowboys movie tonight because his guns just might have been loaded i reached a window of the hut it was now dark enough to look in without being seen there was one man on a bed and another on a chair they were talking the man on the bed was angry but he was so weak that his shout was no louder than a whisper the other man was speaking calmly and patiently the man on the bed said i already paid you and i paid you well you got six hundred dollars and that was too much the man in the chair didnt disagree he only said you called me remember i came to you in your hour of need i told you it would be expensive you insisted i want another five thousand dollars wade i was drunk wade said i wouldve promised you anything youll write me a cheque my friend now at once then youll get dressed and earl will take you home wade laughed a cheque sure ill give you a cheque the doctor smiled you think you can call the bank later and tell them not to accept it but you wont earl will drive you home no thanks that boys insane crazier every time i see him verringer shook his head earl isnt normal i know but i have ways of handling him thats what you think a new voice said and earl came through the door in his pretty cowboy suit keep that monkey away from me wade shouted and this time it was not a whisper earl didnt like the description he started for wade verringer jumped between them and was pushed roughly aside by the cowboy i ran for the door and came into the room with my gun out earl spun around forgetting wade the doctor was picking himself up off the floor the cowboy came right at me he didnt touch his guns and he didnt seem to see mine i fired through the open window over the bed earl stopped looked at the hole in the window screen and looked back at me smiling thats a real gun isnt it oh boy take the gunbelt off slowly earl kept his smile ok only these arent real guns you know he took the belt off and put it down wade grabbed a gun hes right theyre toys earl gave wade a dirty look but then he noticed the doctor who was leaning against the wall rubbing his head sorry earl said in a small voice the doctor patted earl gently on the shoulder and smiled i pulled wade out of there while i had the chance verringer watched us leave and said nothing until we were almost too far to hear him and then he called out you promised me wade five thousand i put wade in my car and we started for home his home first he wanted to talk i couldnt stop him you were great back there who are you i told him i explained that his wife had hired me whatever shes paying you it isnt enough she isnt paying me mr wade i told him you are id like the money from you seems better that way wade agreed then his thoughts turned to the doctor you think i should pay him the five thousand he took good care of me hes not a bad guy tries to keep earl from killing himself from killing everybody else dont know why he bothers he let his business go to hell because of that crazy boy i dont understand that and im the big writer supposed to understand people should i give him the money i told him i didnt have an opinion either way you dont like me do you marlowe wait a minute marlowe i know you you were mixed up with lennox werent you i said i had been wade nodded he knew them he said terry and sylvia he knew her better than he knew him he said he asked me questions i didnt want to answer he was just a job and thats what i told him when we reached his house he went straight in i was going to drive off but she came out to thank me you found him i knew you would come in and have a drink she offered some other time i lit a cigarette and she smoked a little of it you knew sylvia lennox i said why didnt you tell me she looked surprised the woman that was murdered i didnt know her personally i knew the name thats all i should go in mr marlowe and see if my husband needs anything i need something too i said and i pulled her to me and kissed her she didnt help me and she didnt fight me she just let me do the whole job myself you shouldnt have she said when i released her but still thanks for the other work youve done and she walked away and went into her nice house without stopping at the door to wave i waved though i waved at the closed door and then i went home too chapter six empty like a glass the next day was just another day at the office a giant came in and told me someone was trying to poison his dog he suspected the lady next door he wasnt happy when i told him i couldnt help but at least he didnt hit me with my desk a woman with a face like a sad story came in because she thought the girl she lived with was robbing her she wanted me to come over and scare the girl she left as disappointed as the giant then a man came in with the oldest story in the book a young wife who had taken the money and run he didnt want the money he wanted his wife back i could help him and i did it was easy enough i didnt get rich on it but why should i care i was a man with a fivethousanddollar piece of government paper in my pocket three days later eileen wade called to invite me over for drinks the next evening foolish curiosity made me say yes foolish curiosity also made me reread terry lennoxs letter after i hung up it reminded me that i hadnt had the gin and lime at victors hed asked me to have the bar was almost empty when i got there terry would have been pleased i was surprised to hear the woman in front of me order the same drink she wasnt english either i might have found out more about her if i hadnt noticed i was being watched i approached the man straight on youre watching me if i sit here next to you it will make your job easier sure pal sit where you want you re one of mendys boys right a little guy with no name he didnt like the conversation i got a name and im not one of the boys im his number one more than you can say marlowe youre supposed to watch me ok watch me leave i paid for the drink and went out the door the boy came out right behind me there might have been trouble if this enormous man hadnt got out of an enormous car and picked the boy up with one huge hand i keep telling you cheap gangsters stay away from my favourite places you spoil my appetite the giant threw my watcher against the outer wall of the bar with the one arm that had been holding him and mendys number one boy hit it hard and stayed there until the giant disappeared into victors what was that i asked as the boy found his feet big willie magoon a policeman he thinks hes tough you mean he isnt sure i asked him politely the boy ignored me and limped away into the hollywood night when i reached the wade house the next afternoon the party had already begun i parked my old car between two new expensive ones and walked in a mexican in a white coat opened the door for me liked my name and let me in it was the same party everybody has people were talking too loud and not listening at all everyone had a glass in his hand and the glasses were all halfempty eileen wade came up and said she was very glad i could come her husband wanted to see me she added he hadnt joined the party because he hated parties he was in his study she said the mexican took me to see him he also warned me that senor wade was very busy wade was busy lying on a sofa there was a pile of llow paper next to the typewriter on his desk the mexican left and wade sat up good of you to come marlowe did you have a drink or two i said no and asked him how his work was going fine it just comes out thats how it is when its good if its hard work its bad writing he said this almost angrily so i was kind enough to disagree it was hard for flaubert and his stuffs good oh god an intellectual detective well i hate intellectuals im not drinking and i hate everyone i hate you too i understand i said you need somebody to insult go ahead when it begins to hurt ill let you know wade laughed i hate myself too and my terrible books that sell and sell so how can you help me maybe i dont want to help i said lets have a drink because i like you he was laughing again not in here pal not you and me alone i dont want to have to watch you take the first one you know marlowe i think you could help why dont you come and live here and keep me safe from harm and tell me all about flaubert i shook my head i couldnt stop you try it i could finish the miserable book i have to finish it if i cant finish things i start i might as well be dead i didnt want to listen to this kind of nonsense you did as much for lennox he said suddenly i walked right up to him and gave him a hard stare i got lennox killed thats what i did for terry wade said i was talking like a fool he cursed at me but without much feeling i couldnt really help anyway he said telling me what i already knew it was something personal he said about your wife i dont think so i think its about me forget it though lets go out and have that drink and see all those nice people who do want to watch me have that first one the party was louder than before wade said hello here and there and then headed for the bar as candy the mexican mixed our drinks i saw a face i knew it was the woman from victors the one who had ordered the gin and lime wade gave her a real smile hello linda this is philip marlowe marlowe this is linda loring you have something in common if she recognized me from the night before she didnt show it she extended her hand hello mr marlowe what roger wont say is that im sylvia lennoxs sister and i know who you are her hand was cool and she didnt let me keep it for long as she took it back a thin man with a neat beard and a very white face came up to us he ignored me and gave wade an ugly look linda loring said my husband mr marlowe he didnt even look at me he was giving all his poisonous attention to wade i have something to say to you wade stay away from my wife wade seemed amused youre my guest today dr loring so all ill say is that i think youve misunderstood something loring found a glove in one of his pockets and slapped wade across the face with it the writer didnt move a muscle very dramatic doctor next time why dont you do it when i have a chance to answer the challenge it would be more interesting right now i think youre looking for the door candy will show it to you wade turned back to the bar candy the doctor is leaving loring grabbed for his wifes hand but she was too quick im not leaving she said you are loring raised the glove again but wade stepped between the husband and wife we dont do that here doctor dont we loring asked sarcastically but he put the glove away and left candy shut the door behind him i picked up my drink and looked around for wade but he had disappeared no wonder he didnt like parties i took a walk out to the terrace and settled into a soft chair facing the lake a minute later eileen wade was sitting next to me she wanted to know if i had accepted rogers offer to stay with them i told her i hadnt i said that if she wanted to help her husband she should find him a good psychiatrist she looked surprised a psychiatrist why im not an expert but i think your husband does have a secret a secret he has buried so deep inside himself that he cant find it maybe something he did when he was drunk so he drinks to find it unless he just drinks because he cant write anymore she frowned its not that roger has a great amount of talent his best book is still inside him then maybe its something between the two of you she answered immediately no i love my husband not the way a young girl loves perhaps but i do love him a woman is only a young girl once the man i loved then is dead he died in the war his initials strangely enough were the same as yours they never even found his body sometimes i even think i see him at a party or in a restaurant its silly i know but we were very much in love that crazy love that doesnt happen twice she wasnt looking at me anymore she was staring at the lake i looked back at the house and wade was there in the doorway i joined him he had had more than that first drink hows my wife marlowe did you give her another kiss i said i was leaving go ahead but ill tell you what the doctor told me stay away from my wife marlowe because it isnt any good shes not there see empty like a glass did she tell you about her old love the one that died in norway but they never found be careful marlowe people do disappear i walked away from him as i passed the bar candy called to me senor one drink left you want it i told him to drink it but he said he was a beer man he said thats how the spanish were he said that he was very spanish and that he had the knife to prove it he didnt need me to help him take care of his boss youre doing such a good job candy who brought him home i speak enough spanish to know what he called me he didnt hold the door for me when i left chapter seven pretty necklace around a pretty neck for a week the wades left me alone i did what i do for a living then i got a call on a thursday night from wade his voice was bad he was breathing hard im in terrible shape marlowe im losing control can you come over quickly i said i would and then the telephone went dead i shouted into it but there was no reply i was in my car a minute later and drove like a bullet through the streets and up into the hills where they lived i imagined wade throwing his wife down the stairs i imagined him beating on her locked door i drove even faster when i got there eileen wade was standing in the open front door in a pretty dress nice and cool smoking a cigarette if there was any excitement around her id brought it with me where is he he had a fall she said calmly he cut his head on something there was only a little blood thats nice i said where is he now she looked at me quietly and then she pointed out at the darkness towards the lake out there somewhere you find him ive had enough and she went into the house he was right where she had pointed lying on his stomach the back of his head was sticky i talked to him but he didnt answer i tried to lift him dropped him tried again and got him across my back he was as heavy as stone i made it into the house and dropped him on the sofa my back screamed as i straightened up mrs wade came in and said shed called her doctor he hadnt wanted to come she said this confused me until she explained that loring was her doctor he showed up fifteen minutes later took a glance at wades cut and said there was no danger he put his hat back on and started to leave i cant get him upstairs alone doctor i said then leave him where he is loring said coldly you might wash his head too hes not my patient im not asking you to treat him doctor im asking for some help in getting him to his bedroom i said beginning to get angry and just who are you he asked sharply my names marlowe we were introduced last week all i want is he interrupted me im not interested in what you want he started for the door but i stepped in front of it just a minute youre a doctor and this man needs help i cant get him upstairs alone what do you say get out of my way he said through his teeth or i shall call the police im a professional man and as a professional this time i interrupted him as a professional man youre a sack of dirt i stepped out of his way he went out like a storm perhaps he hadnt brought his glove this time instead his eyes smacked me as he went through the door in the end candy came home and we carried wade up the stairs together the mexican wanted to know what i was doing there i didnt like his curiosity and told him so he showed me his knife candy didnt like me i couldnt understand why im very easy to like he asked me if i had hit wade i told him his boss had fallen and that he wasnt hurt badly the knife disappeared we undressed wade and put him to bed candy went to change i washed the cut and wade opened his eyes what happened id say the usual except you also fell and cut your head this time its not serious why dont you get some sleep sleep he said whats that maybe a pill would help got any he said there were some in the drawer they were mrs wades pills and they were strong lorings name was on the plastic bottle i gave wade one and he swallowed it dry he was quiet for a while and then he said slowly i remember something do something for me i wrote some crazy stuff i dont want eileen to see it its on the typewriter tear it up for me i said i would then i thought he had fallen asleep until he opened his eyes again and asked ever kill a man marlowe yes nasty feeling isnt it some people like it i said how could they he asked and then he was asleep for real i waited a minute and then i turned out the light and left him i went downstairs eileen wasnt there so she must have been up in her room i wondered about that didnt she want to know how her husband was or was she just too tired of the trouble he caused maybe she didnt love him as much as she said she did about that i didnt know no one can see into someone elses heart not even a good detective i went to his study and found the papers i began reading them he was right it was crazy stuff he wrote about the moon watching him and wanting to scream and verringer he wrote bad things about verringer but in a kind way then he said he was a rose and talked about a woman who was sleeping in complete silence and that was wrong he wrote because you always make one sound or another when you sleep then he said he had given candy too much money he ought to have killed him instead a good man died for me once why not that insect in his stupid white jacket then he began to come out of whatever bad dream he was having and he wrote that he had to call someone he was in a bad way and that was the end thats where he stopped writing i didnt tear the papers up i folded them and put them in my pocket i stood there looking out of the window at the calm dark lake then i heard a shot her room was empty so i kept running she was in his room and they were struggling before i could help her she had pulled the gun from his hands she fell against me as she pulled the gun free and i held her she was crying roger how could you i saw someone he had a knife i grabbed the gun from the drawer here he pointed to the little table where id found the pills and i shot but it must have been a dream because no one was there it was a miserable story from start to finish the gun hadnt been in the drawer i had seen the pills some papers a set of keys but no gun and she just wasnt strong enough to have taken the gun from him unless he wasnt really fighting it had all been a performance he wanted sympathy i guessed poor roger is trying to kill himself he wanted her to think go back to bed i told her he wont do it again i took the gun she gave me a hard look and then walked out you were just playing i told him when she had left you dont want to die i guess i dont he said what good man died for you i asked him at first he didnt understand and then he remembered i told you it was crazy stuff i was drunk and isnt candy taking your money because he knows something he shouldnt he closed his eyes and repeated it was just crazy stuff i closed the door and came back and sat on the bed and said you cant keep running candy does know something what is it a woman his eyes were still closed maybe you believe that fool doctor i took a wild guess no hes wrong it wasnt his wife it was her sister sylvia wade opened his eyes wide is that why youre here he whispered and i knew i had guessed right you leave me alone he said im not the first husband to do what i did i didnt ask him just what he had done its been hell he said thats obvious the interesting point is why i gave him another one of his wifes pills and watched him fall asleep again when he was finally in dreamland he looked halfdead he wasnt going to hurt anyone tonight maybe he had never hurt anyone at all i went down the hall but at the top of the stairs i stopped because eileen was standing in the doorway of her room hes gone back to sleep i said i knew you would return she said softly her voice was changed even after ten years i havent stopped waiting wonderful i thought now shes crazy too come in and shut the door she whispered and went into her room i followed her in because it seemed like a good idea she threw herself into my arms its always been you she said and i knew she wasnt talking to me i might have done the wrong thing but candy saved me i heard his footsteps stop at the door and i jumped and opened it and he ran down the stairs when i came back to the room all i saw was a crazy woman talking to herself i closed the door and went down to the study and found wades bottle and poured myself a big drink then i poured another i lay down on the sofa there and soon the bottle was empty and i fell asleep too i woke up with a head like a dead tree and the first thing i saw was candy he wasnt smiling he asked me if i wanted coffee sure thanks slept down here she threw you out whatever you say pal he laughed at me you dont look so tough this morning he brought me my coffee i drank it i had more smoked a cigarette and then i was ok i mean i was still alive when candy came to take the empty cup i asked him how much are you getting for your silence i bet less than two hundred he smiled a bad smile he still didnt like me maybe you give me two hundred so i dont say what i saw last night you didnt see anything there was nothing to see now get out of here candy because im waking up i went to the living room she was there and she was surprised to see me i didnt know you were here mr marlowe she was hard to believe i walked over closer to her she was wearing something strange on a chain around her neck it was some kind of army badge i asked her about it i had a peculiar dream last night she said someone i used to know came to see me thats why im wearing this she touched the badge gently he gave it to me i had a peculiar dream too i said looking right at her but now im awake and i dont dream when im awake what im saying is i dont think ill come here again theres something wrong here very wrong oh roger will be fine in a day or two youll see no he wont i said if you want to help him youll get him the right kind of doctor and quick but i added not caring that it was nasty i dont think you really want to help him i left her there in her living room her husband upstairs sleeping a drugged sleep her pretty necklace around her pretty neck and her pretty violet eyes full of anger at what i had said i drove home down a beautiful road and saw nothing beautiful chapter eight the smell of gunsmoke at home i had a long shower shaved changed into fresh clothes and began to feel clean again i read a story in a magazine that was good but not great at midday my telephone rang it was the doctors wife she said she had to see me i told her id meet her at my office i stopped for a sandwich on the way so she was already there when i came in i never remember to lock up you dont even have a secretary she said no i dont why are you looking for a job you couldnt pay me enough she said youre wrong ive got money ive got a fivethousanddollar bill i took it out of my safe and she looked at it carefully you got this from terry lennox he used to carry it around a good luck piece or something you drove him to tijuana you also dont think he killed my sister did he give you a list of her special friends is that it is that why youve been at the wades holding rogers hand because you think maybe roger killed sylvia when he was i dont know drunk and crazy i met the wades because a new york publisher wants a book finished mrs loring terry gave me no list no names and yes i was supposed to help wade but i cant that was all the explanation she deserved but there was a question i wanted answered too i saw you at victors the other night you were having a rather unusual drink i noticed could it be that you dont think terry killed your sister what i think doesnt matter she said she meant it too i didnt come here to talk about terry lennox in any case i came to invite you to my house why someone would like to talk with you i had a strong feeling who that someone would be the old man she frowned it was a pretty frown i dont call him that mr marlowe will you come i said yes even a cat can look at a king we went in her car the driver was a black man in his middle fifties who even opened our doors when we stopped in front of her house which was just about the ugliest piece of architecture i had ever seen it looked like a sandcastle that a little boy builds when hes mad at his parents mrs loring saw my expression and smiled horrible isnt it my father gave it to me as a wedding present my husband loves it we went in someone opened the door for us and then vanished from the hall we entered a room that was at least seventy feet long at the far end a man was sitting waiting he gave us both the same cold stare mrs loring made the introductions and apologized just in case we were late tell them to bring the tea he said sit down mr marlowe i sat down and we looked at each other without talking at all until the tea came two cups harlan potter commanded as his daughter poured you can have your tea in another room linda she smiled weakly and left i took out a cigarette dont smoke please it bothers my health i had to believe him although he certainly didnt look sick he was a long way over six feet and nearly as wide as he was tall his hair was not yet grey his voice seemed to come from the next room so this is what a hundred million dollars looks like i thought he didnt even touch his tea he just talked he said he knew who i was what i was and what i had done for terry he went on to say that my investigation was interfering in his private life i told him i wasnt investigating anything at the moment he disagreed perhaps you think roger wade is involved in my daughters death forget that idea forget you even know roger wade i dont read his books myself he said but i have been told that they are quite childish as childish as whatever strange ideas you may have i explained again how i had come to meet wade i told him about menendez too but he said the name meant nothing to him i asked him what i could do to make him happier all i want is peace and quiet mr marlowe i pay good money for it and i expect it we live in a dirty world where everyone wants to hear terrible stories about the rich and the powerful i repeat i pay money to keep my life private how much do you want marlowe nothing i dont want your money if i get rich i might become like you he laughed then he stood up and i saw just how much over six feet he was he was very big when he shook my hand my fingers cried just dont be a hero young man its not a very clever role for a clever man mrs lorings driver took me home but wouldnt accept the dollar i tried to give him so i tried to give him a book of poetry but he said he already had that book life left me alone again for another week and then i got two telephone calls in one morning and i was back into what harlan potter had clearly told me to stay away from the first caller was roger wade he wasnt crying for help this time he was inviting me to lunch i accepted the second call was from that friend of george peters he was back in town he said he didnt know if it would help now but he was sure he had seen terry lennox in new york a few years back and that his name then had been paul marston he added that marston had been wearing a british army badge with this new information i decided to talk to someone who was supposed to know what was going on i telephoned green at homicide he wasnt pleased to hear from me war record you dont listen do you marlowe the investigation is over but if you cant sleep nights worrying about it ill tell you lennox had no war record i told him mendys story mendy is a gangster he is also a liar and youre a fool to believe him he didnt give me a chance to tell him what i thought he was he just hung up i drove to wades house at noon it was too hot to be a nice day even the wind was hot the house was cool though wade took me into his study a pile of papers next to the typewriter impressed me the book i asked yes and its rotten im not a writer anymore im someone who used to write want a drink a soda please very clever i think ill have one too he rang a bell and candy came two sodas and well have lunch in an hour he told the mexican its thursday boss my day off remember then just make us some sandwiches im not the cook boss wade gave him a narrow look im having lunch with my friend the cook is off today you think hes your friend candy said glancing at me maybe you should ask your wife watch your mouth little man wade warned suddenly angry remember who pays you candy smiled ok boss ill get lunch he left for the kitchen but what are you paying him for i asked wade youre going to start that again and the good man that died for you let me tell you terry lennox candy knows you were seeing sylvia so you pay him wade asked me you think i killed her im not looking for her killer whats driving you insane is that you dont know you were drunk and you dont remember thats how it was he was going to say something but candy came in carrying the sandwiches and two bottles of beer wade looked at the beer and shook his head get me a real drink candy the mexican said there was only beer and that he was leaving now he reminded wade again that it was his day off so go ill get the stuff myself they left the room together and then wade returned a minute later with a bottle of whisky and a glass he filled it drank then filled it again wheres your wife i asked him as he put the bottle and the glass down on his desk why are you in love the whisky was already at work i ask because i dont want to leave you alone now that youre going to fall to pieces again i wouldnt want you to shoot the ceiling again he looked at me with deep worry in his eyes i really did that didnt i you know i cant remember thats your whole trouble i told him is the gun still in the desk i had put it there that night today i didnt want him in the same room with it i dont know where it is but its not in the desk he said look for yourself i did and it wasnt there eileen must have hidden it from him now that youve had your look around he said the whisky in charge once more why dont you leave me alone im tired of your face i took my sandwich to a table and some chairs outside it was a little hotter here but it was nicer than being with wade i watched a boat zip up and down the lake the people in the boat were laughing they were talking to each other but i couldnt hear anything except the loud roar of the boats engine after i finished my sandwich i went back and put my head in at the door of the study go away wade said and shook the halfempty whisky bottle at me i went back outside to wait for someone to come home and keep an eye on the fool the boat continued to roar along the shore of the lake i walked down to get a closer look the man behind the wheel waved at me maybe he didnt know he was wrecking a nice quiet afternoon and maybe he knew and didnt care i walked back to the house the boat moved down the lake and took its awful noise with it at the top of the garden steps i heard the doorbell ringing i went in and opened the door for eileen wade oh mr marlowe i thought it was candy or roger i forgot my key its candys day off there must have been something in my voice is anything wrong she asked well a little drinking is being done hes in his study probably asleep by now and i must get going oh dont go stay and have some tea i dont know why i said yes i didnt want any tea she took off her jacket ill just look in and see if roger is all right i watched her cross to the study door and open it she looked in for a moment and closed the door and came back yes hes asleep i have to go upstairs but ill be right back down she went up and i heard her door close i went to the study if he was sleeping he wouldnt need whatever was left in the bottle i opened the door there was perfect silence and a strong smell of gunsmoke in the room before i was halfway to where he lay on the sofa i knew he was dead chapter nine the kiss of death beside him on the sofa was the gun it was bloodstained the side of his head was more than bloodstained i touched his wrist it was warm but he was quite dead i looked around for a note but there wasnt one they dont always leave notes i wondered why i hadnt heard the shot and then i remembered the boat he must have waited until the boat was passing and then fired the bullet why would he wait for the boat i didnt like that but nobody cared what i liked i went out and closed the door she was in the kitchen making our tea i didnt say anything except that i didnt take sugar or milk she said shed learned to drink tea in london during the war when she met that man but she stopped the story there and changed the subject she started talking about her husband something would have to be done to help him i said it was too late she didnt understand that remark at first then she glanced towards the study is is there something wrong in there i nodded she ran out of the kitchen and by the time i reached her she was kneeling by the sofa i left her there with him and called the police a cop was at the house within five minutes when i took him to the study she was still kneeling by the body im sorry he said but you really shouldnt touch anything its my husband she said angrily hes been shot she looked right at me i think he did it she said pointing it wasnt a nice thing to say but i got lucky the police detective who showed up ten minutes later was my friend bernie ohls he was my friend but that didnt mean he didnt have to think about it first you were here with him alone right she says you knew where the gun was although it looks more like suicide right now and youre maybe too clever to be the only person around when you kill someone maybe but i think you would have done it differently thanks bernie youre right though i would have so it looks good for suicide except that wade was rich his beautiful wife is upstairs crying for him and i cant see why hed want to kill himself if you know if you know anything youd better be ready to talk ill see you later maybe sooner as it turned out i had time to go home change have a nice dinner out and come home again before ohls called the message was simple come to the sheriffs office and dont bother stopping to buy flowers the wade house was in idle valley outside the city border idle valley had its own sheriff and he was investigating wades death in theory the sheriff ran his own office but the sheriff was as stupid as he was honest and he was very honest he looked great in photographs and he was almost as big as the horse he rode in the annual idle valley festival but the horse was cleverer the sheriff knew it and he let his captain a man named hernandez do the real police work it was hernandez and ohls who threw the questions at me how did i first meet wade when what work did i do for him i told them the truth but i didnt tell everything then we reached the part that most interested hernandez the night that wade fired a gun in his bedroom you went into eileen wades room and you were in there together for some time with the door shut how long would you say you spent in there about three minutes hernandez shook his head i suggest you were in there for a few hours he said coldly i looked at ohls but bernie wouldnt look at me three minutes i repeated get that servant in here hernandez said ohls went out and came back with candy i knew what was coming candy told his story in a low nasty voice he said hed seen me go into the bedroom and that he had come up the stairs and listened at the door and heard whispers he said i didnt come out for a long time when he had finished he gave me a hard look and i could see hate in his eyes the captain said take him out just a minute i said id like to ask him a question hernandez didnt like that but he let me where were you when you saw me go into her bedroom i was cleaning up the glasses at the bar and you saw me go into her bedroom and close the door candy said yes youre lying you cant see that door from the bar im four inches taller than you and when i stood at the bar at the party i couldnt see more than the top edge of that door candy did not deny this he said nothing at all hernandez asked what about how long you were in the room i said that was my word against candys and i reminded them that candy had just lied he could believe either of us i told him hernandez sent candy out then he told me i could go home but that id have to come back the next day to sign the statement id made he even shook my hand when i left i guessed that meant he believed me a few days later they closed that investigation too it was suicide they said ohls came over that afternoon it was over but that didnt mean he had to like the answer wade was a writer marlowe thats what bothers me he wrote books he wrote notes to himself he wrote all the time and then he kills himself and he doesnt even write a goodbye it seems wrong i pointed out that wade had been drunk that didnt satisfy bernie theres the boat too why would you care if anyone heard the last shot youd ever fire or the wife who forgets her keys and has to ring the bell to get in when she could have walked around to the back of the house and come in from the garden ive been a policeman too long and it just doesnt smell right i would swear she did it except theres no motive she could have divorced him and still made a fortune he talked for an hour about the wades and for an hour i talked about them too but all my talk couldnt cover up the fact that i wasnt telling him everything he left angry angry at everybody including me i talked to someone else the next day who wasnt any happier about wades death than bernie was but for different reasons howard spencer called from new york to say hed been informed of the suicide and that hed heard i was somehow involved i found myself explaining everything again i was getting tired of apologizing for what wade had chosen to do in fact the more i thought about him the less i liked this dead man spencer said he was going to fly in one day soon we said wed talk then although i had nothing more to say roger wade was dead and so was terry lennox but there was a difference i still cared about terry i called mendy to get some facts straight mendy this is marlowe hello cheapie how are you havent you heard another friend of mine killed himself theyre going to call me the kiss of death from now on i also have a question about paul marston never heard of him mendy said immediately no games mendy that was the name lennox used in new york and probably before there so there are no army records under either name that story of yours was all a song mendy didnt like being called a liar i never said where it happened take my advice and forget the whole thing you were told now stay told some types scare me mendy but youre not one of them ever been to england he ignored my question instead he said big willie magoon wasnt scared either seen the newspapers maybe hes still not scared but i doubt it hes in the hospital and hes going to be there a long time i dont want to talk about magoon i want to talk about england and you and randy starr and paul marston there was a short silence on his end of the line then he made up his mind ok cheapie i tell you the whole story and then your curiosity dies right otherwise you do we were with the british it happened in norway in november now you know it all now you can rest your tired brain he hung up i went out and bought a newspaper and read about poor magoon of course mendy had promised me worse because magoon was a policeman a dirty cop but still one of the boys and gangsters dont like to kill policemen they dont care about private detectives though some days it seems no one does except perhaps another private detective i called george peters and asked him to help he said he would i know a few good people in england youll get what you want he didnt disappoint me when howard spencer called the next friday i had it all he was staying at the ritzbeverly hotel and he suggested we meet in the bar but i wanted to talk in private so i went to his room instead he had it nice the room was big and the view was good he ordered our drinks over the telephone now mr marlowe what can you tell me before i see mrs wade nothing he looked at me with surprise i mean concerning roger wades death i understand you were there i nodded id like to come with you to see mrs wade i said spencer shook his head i dont think she wishes to see you she blames you in part for what happened i think she told the police i killed him i know she doesnt want to see me thats why i want to go with you i want a witness to what i have to say to her too what are you going to say you hear it in front of her or not at all i said then not at all eileen has suffered enough i wont take you there to bother her more that made sense he wanted the book that wade had been working on he wanted to save eileen wade from more pain i said that these were fine aims but i didnt share them all i wanted was a clearer picture i told him the details that had bothered ohls my god he said the police dont think eileen did it do they i didnt tell him the investigation was closed i just gave him a tired smile and let him do his own thinking you want to talk to her and you want a witness i hope to god youre crazy but ill do it he said finally chapter ten a big noise about small things the drive to idle valley was long and hot as always i expected the heat but spencer was shocked this heat this dust i thought california was supposed to have beautiful weather i told him it would be cooler by the lake it was a mistake for roger to move here you know wrong environment entirely too many parties this awful heat no wonder he didnt feel like writing a writer needs things to think about and not just what hes going to wear to the next good time i didnt have a chance to disagree with him because we had reached the house spencer was out of the car as soon as i had parked and he rang the bell as soon as he got to the door candy wearing his white jacket and his usual frown let the publisher in and then closed the door as i approached i rang and he put his head out get lost or do you want trouble i pushed right past him he reached for me but eileen wade was standing there and he stopped hello howard she said warmly to spencer im so sorry you missed lunch and i didnt know you were bringing mr marlowe spencer said simply he wants to talk to you she was surprised does he i cant imagine why but do come in and sit down spencer went at once to the study for the pages wade had written i sat in an uncomfortable silence with eileen wade until i noticed that she was wearing that badge again she had just handed it to me when spencer returned with his pile of papers its the badge of an english army group the artists rifles they were called the man who gave it to me was lost right afterwards in andalsnes in norway in and you were in love with him i said she admitted it proudly and he had my initials his name was quite different she said coldly and he is dead dead i handed the badge to spencer he took it without showing interest ive seen it before he said just help me the picture on it is a long knife that points down and theres a pair of wings too the writing on it says who dares wins spencer was unimpressed i fail to see what you are trying to say this badge she says she was given in london in didnt exist then it was created years later and the artists rifles never fought in andalsnes spencer put the badge down gently on the table and pushed it towards eileen he said nothing i know that eileen said there must be some mistake spencer offered i gave him a hard stare thats one way of putting it i said another way is to say im a liar eileen said angrily that i never met a man named paul marston that he never existed that i bought this badge in a shop somewhere would that explanation satisfy you mr marlowe i said the shop would but not the first part there had been a paul marston once she had certainly met him in fact she had done more than that i took a folded paper from my pocket shes forgotten a few dates years thats all spencer said i dont see why youre being so tough with her i smiled but not from joy shes forgotten a lot more than that i waved the paper from my pocket in august eileen victoria sampsell and paul edward marston were married in a sense mrs wade is right marston never existed because that was just a name he used in the army you have to have permission to get married in the army marston had another name spencer was very quiet now he stared but not at both of us he stared at her she had to say something howard hes dead it doesnt matter and roger knew and he didnt care spencer did the right thing as he saw it he believed her lets forget it marlowe made a big show out of a badge and the marriage thats all she had him on her side now she said mr marlowe makes a big noise about small things but when it comes to saving a mans life and you never saw paul marston again i said how could i when he was dead he was not reported dead he might have been taken prisoner there was an order not to take prisoners she said in a cold sad voice thats enough marlowe spencer interrupted i think its time we left he began packing up the papers into his leather case if thats what you want mr spencer but do you think i came here to tell mrs wade she was wearing the wrong badge i began with marston long before i met mrs wade when i started my paul marston was still alive marston is not such an unusual name spencer said there must be many paul marstons maybe but how many paul marstons would you say had big scars on their faces and snowwhite hair how many that saved the lives of two gangsters marston wasnt just marston spencer he was also terry lennox i didnt expect anyone to jump up and scream and nobody did there is however a kind of silence that is almost as loud as a shout and i had it all around me now i sat in it for a full minute and then i turned to eileen she sat leaning forward her face was pale when she spoke her voice was as empty as the voice on the telephone that tells you the time minute after minute without changing i saw him once howard we didnt speak he was terribly changed when i saw him he was with that awful woman and i was married to roger we were lost to each other even if i hadnt been married i couldnt have forgiven him for marrying her that horrible woman i didnt care that roger went around with her he was just my husband paul was much more than that to me or he was nothing in the end he was nothing she wasnt talking to me but i said i wouldnt say he was nothing less than nothing he knew what kind of woman she was and still he married her then he couldnt stand it and he killed her and ran away and killed himself nothing he didnt kill her i said and you know it she looked at me in surprise spencer made a funny sound in his throat roger killed her i continued and you also know that did he tell you she asked quietly he didnt have to he would have told me sooner or later it was driving him crazy she shook her head no mr marlowe what was driving him crazy was that he didnt know he was so drunk when he did it that he couldnt remember afterwards he tried to remember because he knew something was wrong perhaps that memory came back to him at the very end spencer couldnt believe a man could kill and forget it eileen smiled a very sad smile i was there howard i saw him do it shes going to tell us i thought she cant stop herself now and she talked and we listened she had followed roger to sylvias guest house an argument started between roger and sylvia eileen watched from the shadows roger came outside sylvia ran after him she tried to hit him with a small stone vase she was holding he took it from her and he hit her then he hit her again and she fell down and he kept hitting her before iln ran she saw him pick sylvias body up and carry it back inside when roger came home that night i was terrified he was covered in blood and still blind drunk i took his clothes off him as if he were a child and put them in an old suitcase he went right to sleep and i drove to chatsworth beach on the other side of the lake and threw the suitcase in when roger woke up he remembered nothing he never said a word about the clothes i guess he never even noticed they were missing spencer was working on something while he listened and now he had it ready wait a minute you knew roger had killed sylvia and yet you had me hire marlowe or try to hire him to find out the terrible secret that was bothering your husband that doesnt make sense unless he gave her a strange look as if seeing her for the first time unless the idea was that marlowe would find the truth and maybe tell wade that the whole world would have to know so roger would take that gun and do just what he did anyway she looked at spencer with tears in her eyes thats horrible howard you know i could never i dont know spencer said coolly but you know did you did i what she asked shoot roger he said calmly youre horrible he was my husband i forgot my key i came in he was already dead spencer shook his head ive stayed here a dozen times eileen and ive never known the front door to be locked she stood up howard take the book and go call the police if you think i killed roger but dont ever come back here i wanted one last answer wait a minute mrs wade lets finish the job were all trying to do the right thing that old suitcase you threw in the lake at chatsworth beach was it heavy yes it was so how did you get it over that high fence they close the gate there after dark she thought about it the fence i had a hard time with the fence but i got it over there isnt any fence i said isnt any fence she repeated and sylvia lennox was killed inside the guest house on the bed and there are other details you missed she said nothing she just walked away we watched her go up the stairs we heard her bedroom door close what was that about the fence spencer asked he looked like a man whod just fought a battle he was tired in that way a bad joke ive never been near chatsworth beach it might have a fence and it might not i see he said unhappily but she didnt know either of course not which means she killed them both then something moved behind me and candy was standing there he was playing with his knife again but this time he wasnt thinking about giving me the blade im sorry senor he said to me i was wrong about you she killed the boss he looked at his knife again no i said i stood up and held out my hand give me the knife candy to the cops youre just a mexican servant theyd arrest you for it and love it theyve made a mess of this from start to finish and theyd use you to make people forget that youd spend the rest of your life in jail he put the knife in my hand only for you i do this i put the knife in my pocket candy asked what would happen now i said wed do nothing but spencer insisted we had to do something he mentioned calling the police tomorrow or let them catch her themselves we dont have enough proof the truth is not legal proof if it was we wouldnt have lawyers in the end spencer said hed do whatever i thought was best he was ok he was doing fine but this wasnt something he knew about it wasnt books we left as i walked out i handed candy back his knife dont do a thing nobody trusts me but i trust you candy thank you senor i trust you too i returned spencer to his hotel and went home i watched the clock and the hours went slowly i fell asleep very late and the telephone rang in the middle of my first dream yes this is candy senor the lady is dead its a hard word dead and when he said it he made it sound like stone she took some pills i think have you called the police not yet he said call them was there a note yes a letter give it to them when they come and tell them everything and this time only the truth right yes senor ill call them right now chapter eleven a little trap i hung up and took a shower and shaved i dressed quickly because i knew i didnt have much time i was tying my shoes when my time ran out hello marlowe bernie ohls said when i picked up the telephone come down here and suffer it was different this time it was another suicide but this was the real thing they were not happy with me but there was nothing they could threaten me with hernandez listened to my story and this time he didnt make any suggestions as to what else i might want to say there was eileen wades full confession too but the da didnt want it because he had already believed another confession to the lennox murder the sheriffs office on the other hand liked the confession they liked it because they didnt like the da dr loring showed up because she had been his patient and she had killed herself with his medicine we were not glad to see each other after the doctor left i was told i could go too ohls took me out through another room he pointed out a small pile of papers on a desk copies of the confession it would be terrible if someone took one of them the da doesnt want this to become public then he went out into the hall to get some air leaving me alone he came back a minute later when we were out in the sunlight i asked him you dont like the da do you bernie ohls smiled i like everybody i even like you not everyone does though and in a few days fewer people will like you i think i hope you still carry a gun i do i said but it doesnt always help the newspapers said that willie magoon was carrying two of them the night they put him in hospital thats right ohls said it would be a good idea to remember that when i got home i called morgan the reporter whod given me the ride home from the police station that other time we had a long conversation he tried to persuade me not to do it but he couldnt and he was still a reporter and he wanted the story he did warn me though when we print this confession youre going to be the least popular person in town the da will know sooner or later where it came from potter will be so angry he might forget hes a gentleman and mendy will be angry too because he told you to leave it alone and mendy doesnt even pretend to be a gentleman it was all true and his advice was good advice print it morgan i said and i read the whole letter to him from the copy id taken from the sheriffs office it came out the next day on the front page the da called it lies but the newspaper sold very well bernie ohls came over and we had another bad time together he wondered why i hadnt called him with what id had against eileen wade he said maybe i wanted her dead i said i had just wanted her to take a long look at what she had done to two good men you think youre a clever monkey dont you marlowe what do you want me to say nothing its too late the hard boys will come for you and its very quiet here dark and quiet why are you even here bernie we were friends once but you cant really be friends with a cop can you not a tough old one like you he finished his beer and left the day ended with some good songs on the radio the next day the da made a full statement attacking morgans newspaper and he said a lot of pretty things about poor mrs wade and still the newspaper held to its position i went to my office and did nothing special nothing that i can remember until the workday was over i ate at a restaurant on the way home i drove up locust avenue and it was as empty as usual i parked and went up all my steps i would have unlocked the door but it was already a few inches open come on in cheapie a familiar voice said welcome home if i had taken my gun out right then i could have shot him but i stood still a moment too long and someone slipped out of the bushes and pushed me through my own doorway mendy was wearing another expensive suit and the same nasty smile i didnt see him at first though because i was looking at the other man sitting in the corner of my living room he had a gun lying across his knees and he was so brown from the sun that there in the halfdark i couldnt see his face at all mendy wanted my attention the man that had pushed me reminded me of that in a soft place on my arm the pain disappeared very quickly but with it went the muscle in my arm i looked at him he was a big mexican he was tough there is nothing tougher than a tough mexican just as there is nothing gentler than a gentle mexican or more honest than an honest mexican or above all nothing sadder than a sad mexican this guy was one of the hard ones they dont come any harder anywhere mendy stood in front of me i was very interested in the gun in his right hand and it looked interested in me you didnt listen cheapie he hit me with the gun it hurt you shouldnt have to do this yourself i said surprised that my mouth still worked you should have some boys do it for you like you did to willie magoon he smiled again no magoon was business he tried to push me he bought that big car of his with my money and then he tried to push me you marlowe are personal you embarrassed me professionally i cant let you do that i shook my head theres more to it than that what happened your friend lennox was innocent but you never moved a finger to prove it and then i came and did the work you should have done he saved your life and you didnt do anything because youre no friend and youre not big youre just a loud boy who cant think of anyone but himself his face froze and he lifted the gun to hit me again i didnt think i didnt have a plan i was just tired of being hit i kicked him full in the stomach as he went down i hit him again with my knee then i waited to be shot and nothing happened i looked around the hard one was standing by the door watching me he didnt even bother to look at mendy who was now lying on the floor gasping at last the man in the chair moved he stood up put his gun away and laughed dont kill him marlowe we need him alive that was when bernie ohls walked in whistling hello marlowe youve cut your face he gestured at mendy who was still on the floor take this soft baby out of here he ordered the laughing man hes not soft i said hes hurt anybody can be hurt was willie magoon soft no ohls admitted and now weve got the words from mendys own mouth about magoon because gangsters cant touch policemen in this town its against all the rules we will remind mendy of that it worked well this little trap a few cuts on your face but id say you deserved them they led mendy away and left me alone in my dark quiet house i thought about it for a few minutes and then i made a telephone call marlowe i know that name right a friend of terrys how can i help you he had a businessmans calm voice you can tell me about mexico mr starr i just had a visit from mendy and i dont think he was mad at me for something in the newspaper it was mexico something is wrong here the confession lennox wrote was false how many other lies are there he wrote me a letter which was mailed by someone who randy starr said i have no idea mr marlowe i think you should find out mr starr if you dont someone else will you marlowe he didnt sound like the calm businessman now not me a man so big you could get hurt if he sneezed so find out mr starr the next day i went to see the lawyer who had been to mexico to watch them bury lennox he was surprised to see me but was not unfriendly youre a stubborn one arent you marlowe still digging yes mr endicott still digging i wonder if you could give me a few minutes why not he said can i assume that you were representing harlan potter when you came to see me in jail endicott nodded i suppose potter is very unhappy with me these days i continued but to my surprise the lawyer said he wasnt mr potter blames his soninlaw dr loring he feels that if that wade woman hadnt been using those drugs that the doctor gave her none of this would have happened hes wrong you saw terrys body in otatoclan didnt you i did indeed he didnt look the same did he you mean the colour no he was darker much darker his hair was black but the scar was still there and we took his fingerprints theres no question it was him i asked him the next question twice before he understood it a mailbox no i dont remember seeing a mailbox i showed him terrys letter he read it slowly i wonder why he did it he said when he had finished reading why he sent the letter no of course not why he confessed and killed himself as for the mailbox perhaps he saw something that looked like one otatoclan isnt a modern town i know i said i looked it up a population of one thousand no good roads a small local airport one hotel not a place youd find a mailbox endicott was trying to understand what do you think it would mean if there wasnt a mailbox i said i didnt know what i didnt say was that i was sure i would find out one day chapter twelve the long goodbye a month went by in which i learned nothing new then i came into the office one day and found a stranger waiting for me a tall welldressed mexican he sat by the open window smoking a brown cigarette that smelled strong he was wearing his black hair longer than we do north of the border he was also wearing green sunglasses he stood up politely senor marlowe what can i do for you he handed me a folded piece of paper and told me in spanish that it was an introduction from senor starr of las vegas lets speak english i said if you speak english of course i do he said he didnt have much of an accent but he spoke in the american spanish way stressing every second or third word in his sentences i unfolded the paper and read this introduces a friend of mine cisco maioranos i think he can help you s lets go into my office senor maioranos i said and held the inner door open for him i smelled perfume as he went past me he had a thin neat moustache he looked delicate and harmless except he probably wasnt as delicate as he looked because he had knife scars on both cheeks you wish to know about senor lennox he said as he sat down i was working at the hotel in otatoclan you dont look the type sometimes life is difficult he said who mailed the letter to me i mailed it he said he took out a cigarette case and offered it to me as he lit another cigarette for himself i dont like cuban cigarettes thank you you mailed the letter thats correct the boy was afraid to go up to the room because there was a policeman outside the door a cop as you say so i went up and he gave me the letter there was a lot of money in that letter senor maioranos you should have looked inside the letter was not open he said coldly i am an honest man i apologize continue please i went into his room with the coffee he was holding a gun the letter was on the table he told me to take it and go he gave me some money naturally i gave it to the boy later i was on my way down the stairs when i heard the shot i hid the letter and came right back the police were in the room senor lennox was dead i asked him if the hotel had been full he thought for a moment he lit another cuban cigarette no he said it was not full perhaps six or seven guests americans i asked yes two american hunters one of them spoke border spanish i think did they go near lennoxs room at all why should they it wasnt an answer but i couldnt see his eyes because of the sunglasses so i didnt know why he hadnt answered well i said standing up it was nice of you to come here you can thank randy for me and you can tell him too that next time he can send somebody that knows what hes talking about he stared at me hard i looked at those knife scars again he had not always been a polite man in a hotel he did not like being doubted lets try this i said the two americans were two men named menendez and starr they did go into lennoxs room lennox knew they were there he knew why he wrote me that letter because he felt guilty he had tricked me and a man like lennox doesnt like tricking his friends by the way did you put the letter in the mailbox maioranos frowned mailbox otatoclan is not mexico city senor there is no mailbox no there isnt and there was no coffee you did not bring lennox anything you did not go into his room the americans did one of them took a gun and shot lennox he shot him very carefully so that the bullet did not go into lennox it gave him a nasty wound but it did not kill him the idea was to fool the lawyer that would come down so when he came lennox was drugged and packed in ice and the lawyer saw him in a dark room the fingerprints were real enough but lennox wasnt dead the americans paid the mexican policeman of course they must have paid a few people isnt all this possible maioranos seemed to be thinking it over possible yes policemen everywhere have to eat otatoclan is far away from the cities and no one asks too many questions there it is all possible except for one thing senor whats that if it is true then i am a liar then i did not go in and give him his coffee and take his letter you were already in there pal writing the letter the tall mexican took off his sunglasses nothing can change the colour of a mans eyes i suppose its a bit too early for a gin and lime he said they had done a wonderful job on him in mexico why not their doctors painters architects are as good as ours sometimes better they had changed his nose they couldnt take the scar off so they gave him another on the other cheek knife scars are not uncommon south of the border how close did i come i asked close enough a few details wrong but they are not important we had to work very quickly i was supposed to be followed to otatoclan of course mendy didnt want me to write you but i insisted you knew who killed sylvia he didnt give me a straight answer its tough to let a woman be arrested for murder even if you never really loved her its a tough world i said was potter in this with you he smiled i dont think so im not sure but i think he believes im dead who would tell him otherwise unless you did dont worry we dont have tea together any more have you heard that the police have mendy he smiled again they had him hes in mexico now hes not as bad as you think he has a heart so does a snake how about that gin and lime i got up without answering him and went to my safe i opened it and took out the fivethousanddollar bill i put it on the desk in front of him i enjoyed playing with it but its yours now he looked at it but he didnt touch it ive got plenty of money he said you could have left things alone i know after she had killed her husband she might have done more wonderful things he was nothing special anyway just a man he knew what happened too and he tried hard to live with it he wrote books you may have heard of him i didnt want anyone to get hurt i was frightened and i ran if id stayed i wouldnt have had a chance what should i have done i dont know she was crazy she might have killed him anyway i agreed that she might he smiled thinking that fixed things between us so lets go have a drink lets go to victors no time right now senor maioranos we were good friends once werent we he asked unhappily were we i forget it seems to me it was two other guys who were friends i said quietly take back your money it has too much blood on it you need the money how would you know he picked the bill up and put it in his pocket he bit his lower lip with the very white teeth you can have when you have brown skin you remember i gave you a chance to call the police to have me stopped dont you he said suddenly im not sore at you i said youre just that kind of guy for a long time i tried to understand you you had good qualities but there was something wrong you made your own rules you were a nice guy but that was just luck i think you liked your gangsters as much as you liked honest men maybe the war did it to you but maybe you were born that way dont you understand he said sadly i couldnt have told you more than i did you wouldnt have stood for it thats as nice a thing as was ever said to me you call them gangsters i was in trouble and they know about trouble they owed me for the one right thing i did in my life when i needed them they were there and for free youre not the only one in the world who cant be bought marlowe he took one of my cigarettes and had a little trouble lighting it i can be bought terry you bought a lot of me for a smile and a nod and a few drinks in quiet bars here and there it was nice while it lasted so long pal i wont say goodbye i said it to you when it meant something when it was sad and lonely and final i came back too late he said the doctors took a long time on my face you wouldnt have come at all if i hadnt been asking some difficult questions i saw tears in his eyes he put his green glasses back on quickly they didnt want me to tell you anything im not judging you terry i never did youre a nice guy in many ways its just that youre not here any more youve been gone for a long time youve got nice clothes and you smell nice and you have a pretty litte moustache thats just an act he said almost desperately but you like it an act is all there is there isnt anything eke im hollow inside ive had it marlowe i had it long ago well i guess thats all we have to say he put his hand out i shook it so long senor maioranos he said goodbye and walked out i watched the door close i listened to his footsteps did i want him to stop to come back to make me change the way i felt well he didnt that was the last time i saw him i never saw any of them again except the cops no way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them
