carol oconnell winter house this book is dedicated to a woman who had two wedding rings my mothers only marriage had outlasted the original gold band on a cold day in february i found that first ring my father had given to her it was worn until it was worn out thin and brittle but not broken and then she died acknowledgments many thanks to researcher dianne burke who answers legal and medical questions and can chart the paths of binary stars with equal facility and thanks to phillip skodinski attorneyatlaw any errors in this novel are surely my own and any untoward humor at the expense of the legal profession is expressed by fictional people not me and said humorous though disparaging remarks would not have been made if they had not been important to the plot really no really and thanks to my brother bruce for the gift of time and thanks to cousins norman melinda camille and noel for an eleventhhour visit that meant the world to me chapter the hour was late the traffic was scarce a few cars crawled by at the pace of bugs attracted by house lights five flights of electricyellow windows the narrow mansion was not a rarity in new york city home to millionaires and billionaires however its nineteenthcentury facade was an anachronism on this particular block of central park west the steeppitched roof was split by a skylight dome and attendant gargoyles were carved in stone wedged in tight between two condominium behemoths this dwelling was in the wrong place at the wrong time and regally unrepentant though the police were at the door and in the parlor up the stairs and down in the cellar so many police nedda winter sat quietly and watched them pass her by on their way to other rooms and they watched her for a while soon they came to regard her as furniture but she took no offense she turned on the antique radio that stood beside her chair no one reprimanded her and so she turned up the volume white hot jazz benny goodman on the clarinet and other ghosts from the bigband era flooded the front room and infected the steps of people in and out of uniform passing to and fro lift those feet tap those toes miss winter repressed a smile for that would be unseemly but she nodded in time to the music the house was alive again drunk on life though the party revolved around the dead man at the center of the floor miss winter was well named she had the countenance of that season her long hair was pure white and her skin had the pallor of one who has been shut away for a long time even her eyes had gone pale leached of color bleached to the lightest tint of blue she was so well disguised by time that the police continued to ignore her demanding no apologies nor any explanation for her long absence they had even failed to recognize this house an address that was infamous when the music on the radio was young fiftyeight years earlier in the aftermath of another violent crime which remained unsolved a twelveyearold girl had vanished from this house and now the lost child grown up and grown old had come back home the medical examiners vehicle was parked at the curb and behind it was another van with the csu logo of the crimescene technicians the front windows of the house were all alight and the silhouettes of men and women moved across pulleddown shades and closed drapes a warm october breeze of indian summer rippled the yellow crimescene tapes that extended down the stone steps to include a patch of the sidewalk the tape did the restraining duty of a velvet rope for theatrical productions though tonights audience amounted to only three stragglers refugees from a saloon in the hour after closing time happy intoxication was in their stance and in their badly sung song which was grating on the nerves of a uniformed officer the spinning cherry lights of police units made the officers face alternately beet red and pale white as he waved off the drunks with a loud get the hell outta here charles butler parked his mercedes behind a police car and stepped out into the street unfolding and rising to a stand of six feet four smooth grace in motion served as compensation for his foolish face bulbous eyes the size of hens eggs were half closed by heavy lids and pocked with small blue irises that gave him a look of permanent astonishment and his hook of a nose might perch two sparrows or one fat pigeon otherwise the fortyyearold man was well made from the necktie down and well turned out though he had omitted the vest from his threepiece suit he had dressed in a hurry mallory was waiting two uniformed policemen stood guard before the house barring all comers from the short flight of stone steps leading up to the front door as he approached these officers charles inadvertently smiled a huge mistake whenever his features were gathered up into any happy expression it gave him the look of a loon a second cousin to the three departing drunks before he could be driven off charles pointed upward to the worstdressed man in america detective sergeant riker who slouched against a wroughtiron railing cadging a light from another man then exhaling a cloud of cigarette smoke with his conversation im with him at the sound of a familiar voice riker turned around with that crooked smile he saved for people he liked hey how ya doin the detective descended the short flight of steps to the sidewalk and gripped the larger mans hand thanks for coming out i know its late indeed it was and riker had the appearance of a man who had slept away most of this night in his suit but then he always dressed that way prewrinkled at the start of every workday the yellow light at the top of the staircase had the flattering effect of minimizing the creases in the detective s face making him appear somewhat younger than his fiftyfive years my pleasure charles looked down at his friend of average height feeling the need to apologize for looming over him did mallory tell you anything useful no nothing at all maybe its better that way riker motioned him toward the stairs then led the way up two women live here one of them killed a man tonight simple enough he flicked his cigarette over the railing check em out well talk later when they passed through the open door charles heard music vintage jazz and he would not have been surprised to hear the clink of ice in cocktail glasses as they entered a din of conversation in the large foyer they walked by a cluster of men wearing badges clipped to their suit pockets and detective riker nodded to them in passing those guys are settling a little problem of jurisdiction he led charles through a louder dispute between a woman in uniform and a man in a suit riker explained this one too he pointed to the young man with the folded stethoscope squeezed tightly in one raised fist now thats one pissed off medical examiner mallory wont release the body shes using it to rattle the ladies who live here at the threshold of the front room charles had only time enough to blink once before entering a spatial paradox the inside of the house appeared to be much larger than the exterior a trick of cunning architecture and some of the magic was done with a score of mirrors in elaborate silver frames ten feet tall they created a labyrinth of rooms and flights of stairs and corridors where none existed thus a dozen people were transformed into a mob and each reflection added its own energy to the fray the grand staircase was the focal point a tenuous bit of engineering that seemed to have no secure supports as it curved up to a partial vista on a floor above the cathedral ceiling though the rest of the stairs spiraled out of sight in minds eye he was swept along with them rushing round and upward through all the dizzying flights back to earth a corpse lay on the floor partially obscured by upright people and charles buder unaccustomed to crime scenes was caught in a quandary of manners perhaps he should have admired the dead man first and maybe he should not be tapping his feet in time to the music of a clarinet an even less reverent police photographer stepped over the body to speak with detective riker who directed the closeup shots of the deceased after snapping pictures in quick succession and in time to the beat of a snare drum the photographer departed to another room giving charles his first clear view of the victim he had been prepared for something brutal and grisly given that this case had attracted so much attention but the man on the floor seemed to be merely resting if one could only discount the pair of scissors protruding from the chest the victim did not belong in this neighborhood of wealth his pants were shapeless and dirty the tshirt stained with more sweat than blood and a pointed object lay near one open hand thus laid out was the simple story of an icepickwielding intruder felled by a homeowner who favored shears what could possibly interest all of these following a cue of upturned heads his attention was drawn to the secondfloor landing and the slender young woman standing there in blue jeans and an attitude of privilege blond curls cut by a virtuoso grazed the shoulders of a tailored blazer worn over a silk tshirt arms folded she affected the pose of one who owned all that she surveyed even the people in the room below and most particularly the corpse mallory more formally she was detective mallory and never kathy anymore she preferred the distancing surname even among those who knew her best and though charles was her foremost apologist he found the background music fitting louis armstrong was belting out the lyrics of savannahs hardhearted hannah pouring water on a drowning man one cream white hand with red fingernails call them talons lighdy touched the banister as she slowly descended the grand staircase circling in a wide arc her eyes fixed on one face in the crowd but not his face two crimescene technicians moved out of charless way and now he could see the object of mallorys fixation a child detective riker had told him that two women lived at this address there had been no mention of this litde girl shivering like a whippet that nervous tremulous breed of dog that can never quite get warm no matter what the temperature no wait this was no child but a tiny woman with a few silver threads in her dark brown hair someone closer to his own age eyes cast down this person presented herself at the bottom of the staircase in the manner of a penitent or a volunteer for human sacrifice tall mallory literally descended upon the smaller woman rapidly closing the distance and causing the little householder to shrink even more before the small head could turtle into the cowl of a white robe charles noted one charming detail the short brown hair was angled across the ears creating the illusion that they were pointed in the elfin way thats miss bitty smyth detective riker raised one eyebrow as if expecting charles to recognize the name he did not bitty thats a nickname riker shrugged and splayed one hand to say who knows thats how she introduced herself if shes got another name we cant get it out of her we cant get anything out of her she might be in shock charles watched on in helpless fascination as mallory reached out to bitty smyth and gripped the womans thin arm he was about to discount the possibility that miss smyth was the scissorwielding homeowner when he turned to see the other resident of the house a woman with long white hair and a green silk robe she was barefoot and seated beside an antique radio the source of the music how amazing to find this old piece in working order by the detail on its cabinet he could date the radio back to the middle nineteenthirties the woman too he guessed her age at seventy or thereabouts her hand was on the dial raising the volume thats miss nedda winter said riker shes bittys aunt again something in rikers manner suggested that charles should also know this person she caught charles staring at her and he could only describe her expression as one of curious recognition the old woman turned off the music her attention had quickly shifted to the young homicide detective who had hold of bitty smyths arm nedda winter rose from her chair she was taller than many of the men in this room and her strides were long as she rushed toward her niece with an obvious plan of rescue riker moving faster than his usual mosey headed off miss winter and now charles was treated to a display that simply did not fit the man he knew playing the consummate gentleman riker extended one arm to the lady as if she might need his support then dazzled her with a broad smile and smoothly led her out of the room star treatment perhaps he should know that old woman charles turned back to the interrogation of bitty smyth who was now facing in his direction a bible was clutched to the tiny prisoners breast and her large brown eyes rolled back as her lips moved in what he took for whispers of fervent prayer well mallory had that effect on people his next impression was that miss smyth had disconnected from the solid earth and might fly upward if not restrained as charles drew nearer he heard mallory say that no she had not found jesus and had no intention of being saved the smaller womans head wobbled and nodded perhaps in a fearful palsy or maybe agreeing that this young policewoman was beyond salvation charles mallory quickly dropped her hold on bitty smyths arm as if caught in the act of beating a suspect supporting this illusion miss smyth sank to an armchair still nodding and trembling on the verge of a smile so greatly relieved the long slants of mallorys eyes were always the first thing one noticed a strange bright shade of green not found in nature she did not smile upon greeting him and he had not expected that her expressions were usually deliberate or absent a chilling idiosyncrasy she had others though charles butler possessed a vast knowledge of abnormal psychology mallory sidestepped every attempt to classify her with any sense of confidence as if she belonged to a separate species of one a denizen of some unsentimental planet of perpetual cold weather hello he said smiling and standing back a pace to take her in as if he had expected her to have grown over the weekend her hand was on his arm and with the lightest of pressure she was able to drag him down a narrow hallway and into a small boxy room all decked out like a tailors shop with the tools and machines of the trade racks of thread spools lined one wall and a basket of mending sat on the floor near a dressmakers dummy a sewing room she said without a single pair of scissors i think i noticed them back in the parlor and here wisely he stopped for mallorys eyes widened slightly to tell him that she did not appreciate his pointing out the obvious thing the shears planted in the dead mans chest and neither did she care to be interrupted arms folding across her chest was all the warning he would ever get so the detective continued this woman comes downstairs in the dark sees the burglar then she runs to the other end of the house to look for the sewing shears and the perp just stands there in the front room waiting for her to come back and stab him to death charles hesitated always a good idea to tread carefully with her there was only one logical conclusion but he sensed a trap in the making then its not a case of selfdefense no thats exactly what it is she said somewhat impatient selfdefense that much i believe right charles needed no mirror to tell him that he wore the comical face of a fool who has just discovered that it was not night but day hands in his pockets he stared at his shoes i gathered from riker that you wanted a psych evaluation of those two women no that was just an afterthought she closed the door then leaned her back against it as if to block his escape what can you tell me about those people he shrugged only their names i just got here she put one hand on her hip a sign that she did not entirely believe him but then it was her nature to be suspicious of everyone who did not carry a badge and everyone who did youve never met them before no said charles i dont know either of them well they know you and theyve known you for a long time her eyes were asking accusing and demanding all at once and how do you explain that detective riker liked the kitchen best unlike the rest of the house this room was built to human scale the low ceiling made it cozy almost cottagelike he declined an offer of alcohol but allowed nedda winter to make him a glass of iced tea with thanks she selected a lemon from a bowl of fruit knife in hand she stood at the butcher block and smiled at him it was almost a tease as if to ask did he object to her holding this dangerously pointed object rikers mouth dipped on one side to say yeah right he made a cursory inventory of the room his gaze passing over a meat cleaver then traveling onto a cutlery block of knives a case bolted to the far wall contained a fire extinguisher and a small ax with all the lethal weapons in this kitchen arsenal a pair of scissors had been an odd choice to bring down an intruder tonight miss winter made short work of the lemon cutting a slice and draping it over the edge of a tall glass full of ice cubes she stood at the table pouring tea from a pitcher and saying please sit down detective dont wait on me as riker setded into a chair the woman pulled a frosty beer from the refrigerator and uncapped it now he revised his ideas of society matrons for nedda winter drank straight from the botde long swigs beer she said pulling up a chair on the other side of the table nothing like it on a warm night they go together dont they yeah there was no false note in her voice and nothing ingratiating in her manner he liked her style and her brand of beer this was one of his people of course she paused to study the bottle in her hand then flashed him a wry smile if you do beat a confession out of me the alcohol might argue for diminished capacity i can live with that riker reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a folded sheet of yellowlined paper weve already got this statement you gave to the west side detectives but theres just a few inconsistencies this word was a cops euphemism for lies and more lies a few things that need explaining in other words try and talk your way out of this if you can her gray eyebrows were on the rise they were whimsical things stray hairs growing this way and that how old was she so much hung on the year of nedda winters birth the detective searched her face and found wrinkles enough to make her seventy the right age for a legend but he could not be certain not in this world of plastic miracles where women of sixty passed for forty there was evidence of surgery anomalies in the planes of her cheeks and forehead as if she had been badly broken long ago and put back together she withstood this intense scrutiny with smiling pale blue eyes their directness appealed to him and also put him on his guard she was looking past his smile there was still some doubt about her identity or maybe he could simply not believe his own luck to find her in this house tonight blunt questions were not an option not yet and so he must go slowly with this woman intelligence lived in those quick blue eyes that missed nothing as he took her measure she measured him so why are all of these people still in my house she set her beer bottle to one side the truth riker settled on a halftruth theyre trying to reconstruct what happened here i told them what happened several times like i said miss winter there re a few glitches in your statement and then theres the problem of the ice pick charles butler followed mallory into the front room where the tall mirrors created an unsettling carnival effect it was impossible to look anywhere without encountering ones own reflection repeating two and three times yet mallory managed it he watched reflected copies of her negotiating the ocular maze with downcast eyes actually this was a familiar phenomenon she had always avoided every looking glass even shunning reflections in shop windows he once had a theory to fit her early history as a homeless child she might see something ugly or worthless when she met herself in mirrors selfesteem issues were the sad baggage of that background however he had retired this idea for another one that was truly eerie and almost akin to vampirism she raised her eyes now and there was no way she could fail to see her own reflection walking toward her from three directions yet she lacked the instant catcheyes response of every normal person she appeared to see nothing at all no recognizable form or proof of her own existence and she moved on without pause what a bundle of contradictions was this stunning young woman who could not enter any room unnoticed invisible mallory he climbed the spiral staircase following her black running shoes italian leather imports that might cost a weeks pay for the other civil servants in this house he sometimes wondered if she did not delight in raising rumors that she might have an illegal source of income and of course this was true she was his business partner they were headhunters halfway up the stairs charles discovered a design flaw because of the cathedral ceiling this march of steps to the second floor was the length of more than two flights the house had been made for appearances only and with no consideration for inhabitants of nedda winters age did that name sound more familiar to him now he was distracted by mallory as she explained that there were not enough ice picks in the house but there had been an ice pick lying on the floor by the dead man surely the one was sufficient enigma thy name is mallory and sometimes he wondered if she simply enjoyed sharpening her claws on his brain he looked over the railing and down at the lavishly stocked wet bar by the foot of the stairs and the silver ice bucket which would so nicely complement the burglars expensive ice pick he could not recall when he had last found a use for his own pick regrettably the day of the oldfashioned ice block delivered by horsedrawn cart was long gone perhaps miss winter like himself had inherited one with the family silver well he began picking his words more carefully this time im guessing not assuming mind you that the ice pick near the body doesnt belong to the burglar so far if he interpreted her silence correctly he was on safe ground i suppose the man found the pick after he broke into the house looks that way doesnt it she said and so of course his theory must be dead wrong all right the bedrock of logic was a bit shaky here mallory had already conceded selfdefense so either the pick belonged to the burglar or the man had found it in the house one of these two things must be true or not he sighed mallory paused on the stairs and turned to face him the dead man wasnt a burglar he was a serial killer out on bail im the one who arrested him he always used a hunting knife i found one strapped to his leg he never had a chance to pull it out before one of those women stabbed him theres only one line in her statement that rings true she said it was done in the dark now that parts true if the lights had been on shed never have gotten close enough to kill him this serial killer was out on bail dangerous but he had to ask how is that possible bad judge good lawyer mallory glanced over the railing looking down at the front room below and the dead man at its center so that ice pick was out of character for him and one weapon too many she resumed her climb well said charles to mallorys back given his history with women the very fact that he broke in with a knife strapped to his leg that should be enough to she paused on the secondfloor landing to stare at him in a way that asked whose side he was on neither one of those women knew he had a knife mallory turned her back on him and approached a door to the right of the stairs odds are they still dont know she rested one hand on the knob when riker and i showed up the west side cops were still trying to get bitty smyth to unlock this bedroom door i had better luck charles was not certain that he wanted more detail on this i told her to open up or id shoot off the lock thats when bitty decided to come out mallory opened the door and waved him into the darkness ahead of her saying behind his back and this is what she didnt want the cops to see what a flair she had for drama the lights switched on and in the sudden bright light charles faced a wall lined with scores of photographs and saw his own face looking back at him from the picture frames his eyes gravitated first to a shot taken when he was a child of ten the backdrop was a birthday party in gramercy park a neighboring frame held a small portrait with the gray grain of newsprint and a companion article about the youngest student ever to matriculate at harvard university next was a picture of a child in cap and gown inches taller than his graduating class of young adults in successive photographs he passed through puberty collected more academic credentials and entered a prestigious corporate think tank the caption of an old photo cut from fortune had him escaping the corporation to strike out on his own and the rest were a collection of societypage shots from weddings and funerals the most recent picture of the lot was a candid photograph taken on the streets of soho this one was framed in silver on the table beside bittys bed so you have a stalker mallory turned to the bureau and picked up a stack of three diaries each with a flimsy lock that had been opened take a look at these i need to know if shes dangerous youre joking her chin jutted forward and an angry line appeared between her eyes an unsubtle reminder that she had no sense of humor mallory held out the journals charles recoiled as if she were offering something unclean this cant be right reading her personal this is a crime scene charles i dont need a warrant and her subtext was unmistakable she was the law friend and business partner aside he should not push his luck with her tonight a third voice chimed in to say what they looked over to the far corner of the room to see a bird emerge from a large cage on the floor it was smaller than a parrot but somewhat larger than a parakeet a comb of yellow feathers unfurled at the top of its head in a gesture of surprise its a cockatiel said charles mallory looked down at the bird clearly regarding it as something that she planned to wipe off the sole of her shoe charles sensed that this was not their first meeting the tiny creature was too quick to pick up on her hostility it opened its beak wide but not to scream the posture reminded charles of a baby bird begging for worms or in this instance begging for its life the cockatiel flattened its comb of yellow feathers and head ducked low to floor retreated behind the fringe of the bedspread charles however had nowhere to hide he stared at the journals as mallory pressed them into his hands he shook his head bitty smyth impressed me as a very fragile personality reading her diaries would be rather like an assault read fast and shell never know mallory turned away from him to rifle the contents of the closet shelves he sat down on the unmade bed as he took in all the items of the room bittys interests were not limited to himself his photographs shared a bit of wall space with the virgin mary and small statues of saints decorated her dresser alongside lipstick tubes and other toilet articles there was also a collection of equestrian figurines from a young girls horsecrazy stage of life and stuffed bears abounded here apart from the religious themes the underlying decor was that of a teenage girl who was approximately forty years old he opened the earliest of the diaries and read it as fast as he could turn pages even given his skill as a speed reader this was a waste of time all the famed diarists in history had written with posterity and an audience in mind and so did damn near everyone else on the planet consequendy the entries were usually absent anything as embarrassing as truth in a matter of minutes he was reading the final page of handwriting small and neat and not one line to support the idea of bitty smyth as an obsessive stalker im not in any of these diaries he said satisfied no mallory stood before the open closet holding a sheaf of papers bound in clear plastic this is a phd dissertation yours think she read it mallory held up a worn sock with a hole in it or did she just want another souvenir like this one she tossed the sock into his lap your size i think charles shrugged this off bitty moved on to another obsession two years ago he stacked the diaries on the bedside table all she wrote about were her religious retreats on the weekends his phd dissertation flew across the room to join the holey sock in his lap and he looked down at the cover sheet of this paper authored before he was out of his teens the subject was prodigies his own peer group charles rose from the bed drawn to the wall of framed pictures and another sort of peer group children ganged by age and social strata this one he said staring at the group photograph taken at his tenth birthday party this is the connection between bitty and me mallory crossed the room to stand beside him as he pointed to the smirking face of one child in the crowd that boy is paul smyth must be a relative i dont remember meeting bitty smyth as a child but i suppose she could have been at this party though i dont see her in the picture odd she has the kind of face that never changes gamine all eyes maybe she was the one with the camera the shot angles upward a childs point of view a child smaller than the others mallory stepped closer to the photograph there mustve been fifty kids at that party at least said charles so you dont remember bitty very distinctive face but you remember paul smyth the ordinarylooking kid he was a friend of yours hardly all of his childhood friends had been adults i didnt even know most of these children this had been a family experiment in social interaction with youngsters of normal intelligence all such experiments had ended in disaster children were so good at sussing out and torturing the alien in their midst the child with the freakish large brain but i knew paul smyth too well he called me froggy all morning of course mallory would not ask why so obvious his bulging eyes did call to mind a bullfrog froggy only nickname i ever had so that was memorable it caught on with all the other children that day and thats what he wanted he was setting me up i figured that out when it came time to open my presents he gave you a frog a big one the huge frog had leapt from the open gift box initiating a scream from one of the mothers for six seconds that amphibian had been the only pet that charles had ever owned but then of course the other children had converged upon the creature and slaughtered it slowly smashing it out of existence under sandals and sneakers and patentleather shoes the frogstomping had been the highlight of his birthday party for normally the children were not encouraged to kill living things later in the day they had turned their sights on him froggy number two all right back to bitty mallory picked up the stack of diaries shes a religious fanatic i think i guessed that what else can you tell me charles absendy stared at the stuffed toys on the bed the teddy bears were quite old a child bitty no doubt had loved the small leather noses off their faces rubbed them all away with kisses and then there was the little bird hiding beneath the bed a metaphor for its mistress who shared the trait of extreme timidity i cant believe this woman could kill anyone bitty of course not said mallory oh so casually it was the old woman who did the stabbing nedda winter confessed to the first cop on the scene charles turned his eyes heavenward he was not praying then why he paused a moment to dial back the frustration why did you put me through this invading this womans because shes a stalker no mallory thats not quite it try again i want you to talk to bitty smyth you said you didnt know her mallory stacked the journals on a closet shelf well now you do he shook his head but denial was futile you set me up she raised one eyebrow in a silent acknowledgment of yeah so you seriously expect me to make use of this womans personal diaries to interrogate her she wont talk to cops she just throws out quotations from the bible yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death given mallorys effect on the woman that might be its like biblical tourettes said mallory so just go down there and talk to her get her to open up i have no intention of you do it or i do it her tone implied a threat no cancel that it was a solid promise to do some damage to that fragile little woman downstairs bitty smyth was most likely in shock and mallory would be best described as sociopathic on a good day not that he adored her less for that and even understanding that emotional blackmail was mallorys idea of sport he said all right when the door had closed on the detective a small voice from the darkness beneath the bed said what charles looked down to see the bird emerge from its hiding place it limped badly on one leg and could not travel in a straight line but veered in curving paths and circles one of its wings was missing a full complement of flight feathers and the raggedy tail feathers dragging along behind the creature were more proof of a walking bird hence the cage on the floor to accommodate the handicap of being earthbound he picked up a bottle of pills the vitamin prescription of a veterinarian he had nearly guessed the birds name rags a second bottle of tablets carried the prescription of a doctor who catered to humans and this one was filled with sleeping pills he read the pharmacists date then shook the bottle out in his hand and counted the tablets all there for the past month bitty smyth had not required a sleep aid or had she been afraid to sleep the bolt on the bedroom door was a great sturdy thing thick as a steel cigar and it had the shiny look of a recent installation the woman was certainly afraid of something or someone detective riker wondered if miss winter knew how many mistakes she had made tonight he decided that a few of those errors must have occurred to her for their suspicion was mutual as they stared at one another across the kitchen table he smiled and she smiled well maam call me nedda unusual name and unforgettable to riker his younger brother was called ned but nedda was not the name that most people would know this woman by not even those old enough to remember the lurid tabloid stories though given names were often passed down through generations of a family he was certain of her identity now and he planned to bludgeon her with it later on maybe we can straighten out some of these loose ends said riker then well just pack up and get out of your life yeah like thats gonna happen he flipped through the pages of a small notebook as if he might need this reminder you had a breakin last week and tonight we find a body in your house after another breakin now the ice pick next to the body looks like he brought it with him but i shouldnt jump to that conclusion more pages flipped by lucky guess he looked up at her smiling face did i mention that the guy on your rug was charged with three counts of murder now what are the odds that we wrap up three homicides and a breakin with minimal paperwork you see we almost never get this kind of happy ending but we d be willing to buy it if the guy brought that ice pick into your house now heres the problem it looks expensive the trim is real silver doesnt really go with his ensemble does it the torn sweaty tshirt and all wheres your ice pick nedda we checked the wet bar in the front room no luck maybe you keep it in the kitchen no idea detective i rarely drink hard liquor so you wouldnt know if that was his ice pick or yours its a mystery she placed an ashtray on the table as an invitation for riker to pull out the pack of cigarettes that he had been longing for all night remembering his manners he first offered the pack to the lady you smoke she surprised him by accepting one then bending down to his match flame in answer to his question she inhaled deeply and blew a perfect smoke ring riker found her entirely too cool for a woman with a houseful of police and a dead body on her livingroom floor he finished his iced tea then casually perused the written statement that nedda winter had signed for the west side detectives maam does anybody else live in this house i dont see anything here about yes theres my sister her name is cleo wintersmyth rikers pen hovered over his open notebook is she one of those hyphenated people im afraid so my brother lionel lives here too but tonight theyre both at the summer house in the hamptons why dont we give em a call and ask where the ice pick is you could leave a message on their machine they never pick up the phone out there they have privacy issues riker turned toward the sound of heavy footsteps from the hallway he was surprised to see the head of forensics making a personal appearance heller a great bear of a man hovered in the doorway a babyfaced technician stood by his side and this was a new face a trainee the chief crimescene investigator had always taken great pride in the handson training of his crews this might explain his presence here tonight the man owed none of the detectives any favors that would warrant turning out for a pennyante burglary gone wrong heller remained in the hall as his new recruit entered the kitchen with a fingerprint kit the younger man was shaking his head and muttering why elimination prints the perps dead just do it kid hellers tone conveyed that he would deal with the youngsters attitude problem later he turned his back and ambled away down the hall the rookie opened his kit on the table then laid out his white cards an ink pad and a roller when he picked up miss winters right hand he treated it as an inanimate object without a word spoken no may i or excuse me ma am he bent over his work inking her thumb then rolling it across a small square on the card nedda winter looked up at the young mans face but the technician clearly did not see her she bowed her head in resignation understanding that she was invisible to him all but the fingers of her captive hand it was a revealing moment and not the response that riker would have predicted not at this posh address ensconced in a mansion this grande dame was accustomed to indifferent manhandling by minions and so he needed no psychiatrist to tell him that she had spent some time in an institution a long time prison or the nuthouse as her hand was being manipulated by the technician so carelessly impersonally the sleeve of her robe slipped down her right arm exposing a long and jagged welt of old scar tissue that told a story of a body torn to the bone riker rose quickly knocking over his chair as he turned on the crimescene technician let her alone tell heller i want someone else to do it when the younger man only gawked at him the detective yelled get outl bitty smyth sat alone in the dining room waiting for someone anyone to give her life direction or that was charles buders impression when he sat down on the other side of the table if he could caption the look on her face her unspoken words would be at last as if she had been expecting him for all of the thirty years that had passed since his tenth birthday party waiting in absolute faith that he would come im sorry she said the police dragging you here so late and all it was because of the pictures in my room wasnt it his one and only stalker seemed not at all embarrassed about the shrine in her bedroom and he wondered if this was a first warning sign he gravitated toward the possibility of a harmless almost magical fixation that would not interfere with the everyday function of her life he preferred this to the darker diagnosis of an obsessive psychotic for a moment he was lost in her eyes so large so dark the antithesis of his own small blue irises physically pulling away from her he sat well back in his chair it was his everyday job to observe people and pass judgments upon their mental wellbeing before marrying them to the proper think tanks but there was something at work here that was quite beyond him for the present her face was heart shaped he would not call it pretty and yet he was charmed by it and leaning toward her once more without understanding why perhaps magical thinking worked both ways tonight for he was reverting to his earlier impression of a pointedeared elf i cant imagine she said what the police must have thought of my little gallery of photographs yes the pictures he said im sure they assumed i was a friend of the family he handed her a business card for butler and company an earlier version of the card had born the name mallory and buder but nypd had ordered her to dissolve the business partnership in mallorys version of compliance she had removed her name from the stationery bitty smyth never glanced at the card i was at your birthday party in gramercy park i know said charles though he still had no memory of her granted she would be inclined to remember him the tallest boy the one with the beak of an eagle the eyes of a frog but he had been blessed with eidetic memory and he wondered how he could have forgotten her she would have been unusually small given her cameras low point of view when she had taken the party photograph all the other children had been normal size at least a head smaller than himself gradually he formed a portrait of a little person who did her best to blend into every wall she leaned against and now he imagined her as a little girl watching from behind the foliage of gramercy park hiding out the shy child and perhaps the only one not to take part in the incident of the unfortunate frog she leaned toward him wasnt it your uncle who did the magic show no he was my cousin max candle old enough to be my uncle though so hows paul forgive me if i dont recall the relationship was paul your my brother said bitty half brother we have the same father so now you look after your aunt is that right he wondered if she had forgotten to breathe for a moment why should her aunts health be a touchy subject im told theres a lot of medication in miss winters room i assumed you were yes you must have been talking to the medical examiner he wanted to give me a sedative but i cant swallow pills now what was i oh aunt nedda yes endstage cancer but she appeared to be in rather good health bitty lowered her eyes with a modest smile as if taking this as a personal compliment you should have seen her six months ago her skin was all yellow so she had a successful surgery something like that no and now he noticed something new in her eyes the pupils were dilating this was the unconscious tactic of a small child anxious to curry favor with an adult and it usually worked enhancing the unwitting adults concern and affection it was a childs act of selfpreservation carried into adulthood he wondered what other tactics she might have both instinctive and deliberate ones for negotiating her way through a forest of taller beings how do you account for your aunts recovery a miracle or the wrong diagnosis this was a trick question a trap and he wondered if she had guessed that she was staring at her bible reaching toward it and its pious explanations for all things miraculous but then she pushed it away electing not to play the biblethumping zealot not with him it occurred to him in that moment that the bible and the journals were props for an illusion rather like the trick of the eyes more survival tactics this intuition posed an ethical dilemma either this woman was more vulnerable than anyone imagined or she was a worthy adversary for mallory he decided to keep his silence if he guessed wrong mallory might shred this woman into pieces ah but what if he was right about bitty well in that event mallory would certainly shred her police from the west side precinct had gone and so had charles butler after bitty smyth had been shepherded off to the dining room only the csu technicians and their boss remained at the crime scene with mallory and the dead man the young detective looked past the foyer to the open door the assistant medical examiner stood on the front steps smoking a cigarette he looked her way then tapped his watch to remind her that his people were still waiting to collect the corpse she turned her back on him to make it clear that this was her dead body not his and now not hurrying any she strolled over to the foot of the stairs and slowly paced out the movements of nedda winter and her victim guided by the old womans statement mallory ended her pantomime of a killing by hunkering down at the dead mans side and running her fingers through his hair she waved to a technician standing by the foyer entrance kill the lights he did and now in the etiquette of sudden darkness no one moved or spoke streetlights glowed dully behind the drapes only silhouetting the technician standing before them all else was pitch black she could not even see the face of the man nearest her the dead man on the floor mallory smiled hellers voice boomed across the void i know what youre thinking kid she couldnt have done it in the dark yes she could and she did it was dark when she stabbed him the first time but not the second time but he was only stabbed one time dr morgan the medical examiner had come stealing back into the house and there was exasperation in every word theres only one entry wound one stabbed twice she said and now they had a game lights yelled mallory and there was light heller entered the kitchen carrying a fingerprint kit and settled his massive bulk into a chair beside nedda winter after introducing himself he smiled as he held out one hand for hers asking almost courtly may i who knew that heller was secretly a ladies man she smiled placing her veined and wrinkled hand in his then watched absently as the head of forensics did the grunt work of inking her index finger rolling it back and forth on a small white card he said sorry about the mess comes off easy enough taking prints is routine in a case like this no it isnt she said contradicting him without any trace of rancor okay call it a formality heller gently continued to make the black impressions on his fingerprint cards nothing to worry about maam unless youve got a record riker smiled to let her know that he was not serious and she smiled not buying into that for one minute he exhaled a blue cloud of cigarette smoke and stared at the window he might have been innocently inquiring about the weather outside when he asked you never murdered anyone did you nedda oh dont get me started detective well be here all night he liked sparring with this woman and he was gradually losing his awe of her though he had never been so close to a legend if his father only knew who he was sitting with right now and granddad how he wished that beloved old man had lived long enough to see this night we always fingerprint the householders said heller as if she had never called this a lie and called it right you see this is the way we eliminate no she said still smiling theres no need for elimination prints you dont care what he touched or we touched not in a burglary with a dead suspect she turned to riker sorry ive watched entirely too much television resignation was in her face when she turned his way she knew why the cops had come to her door and why they had stayed so long okay you got us said riker we lied about the prints but you can see why we got problems here he lit another cigarette and watched the smoke curl wondering if he could turn her suspicions around civilians have tv ideas about how this works when a good taxpayer like yourself kills a criminal type like our friend on the floor out there riker nodded in the direction of the crime scene down the hall you think the cops just show up as a courtesy they take the dead body off your hands maybe even clean up the mess for you then they write you an excuse note for a homicide he waved this idea away with one hand naw when we find a body with a pair of shears stuck in the chest we call it unnatural death doesnt matter if the victim is scum and believe me this guy would have to do some social climbing before we could call him anything as grand as scum but he still gets a full homicide investigation now first we had to figure out which cophouse owns the crime scene if the perp came to rob you then the case goes to robbery homicide division if not then it could go to the west side cops they showed up first and its their turf and then theres me and mallory we re from special crimes unit we might get the case cause we had a prior interest in the dead man so how many detectives are fighting over the body only one left standing out there heller turned his eyes to the hallway the body belongs to rikers partner mallory and i predicted that riker turned his face to neddas she was the catching detective on your dead mans three murders too bad we cant turn up your ice pick he watched nedda winters body relax as she slid back into a comfort zone believing that she was merely suspected of homicide yes i see the problem she said you have to be sure the pick belonged to him before you can close out the case as i said ive never had any use for an ice pick well its a big house said riker you got a maid or a housekeeper there was a livein housekeeper my niece bitty tried to save her soul and she ran away from home now my sister cleo deals with an agency they send different people every week done with the fingerprinting heller gently wiped the ink from her hands then filed his print cards away in an envelope he was working on the identifying labels when he and riker looked up to see bitty smyth hovering in the doorway asking with her eyes if she might enter come in dear said nedda this is mr heller and youve met detective riker for a moment riker believed that bitty might curtsy but instead she held out her bible as an offering voting him the most likely soul to be in need of religion its a gift she said when he failed to take it from her you are a christian are you not my church is finnegans and rikers religion revolved around sacramental bourbon and beer finnegans was the cop bar beneath his greenwich village apartment free drinks courtesy of his new landlord and barkeep made it a religious experience every night the tiny woman patted his head in the manner of rewarding a dog bitty said her aunt do you know where the ice pick is its on the floor beside the body no dear where is our ice pick the younger woman shook her head uncomprehending suddenly one pointing finger rose in the air as a divining rod and she walked in a straight line to a drawer beside the sink she pulled out an ice pick then placed it on the table in front of nedda and left the room heller followed after her fingerprint kit in hand and calling out maam miss smyth a minute please nedda winter studied the plain ice pick on the table its wooden handle was cracked and worn doesnt quite go with the silver ice bucket does it no maam it doesnt and he had already found this one during an earlier search of the kitchen rikers eyes were on the hallway when mallory paused just outside the door standing there in low conversation with the police photographer she moved on down the hall no doubt wanting pictures of a sewing room with no scissors he turned back to face nedda well keep looking till we find the other ice pick the good one if she took this as a threat and it was she showed no outward sign leaning toward riker speaking in her dry way she said our bitty is a soldier in the army of the lord in case that escaped your notice shes also very delicate i hope you dont see her as a woman who fancies dangerous men maybe lures them home so she can murder them i like your sense of humor nedda he had already surmised that if bitty the christian soldier were hanging nose to nose with a fruit fly the fly would beat the living crap out of her a shriek came from the front room and now bitty smyth was screaming no fingerprints no you cant do this riker watched kathy mallory passing the kitchen doorway again advancing on the front room with grim resolve he was already feeling sorry for the smaller weaker woman the little soldier was indeed delicate in mind and body oh yes there would be fingerprints and right now mallorys end of the conversation was not intelligible at this distance but riker could imagine the scene in the other room his partners attitude conjuring up a faint aroma from the sulfurs of hell and maybe a little smoke bittys eyes growing wide and wild no bitty smyth yelled i want a lawyer bitty smyth flitted about the room staring into every face silently begging for relief she avoided looking at mallory whose eyes were green neon signs with the words no mercy nedda winter entered the room followed by a more languid riker who hardly ever moved quite so fast as an old lady though mallory knew that her partner would not call this whitehaired woman old the litde lost girl of the nineteenforties would only be fifteen years his senior deserting her niece miss winter hurried past mallory and disappeared into a small powder room in the foyer every pair of eyes was on that closing door dazed by this abandonment even bitty smyth was quietly keeping watch when the old woman emerged she held a glass of water in her hand and moved toward her niece smiling extending the glass then holding it to bittys lips and urging her to drink big gulps dear everything is all right bitty smyth stole a glance at mallory then shook her head slowly from side to side to say that this could not be true ive already given them my fingerprints nedda winter settled her niece on the sofa theres no harm in letting them take yours heller pulled up a chair alongside the couch and gently took the tiny womans hand and kissed it well this was new the only one more startled than bitty was mallory the head of forensics was not only doing the work of underlings tonight but he was also in rare diplomatic form and mallory disapproved she preferred her interview subjects unhinged and easier to intimidate less work before heller had inked the third finger bitty smyths head lolled back on the upholstery and her eyes closed mallory turned on the older woman what did you put in that water a sedative miss winter opened her hand to show the label on the bottle this house almost qualifies as a pharmacy these belong to my sister cleo this civilian was surprisingly unruffled mallory decided to work on that while heller finished the fingerprinting process one of the medical examiners underlings returned to remind the detectives that the meat wagon was still waiting for the corpse mallory shot him a look to tell him that he should get out of here now nedda winter searched the remaining faces then turned to riker mr butler is gone yeah said riker it didnt take him long to check out the pictures in bittys room is he going to make any trouble for my niece i wouldnt be surprised mallory glanced at the small woman asleep on the sofa by law we had to warn him were really scrupulous about that when we find the stalker at a crime scene with a dead body my niece is harmless you really believe that mallory opened her blazer pausing a beat to display a very large gun and her authority in this room im surprised her hand passed over the weapon to dip into an inside breast pocket she produced a wrinkled sheet of paper i found this in your bedroom wastebasket its the same line written over and over again crazy people make sane people crazy mallory glanced at the small sleeper on the couch was bitty getting on your nerves the older woman looked as if she had just been slapped mallory edged closer need to take a pill miss winter i saw all that medication in your room im fine thank you sit down said mallory indicating a chair close to the corpse nedda winter shook her head defying a direct order and electing to stand ive been sitting for too long with a slight lift of one shoulder she said you know old bones and so her dignity remained intact for the moment really mallory made a wide circle around miss winter forcing the woman to revolve the medical examiner says youre in very good shape for your age good hearing and coordination no confusion at all now dr morgan thought that was strange considering all of your meds he said the high doses shouldve created massive confusion bordering on dementia but youre pretty sharp thank you once more mallory looked down at the sleeping niece does bitty know that you flush all those pills every day she noted just the barest inclination of nedda winters head a small gesture of congratulation and now this old woman must understand that rikers interrogation had been merely a friendly little warmup showtime and your color surprised dr morgan too according to your niece your skin turned yellow in the end stage of cancer but now you look entirely too healthy mallory stopped circling her interview subject they stood toetotoe can you explain that doctorpatient confidentiality said the old woman the state of my health isnt open to police scrutiny wrong mallory turned her back on the older woman i can ask you anything i want and that was true she could legally ask and now we go over the holes in your statement until i hear something believable you might want to sit down now this could take all night and with this more polite invitation this consideration for her comfort yeah right nedda winter did sit down but this was not the advantage that mallory sought she had wanted subservience and all she got was tolerance miss winters head was level and regal she would not strain by one bare inch to look up at her adversary the detective moved behind the woman leaning down close to her ear and saying i like money motives mallory rounded the chair in time to catch the trace of a smile i never touched the mans wallet said nedda winter i did he had a lot of cash but you told the responding officer there was none missing from the wall safe you were positive about that she signaled riker to bring in the patrolman waiting outside on the steps after sitting down in an armchair on the other side of the corpse she proceeded to ignore the old woman turning all her attention to the pages of a small notebook the young officer entered the front room he smiled at miss winter and one finger tapped the visor of his hat in a mock salute mallory caught his eye and with a look that promised something nasty she put an end to all that friendliness he stood at attention all properly lined up on the side of mallory and the law the detective turned back to her notes saying you remember officer brill dont you he shows up for all of your breakins yes i remember him but that first one was only an attempted burglary mallory kept her eyes on the notebook according to officer brill your relatives were out of town for that one too what a coincidence she looked up at the staircase and the small device well concealed in the woodwork oh and the tape cassette is missing from your security camera another coincidence dont look at officer brill hes not a friend of the family hes with us but not for much longer with only a nod she sent the man back to his post outside the front door nedda followed the young officer with her eyes clearly sorry to see him go well start over mallory accepted a yellow pad from riker then pulled out a pen and clicked it absently you said you stabbed the burglar with the scissors click click yes miss winter pulled a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of her robe this makes the fourth confession of the evening i stabbed him with the scissors but his weapon said mallory the ice pick thats jours dont waste my time making me prove it click click click click i never said it wasnt mine she shook a cigarette loose from the pack i only said i couldnt identify it and now she searched her pockets for a light maybe he found it here in the house in the dark according to your statement the lights were off you didnt turn the lights on until it was all over how could he find that ice pick in a strange house in the dark click click click click click i believe i saw a small flashlight on the floor by the yeah a penlight riker stepped forward with a lit match for her cigarette that was his we found his fingerprints on the case and the batteries the dead batteries mallory leaned forward while youre changing your statement some advice dont fool with the lights okay if the lights had been on he wouldve pulled his knife and youd be the dead body on the floor tonight she leaned down to raise one pants leg of the corpse and exposed the long hunting knife in a leather holster strapped to his leg now the old woman was taken by surprise but it passed quickly you see the problem miss winter too many weapons if he had a knife why would he waste time hunting for a all right i lied after i realized that he was dead and he had no weapon well none that i could see i put the ice pick in his hand i thought it might make the police more sympathetic but it was dark i was afraid for my life thats the only thing youve said that i believe im sorry i misled you mallory looked down at her notes again as if the next question mattered not at all to her are you sorry enough to take a polygraph exam yes of course if you wish thats good said riker now explain this he held up a small plastic bag to the light of the chandelier so that she could clearly see the key inside we found dirt in the front door lock and we found this key in the potted plant on the stairs outside our boy put it back after he opened the door didnt you wonder why the alarm went off for last weeks burglary but not tonights he nodded toward the corpse this guy knew the code to turn off the alarm you know what that means we have an endless parade of temporary help i suppose one of them set us up for a robbery no that doesnt work for me mallory nudged the corpse with the toe of her running shoe someone wants you dead miss winter this man was a murderer not a burglar he grabbed his victims off the street never broke into a house before and he didnt break into this one either so tell me who benefits from your death my death would make no difference to anyone riker stared at the little woman on the couch bitty smyth had begun to snore so maybe your niece is the target now that should make you real eager to help us out with this investigation and if you dont said mallory we ve got you for tampering with evidence obstruction of a homicide investigation and making false statements to the police does that worry you my medication causes confusion said nedda winter throwing the young detectives own words back at her and there go your charges nice try said mallory but that only tells me youve got secrets thatll get you killed you or your niece what about your brother and sister they were out of town for both breakins nothing odd about that lionel and cleo spend most of their time out of town mallory left her chair to stand over the unconscious bitty smyth her long red nails grazed the sleeping womans hair does bitty know secrets too let me put it another way would you trust your niece with a secret nedda winter rose to stand beside the detective the cigarette tightly clutched in her hand had gone dark and smokeless and now she broke it in half mallory never took her eyes off bitty smyth her hostage in this interview all the doors in this house have oldfashioned locks and keyholes except for your nieces bedroom shes got a dead bolt and a slide bolt your brother and sister are always out of town why she looked up at nedda winter is your whole family afraid of you riker stepped forward to deliver the blow that he had been waiting for all night long mind if i call you red nedda winter smiled perhaps in relief now that it was finally out red winter was the title of a painting she said my portrait once my hair was red but red was never my name bitty smyth woke in the night but not in her bed the windows of the front room were looming rectangles of dull light there was no other detail to be seen by touch she recognized the knitted afghan that always draped the sofa her aunt must have covered her with it as she lay sleeping bitty pulled it up to her chin taking a little comfort from this thin protection of wool and now she played the childhood game of ferreting out the monsters in the shadows a dark silhouette passed by one window the shadow of someone inside the house she held her breath and heard whispers of a silk robe and slippered feet it was aunt nedda straight and tall marching back and forth an aged sentry pausing at each window to part the drapes and look outside but the aunts form and face were lost in the dark and so the shadow prevailed on bittys imaginings old monsters never died chapter chief medical examiner edward slope might have been taken for a military man as he walked down the hall to his office he had a stride that bordered on a march and his face had all the animation of a granite war monument the doctor was an early riser though he had minions a small army of them he was always the first to report for work he cherished the quiet hours of daybreak when the dead were content to wait until he had finished the newspaper and the living would not intrude upon him while his coffee was still hot if there was a god then one of the assistant medical examiners could crack open the first corpse of the morning and he might get caught up on a backlog of files but first a little solitude he unlocked the door to his office with a plan to work on the times crossword puzzle or not kathy mallory was asleep in his chair well this put a lie to detective rikers theory that she slept hanging by her heels like a bat while her uncivilized eyes were closed she looked rather like a child napping after a busy tour of duty on a homicide squad and a bit of illegal trespass a velvet pouch holding bright bits of metal lay open upon his desk blotter poor baby apparently sleep had overtaken her before she could put her lock picks away oh surprise number two her eyes snapped open in the mechanical fashion of a doll or a robot there was no middle gear of rousing from sleep and dreams she was simply awake and this lent credence to his own theory that she had an onoff switch good morning kathy mallory she said reminding him of the rules she liked the chilly distance of formality well isn t that just too bad he had known her as kathy since she was ten years old though she had insisted at the time that she was twelve his oldest friend louis markowitz had bargained her down to the more realistic age of eleven so that he could complete the paperwork for her foster care eleven in a pigs eye but who could discern the true age of a homeless child who was also a gifted liar and worse she was the fault in the doctors personal myth of himself as an intractable man upon the death of her foster father killed in the line of duty edward slope had tried to fill that void loving her enough for two but he was no pushover and this business of breaking into his office well he was not about to let that slide he reached across the desk to grab her lock picks planning to use them as a showandtell exhibit while he lectured her on the lock picks were gone she had pocketed them in a sleight of hand and the doctor knew this drill all too well if he had no evidence of her illegal entry then there had been no crime that she would own up to kathy mallory laid her hands flat on the desk her desk now how she loved these little hieratic strategies of furniture and psychological leverage i need an autopsy all the trimmings get in line slope settled into one of the visitors chairs it might take a few days he opened his newspaper her cue to leave as if that ever worked ill have dr morgan determine the no it has to be you she was almost petulant it has to be now you dont have the rank to make that kind of a request he said tacking on kathy just for fun mallory she said insistent she held up a stack of photographs then fanned them like a deck of cards and dealt them out one by one just like her old man louis markowitz had been a portly soul with hounddog jowls and a charming way about him charm had never been an option for kathy and yet every now and then the doctor fancied that he found traces of lou lingering on in his foster child sometimes a gesture or a phrase briefly put lous daughter knew how to manipulate him even though he was fully aware of her calculation this deliberate and casual way she had of breaking his heart he played along every time the doctor leaned forward to examine the crimescene photographs torso shots all of them and every camera angle showed a pair of scissors driven into the victims chest good aim he said no hesitation marks hardly any blood loss so it was a quick death but you already knew that truly he was intrigued by the request for a full autopsy but he could not simply ask her a direct question their relationship had the strict parameters of a duel and now as he leaned back in his chair he was even more generous with his sarcasm so you had some doubt about what killed this man no but it wasnt the scissors she wore the only smile in her limited store of expression that was not forced it was the smile that said gotcha in the early gray light of her bedroom nedda winter lay very still not even drawing a breath waiting for the panic to subside it was always alarming to open her eyes and find herself alone and how quiet it was she had lived too many years with constant companions never awakening in any normal sense but ripped from sleep with the early morning orchestra of a onenote moaner in the next bed and beyond that one the screamers bed and a chorus of harpies singing an angry song of shut up shut the hell up or nursey nursey im cold im wet nedda had played the audience for them staring vacantly in the direction of their noise and wondering how she would get through another day her nights had been whiled away with plans for her own slow death but that was over now she had a new plan and something to live for her heart settled into a normal rhythm and her gaze calmly roved over the daisy pattern on the centuryold wallpaper the flowers had been yellowed with age generations before she was born all the other bedrooms of the house had been repapered in her absence here nothing had changed the furniture was the same just as she had left it when she was twelve years old except for the trunk that once sat at the foot of her bed all of the winter children had had such trunks by custom of the house hers had probably been consigned to the attic when she was assumed to be dead otherwise this might be like any morning from her childhood only the music was missing she reached out to her bedside table and turned on the old radio it was tuned to a station that played only jazz her fathers favorite music for as far back as memory would take her when quentin winter was alive trumpets and piano riffs had filled this house day and night loudest in the party hours mellow saxophones had dominated at the break of a new day and toward midmorning daddy had played the blues as background music for his hangovers nedda pulled on her robe and entered the bathroom where her eyes bypassed that strange old woman in the mirror she looked down at the wide array of pharmacy bottles lined up on the sink one by one she flushed her morning doses down the toilet the medication had been prescribed for an illness that she had never had and now she watched the tablets swirling around the toilet bowl what luxury this was after all the years of picking up the pills that other patients had spit out then ingesting them tasting other peoples bile and inheriting their diseases and sundry germs how difficult it would be to make anyone understand that this slow attempt at suicide had been the act of a sane woman now in the absence of any medication she was getting stronger every day disappointing her brother and sister barefoot she left her room on the other side of the door she met her dead stepmother on the day of the massacre in the manner of a puppeteer memory worked alice winters limbs and the pretty woman crossed the threshold of the bedroom to rouse another version of nedda young nedda with the long red hair the house itself had been drowsing running off the low batteries of nine sleepy children on a sunday morning as nedda started down the staircase her father with only a few more hours to live was climbing toward her fiftyeight years ago she had stood on tiptoe to kiss him in passing now she simply watched him go by in his silk pajamas and dressing gown what a beautiful man he was long fair hair like a prince from another age he was holding a glass with the foulsmelling ingredients of his hangover cure the disembodied voice of billie holiday wafted up the stairs behind him dogging him from the phonograph below and moaning the blues to daddy in the next century nedda completed her descent to the parlor floor where bitty was a childsize lump beneath the afghan on the sofa she sat down in a chair beside her sleeping niece and waited a few minutes passed before the younger woman sensed another presence in the room small hands gripped the afghan and her eyes opened cagey at first only looking through slits for signs of danger aunt nedda was there just a touch of fear in bittys voice yes and nedda winced good morning dear i was just curious what did you do with the tape from the security camera the police were asking about it i put it where theyd never want to look bitty fumbled with the afghan then produced her bible from the folds of wool and opened it oh not a book at all the bible was a clever box and nestled inside a rectangular compartment was the videotape the morgue attendant from the graveyard shift was not at his desk the chief medical examiner was about to ask kathy mallory what she had done with the poor mans body but then the double doors swung open and ray fallon appeared alive if not well he was nervous kathy had that effect on him and sweating from recent exertion after handing a deli bag to the detective the attendant was tipped lavishly but not thanked not that fallon cared so eager was he to get away from her mens room he said to his boss and slope knew that the man would not be back again until kathy had left the premises you sent him out for your breakfast the doctor affected the lecture mode that he used when he suspected her of cheating at cards if you think im going to tolerate i had to get rid of him she dug into the brown paper bag and pulled out a bagel i cant afford any leaks on this case and hes the worst you know you shouldve fired that weasel years ago this was her very best trick reversal of guilt and he should have seen it coming because she was right kathy mallory bit into her bagel with her free hand she pulled out the metal drawer where she kept her own personal corpse the victim was still encased in the body bag and there was no attendant paperwork attached none of her crimescene photos had included any body parts above or below the torso and now she pulled back the zipper to give the pathologist his first look at the face its willy roy boyd ah said slope your ladykiller so given his current condition dead im guessing that you lost your temper when he made bail her strip show continued downward until she had exposed the pair of scissors sticking out of the mans chest point taken he said not your style if kathy had inflicted this wound the scissors would have been placed more symmetrically and at a perfect right angle to the flesh she was peculiar that way compulsively neat the doctor unzipped the rest of the body if i were to roll him over would i see any other signs of trauma no she said thats not it and the game went on he checked the dead mans eyes and fingernails no obvious indication of poison he stared at the chest those shears make a hell of an entry wound i wouldve expected more blood right he was dead when the scissors went in but dr morgan didnt catch that he said the scissors contained the bleeding like a stopper in a bottle in defense of his young and unseasoned possibly incompetent medical examiner dr slope said well thats one possibility like hell it was hers was the more likely explanation the dead man was thin his chest concave and the shears went deep one did not rupture the human heart so neatly not with a weapon of this size and thickness ill know for sure after the chest is cracked so you dont think he was stabbed to death of course he was stabbed to death the perverse brat paused a moment to relish this small win the look of surprise in his eyes she pointed to the chest and thats the only entry wound edward slope had to smile he was the one who had taught her this twisted game the student was surpassing the master kathy mallory picked through the dead mans hair finding something she liked she said see this spot of blood on the scalp slope adjusted his glasses as he leaned over the corpse yes and heres another one on the upper lip so small and this drop on his shirt one red fingernail marked the spot thats three drops total and none of the blood is where youd expect to find it if the shears had killed him its a backstrike splatter so the wound was made with something smaller thinner she leaned down to rifle her knapsack and pulled out a bag tagged by forensics it contained an ice pick i like this for the primary weapon i want his stomach contents i want to know what he ate for his last meal and where he ate it i want a screen for drugs if hes a user i need to know when he got his last fix and i want stop the doctor put one hand up in the manner of a traffic cop first things first a few drops of backstrike blood doesnt prove it was an ice pick i cant even corroborate a second weapon ive told you a hundred times textbook scenarios dont even get close to the spectrum of trauma i see on my dissection table i didnt work this out by reading a book she opened the evidence bag and held it close to his face sniff that no need the odor of bleach was strong someone cleaned it she turned over the evidence bag to show him the white residue of a price tag peeled from the bottom of the pick handle its brand new a perfectly smooth surface heller says even without the bleach his luminal wouldnt pick up any blood on the metal but this is the weapon it fits with the backstrike blood you know who killed him too an old lady good said slope finding this only fitting since willy roy boyd had murdered three women and now he better understood police concerns about leaks to the newspapers he envisioned the headline old lady kills ladykiller kathy mallory parted the hair on the dead mans scalp this drop runs horizontally the woman said they were both standing when she stabbed him and blood ran down not sideways so either the law of gravity has changed or the old woman lied no i believed that part he was on his feet when she stabbed him the first time but he was down and dead when she pulled out the pick and that explains the drop of blood in a horizontal streak the doctor nodded and then the shears were pushed into a prone corpse he smiled congratulations now you can nail an old lady for mutilating a corpse but hes just as dead either way and hardly worth the trouble of i want that autopsy i need proof that the ice pick killed him any idea why this woman would go to the trouble of planting a second weapon yes but youre not going to share no of course not what was i thinking so obviously you want evidence to dispute her claim of selfdefense no that holds up she said willy roy boyd was a onetrick pony he was in that house last night to kill a woman though edward slopes brain had stripped a few gears he was damned if he would let it show the doctor stared at her with his best poker face but hers was better endgame kathy mallory had won a full autopsy by the chief medical examiner for now that he had been suckered in what were the odds that he would let anyone else touch this corpse waiting for the explosion boys the upper half of the wall was a wide window on the squad room and with the blinds open lieutenant coffeys private office was a damned goldfish bowl on view for fifteen pairs of eyes he pretended not to notice the men beyond the glass as they covertly looked his way the lieutenant was young for a command position only thirtysix but he was aging fast to fit the job stress had chiseled new lines into his face giving him an expression of constant pain and just now it was a fight to bite back a scream as three detectives brazenly walked up to the glass the better to observe their boss the poor bastard with the thinning brown hair the tension headaches and a knottedup gut the case load for special crimes unit had spiraled out of control and the new mayor a man with the soul of a corporate raider was planning to cut the departments allotment in manpower and funds every day was run at a heartattack pace and yet jack coffey was showing no early warning signs that this was the worst possible time to jerk him around nor had he raised his voice to mallory and riker who sat unmolested on the other side of his desk he was not even holding a gun on them and the other detectives must find that odd when he glanced at the glass wall again he saw money flashing out there in the squad room bastards they were making book on this meeting never let the troops see you crying like a little girl that was his mantra today riker and mallory were on their best behavior this morning quietly waiting for him to finish scanning another precincts report on a common burglary gone awry he crumpled the cover sheet in one hand well this was just great this crap why would these two detectives drag this case home to an elite squad of firstgrade gold shields mallory close the blinds this was a test and he was gratified to see her do it and so quickly not even dragging it out to jack up his frenzy big mistake mallory now he knew that all the leverage in this room belonged to him better than that with the blinds drawn and no witnesses he could do whatever he liked with these two he leaned forward and gave them his most benign smile to knock them off balance the partners exchanged looks that clearly said oh shit so they wanted this case really bad well tough but he just had to know why he pulled one sheet out of the pile of paperwork the results of the fingerprint search they had requested youll be happy to know that neither one of your socialites has a criminal record what a surprise huh he also crumpled this paper into a ball and tossed it over one shoulder then picked up a collection of forms that transferred the dead man to his own doorstep and this makes it official weve been screwed in triplicate he took his time crushing these sheets into another ball he bounced it off the back wall after spreading out the remaining paperwork he selected two sheets from the array well what have we got here could his sarcasm be more obvious did he need to work on that im looking at two witness statements one from a little old lady eighty years thats a typo said mallory nedda winters only seventy and shes at least as tall as mallory said riker maybe an inch over she said yeah said riker make that fiveeleven coffey glared at his detectives then looked down at the paperwork saying and next we have a shitpile of biblical quotations from bitty smyth a fortyyearold woman of undeterminedheight he paused to glance at mallory just jump right in if i get anything else wrong okay his true message to her delivered only by the tone of his voice was you speak you die the lieutenant turned to his senior detective whose face was always easier to read so riker the catching detectives agreed with you they figured it for a staged crime scene fair enough hellers report backs them up but the old lady explained that in her statement she was afraid the cops wouldnt be very understanding if she d killed an unarmed burglar so she put the ice pick in his hand jack coffey leaned back in his chair and clasped his hands behind his head well i say no harm done she gets to slide on that one i may even send her roses for killing that butcher he swiveled his chair to face mallory im surprised that nedda winter isnt your new best friend willy roy boyd was your perp you think a quick death was too good for that little freak would you rather wait out years of appeals before the state put him down with a needle that old woman lied about the miss winter gets away with everything mallory coffey picked up the amended statement and scanned the lines for the one he wanted she says her medication causes confusion ah bless her riker flashed a smile at mallory nedda was good wasnt she jack coffey was not amused maybe you guys shouldve brought her in here to do your talking for you i called the old lady myself it took me five minutes to queer the idea of an inside job she said there was always a spare key in the planter outside the front door and she couldnt remember setting the burglar alarm last night so much for our perp turning off the alarm with a security code she also solved your problem with the missing videotape a patrol cop named brill took it out of the security camera coffey looked down at his personal notes that was last week after an attempted breakin the cop returned it to bitty smyth but she never got around to reloading the camera the ladies figure the housekeeper tossed out the videotape with the trash the lieutenant picked up mallorys report but never bothered to read it he preferred to make up his own more accurate summary now the catching detectives couldnt fob the case off on robbery homicide and why not because those guys had the brains to bow out early then while you two have your backs turned the west side dicks skate out the door and leave their mess in your lap now i know the two of you couldve dumped this case on another squad if youd only tried harder and talked faster youve got thirty minutes to do the paperwork and close it out as justifiable homicide jack coffey was shuffling all the reports and statements into a neat stack when mallory leaned forward trouble theres more to it she said west side screwed up willy roy boyd was hired for a murder its all there she said pointing to her own report the one he had never read it all fits talk fast mallory the west side precinct has no volume in homicides she said they looked at the same evidence and came up clueless if we just write this one off then one of those women dies not so fast said coffey no he was not getting stuck with this lame case if you guys are right about murder for hire and he was not conceding this why wouldnt the ladies ask for police protection he turned to riker for his answer mallory jumped in two other people live in that house the old ladys sister and brother they were conveniently out of town for the attempted breakin last week and they werent home last night either even if you were onto something and coffey doubted that its still not a case for special crimes the department has a task force for that kind of its not a mob hit said mallory and its not gang related willy roy boyd wasnt connected that way but he had an expensive lawyer for his bail hearing and the bail bond cost him a fortune hes got no assets no job but his wallet was full of hundreddollar bills he was hired to kill one of those women if we dont work this case no one else will and your partner collects icepick murders said coffey you left that out this was no joke his detectives had not been invited to last nights party on the upper west side he knew that riker had been tipped to the aspect of the ice pick over time word had come back to jack coffey mentions of his senior detective turning up at crime scenes in every borough where an ice pick was the murder weapon special crimes had only handled one such case only one standout among the more common murders via muggings and domestic disputes no matter how ordinary the crime riker had been a faithful visitor at every scene all his working life and no one knew the reason why coffey had to ask or he would have blown out his teeth trying to hold it back if riker would only answer him the man could keep this damn homicide the lieutenants only other consideration was the possible embarrassment of having a taxpayer drop dead after the case was closed out why ice picks riker he doesnt have any normal hobbies said mallory betraying impatience with coffeys little side trip the lieutenant was a second away from slapping her with a charge of insubordination when her partner spoke up i collect icepick cases said riker because my father did my grandfather collected them too i need a little more than that said coffey and he was surprised by his own lack of sarcasm willy roy boyd was hired by amateurs said riker but maybe he was killed by a pro somebody who had a little practice with a pick maybe the ladies werent the only ones in the house last night a pro the lieutenant was incredulous at this escalation from a nice old lady to a professional assassin a pro with an ice pick he shook his head slowly from side to side oh no this was the age of miracles and wonders longrange rifle sights equipped with infrared devices that could see in the damn dark no contract hitman has used an ice pick since the forties and theres one old case still on the books mass murder said mallory how would you like to wrap nine unsolved homicides this week oh jesus freaking christ jack coffey could not find the words to toss these two out of his office the partners politely waited for him to find his voice again he did he slammed his fist down on the desk no this is not happening riker tell me shes not talking about stick man mallory answered for riker special crimes unit would get all the credit and we need good press right now the timing is perfect she tacked on the reminder its budgetcutting season ordinarily these would be the magic words but not today jack coffey feeling slightly giddy covered his face with both hands worrying that tics or twitches might betray his image of a man in control of this meeting mallory of all people should never have bought into this fantasy of a superannuated psycho from the last century she was more jaded better rooted in reality any cop could imagine the horror show of her childhood on the streets of new york dodging kiddy pimps and pedophiles ending every day in the exhaustion of a childs poverty then chasing down some place where she could be safe for a few hours where she might close her eyes to sleep still feral in many ways she was suspicious of everyone she met and everything she was told her belief in a ghost story intrigued him more than rikers a fair detective in his own right coffey had worked through the puzzle in the very next minute these two were holding something back a bombshell there was no other explanation riker do you have any idea how old stick man would be today well yeah the mans tone indicated that this might be a silly question since he was the expert on all things related to icepick homicides all right let me see if i understand this the lieutenant uncovered his tired eyes to look at riker youre planning to reopen the winter house massacre have i got that right the man only shrugged to say yeah thats about right and his partner was busy inspecting her running shoes for smudges jack coffey shook his head riker youve got two minutes of my time give me the rest or get out okay the old lady you talked to this morning that was red winter of course it was jack coffey wore that special smile reserved for dealing with lunatics i should have guessed his smile never wavered though his teeth were locked together and grinding so when you asked red winter where she d been for the past sixty years fiftyeight years said mallory she was twelve when she disappeared shes seventy now shut up said coffey he only had eyes for his senior detective well sure said riker we asked where shed been but she just yawned and went upstairs to bed left us to lock up the house with one angry sweep of his hand coffey wiped his desk of papers and sent them flying to the floor he was on the verge of the explosion his squad had been waiting on betting on and now he realized that he was still smiling actually grinning not a good sign not a healthy sign mallory bent low to pick up the scattered papers around her chair we got the medical examiner to lose the id on willy roy boyd for a week she was already assuming that he would believe the most ludicrous story ever told within these walls we have to keep a low profile she said collecting the sheets and stacking them neatly on the edge of the desk then bending down for others the reporters cant get near this story she settled back into her chair to concentrate on aligning all the edges of every sheet it might be better if the rest of the squad didnt i wont tell a soul said jack coffey and he would not no more than he would run naked through the streets scattering rosebuds along the way he continued to smile feeling oddly calm he just needed a little time was all that and a bottomless bottle of jack daniels most of all he needed to make these two detectives disappear so much depended on that his sanity his stomach lining and what was left of his hair though the blinds were closed he could sense the troops massing out there pressing up against the glass tensing waiting for him to crack wide open any minute now you got seventytwo hours said coffey i dont expect to see your faces for three days got that he very much wanted to lay his head down on the desk and bang it a few times but his detectives were still seated in their chairs perhaps not fully comprehending that they had gotten away with this leave he said now and leave they did they left the door open unfortunately and he heard a snatch of their conversation riker asked his partner where to now we re going to mess up a lawyer she said thats my girl money was changing hands in the squad room but the lieutenant no longer cared who had won or lost this round he knew mallory was going after the lawyer who had won a bail hearing against all odds for a cockroach who had murdered three women the high school student boyds youngest victim had been closer to a child jack coffey had been the one to break the news to her parents to show them the morgue photograph of their daughters face a shot framed to expose the features least bruised and broken the mother had touched the photo caressing it with her ringers then rubbing the glossy surface as if desperately trying to break through that artificial dimension to get to her only child both parents had cried the morale of the squad had gone down when that serial killer had walked out free on bail spitting on the sidewalk and spitting on the law the timing had been a gift from hell the very hour of the schoolgirls burial and so the lieutenant gave no thought to blowback from mallorys upcoming confrontation finally he understood why she needed jurisdiction on the dead body of willy roy boyd she wanted payback coffey wondered if mallory would go after the defense attorneys testicles there were some things in life that were worth his rank and pension neutering a lawyer was high on the list he picked through the cards on his rolodex until he found the number for the parents of boyds last victim he would call them first and tell them that the man who had destroyed their lives was dead stabbed to death by an elderly woman they might find some just irony in that no they would cry nedda winter pulled back the sheer white drape of the front window for a better view of the old rollsroyce once it had been her fathers car and now it belonged to her brother a dozen suitcases were disgorged from the cars trunk tall lionel sixtynine on his last birthday handled the bags with surprising ease though he did this service grudgingly for most or all of the luggage would belong to his sister cleo wintersmyth bittys description of the summer house in the hamptons filled its closets and drawers with her mothers clothing and cleos room upstairs was packed with more designer dresses like the one that she wore now so why this spectacle of suitcases what was the point of two houses if one could not travel lightly from one to the other without taking her eyes from the window nedda spoke to the small woman behind her theyre here bitty she glanced back at her niece who was still holding the bible go up to your room if you like ill deal with them this arrangement was very agreeable to her niece who stole up the staircase with exaggerated stealth perhaps on the off chance that cleo and lionel could hear escaping footsteps through the solid walls of the house nedda turned her eyes back to the sidewalk activity her brother stood beside the car shaking his head he was refusing to lug the suitcases up the stairs lionel put two fingers to his lips and whistled the doorman from the neighboring condominium came running smiling as a dog would smile if it only could money changed hands and lionel slipped behind the wheel of the rolls and drove off to the parking garage leaving his sister to supervise the doorman who gathered up her bags cleo looked up at the parlor window saw her elder sister standing there then quickly looked away this was only one small slight of many nedda understood she might never be forgiven for coming home again though cleo and lionel had been to town only a week ago nedda was amazed anew each time she saw her sister and brother these chic people so little affected by time in her early sixties cleo appeared closer in age to her fortyyearold daughter there was not a single strand of gray in the perfectly coiffed ash blond hair and her flesh was suspiciously smooth and firm nedda let the drape fall then sank down to the window seat the front door opened and the foyer was filled with the sound of dueling accents american diva and spanish immigrant the doorman was making short work of the bags stacking them inside the door while cleo surveyed the front room checking for signs of sudden death or would she be more concerned with possible breakage cleo turned to her sister with a vacuous smile one might call it professional the way a stewardess can smile at her passengers though she hates them and hopes they will die you look wonderful your colors so much better the yellow cast had passed off months ago in the hospice where neddas siblings had expected her to pass away from natural causes fooled you all so sorry i never meant to but youre still a little pale nedda you really must get some sun and fresh air well have to get you out to the hamptons one day the sisters both knew that day would never come there would be too many questions from the long island neighbors it was so much easier to hide embarrassing relatives in the more anonymous city and now small talk exhausted they fell into a silence awkward for nedda easy for her sister when the doorman had lugged the last suitcase indoors he learned to his dismay that he had not yet earned his money not until he carried them up the stairs to a bedroom he looked up at the winding steps and up and up shaking his head in denial finally the job was done and her brother had returned from the garage on the next block lionel preened for a moment before a mirror running one tanned hand through hair as white as her own her brother could still be called a handsome man and surprisingly youthful in the way that a waxwork can never age so this was what sixtynine years looked like in the twentyfirst century nedda rarely consulted a mirror on her own account for she was a different creature now and no such comparison to her former self was possible though she had made good use of the thirdfloor gymnasium the treadmill and the weights would not give her back any of the time she had lost she was marked by the wrinkles and stitched up scars of a difficult life not so for lionel and cleo nedda had returned to find her siblings well preserved in the amber of younger days every creature so preserved was dead and still the simile held true there was no life in their dark blue eyes dead eyes flies in the amber neddy was all that lionel said to her by way of a greeting she could see that it irked him to slip and call her neddy but he had never known her by any but that childhood name in a cruel departure from a goodnatured boy of eleven lionel the man reminded her of their father now quentin winter had been a cold one too it had been said of daddy in his youth that he left footprints of ice across the floor of a warm room on a summer day she recalled lionel as a child of five following his father about in the month of july to see if this was true in part it was she turned to her sister always searching cleos face for evidence of the child she had been up to the age of five young cleo had danced through the average day always in motion to music that had played round the clock a laughing child who had no bones who moved to the beat of drums and cornets with fluid joy daddys little boogie woogie wunderkind had never been able to pronounce this mouthful and so she had been called jitterbug by one and all but nedda never forgot herself and called her sister by this old pet name it was unsuitable now for cleo had become somewhat stiff on several levels nedda wondered how she was remembered by her siblings she shuddered and this thought passed off like a chill lionel walked to the center of the carpet was it here bitty wasnt all that clear on the phone yes thats where the man died nedda turned from one sibling to the other saying charles buder was here last night did bitty tell you that cleo broke into a rare wide smile the frog prince no bitty never said a word and now something dark had occurred to her no doubt linked to the shrine in bittys room the woman sat down more solemn in her tone saying my god did the police see the nedda nodded and they brought charles buder here they showed him the shrine in bittys room yes he saw it lionel and cleo turned to one another to hold one of their eerie conversations of the eyes it was something akin to the madeup languages of small children bonding in secret alliance against the adult herself this time it was easy for her to guess the content of their discussion and in answer to their unspoken question she said the police believe that bitty was stalking mr butler charles butler said lionel wasnt he one of the gramercy park butlers yes dear said cleo the keeper of the social register charles is the last one but there havent been any butlers in gramercy park for ages he lives in soho of all places he owns an apartment building there trust cleo to know the details of wealthy families who would not take her phone calls and the environs where she was not welcome the winter family had fallen away from polite society long before the massacre charles butler said cleo bitty mustve been thrilled and by inflection she conveyed the opposite meaning well we must do something before this business gets out of hand ill call bittys father sheldon will know how to handle it oh christ said lionel at this mention of his erstwhile brotherinlaw the attorney did the police take bitty away both faces turned to nedda they were almost twins in expressing the horror of publicity she shook her head and stood with them in cold silence the natural state of their every reunion until a movement in one of the many mirrors caught her eye nedda turned around to see her niece slowly coming down the grand staircase hesitating now eyes wide and wondering if it was safe yet bitty had never outgrown a childs stature and a childs issues the cowering deference to her mother and her uncle and yet one day brave as any knight this tiny woman had marched into a hellhole and plucked nedda out of it soul and all hello dear kiss kiss said cleo in lieu of actual affection for her daughter ive decided that we have a small dinner party tonight i think i can arrange for the frog prince to come bittys feet were frozen in place on the last step and one hand drifted to her heart as if her mother had shot her there yes dear said cleo your beloved charles butler wont that be nice bitty nodded meekly then turned away from them and crept back up the stairs lieutenant coffey was enjoying a rare hour of calm two homicides had been closed out before noon a banner day there would have been three cases closed by now if riker and mallory had only cooperated but they were both exhausted and badly in need of a rest they had logged more overtime than anyone else on the squad and this was how jack coffey rationalized his irrational behavior of the morning allowing them three days to work a bogus case red winter my ass when he stood up to stretch his legs he saw the wadded balls of paper he had tossed on the floor sooner or later he would have to uncrumple them he gathered them up and smoothed the pages out across his desk next he picked up mallorys report he had the time to read it now but his eyes could not move past the address for the crime scene she had included the landmark credit with the formal name of the property miss winter was not just another taxpayer with a common surname she lived in winter house the lieutenant stole guilty glances at the glowing computer screen only a few feet from his desk the coldcase file would not be there not a case dating back to the forties almost against his will the chair slowly wheeled toward the computer workstation he typed red winters name into the search engine and came up with a selection of several hundred web sites after weeding out the sellers of books videotapes and memorabilia he settled upon a site for truecrime junkies colorful bloodred skulls marked every selection on the menu and the winter house massacre was listed near the end of this alphabet of bones when the screen changed again he was staring at the famous nude portrait of a child with long red hair and he could see that she had been tall for her age all out of proportion to the surrounding furniture civilians and cops who knew the case had always called her red winter here her true name was given as nedda the same as the woman a tall woman who had stabbed willy roy boyd riker had guessed her height at five ten or eleven and mallory had placed her age at seventy nedda would have been a twelveyearold girl in the year that red winter had disappeared no no no it was easier to believe that he was being set up for an elaborate pratfall and how many bets were being made on him this time though his blinds were not drawn and the door was not closed no one disturbed him his people had sensed that he was best left alone as he sat there staring at a blank space on the wall from time to time the men would approach the glass of the goldfish bowl to see if the position of the bosss body had changed any and now jack coffey gave them a little thrill his head moved slowly from side to side as his chair rolled back and away from the computer it seemed that two of his detectives had found the lost child red winter the most enduring mystery in the annals of nypd and he had only given them three days to expose stick man and break the case of the century chapter riker was telling his partner a story to distract her from a favorite sport of neardeath adventures in traffic and so the tan sedan rolled safely down madison avenue mallory pulled up to the curb legal parking spaces were impossible to come by in midtown but bus stops like this one were plentiful she cut the engine why did they call him stick man the lead detective on the winter house massacre he named the freak riker stepped out onto the sidewalk therere only two or three cops whod remember why he picked that name and theyre in nursing homes he paused to light a cigarette striking three matches in the wind impatient mallory slammed her car door and still he took his time exhaling a cloud of smoke as he walked toward an office building at the middle of the block one of the winter kids was holding a crayon drawing when they found him it was a stick figure no detail you know the way kids draw and this litde boy was only four years old there was one small hole in the paper and some blood from the stab wound to his heart so the lead detective fitzgerald was his name he framed the kids picture and hung it up in the squad room at first only the cops on the case knew how important that drawing was so fitzgerald thought the boy drew a portrait of his killer yeah said riker and in a way he did there were thirty detectives assigned to the massacre they worked it for a solid year and they never had one lead to flesh out a suspect you see the kids drawing of a stick man fit the case it hung on that wall for years it drove them all nuts he stopped and looked up at the sky as if he gave a damn about the weather he was wondering how much of the story he should hold back in mallorys puppy days when he was still allowed to call her kathy she had loved his grisly cop stories the more blood the better but never ghost stories eventually he would have to tell her that stick mans killings had begun in and then she would have to shoot him my grandfather didnt work the case said riker but it was all he ever talked about and it was all that granddad had really cared about the old man had made a science of icepick wounds that spanned a full century but mallory did not need to know that not yet and now that they had reached the address of willy roy boyds attorney the story hour was over the two detectives pushed through the glass doors of the rat maze floor upon floor of lawyers offices stacked up to the moon riker flashed a badge at the security guard who wanted to stop them from using the penthouse elevator they stepped inside a carpeted box paneled with mirrors and lit by a tiny crystal chandelier it was a style that new yorkers would call piss elegant the elevator doors closed and they rode upward through the tower of law firms aiming for the most expensive one riker was looking forward to this meeting and he had no plans to restrain mallorys enthusiasm for payback they exited at the last stop and breezed on by a young woman at the reception desk paying no attention to her as she called after them asking if they had an appointment the next woman to ask this question was a more formidable brunette whose desk stood guard before a lawyers door the secretary spoke only to mallory or more accurately to mallorys clothes the silk tshirt and tailored blazer money on the hoof that blended well with the luxurious surroundings the brunette made it clear that rikers suit really ought to have arrived on the delivery elevator at the rear mallorys clothes leaned over the desk and said we dont need an appointment did the darkhaired woman find her unsettling possibly dangerous oh yeah the secretary sat very still hands tightly folded and knuckles turning white as the young detective reached across her desk to press the button that would admit them to the inner sanctum of sid henry esquire riker followed his partner through the door glancing back at the cowed woman behind the desk good job the door swung open on panoramic windows and brilliant light the lawyer was reclining in a leather chair and sunning himself like a lizard in very expensive threads the man even moved like a reptile his head jerking upward startled as the attorney rose from his desk preparing his first verbal assault he suddenly shut his gaping mouth was it the sight of mallorys lovely face no riker guessed it was probably the very large gun a smith and wesson revolver she had one hand on her hip her blazer open and pulled to one side and there was no way he could fail to see that cannon sid henry sat down quietly riker luxuriated in these passing seconds for mallory had not yet produced her shield and considering this attorneys recent client a serial killer the poor bastard sincerely did not know if she was crazy or a cop would he live or die it was riker who ended the suspense holding up his own gold shield mallory pulled a manila envelope from her knapsack tore it open and held up the morgue photograph of a body on the dissection table after the dissection minus all the vital organs and looking very pale recognize your former client no well its a bad photo willy roy boyd was the psycho who butchered three women gutted them with a hunting knife and you got him out on bail she dropped the photo on his desk remember now blame it on nypd sid henry grinned at her entirely too confident that she would not hurt him the case against my client wasnt exactly flawless mallory slammed her fist down on the desk with the force of a hammer my case wasperfectl the attorney flinched and his eyes widened with sudden clarity for now he understood his error she was the lead detective on that case and she did not respond well to criticism i looked up every precedent you cited at that bail hearing she said you had nothing it was all smoke you knew that judge would never admit he didnt know case law on search and seizure you were right on the edge of perjury so said sid henry this is retribution you plan to scare me to death he tapped the photograph this is so unnecessary he turned the picture over the dramatics this disgusting picture riker had predicted that the man would rally quickly according to police lore lawyers were as resilient as cockroaches and one who had been decapitated could litigate for up to three days mallory walked back to the door and closed it slowly smiling as she shut out all sound and sight of witnesses and this little gesture was not lost on sid henry so sid let me guess said riker youre just an associate right not a partner in the firm naw youre too young id bet even money those old geezers dont know you took a fee to bail out that butcher maybe said mallory you told them it was pro bono all the money you made on that hearing didnt go through the firms billing office at least she had found no record of it while raiding the firms database however she had found a large deposit in the lawyers personal bank account by sid henrys silence riker knew they had the man cold for pocketing money that belonged to his firm and now they owned him oh and best of all there would be no charge of police harassment at the end of the day even if mallory left marks on him you didnt ask how your client died said riker not giving the lawyer any time to wonder how the police could access the firms billing office it wasnt in the newspapers not on the tube either but you dont seem surprised i havent seen willy since the bail hearing sid henry picked up the photograph of his late client and forced a smile as he handed it back to mallory so hes dead can i assume this is your work detective rather excessive use of force mallory ignored the photo and let it hang in the air between them until the mans arm got tired and he lost the idea that he could win a staring contest with her she pulled out the pocket watch that had once belonged to the late louis markowitz youve got two minutes to clear yourself on a charge of murder for hire this little trick of time the pressure of a ticking bomb was another handmedown from her foster father if you cant do that then we get to parade you out of here in handcuffs she waited out the silence her eyes cast down to the face of her watch one minute fiftyfive seconds sid henrys voice cracked if you think you can we wanna know who paid for that bail hearing riker snatched the photograph from the lawyers hand and dont give us any crap about attorneyclient privilege that wont cover the bastard who hired you we know willy couldnt afford fifteen minutes of your time so who paid your fee one minute fifty seconds said mallory youve got no right to this is a warrant riker waved a folded sheet of paper it bore no judges signature but it worked well as a prop the charge is attempted murder your client tried to kill another woman last night a rich woman now the older lawyers the guys with their names on the door of this outfit maybe they even know her all these rich people know each other dont they he turned to his partner curious mallory we could ask them on the way out she nodded saying one minute thirty seconds riker pulled out his handcuffs then tossed a miranda card on the desk i think we can assume you know your legal rights im guessing you plan to use the right to remain silent one minute fifteen seconds riker grinned at her i think your watch is slow kid i say we just do him it happened very fast she had reached the other side of the desk before the lawyer knew she was after him now he was half risen from the chair and pulled forward by her hand dragging his necktie no visible bruising that way he was quickly bent over the desk face pressed to the blotter as she worked his arms behind his back riker threw her the handcuffs and while she did the honors he stood back and smiled wanting always to remember this special moment sid henry bending over and exposing his ass to all comers evidently the lawyer saw his own posture as a portent of things to come in lockup i dont know who hired me he yelled no call it a squeal thats not what we wanted to hear said mallory i couldnt tell you if i wantedto and now his words came out all in a rush it was a cash payment anonymous ask my secretary she opened the first package there were two installments one before the bail hearing and one afterward and you gave the secretary a cut to keep her quiet right riker pocketed the warrant producing instant relief in the attorneys eyes okay i dont think we have to pursue this if your story holds up he took one last look at the man bent over his desk then turned to his partner can we take a picture of this before you uncuff him no he could see that mallory was in a hurry to get on to the next interview well one lawyer down and one to go their second target of the day was the attorney of record for the winter family trust fund he was also the father of bitty smyth the reception hall of the harvard club had the hallmark of wealth and power wasted space on an obscene scale the high ceiling was close to god and deceased alumni it was rare for charles butler to set foot in this place as a child prodigy he had not made many friends among his older classmates todays luncheon was at the invitation of sheldon smyth scion of the oldest and most venerable law firm in new york city smyth had mentioned that his son paul would also be dining with them the old man harbored the delusion that charles and paul had been great friends at school untrue paul smyth had been shoehorned into harvard as the son of a wealthy alumnus while charles had been a soughtafter child the center of a bidding war among the finest schools on the eastern seaboard there had been only one occasion when he and paul had met on campus in passing at eighteen charles had been on his way out one semester away from submitting a phd dissertation and paul had just arrived as an incoming freshman no thought had been given to this schoolmate in decades however last night the birthday party photographs in bitty smyths bedroom had raised old grudges dating back to the sandbox the main dining room a grand oakpaneled affair was lined with the portraits of patrons immortalized in gigantic oil paintings their names and deeds long forgotten however the clubs famed cheese dip was memorable he crossed the room behind a waiter if not for this escort he would never have chosen the right table for his old enemy was so altered by time paul smyths hair had thinned his belly had expanded and his chin had tripled but charles was recognized at once so little changed was he with a full head of hair and only the one chin so it was a balanced universe after all paul stood up to shake hands with him in peripheral vision pauls father was a thatch of silver hair with thick black eyebrows now the older man rose from his chair to match charless stature of sixfour sheldon smyth extended one hand across the table to greet his luncheon guest the old mans eyes were the magic mirrors that every narcissist prayed for clear blue reflections of the egoist coda saying to the beholder my god i think youre wonderfulaloud he said so good of you to come such short notice and all charles was stunned but not seduced how do you do sir by sheldon smyths manner and smile the other diners might believe that they were close friends who met for lunch every day when the three men were seated with menus in hand the elder smyth said i understand the police got you out of bed last night my exwife called this morning you remember her of course cleo wintersmyth no said charles weve never met for that matter he could not recall having met pauls father either at those gatherings where children were forcibly pitted against one another paul had always been accompanied by a nanny but you did meet her once said paul for about six seconds when you were ten she dropped off me and my sister at your birthday party bitty wasnt invited of course but she badgered dad and i had to take her sheldon smyth cleared his throat to announce that this minor slander did not sit well with him bitty is the only child by my first marriage to cleo charles nodded in a show of polite interest i see the family resemblance bittys adopted said paul this was a surprise for the woman had features in common with her father the shape of his large eyes if not their color the same chin and mouth paul on the other hand bore no shes family said sheldon smyth all but daring his son to say one more word with a friendlier expression he turned all of his attention on charles cleo and i adopted bitty when my cousin died in childbirth now tell me why should the police bother you about a lot of photographs i believe theyre required to notify me of a potential stalker but you set them straight of course told them she was a family connection this was news to charles who had no surviving relatives he politely smiled and waited for some explanation your mothers second cousin charles his half brother was a smyth no blood relation perhaps but there you are he said family the old lawyer allowed this word to hang alone punctuated with respectful silence to increase its import charles was not surprised he had long been a believer in the six degrees of separation the theory that everyone on the planet was somehow connected to everyone else by a sequence of relationships however the smyths had taken it to an elitist extreme marrying into every major fortune in new york state so youve got a stalker said paul not quite understanding that word as the one his father most wanted to defuse he failed to catch the old mans eye and that look of disappointment in an idiot son just like a rock star grinning paul punched charles on the arm instantly calling up the days when a childsize paul had fired sniper shots with closed fists jabbing and bruising on the run then finishing off his prey by killing him with words that had an even stronger punch and power charles had died each time they met but not today sheldon smyth had finally managed to capture his sons attention the old man narrowed his eyes in an ocular thump on the head a warning not to punch their guest one more time glancing at his watch he said paul dont let us detain you any longer as he reached out for a roll and a butter knife his face said the rest go or be impaled on the silverware and now charles quite liked the old man when paul had excused himself from the table and the waiter had departed with their menus and lunch orders sheldon smyth leaned forward voice lowered so my boy cleo said the house was full of police standing room only why all this fuss over a burglar well he was a dead burglar you didnt know no my exwife neglected to mention a corpse so typical of cleo he said as if dead bodies lying about the house were an everyday nuisance i think she was more concerned that you might cause problems for bitty when i called my office this morning i was told that the police had paid a visit well naturally i wondered if youd pressed charges against my daughter no sir it never occurred to me good man salads arrived during the ensuing silence then charles further reassured bittys father saying i had a long talk with bitty last night im satisfied that she isnt the least bit dangerous quite right no more than a simple schoolgirl crush im sure you found it quite charming charles understood this from his hosts perspective quite comical really a man like himself one with the attributes of an eagle beak and bullfrog eyes would have so few choices how could he fail to be flattered by the fixation of a neurotic elf between one course and another he learned that the smyth firm had served the winter family for more than a hundred years the old mans eyes were always fixed upon charles as if he regarded his guest as the most important personage on the planet it was an illusion from a lawyers bag of tricks to win over juries and stalking victims alike but smyth had perfected it to a fine art and charles felt that his immunity to flattery was slipping meanwhile heads were turning at all the other tables mallory had arrived to work her usual effect upon a room no one thought to stop her forward momentum across the wide floor she was so obviously one of the power people in this gathering what waiter would risk being trampled there were nods of approval all around yes the patrons assured one another she was one of them though so few of them carried guns to lunch hers was exposed quite deliberately charles thought as she swept the blazer to one side and reached into a rear pocket of her jeans where she kept her gold shield only now did smyth realize that his table had become a spectacle he looked up to see the young homicide detective standing beside his chair she was no longer displaying the gun but only discreetly holding out her badge mallory gave charles a curt nod hello dr buder she said employing a title he never used though his credentials entitled him to do so and with this pointed formality she wiped away their friendship their business partnership and the years that they had known one another they were merely recent acquaintances that was her message to him and now after forcing sheldon smyth to wait out this little farce she turned her eyes on him your office told me i could find you here really he said with those two syllables smyth managed to convey that some minion would be parted with his head just the moment he returned to his office hardly inclined to wait on an invitation mallory pulled up a chair at the table as if she did not already have smyths complete attention she asked can you think of any reason why someone would want your daughter dead smyth stared at her then shook his head and kept his silence perhaps adhering to a lawyers code to ask no question to which he did not already have the answer and then of course he could not have been more stunned if she had pistolwhipped him mallory seemed to like that reaction she liked it a lot money motives work for me who inherits if your daughter dies the words were slow to come no one said smyth i drew up her will myself her estate goes to the legal aid society i know theres a family trust fund mallorys tone implied that she had caught the old man in a lie my daughter has no stake in that the only beneficiaries are her mother and her uncle and nedda winter the old man nodded tell me why your daughter doesnt benefit from the trust fund it took a moment for sheldon smyth to adjust to the fact that he was not in control of this interview he graced her with a radiant smile an experiment that immediately failed she had a natural immunity to charisma and this seemed to irritate him the old man made a great show of looking at his wristwatch and he would not meet her eyes when he spoke i cant discuss the trust fund with you he addressed the empty chair on the other side of the table its privileged information i can tell you that bitty doesnt need a draw on the trust i provide her with a generous allowance thats not what i asked mallory leaned forward and raised her voice as if the old man might be hard of hearing so apart from you her only source of income is her law practice charles sat up a bit straighter bitty a lawyer yes my daughter was top of her class at columbia the old man misunderstood charless startled expression of course i wanted her to go to harvard but she preferred to stay close to home mallory called smyths attention back to herself where does your daughter practice law and whats her area of expertise she used to work for my firm but now shes on sabbatical shes always concentrated on contract law would that include trustfund busting you cant mean the winter family trust smyth was incredulous what would be the point if she didnt i need copies of all the documents for that trust fund said the detective i want them today got a warrant detective smyth seemed suddenly cheered by mallory s prolonged quiet no he said i didnt think so youre the executor said mallory you can give me any that trust fund has a long history the documents every bill and receipt and canceled check paperwork for decades of transactions it fills a goodsize storage room he leaned toward her with new confidence it would take a small army to copy all that paperwork and the originals will never leave my firm did i mention that i was trying to keep your daughter alive and were you listening when i said there was no motive for anyone to harm her its my job to decide that said mallory youre only a lawyer im the law sheldon smyth inclined his head and smiled perhaps in agreement with this distinction but more likely in approval a sudden change in his opinion of this young adversary detective mallory i can give you the basic structure of the trust cleo wintersmyth and her brother are entitled to a monthly draw and nedda said mallory reminding him once more of this womans existence she could also be a target so if she dies it doesnt change the amount of the draw you should also know that the trust fund is entailed to charity the payouts end with lionel and cleos generation and nedda said mallory you keep forgetting her sheldon smyth dropped his smile and laid his napkin on the table i think were done here detective talk to my secretary if you need more information shell schedule an appointment and now because he must sense that she did not take direction very well he added im afraid we re boring poor charles with all of this after mallory had kicked him under the table charles was encouraged to say oh no sir this is fascinating well charles said smyth if thats the case i suggest you have dinner with the family tonight youve been invited by my exwife im sure bitty would like to properly apologize for the unpleasantness with the police i assure you theres no need for that said charles shifting his legs beyond mallorys long reach say yes said smyth im asking as a favor bittys so easily crushed tell me youll go in mallorys version of subtlety she examined her fingernails as if they might need sharpening of course said charles after signing a tab for the luncheon and leaving instructions to care for his guests sheldon smyth departed and the energy level of the dining room was diminished by half moments later riker arrived and he proved to be another head turner attracting attention from every quarter of the dining room he moseyed toward the table followed closely by a waiter who no doubt suspected this badly dressed man of a scheme to steal the silverware charles stood up to greet the detective and the waiter somewhat relieved melted away when riker had been apprised on the fine points of mallorys interview he sipped his coffee and grinned at charles so mallory promoted you to snitch good job take a nose count when you show up for dinner there might be somebody living there that we dont know about maybe the one who wrote this letter he handed over a clear plastic bag containing a sheet of paper we took that from the dead mans lawyer it came with a boxful of money charles read the scant information neatly typed it mentioned the name of the client and an arrangement for more money if the bail hearing was successful my god i shouldve recognized him from his picture in the newspaper this is the dead burglar isnt it willy roy boyd keep that to yourself said mallory can you tell us anything helpful charles shook his head bare sentence fragments no style or turn of phrase to give the writer away i can tell you that youre not dealing with an idiot does that help you no apparently not sorry an afternoon of begging for warrants had come to a bad end district attorney john j buchanan had personally turned down the last request for assistance from his office in a rare exception to protocol he had granted an audience to mere detectives and that alone had been enough to make riker suspicious the da had made it clear that the smyth firm was unassailable and offlimits to the nypd that directive had included bitty smyth a former member of that firm it was dark when the partners returned to soho and riker was gearing up for another unpleasant confrontation as they left the car and headed down the street to a familiar haunt well its an election year he said as they walked along smyth must be a big contributor to the das war chest damn buchanan they stopped by the window of a brightly lit cafe across the street from the station house the table on the other side of the glass was littered with guidebooks and cameras and the chairs were filled with middleaged ladies damn tourists all the cops in sight had had the decency to take other tables a gray haired woman sat in the chair once occupied by mallorys foster father unaware that she was trespassing this tourist looked up to see the young homicide detectives face close to the window and those cold eyes like oncoming bullets apparently the mayors new handout sheet for visitors had included tips that were actually helpful like never make eye contact with the sociopath for now the woman quickly looked down at her menu wishing the greeneyed apparition away riker nudged his partner theyre ordering dessert we can come back later no that would have been too easy the woman seated in the dead mans chair looked up to the window again and now her companions were also curious this was mallorys cue to clear the table quickly and efficiently before his partner could casually draw back one side of her blazer to terrorize these outoftowners with the display of her shoulder holster riker said no let me do it this time just wait here okay he entered the cafe and hunkered down by the ladies table softly he spoke to them about the young woman on the other side of the window glass the one with the very disturbing eyes really just a kid he said to them he talked about her foster father a late great cop and how kathy mallory had never come to terms with the fact that she would never see him again it was too hard to believe that lou markowitz would not be sitting at this very table each time she came by the cafe and here riker paused a beat to rap the table softly there was always this little moment of pretend he told the ladies before the kid turned to the window to see that the old mans chair was empty and then she would come in and sit down to wait for him because bless the old bastards soul he was always late and just for a little while lou was still alive he had never died in the line of duty and left his kid all alone in copland just a kid he said once more and he told them about gurt the waitress who had kept this table clear of other patrons at this same hour until the day not long ago when she had retired so now the girl had also lost another fixture in her life ah gurt he said to them that saint a sarcastic old bat who should have retired years ago and so as the ladies could see he pointed to mallory now the kid did not handle change very well it disturbed her they all turned to the window as if waiting for mallory to cry they would wait forever he was still talking as these women rose from their chairs all smiling with their kind faces from the heartland of america where all the good people lived they picked up their plates and glasses silverware and napkins and moved to a vacant table at the back of the room riker faced the window but mallory was gone what did you say to them she was behind his back and he jumped one hand went to his heart still beating just checking i told them the truth he said and that should shut her up mallory had difficulties with that simple concept and the idea of human kindness would give her even more trouble when they were seated and waiting for their meal riker continued to parcel out the story of nedda aka red winter youve seen the painting he said i guess everybody has but back in the day remember this is the forties a nude painting of a little girl was a shock and a half in the other paintings the kid had clothes on but the nude was the biggest one nine feet tall and nedda was only eleven years old then the cops raided the art gallery and took all the paintings away the artist was her father right riker nodded her rich father i guess thats why the whole thing blew over one headline in the papers then nothing some of the books about red winter figured her for a runaway because daddy was a freak and some say she killed him and everyone else in the house mallory shook her head a little girl on a murder spree doesnt work for me that had been predictable his partner favored money motives hey said riker i can only tell this story the way it was told to me you wanna hear it or not he knew that she did her chin lifted slightly a vow to behave and she was his old kathy for a moment just another little girl sitting around a copshop surrounded by men with guns and human scum in handcuffs riker had sometimes done midget duty in the afterschool hours making sure the tiny semireformed street thief would not rob the place while her old man had been occupied with more hardcore criminals riker had kept lous foster child honest by telling her all of his handeddown family stories from the days of legs diamond lucky luciano and murder incorporated murders by the dozen in every tale what a deal young kathy had never gotten such bloody treats at home her foster mother would never have allowed it gentle helen markowitz had always held the strange notion that kathy mallory was a normal child one who might have bad dreams of the bogeyman what helen had never understood was that little kathy had the early makings of the bogeymans nightmare anyway said riker after the raid on the art show quentin winters daughter is famous everybody uptown and down has a theory on what goes on inside winter house then one day a year later the cops get a call from another litde girl she tells em she just got home from the park with her brother lionel the whole house is dead thats the way she put it except for the baby and the babys crying the litde girl on the phone says her name is cleo she was only five years old when charles rang the bell it was sheldon smyth who responded the older man had won a footrace to the door beating a young woman in a maids costume who rushed up behind him with a tray of hors doeuvres in hand not now said smyth flicking his fingers at her to shoo her away as if she were an insect hello charles he glanced back satisfied to see the maid in retreat not the best caterers im afraid short notice and all charles wondered why smyth would tell such a lie the truck parked outside the house belonged to the most exclusive caterer in manhattan one who was booked months in advance and not the sort to do impromptu dinner partiesunless of course the fee had been doubled or tripled with the old lawyers hand on his back charles was gently but firmly propelled into the front room and his eyes were once again drawn to the wildly impractical staircase the architect must have hailed from a school that regarded clients as parasites in the home only grudgingly deferring to them by allotting space for kitchens bathrooms and the like and now he had exhausted every sane rationale for his sudden discomfort in a less pragmatic part of his mind he thought the house was hostile how ludicrous at the foot of the stairs was a fully stocked bar and here introductions were made to bittys uncle while charles was shaking hands with lionel winter he felt that his host was missing something oh perhaps a pulse the man was simply not present that or his personality was in hiding given the snowwhite hair the face was younger than it should be and charles wondered if the lack of age lines was due to the absence of an emotional life it was pathos and comedy that creased a face with personal history sheldon smyth dismissed a young man from the caterers staff and assumed the role of bartender let me guess your poison charles he poured a double shot of chivas regal into a brandy glass neat am i right yes thank you this was indeed charless usual fare but he had not ordered chivas at lunch today he was given further proof that smyth had gone to a great deal of trouble over this dinner party for now he learned that his favorite foods were on the menu however the elderly lawyer had not discerned that charless taste in music was strictly classical though this extended to the vintage jazz that nedda winter had played on the radio during his last visit to this house tonight he was forced to listen to elevator music popular tunes played as boring instrumentals by an uninspired orchestra even the tonal quality had changed overnight the sound surrounded him he did not have to look at the antique radio to see that the dial was dark that the music did not come from there lionel winter made his first attempt at conversation going on at length about the elaborate sound system that played in every room of the house and when charles mentioned the jazz tunes of the previous evening his host fell silent and only stared at him sheldon smyth filled this uncomfortable void saying the ladies should be joining us any minute now ah women never on time well whats the use of a grand staircase if you cant make a stunning entrance and now the ladies were coming gliding down the stairs in long gowns the tall woman could only be cleo wintersmyth resplendent in a darkblue gown the color of her eyes she towered over her daughter poor little bitty her strapless dress of iridescent colors was reminiscent of a disco ball on prom night and her gamin charm had been destroyed by a gash of lipstick a rouge pot on each cheek and hair lacquered into appalling spit curls aghast sheldon smyth turned from his daughter to his exwife and charles wondered if bitty had been transformed into a circus pony under duress the tiny woman flinched needing no more than her fathers expression to tell her how foolish she looked cleo wintersmyth resembled her brother lionel both were tall and fair and absent any human aspect in their eyes the woman tilted her head to one side and this was the only indication that she was surprised by her exhusbands attitude turning away from him she managed a floodlight white smile for their guest during the ensuing small talk of weather and dead burglars charles felt more and more ill at ease again he tried to blame this on the staircase that was always in the act of running off to the top of the house and all those tall mirrors they picked up each gesture of a head half turned repeating it in a herd of heads all giving alarm as animals will do when they turn to the sound or the scent of danger even the small painting over the bar had a manic quality of stroke and line and color between one drink and the next he learned that bitty smyth had grown up in this unsettling house and so if there was an easily startled air about her in her eyes and in her manner this was to be excused cleo wintersmyth lifted her face ever so slightly as she peered into one of the mirrors lining the walls she spoke to the reflection of another woman on the staircase behind her nedda i didnt know youd be joining us tonight was there something in her tone that implied the older woman was unwelcome nedda winter drifted down the stairs in a long black satin dress that called to mind a blackandwhite movie from a more elegant era a loosewoven shawl of silver threads was draped over her shoulders and her braided white hair served as a coiled crown she was another paradox of the house the lines of her gown were sylvan and classical the lady statuesque her posture unbowed and despite the wrinkles and the hair gone white the total effect was beautiful and what quiet authority this woman had sufficient to reduce sheldon smyth to a fidgeting child on best behavior her pale blue eyes took in the drastic alterations to her niece if the sight was unpleasing she never let on but while bitty was looking elsewhere miss winter glanced at cleo with mild disapproval the younger sister would not look at her upon reaching the bottom step the elder lady inclined her head and extended one veined hand to charles how nice to see you again im sorry we didnt have a chance to talk last night well said sheldon smyth well make up for that this evening and with those words the occasion of a mans violent death had been reduced to a previous social event nedda placed a protective arm about bittys shoulders then guided her niece into the dining room and the rest of the party followed them to the table a waiter pulled out a chair to seat cleo wintersmyth beside charles i met your parents years and years ago she said sheldon and i were enrolling bitty at the marshal frampton institute left off this long name were the words for gifted children they seemed to dote on you the woman had more grace than to mention that marion butler had been a bit old for motherhood charless birth had been a shock to his parents a pregnancy so late in life his parents had died of old age before he was out of his teens and yes they had doted upon him and sent him to schools that would cater to his freaks iq he looked down at his place setting wondering how he could have forgotten bitty smyth among the limited enrollment of the frampton institute stop racking your brain my boy said sheldon smyth the moment my back was turned bittys mother pulled her out of school i dont think she attended for more than two days the subject came up again as the first course was being served it wasnt the right school for bitty cleos tone was somewhat defensive i sent her to a better one where she could make all the right connections connections smyth laughed she was a fiveyearold not a socialite bitty seemed to be growing smaller sinking down in her chair as she was talked about but never acknowledged as a person in this room she was so small so easily overlooked in a family of giants charles imagined her life as a mouse in this house scurrying from one bolt hole to another he waited for her to look his way then smiled and said its a pity you didnt stay at frampton we mightve gotten to know one another much earlier bitty smiled and spilled her water glass while a waiter mopped up the table nedda winter nodded her approval of charles the subject was closed and peace was restored for a time before the last entree had been served the house and all its company all save nedda had begun to wear on charles he hardly tasted his food while eating his way toward the final course cleo and lionels smiles were flashing on and off like lightbulbs and by this odd behavior he determined that the history of the house was a subject to be avoided every foray into this area was sharply cut off and the conversation directed elsewhere odder still was the bond between brother and sister in some respects lionel and cleo brought to mind an old married couple who could finish one anothers sentences or altogether do away with the spoken word however there was no apparent affection between them they simply came as a set if you got one you got the other charles picked up the challenge of cleaving the pair lionel what sort of work do you do work cleo translated for her brother investments dear the stocks and bonds so you work on wall street said charles in an attempt to be helpful oh wait there was that pesky word again work us no we manage our own investments said lionel but it is time consuming somewhere between the chocolate mousse and postprandial brandy the conversation had turned to the subject of fortunetellers where this topic had come from charles could not say but he suspected that bitty had raised it in a small voice and wafted it across the table to her mother a willing receptacle ive had a few tarot card readings said cleo and it was worth years of therapy but theres nothing mystical about it the fortuneteller reads the person not the cards some readers are remarkably intuitive and charles took this to mean that a fortuneteller had once flattered her no that was unkind and in conflict with his heightened sense of empathy he suspected a wound at the core of this woman some serious misadventure of the psyche it was a certainty that she shared this affliction with her brother hence the odd bond between them something had happened to them some great trauma bitty gulped down her brandy and reached for the decanter saying aunt nedda can read tarot cards out of the entire company nedda winter was the most surprised by this news bitty quietly slipped away from the table and left the dining room door ajar as she made her way across the front room wobbly but stumbling only once upon finally noticing her daughters absence cleo shrugged her apologies to charles im sure shell come back it might be better if she didnt said lionel shes had way too much to drink he turned to charles saying my niece isnt accustomed to alcohol the religious life i suppose her current church religious sheldon smyth pronounced this word as if he had never heard it before bitty shes never even been to sunday school its a phase shes been going through said his exwife for the past three years there was a clear comment here on sheldon smyths apparent lack of interest in his own child lionel turned to his erstwhile brotherinlaw so bitty never told you when she joined the catholics there was nothing in his voice to say that sheldons ignorance surprised him well thats old news in an aside to charles cleo said bittys a protestant now bloody heart of the redeemer i think something like that its a sect no actually more like a cult lots of traveling on holy missions to recruit heathens im sure said lionel bitty finds it a damn shame that the protestants have no nunneries its a shame they have no confessionals said bitty reappearing from behind her uncles chair weaving slightly and producing an awkward silence all around the table imagine a little room where you can take your soul to get it cleaned this comment was met with dead quiet charles affected the distance of outsider status eyes cast down his spoon served only to move the dessert about on his plate youve had quite enough to drink cleo was firm and apparently still had the power to forbid her fortyyearold child for now she moved the brandy snifter far from her daughters place setting ignoring her mother bitty passed by her own chair and moved toward nedda in a slow somewhat unsteady march she held a boxed deck of cards in her hands the cardboard was worn with ages of handling and bore a tarot illustration of the hanged man she set it down on the table before her aunt as though bestowing a precious artifact maybe you could read the tarot cards for charles nedda winter stared at the deck with a trace of alarm this might as well be a dead animal that her niece had laid on the dinner table she was slow to recover her composure and then she slipped the deck into her lap beneath the cover of the tablecloth not tonight dear im rather tired what you need is a good stiff drink sheldon smyth rose to gallantly pull out her chair then led her away from the table and the rest of the party followed them to gather around the bar in the front room while the lawyer poured out their drinks charles renewed his fascination with the staircase you feel it too said bitty nodding its haunted he noticed a sudden dismay about her and turned to see what she was staring at another damned mirror it was impossible not to encounter ones self at every turn bitty had caught her reflection alongside his own how he dwarfed her in size they resembled a sideshow team of giant and midget she turned her eyes this way and that finding the same tableau in every direction they both looked up to escape the mirrors and now they shared a view of the winding banister encircling a skylight dome at the top of the house in another era of horsedrawn carriages and clearer skies there might have been stars up there lots of history in this house he said you mean all the murders said bitty cleos smile clicked on slightly out of sync and all for charles im sure you know the story of winter house everyone does glancing back at her daughter she said its a tired old story dear every pair of eyes was fixed on charles reading the stunned surprise on his face he was recalling a bit of history that appeared in newspapers every ten years or so the regurgitation of a mass murder for the reading pleasure of the public on a sunday afternoon oh bloody hell riker and mallory should have told him warned him forgetting his manners he looked over bittys head to gape at the surviving winter children all grown up there was another murder that wasnt famous bitty addressed charless shoes youre standing on the place where edwina winter died she was aunt neddas mother he backed up a few steps she fell he looked straight up the body could not have landed in that spot not after falling down the stairs the woman must have gone over the nedda is our half sister said cleo as if this might be what puzzled her guest different mothers and her mother drank quite a bit well there you have it the oldest family scandal edwina winter was drunk when she went over the banister my father and his brother james saw her fall said lionel directing his gaze upward to a large picture hanging on the secondfloor landing thats their portrait charles looked up at the oil painting of two adolescents even at this distance he would call it a very bad piece of work almost a cartoon their account wasnt quite accurate said bitty daddy and uncle james gave the only account said cleo how can it quentin and his first wife hated each other bitty sipped sherry stocking up on a little bravery from a glass i found the divorce papers filed just before edwina died they were charging each other with infidelity thats enough bitty said her mother have some consideration for your aunt no dont stop because of me said nedda i never knew my mother i was a baby when she died she gave her niece an encouraging smile apparently approving of this uncharacteristic demeanor all the money belonged to edwina winter bitty was running out of false courage she went to the bar and poured herself some more the staircase is full of ghosts its a nervous kind of haunting cant you feel it i know what she means said sheldon smyth theres always been something queer about this house always felt it just as she says and that damned staircase its just plain wrong its the pride of the house said cleo it was featured in architectural digest the writer called it the absolute triumph of form over function his very words sheldon smyth wore a condescending smile his exwife had missed the insult in that quotation and she was doomed to repeat it to anyone who would listen to this joke told by herself at her own expense politeness prevented charles from enlightening her informing her that life was not lived on the stairs but in the rooms where people might take creature comforts procreate and dream but not in this house here everything revolved around the tension of the staircase the inertia of lines rushing upward appeared to be all that kept it from falling down taking charles by the arm bitty smiled with newfound boldness you decide helplessly bound by good manners he climbed the stairs with her until they gained the second floor the rest of the party was also being pulled along straggling upward without wills of their own the dynamic of the dinner party had changed oddly enough bitty was running the show she paused and with the air of a tour guide pointed to the place along the stairs where quentin winter had died in the famous massacre charles glanced back to see nedda last in line giving wide berth to this area as if she must round the dead body of her father before she could continue upward the staircase was not haunted nedda was edwina winter died almost twelve years before the massacre bitty stood beneath the painting of the winter brothers and instructed charles to remain by the railing thats where she was standing when she fell now remember all the winters were tall and they married tall people like you think you could fall by accident he stood with his back to the railing which was higher than one might expect yet another design flaw and he tried to imagine a scenario where he might go over the side perhaps if the floor were slippery or he were to stumble no that would not work his center of gravity would still be below the rail tricky isnt it bitty rested one hand on the smooth round wood now if it had broken that would explain everything but this is the original perfectly sound give up without waiting for a reply she turned her back on him to open a door into the blackness of a bedroom she pointed to the spot where he was standing as if commanding a very large dog she said wait there the tiny woman was swallowed up in the shadows seconds later she was rushing back into the light running toward him hands extended and palms flattened back as if to push him and she was fast there was no time to grip the rail nor even to raise his arms bitty stopped dead stop when her hands were a bare inch from his chest she turned her smiling face up to his thats the only way it could have happened quentin winter murdered his first wife thats enough said cleo i wont have you saying these things about my father why not said her exhusband neither one of the winter boys was a saint not according to my father its as good a theory as any and now the other ghosts bitty was gleefully potted as she descended the stairs to a midpoint between the high ceiling and the parlor floor she turned to look back at cleo this was where your mother died bitty turned her eyes to charles alice was her name the second mrs winter was my grandfathers favorite model he was an artist you know all eyes followed the dramatic point of bittys finger there was another body in the stop you werent there cleo yelled at her daughter you werent even born yet you dont know anything nedda winter was not taking this well either she gripped the rail with a sudden need of support had both these sisters witnessed the massacre of their family charless sketchy knowledge of this old story held no such detail bitty was prattling on about the other deaths and where the bodies fell as she led the party down the staircase and then there was the baby she said almost as an afterthought a newborn sally was her name she survived the massacre what happened to her after that mother nedda paused on the last step and stared at cleo waiting on the answer to that question clearly she had no knowledge of her baby sisters whereabouts how curious charles wondered if another of the winter children had been lost sally winter sheldon smyth was the first to reach the bar i havent heard that name in years he smiled at charles everyone called her baby sally i was just a boy away at school when i heard the news she ran off isnt that right lionel isnt that what the nanny told the police the nurse said cleo sally had a nurse quite right said sheldon as i recall your uncle james fired that woman for stealing he spoke to charles for the outsider would need a running translation james winter was their guardian after the rest of the family was murdered yes i remember him confronting the nurse about stealing youre confused old man said lionel it was uncle james who was stealing yes of course said sheldon smyth thats why he left town so suddenly if i remember correcdy that was the year you turned twentyone lionel turned his back on the man then poured a double shot of whiskey from the bar and downed it quickly neddas face had gone bloodless she drifted back to the stairs passing all of them by and without a good night to anyone in dead silence they all watched her climb and climb then disappear behind a door on the floor above bitty the living portrait of contrition and regret trailed after her aunt sheldon smyth was quick to retrieve a briefcase from the floor of a closet and now he made his retreat backing up to the door pleading an early appointment and urging his guest to stay on for a nightcap the caterers were gone and so were cleo and lionel charles opened the door to the dining room hoping to find them there to say good night and beat a hasty retreat not there where then they had not gone upstairs after searching the kitchen and the sewing room he returned to the front of the house to find cleo and lionel standing by the entrance to the foyer with only a nod to their guest they turned around and left charles heard the front door close behind them well this was a bit backward the hosts leaving the house in advance of the guest a most unconventional dinner party said nedda winter he turned to see her standing behind the bar uncorking a bottle of wine my family doesnt entertain much anymore she smiled quite her old self again such a charming smile she tapped a button on a control panel next to the bar and the sound system died off to blessed silence ah thats better id like to thank you for not asking me where ive been for all these years to be honest i wasnt sure that you were red winter i dont know the story as well as i thought do you like jazz mr butler oldfashioned record albums had appeared on the bar stacked up beside two wineglasses charles examined them one by one any audiophile could date them back to the middle of the last century this is a wonderful collection unfortunately theyre all warped and scratched and all the records that my sister stacked up for the party are not my idea of music mine either he pulled a record from the album cover it was made of hard plastic that predated vinyl cassettes and magnetically encoded discs and it was ruined what a great pity nedda turned away from him to study the control panel for the sound system i was hoping you could show me how to play the radio on this thing it has a beautiful sound quality and i know a station that only plays jazz from the thirties and forties i tried to tune it in once but that made cleo cry she said i changed the programming for all her favorite stations she doesnt know how to work it either and neither do i for a birthday present mallory had rewired his apartment with a similar sound system and yes the sound quality was incredibly beautiful but the control panel she had installed was equally daunting i have one at home but its a different model and the buttons are color coded mallory had programmed his stations and painted the selection buttons with red nail polish he strolled over to the antique radio that she had played last night well we know this works the front windows were open the curtains blew inward duke ellington and his band flowed out into the street charles buder was in luddite heaven he ended the evening painlessly sitting outside on the stone steps the warm wind of indian summer ruffled his hair to the tune of rippling piano keys they were finishing off the last bottle in a prolonged goodbye i havent gotten soused on wine since i was twelve years old said nedda winter i gather your upbringing was rather liberal you have no idea she looked up at the face of her house and smiled it was a party that went on for years my parents were jazz babies and they were never bothered by nice people from good families our guests were miles more interesting she ticked off an impressive list of actors writers gangsters and gamblers who had passed out at the dining room table but i liked the chorus girls best they gave me a taste for cold beer and taught me to curse she produced a pack of cigarettes from the folds of her shawl and they taught me how to blow smoke rings she blew one now and it hung in the still night air you dont like my house much do you i suppose it makes me nervous yes i noticed that but it didnt bother you the other night did it not with all those policemen all that activity and this music on the radio well no oh said nedda big smile how the house loves a good party im afraid we put on a rather poor show tonight not nearly enough people and that dreary music she caressed the wroughtiron railing poor house it was made for a wilder nightlife though he would not describe the crime scene as a wild party he took her point so tonight im seeing the house out of context the interior that was actually designed tor large gatherings wasnt it she nodded and refreshed his glass with more wine my fathers work he gutted the front room years before i was born the staircase was the main event it works best with a hundred people lounging on the steps slugging back whiskey and tapping their feet to very loud music late in the evening the music was live musicians came by from every club in town jam sessions till sunup piano men and men with horns women with voices that could belt out a song to bring the roof down everyone in motion dancing even when they were sitting down now the mirrors daddy hung them up to create a bigger crowd than the house could hold he even slanted the walls to give the mirrors more scope thats why you can never avoid the multiple reflections she nodded you could never escape my fathers illusion all that energy the people and the music fed the house her hand rubbed the stone step she sat upon poor house now its starving dying for the next big party as charles lit the last of her cigarettes he glanced at his watch startled to realize that another hour had passed he liked this woman tremendously however he knew she must be tired with some regret he rose to take his leave to see her safely behind the door and to lose the pleasure of her company lionel winter loved one thing in all the world the rollsroyce the wraith in the last two years of production before the war only had ever existed the wraith had been his fathers car and it was in nearperfect running condition the ride was smooth and utterly quiet he paid lavish tips to the garage attendant for a little magic from an aerosol can that always made the leather smell like new like the year when he had sat upon his fathers lap and steered the wraith down city streets whenever he drove this car he lived in that year tonight however it was difficult to escape the twentyfirst century and all his thoughts were centered upon his niece what was she playing at since bitty had abandoned the practice of law at her fathers firm she had become more and more peculiar or so it seemed on those days when she appeared in his line of vision most of the time he hardly noticed her he could not entirely blame the wine for the nights disaster how long had she been harboring these suspicions and how much could she really know flying down the henry hudson parkway boats on the water the town alight electric new york at night how he loved to drive always shuttling between the summer house and town that was his whole life going nowhere with great speed and always alone his solitary thoughts turned to nedda why was she still alive at the hospice an ancient doctor had virtually promised him that his older sister would be dead before the month was out that no tests were necessary to tell him that there was no hope of a cure all the signs of endstage cancer had been there her skin a ghastly yellow her belly bloated and the rest of her body wasted and yet months later nedda had come home to winter house and there she resided in splendid good health doctors were so untrustworthy hardly science was it obviously his older sister had been woefully misdiagnosed so she lived in his house and every day nedda summoned up the gall to look him in the eye every smile in his direction was a mockery and now she was using bitty turning his niece against her own family lionels fingers tightened around the steering wheel and the car accelerated down the parkway he sped past the taillights of slower cars the electric yellow windows of tall buildings and bright reflections on the river going faster and faster why did you come back nedda uncle james had promised them over and over that their sister would never return to winter house he turned toward the passenger seat to look at his sister in her own neighboring galaxy on the other side of the car her face was bathed in dim light from the dashboard cleo you dont remember very much do you when we came home from the park that day and found them all dead no she shivered slightly as if awakening and shaking off dreams no i dont that was not surprising his sister had been only five years old when the two of them had come home to find their parents bodies sprawled on the stairs and the dead housekeeper what was her name no matter he could not remember the nannys name either oh but the others his brothers and sisters he saw them now white and still his parents were his most vivid memory what a picture for the family album little cleo clinging to their dead mother the corpse warm to the touch and by that warmth still giving comfort to one of her children but not to lionel while standing on the stairs only inches from his fathers body he had been a zillion miles distant from that scene wishing himself to the moon and listening in on the world from a great distance listening to a memory now truly a long way off he could still hear cleos sad little conversation with the police on the telephone numbering and naming the dead then ending by asking them so innocently are you coming lionel looked at his mask of a face in the rearview mirror then glanced at his sisters mask before turning back to stare at the windshield alone again chapter charles butlers suite of offices was equipped with an ultramodern kitchen and mallory was always upgrading the technology most of the appliances had secret lives of their own and functions that he could only guess at but the one that he resented most was the hightech coffeemaker as a confirmed luddite he preferred his brew untouched by computer chips this morning he ground his own beans as usual percolated the coffee over an oldfashioned gas flame then carried the cup and saucer across the hall to a door that bore the gold letters of buder and company on frosted glass once it had said mallory and butler but again the police department had frowned upon this flagrant breach of policy against using investigative skills in the private sector the absence of her name on the door was at least an attempt at discretion charles took a deep breath while fitting his key in the lock he would only have six seconds to disable the burglar alarm all the time that mallorys programming would allow him and he was not likely to forget that ever the deafening siren had once jangled his brain and entirely cured his absentmindedness but the door was not locked well this was not a promising start to any day not in new york city only two other people had keys his cleaning woman mrs ortega never came this early and his business partner never came this late he glanced at his wristwatch right about now mallory would be entering the soho police station her only legally sanctioned workplace he pushed open the door and found that the reception area was in good order and nothing appeared to be missing the antique furniture in this room was costly but burglars would probably prefer more portable items like mallorys wildly expensive electronics he walked down a narrow hallway to the back rooms moving at the leisurely pace of a man who is heavily insured mallorys private office was dimly lit by the glow of a computer projection on a large pulldown screen he stared at the wallsize portrait of a redheaded child standing nine feet tall a smaller scale of this same picture appeared on three computer monitors but for some reason the detective felt the need to see this little girl blown up so absorbed was mallory that she had not noticed him yet charles watched one painted image blend into another in this new portrait the redhaired girl wore the uniform of a private school and she posed with her legs draped over the upholstered arms of a chair just a trace of white underpants was showing computer clicks and whirs announced the next painting and this one was memorable this was the jewel of the quentin winter collection the only major work of art by an otherwise minor painter this was the artists child and she was naked there was only a gentle swelling where breasts would be one day more paintings clicked by in quick succession and he felt like a voyeur watching nedda winter go through all the stages of her prepubescent life nine feet tall on mallorys wall a young giant do you see what i see asked mallory without turning around so much for being able to walk up behind her unnoticed after the next click mallory was once again bathed in the light of the famous red winter painting he well understood her question well the artist wouldnt be the first to paint his own child au nature that bastard singled her out said mallory nedda was one of nine kids he painted a lot of nude women but she was the only child you believe he molested his daughter based on nothing more than a painting im ninety percent sure charles did not care for the sound of that he would prefer not to go to certain corners of mallorys early life undoubtedly the source of her expertise turning to face the projection on the wall he recalled a wallet photo that his old friend louis markowitz had carried a small portrait of his foster child at the age of the young girl on the wall kathy mallory had possessed those same wary eyes her early days on the streets had been hard and hardening nedda winter however had been a child of wealth and luxury not at all the same case and this might argue for a troubled home life in winter house and molestation his mind now poisoned he had to wonder against his will if the title word red denoted the color of young neddas hair or her rape mallory switched on the overhead fluorescent tubes and the room became entirely too bright light bounced off glass monitors gleaming metal furnishings and electronic components the carpet was an institutional gray no doubt selected to disguise the wood floors as cement she crossed the room heading toward the steel blinds that hid the graceful lines of arched windows her computers were dead for the moment when they were powered up they hummed in communication with one another and she with them when the machines were alive the psychological temperature of her private office was always ten degrees below a normal persons comfort zone the viewing screen was raised with the press of a remotecontrol button and sent rolling back up into its metal cylinder near the ceiling molding a cork bulletin board that spanned the entire wall was now exposed with all its papers pinned up at perfect right angles and each sheet was equidistant from the next mallorys pushpin style had machine precision if her lovely face was incongruous in these environs what lay beneath was not and what truly moved him what touched him most was that she could have no idea that this room exposed her personal quirks her own clicks and whirs all the most chilling departures from her fellow creatures this office was mallory naked for all to see so vulnerable and what did she see when she looked at him was it something sad and pathetic or was he comical in her eyes they could never tell one another the truth they were friends all right said mallory lets say quentin winter molested his daughter could you make a case for the girl as a spree killer what nedda i was under the impression that an outsider killed all those people an ice pick killed them she said and that dead burglar the other night he wasnt killed with the shears it was a pick to the heart same as all the victims in the massacre i see the problem he sat down at the edge of mallorys desk back in the forties did anyone suspect the child no but i might ah but then mallory suspected everyone of something so i gather said charles that the father had multiple stab wounds no it was a single strike to the heart all nine victims here he might point out that this indicated no rage zero animosity but mallory had not asked him to point out flaws in her logic and now he had to wonder if she was putting herself in nedda winters place perhaps this was the way mallory would have done it as a child in cold blood efficient and quick revenge he said mulling over this idea so she kills her father for molestation and then she does in the witnesses all those people nedda was what twelve years old very tall for twelve mallory powered up the computer to display the red winter painting and there was the evidence in the childs proportions relative to her surroundings and after the massacre this girl didnt wait around for the cops i thought the newspapers ran with the theory of a psychotic killer and a kidnapping so did the cops said mallory what of it its my case now this killer was cold and precise you cant see it can you a very cold little girl working her way through the house stabbing all those people he could but it was a smaller version of mallory and he would be a long time getting that picture out of his head she blanked the screen the only other option is a professional hitman with a money motive nothing personal just a neat quick job but theres a hole in that theory all right i see the stumbling block and this time he found no fault in her logic if the children are the only ones who profit from the trust fund then who paid for the no thats not it i could work around that all right a moment to regroup thank you professional killers dont usually kidnap children they never do she inclined her head prompting him to continue and its probably quite alarming to have one turn up in a house full of people so far so good no stumbles yet whereas a member of the family could move through the house at leisure taking victims by surprise without alerting the entire household she nodded to say now you ve got it well not to be argumentative he held up his hands even realizing that this was a defensive posture that said dont shoot me all right its only conjecture heres another scenario what if it was a professional assassin and what if nedda saw him in time to make a run for it charles knew he was making a mistake in offering his own theory but he could not stop himself the killer would have to chase her down wouldnt he suppose he lost her outside maybe in the park across the street then youd have a little girl who thought she couldnt go home again home was where the monster would be waiting for her so the theory of a runaway child could it works for me riker stood in the open doorway wearing a suit and tie of a different color otherwise it would not have been apparent that he had changed his clothes from yesterday yeah a runaway good work charles the man smiled and this was tantamount to squaring off against mallory when he faced her and said i dont think nedda winter killed all those people mallorys arms folded across her breast in a warning sign that she was not happy with this division in the ranks riker shrugged and lit a cigarette to say well thats just tough and now she turned on innocent charles who had only offered the most so she said im guessing nedda didnt volunteer any details about where shed been for the past fiftyeight years no said charles sorry i never thought to ask did you get us anything asked riker anything at all maybe he said breakfast anyone long ago bittys room had belonged to robert the reader eight years old with thick lenses in his spectacles that made his blue eyes larger more tender each time nedda winter entered this bedroom she saw her brother sprawled on the window seat a book held by small dead hands a tiny hole in his pajamas and a bit of blood from his young heart nedda sat down at the edge of the bed and lifted a glass to bittys lips just drink it dear you dont want to know whats in it her niece obediently swallowed a mixture of raw egg milk and steak sauce my father favored that hangover remedy said nedda was he a drunk well yes dear but in those days who wasnt she took the emptied glass and set it on the bedside table and he only drank after three oclock he had rules was my grandfather a violent man ah back to the theory of edwina winters murder no the only thing that aroused any passion in him was a fight with my stepmother sometimes lionel got a light swat on his backside he was always getting in between his parents trying to protect his mother not that she needed any help she always had something heavy in her hand whenever she went after my father i cant imagine uncle lionel as a boy i think you wouldve liked him then he was the only one of the children who ever stood up to my father he was a brave one i loved him for that did you love your father yes but lionel loved him more sometimes i think he took those hits just to get daddys attention bitty pushed her covers aside then after a grimace of pain thought better of moving so rashly she lay back on her pillow what about the others do you remember sally of course she was the baby of the family a newborn she cried a lot thats why the nursery was at the top of the house and she wasnt well i remember a steady stream of doctors marching up the staircase to examine her what was my mother like she was only five when i left a very loving child big sunny smile poor little cleo she mustve thought that id abandoned her and i suppose i did aunt nedda im so sorry about last night that business about your mother she turned her face into the pillow its all right bitty i told you i never knew my own mother your murder theory didnt upset me at all i know my father didnt kill her his second wife alice was a copy of edwina what does that tell you he loved her madly once before i was born they were separated for a week they wrote to each other every day their love letters are in her trunk up in the attic you should read them i know all the lines by heart a small voice screamed what it was rags the lame cockatiel had left its cage and now worked its way up the bedspread climbing toward its mistress by beak and claw poor thing said nedda what happened to him why cant he fly his wing was crushed by the window sash it just fell on him no it slammed on him i saw it happen mother said the house doesnt like birds no it doesnt said nedda every year after the first frost wed find a dead bird outside on one of the window ledges the house doesnt like flies either she stared at the dead dry insect on bittys sill thats what old mrs tully used to say she was the housekeeper when i was a little girl tully always said you might see a dead fly every now and then but youll never hear a live one buzz at least not for long was she insane bittys hand flew up to cover her mouth as if she had just committed a social faux pas calling attention to an infirmity in front of a cripple and now realizing her blunder she seemed on the verge of tears nedda gave her niece a smile of reassurance then dipped one hand into the pocket of her robe theres something else we have to talk about she withdrew a small worn box and held it up for bitty to see remember this last night at dinner the box was heavily lacquered cardboard not machine made but one of a kind handcrafted and painted with the tarot image of the hanged man a memento mod from days in hell nedda opened the box and pulled out the deck the card of destruction an image of a burning tower was on the top tell me where you found my tarot cards the bookcases that lined charles buders library were fifteen feet tall necessitating a ladder slanting from the topshelf railing to the floor high in the air he rolled along on its wheels as he searched for the volume that mallory wanted a friend of my fathers gave it to me he said my new york history section would be incomplete without it though he had never considered reading the book it had been stored on the upper shelf with similar volumes after perusing the first page he had found the writing inferior but it would have been bad manners and literary heresy to toss the book in die trash now where was it well this was embarrassing the book was not where it ought to be a few years might have passed since he had placed it here but how could it be lost after generations of librarians had inculcated him with rules he was virtually incapable of losing a book by placing it on a shelf out of order each volumes spine was tagged with the library of congress number to ensure against such losses but now he noticed that none of the books on the top shelf were in their proper places no this could not happen not to him he glanced down at mallory she was staring at his recently delivered club chairs six of them arranged in a circle in their midst one might expect to find oh say a priceless piece of furniture with a provenance dating back to and great historical significance however inside the wide circle of chairs there was nothing but his memory of a page from an antique catalogue she lifted her face to his charles youve been robbed no i gave away my card table after i bought another one it wouldve been delivered this morning if not for a warehouse fire last night he turned back to his problem of the lost book and discovered that the top shelf was free of dust all was clear to him now apparently his cleaning woman had actually dusted up here fifteen feet in the air then rearranged all the books by height so the line of the topmost shelf would not appear so uneven mrs ortegas mania for neatness was second only to mallorys rather than undo all of the womans hard work he politely memorized the new order of his books mallory called up to him from the foot of the ladder so you thought a new table might improve your poker game no well yes charles was not as crippled by magical thinking as some people but historical memorabilia could be psychologically empowering and in the game of poker you know she said youd have to cheat to beat those bastards he sighed she was right psychology would not save him he had the wrong sort of face for the game expressions that gave up every thought and emotion worse he had inherited his mothers deep red blush that made a lie or a bluff nearly impossible to pull off regrettably he had been genetically programmed to be an honest man and a poor poker player the bastards as mallory affectionately called them were the charter members of a very old floating poker game upon the death of her foster father louis markowitz charles had inherited a seat in the game and three new friends next week the poker game would have been in his apartment played at an antique table once graced by a famous politician and worldclass card player the table wasnt exactly new president ulysses s grant once sat in on a game at oh what the hell that bit of history was burned to a crisp he knew that mallory took a dim view of the weekly poker game it was entirely too friendly for her tastes only pennyante stakes or as she would say chump change she also objected to wild cards that changed with the phases of the moon or the dates for recycled trash pickups once she had complained that the game was a close cousin to an old ladys bingo night at church this week said charles the games at robins house if you want to come im sure theyll all be happy to play by your rules apparently fleecing her fathers old friends in a fast game of cutthroat robandrun poker was hardly tempting fat chance said her eyes however she did run one hand over the new chairs approving the grade of leather he rolled the ladder down to the end of the wall and his eyes locked onto the title he had been searching for found it its roughly a thousand pages this news seemed to pain her can you give me the gist of it i never read it he looked down at his copy of the winter house massacre not my sort of thing its that bad well the information should be sound enough the authors an accredited historian now i wish i had read it wouldve saved me some embarrassment last night he climbed down the ladder to stand beside mallory you mightve warned me that nedda was red winter honest surprise worked better she stared at the dust jacket and its single drop of illustrated blood but i knew the story of winter house what new yorker born and bred did not where does the advantage of surprise come in mallory patiendy waited him out and now he must admit that he had not even recognized the address while visiting the crime scene and like most people who believe they know all the details of historical events he had not understood the significance of an ice pick in winter house of all houses last night she said it wouldve been suspicious if you knew who nedda was shes right said a voice behind him charles turned to see riker walking across the library a cup of coffee in hand and probably wondering when the rest of his breakfast would be ready the detective lacked the patience for homemade croissants dont feel bad said riker after fiftyeight years only a cop wouldve made the connection to nedda winter and not just any cop it even took me awhile and i was raised on that story the only name most people knew her by was red winter mrs ortegas vacuum cleaner preceded her into the library and all conversation stopped the wiry little woman with dark spanish eyes and a brooklyn accent said pick up your damn feet as she moved the sucking nozzle perilously close to rikers scruffy shoes she switched the machine off just long enough to curl her lip while passing judgment on his suit after pulling a wad of paper slips from her apron she stuffed them into the mans breast pocket those are drycleaning coupons you know what you have to do and now the vacuum powered up to move back and forth across the rug charles handed the book to riker and raised his voice to be heard over the noise here a gift might be rather dry reading this author is known for that i read it said riker you what the vacuum cleaner switched off and mrs ortega observed a moment of silent disbelief previously this detective had only admitted to reading the sports pages and never mind the books cover art lurid drop of painted blood aside this was a thick book she steered the vacuum cleaner out of the room with mutterings of damn miracles as an apology for literacy riker shrugged and said i had to read it the massacre was my bedtime story when i was a kid he hefted the book in one hand but this wouldnt have helped you last night the guy who wrote it never mentioned neddas real name he only calls her red winter so much for historians huh he opened the volume to the title page my copys autographed when they were all seated around the table in charless kitchen the batch of ovenwarm croissants quickly disappeared the detectives had not paused to savor the buttery flakes they had inhaled them with their coffee then made short work of the crepes now and then one of them would stop feeding to extract information from him rather than relying on his recollection of events perhaps he was inclined to be too wordy possibly trying their short at the time of the murders said mallory keeper of the body count there were nine children and four adults living in winter house and four children survived the massacre charles used a napkin to mark the book page that would allow him to recite their names in birth order but there re only three left said mallory you didnt buy the story of sally winter as a runaway i didnt say that i said it didnt quite ring true in all the details lionel had an odd reaction that i couldnt put down to oh how should i put this put it briefly said riker if you werent such a good cook mallory wouldve shot you twenty minutes ago she nodded as if in agreement while reading the marked passage on the youngest winter child this author follows cleo and lionel from grammar school through the college years hes got dates of enrollments and graduations but all hes got on sally is her date of birth she looked up at charles could be another homicide did you question them about it well no after bittys little exhibition on the staircase the rest of them were sliding into shock it would have been rude to ask if theyd murdered baby sally by the rapid clicking of mallorys pen he deduced that a simple no would have sufficed good for bitty said riker who was apparendy allowed to make extraneous remarks between forkfuls of strawberry crepes i never thought she had it in her she had to get drunk to do it said charles shes a passiveaggressive personality it was wildly out of character to how aggressive mallory leaned forward liking this detail oh not in the physical sense shell take a sniper shot from the woods but its strictly verbal i think nedda was being truthful when she confessed to killing that burglar the other night bitty simply could not have done that i never thought she did said mallory and her tone was a rather pointed reminder that she had said as much the other night and disliked repeating herself bittys a mouse riker was more charitable but last night she nailed her whole family im guessing that was a tactic to get attention said charles bittys emotional maturity is a bit stunted what gave her away asked riker was it the prom dress or the teddy bears in her room charles ducked this sarcasm by filling his mouth with food last night the significance of bittys outlandish makeup and dinner dress had nearly escaped him at first he had believed that her mother must have engineered that fashion travesty later he had realized his error cleo wintersmyth would never have taken that much interest in her daughter the mother had simply neglected to save her child from ridicule the absence of parental bonding would explain a great deal and now he quietly cleaned his plate having learned not to volunteer any more elaborate explanations riker wore a satisfied smile as he laid his napkin to one side so its a dysfunctional family a bit more bizarre than that said charles filling rikers coffee cup and instantly forgetting all his lessons in brevity theres no real family dynamic theyre like islands all of them i had the distinct feeling that sheldon smyth was only going through the motions of playing a father to bitty same thing with cleo and lionel correct responses without any matching nuances in tone or expression i got it said riker like a pack of aliens imitating a human family exactly it suggests you havent mentioned nedda yet mallory tapped her pen on the table how did she fit in she didnt id say she was more of a watcher on the sidelines though i did see genuine affection for bitty and there was a bit of tension with her sister and brother nedda never exhibited any aberrant behaviorif thats what youre asking but shes been away for a long time said riker we think shes been institutionalized well i could be wrong said charles but in a case like that youd expect to see more signs of vm positive said mallory and i know it wasnt prison we ran her prints no criminal record charles pushed back from the table so you think shes been in an asylum all these years well then that dinner party shouldve made her feel quite at home but she was the normal one at the table and quite charming he could see that riker was also rejecting mallorys idea of nedda as a certified lunatic with a bloody past this detective was charless only ally in the theory of an innocent runaway child the man seemed very much on neddas side wanting to believe in her however when the subject turned to an old deck of tarot cards produced at the dinner table last night a deck belonging to nedda winter the light in rikers eyes simply died a light breakfast had revitalized bitty smyth and now she climbed toward the top of the house almost cheerful as she led the expedition to the attic following close behind her niece nedda winter pressed close to the banister to avoid treading upon the corpses of her stepmother and her father on the third floor they passed the door to henrys room where the budding artist four years of age lay dead among his sticks of chalk and pencils and drawing papers her little brother wendell only seven when he died lay on the floor of the next room upward they climbed passing a hall closet where her nineyearold sister erica huddled in terror and absolute darkness listening for the footsteps of a monster and hoping that death would pass her by nedda trod quietly past this door and fancied that she could hear the beat of a childs wild heart im so sorry the staircase narrowed as they approached the last landing below the attic here she skirted a small corpse on the stairs mary had escaped the nursery in a twoyearolds version of mad flight and she had died in a toddle down the steps the dead were invisible to bitty who resided solidly in the present nedda lived much of her life in the past where the nanny on the hallway carpet was more recently deceased the flesh still warm and the bit of blood on her breast had not yet dried nedda looked down at the face of this teenager gwen rawly who had previously believed that she was immortal the girls lips were parted as if to ask why beyond the young nannys body was the door of the nursery it was closed in the current century bitty and nedda paused beneath the great glass dome that crowned the fourth floor and divided the two attics here the stairs were split like a forked tongue the steps curving to their right led to the north attic used for storage bitty climbed toward the south attic a repository for personal effects of the dead this was a family custom begun in the eighteen hundreds following her niece nedda entered the narrow room of slanting rafters and the old familiar smells of rotting history and dust it was illuminated by a row of small gabled windows and appeared to be unchanged early memories were clear pictures in her mind all that she had had to feed upon for so many years she looked at the trunks stacked in rows and representing generations of her forebearers the contents were the odds and ends of life on earth her eyes gravitated to her mothers trunk as a child she had spent many hours counting up the dresses lace handkerchiefs hairpins and such souvenirs of a woman who had loved her a woman who had died when nedda was too young to memorize her living face this morning she passed it by following her niece between the rows of the murdered winters adults and children you know what this place reminds me of bitty reached up to pull on strings that switched on the overhead bulbs as she walked the length of the attic early christian catacombs corpses stacked up like cordwood of course there are no actual bodies all the brass plates on this row of trunks had been polished by a ringer through the dust the better to make out the letters etched in oldfashioned script nedda knelt on the floor to read the names bitty squatted down beside her i couldnt find a trunk for baby sally its not in the north attic or the basement she looked up at her aunt sally had a trunk of her own didnt she yes dear we all did i remember sallys trunk was at the foot of her crib there had been no family conversation on this subject no catching up on one more death in the family she had asked no questions of lionel and cleo not wanting to open the door to any more sorrows and she had thought it unnecessary an early demise had been foretold for the baby on the day she was born her heart ailment had been some grave defect in the bloodline of quentin winters second wife alice you might find this interesting bitty reached behind the row of trunks and pulled out a canvas sack yellowed and cracked with age have a look nedda opened the drawstring and emptied the contents onto the floor among the clothing was a little girls sailor suit of rotted fabric the years had been unkind to these artifacts stored outside of the cedarlined trunks the next item retrieved from the pile was a christening gown and it fell apart in her hands all that held together was the little bit of material embroidered with sallys initials neddas hand passed over small moldy stuffed toys and books of nursery rhymes she tenderly picked through the rest of the clothing in the varying sizes of a growing child who had lived for three or four years following the massacre bitty folded the childs clothing and placed it in the sack my father said sally ran away the year that lionel turned twentyone so she wouldve been ten years old but wheres her trunk can you imagine a tenyearold girl dragging her trunk with her when she ran away from home no said nedda i cant sally had never run anywhere a legion of heart specialists had all predicted a very short life of invalidism did bitty know this nedda could not ask and there were other questions that would never be answered had sheldon smyth lied about sally running away from home or had someone cleo or lionel lied to him nedda had lost the heart to go on with this disturbance of the dead where is my trunk bitty stood up and walked to the end of the row of murdered children one trunk had been segregated from all the rest and pushed to the wall this one you were never legally declared dead but i guess they gave up on you after a while she opened the lid but this isnt where i found your tarot cards nedda joined her niece by the wall and read her own name on a brass plate in the context of this attic it was like viewing her gravestone she followed bitty to the far corner of the attic the resting place of an old standing trunk larger than all the others and plastered with travel stickers what was this old piece of luggage doing in the attic of dead winters bitty opened it like a closet i found uncle jamess passport in here and thats odd because he has a regular trunk like the others its stored in the north attic this is a steamer trunk said nedda your grandparents used it for ocean voyages she examined the drawers that lined one side in the last one she found a jumble of bright colors cheap gaudy clothing that stirred a memory i found a long red hair said bitty it was snagged in the tarot card box she turned to look at the bottom drawer her aunt had opened thats where i found the cards and there were short red clippings in all of those clothes so i wondered if your hair yes it was cut off very short short as a boys nedda recalled her waistlong hair falling to the floor the snip of the scissors it seemed like only this morning she had been sitting on a wooden chair in a small shabby room with tattered pulleddown shades while this mutilation covered the floor the red strands had come alive curling and writhing in the wake of a large cockroach moving through the pile of clippings and nedda had cried all the while listening to the steady beat of rain against the window the snip of scissors bitty pulled a dress from the lower drawer now this is the same size as the ones in your trunk but otherwise nothing like them indeed this was rather poor fare for the child of a wealthy family nedda well understood her nieces curiosity unable to get any reliable information from her family bitty had produced the tarot cards at the dinner table hoping for answers via surprise attack and now this gentle ambush i had a theory about sally said bitty i thought maybe years after the massacre you came back for her intrepid bitty the detectives talked as they walked through greenwich village breaking off their conversation whenever they were assailed by tourists with a wild lost look about them grid logic was abandoned here where west fourth street ran amok to bisect west tenth street two grayhaired people stood at this crossroad unable to move on gaping at the improbable street sign and willing it to make sense i cant believe were doing this annoyed mallory waved off this elderly couple souring the message on their ilovenewyork tote bags its not much farther riker flicked his cigarette into a gutter and its worth the trip this is the only place in town where you can find a tarot card reader and an icepick murder in one conveniently located square block its the neighborhood where stick man screwed up royally a killing close to home mallory opened her borrowed copy of the winter house massacre and removed the brochure she had used for a bookmark it had been written by the same author and now she reiterated the title with sarcasm a guided tour of murder in greenwich village the guy never made much money publishing the book bad writer if you ask me so he makes a living with this walking tour if youve already taken the tour why do we have to waste and there he is now riker nodded toward a small cluster of people on the sidewalk and their tour guide a middleaged chinless hairless man who was barely five feet tall martin pinwitty was addressing his less than rapt audience of outoftowners only tourists would politely listen to his monotonous drone while their eyes glazed over with fatigue any new york crowd would have left footprints on the authors face by now the man actually managed to bore them with the story of a mobfinanced killing machine and details of murders by gun and baseball bat and rikers personal favorite the ice pick the groups interest was suddenly revived when pinwitty told them that they were standing on the very site of an icepick murder they all looked down at their feet perhaps expecting to find bloodstains more than half a century later they always do that said riker hanging back with mallory at the edge of the tour group how many times did you take this tour something in her tone of voice implied that she had lost all respect for him i check in once a year this guys still doing research and his spiel is always changing martin pinwitty and his tour group walked a few paces down the sidewalk and the lecture continued the victim was a reporter who covered the hearings on murder incorporated in the early forties now that investigation was over years before this murder took place i believe the reporter had uncovered some new evidence on a professional assassin mallory glanced at riker who nodded saying i think he got this part right and the author droned on saying the police made a very thorough search of this area they spent days questioning all the residents on this block and then it was the fortunetellers turn he pointed to a narrow building across the street the womans storefront was right there the tour group turned in unison to stare at a bodega with neon signs for beer and smokes a drunk stood before its front window vomiting on his shoes yet this view held special charms for the sidewalk audience the police took great interest in the fortuneteller said pinwitty she was the only one they brought in for questioning at the police station and there she died according to the obituary it was a cerebral hemorrhage thats wrong said riker speaking low so as not to interfere with the dry static of the ongoing monologue it was way more interesting than that so whats the real story this is secondhand i was only a kid when i heard it and this was more than twenty years after it happened the detectives left the fortuneteller sitting on a bench for maybe five minutes while they freed up an interview room when they came back for the old lady the cop on guard duty was bending over her dead body the uniform tells the detectives she was sitting up one minute dead the next and there was nobody near her when she keeled over well theyre hunting for an icepick killer right and thanks to a slew of exhumed corpses in the early forties theyre hip to the ice pick in the eardrum it simulates a stroke well sure enough they shine a light in the womans ear and find blood from the pick now they interrogate the shit out of that cop the cop was dirty thats what the detectives figured maybe the uniform took a few bucks to look the other way or maybe he did in the old lady himself but no according to the other witnesses the cop just wasnt paying attention when somebody stopped to talk with his prisoner the old ladys visitor was only there long enough to say hello and goodbye a few seconds later the old woman slumps forward the cop jostles her shoulder and asks if shes okay thats when she falls to the floor stone dead the killer walked right into a police station and killed this woman right under their noses a real pro and the detectives covered it up you bet they did this happened maybe ten or twelve days after the winter house massacre the newspapers wouldve crucified the whole department so an icepick murder was passed off as a stroke and buried on the obituary page oh yeah he said as an afterthought and that old lady was no crystalball gypsy she only read tarot cards and she had a solid connection to the hitman riker nodded in pinwittys direction hes getting to that part now the author pointed upward to a window on the second floor after the fortuneteller was taken away that very night in fact that apartment was searched by detectives on previous calls the tenant had never been at home that night they didnt even bother to knock sadly the tenant was gone and so were his things no one was able to give the police a name or description in fact no one in the neighborhood could recall ever having seen the mysterious tenant even once though hed held the lease for years mallory nudged riker so the fortunetellers storefront was a drop site for money and the old lady brokered the hitmans murders yeah two different fortunetellers used the same location they were both murdered but pinwitty doesnt know that riker looked on as the author lost his audience one by one the escapees peeled off from the tour group but he did get a few things right he looked up to the secondfloor window when the detectives broke down the door that apartment was clean and i mean spotless no prints anywhere ballsy huh cops breathing down his neck and he takes the time to wipe down the walls and the furniture and now we ve got nedda winter with tarot cards at the dinner party said mallory you think stick man would kidnap a twelveyearold girl to replace his old fortuneteller its a stretch remember the girl disappeared from winter house twelve days before the fortuneteller died if stick man thought the cops were closing in on his drop point maybe he planned to break in the girl as his next tarot card reader before he killed the old woman nedda was tall for twelve she couldve passed for a teenager could be in fact riker had already thought of this but why would a hitman believe that a little girl might go along with that idea the spooky brat beside him read his mind maybe she said nedda wasnt all that broken up about the murders maybe she knew what was going to happen to her family before stick man showed up at the door riker gave this idea half a nod its possible there were too many possibilities and they might all be wrong mallory turned back to the author and his few remaining tourists he had moved on down the street to the scene of another crime she listened to the fading banter for another moment you said his research is an ongoing thing at the bottom of the stairs lionel was waiting for them bitty shrank back thinking of something better to do on the upper floor and she retreated sensible after last night bitty would not want a confrontation with her uncle nedda accepted a cup of coffee from her brothers hand she was so absurdly grateful for this small gesture and hoping for something more but he looked at her with such wariness and hate it was difficult to read lionels thoughts anymore as a child he had never been cold to her there had been a bond between them once the two eldest children against the confusing and sometimes violent world of their parents making when brother and sister were seated in the dining room nedda turned her gaze to the glasspaned doors that opened onto the back garden it looked so mournful now pruned back to a few shrubs and a single tree once there had been a swing attached to the lowest bough her brother had preferred the higher climbs the branches closer to the sky he had been a beautiful nimble boy with a sunbrowned face and perpetually skinned knees and now said lionel youre wondering about baby sally nedda shook her head no she had been hunting out of doors for some old memory to share with him a common ground she wanted only a bit of conversation and his company nothing more cleo and i were away at school when sally when she left ive given a lot of thought to that day it was nothing that we did we were old history nedda dismissed the rest of his words with a wave and now she wanted so much to reach across the table to take his hand in hers and tell him how good it was to be home however in this moment she was more the coward than bitty she anticipated lionel shrinking away from her touch withdrawing his hand and turning to ice her own hands remained folded in her lap martin pinwitty was beside himself with happiness two genuine homicide detectives were visitors in his humble home underscore the word humble there was only one room unless one counted the closet that housed a toilet and mallory did not the bathtub concealed by a broad wooden board did double duty as a table and the hideabed sofa had been hastily folded away one more sign of an impoverished makedo life mallory could guess how much of this mans meager income was daily sacrificed for stamps correspondence was piled on every surface that was not cluttered with pagemarked books the postmarks on his mail were wideranging and a few envelopes had the return addresses of police departments in other states on the way to his apartment pinwitty had insisted on stopping at a bodega so that he might treat them to doughnuts on this special occasion believing as all civilians did that this was a staple of every cops diet and now both detectives stuffed with charles butlers croissants and crepes ate their sugar doughnuts while feigning gratitude and swilling tea that was unspeakably bad riker shoveled more sugar into his cup so the reporter who died in the village that was the last icepick job for a professional assassin yes i believe it was said the author i have sources everywhere if theres an old unsolved murder with an ice pick i hear about it the pick was going out of vogue years before that man was murdered after scanning one of pinwittys files a lengthy list of muggings and murders mallory set it aside agreeing with riker that this was an amateur investigation what about the freak who killed the winter family you think he retired after the massacre oh definitely said pinwitty that or he died you know once i actually thought red winter had killed him a man was stabbed with an ice pick in the state of maine he stood up and walked to a bookshelf crammed with texts papers and manila envelopes i have a separate file for that one nothing ever came of it he pulled out a folder and smiled i even went up to maine for a few days to check it out this piqued mallorys interest for that little junket wouldve represented a lot of money for this impoverished little man pinwitty settled into a chair and opened the folder on his lap ill tell you what made this incident so interesting the victim of the stabbing was a man named humboldt rikers teacup was suspended in midair all attention suddenly riveted to the author and mallory had to wonder what that was about pinwitty continued humboldt once shared a cell with a murder suspect in new orleans the cellmate was charged with the icepick murder of a politician rikers cup clattered back to its saucer now this suspect the author paused to bring the page a bit closer to his nearsighted eyes oh i dont have a name for this one but i know it began with an h well no matter turned out the man was innocent thered been another murder while he was in custody however it occurred to me that red winter didnt know that and she might have mistaken humboldt for the suspected icepick killer maybe she heard a confused report of the new orleans murder you see the first time i heard this story more like a rumor actually humboldt was killed by a girl with red hair i postulated that red winter mightve hunted down the wrong man and killed the cellmate by mistake believing that humboldt was the one who murdered her parents mallory smiled ah the penalties of bad scholarship death and this happened when two years after the massacre i was originally led to believe that it happened much later than that in any case it wasnt red winter who killed humboldt she wouldve been a fourteenyearold child at that time when i went up to maine i discovered that he was killed by a fullgrown local woman at the time of this icepick homicide red winter would have been tall enough to pass for someone older mallory glanced at riker who nodded to say that this was also his thought unmindful of their silent conversation pinwitty continued his thought saying the stabbing wasnt premeditated either so that was another indication that my theory wouldnt work the police put it down to selfdefense it seems that the man broke into this womans bedroom and attacked her however i should mention that i got this information many years after the fact originally i only had one source for the story a very old man who later died in a nursing home there was no police report on file mallory and riker were both paying edgeofthechair attention oh i know what youre thinking said the author i also thought it was odd but this was a small town more like a truck stop and i couldnt interview the residents because there werent any a new highway project wiped out all the houses and public buildings the records of births deaths and taxes were relocated but police records simply didnt exist you see the town had a police force of one that was chief walter mcreedy i thought he might have taken the records with him when he retired so i hunted down his daughter susan she was rather young at the time of this incident barely remembers it now the woman who stabbed humboldt was a redhead and chief mcreedys daughter agreed with that much but after she had a minute or two to think it over she couldnt swear that red was the womans natural hair color in fact a minute later she thought otherwise she did recall that the woman was a local but couldnt remember her name susan mcreedy thought the redhead mightve been middleaged but then everyone seems old to a child of seven at any rate it was a wasted trip for me mallory held up her copy of the winter house massacre so theres nothing in your book about humboldt well no what would be the point he was only the cellmate of a man wrongly accused of an icepick murder that doesnt confer even a peripheral significance but the author had failed to see the significance of humboldts death by ice pick he had tripped over this large messy fact and not seen it mallory was undecided either martin pinwitty was more inclined to believe in coincidence than the average cop or he had not told them everything there was something not right about this little man and she could say the same for her own partner after warding off more stale doughnuts and bad tea the detectives escaped from the authors apartment with the borrowed file on the incident in maine riker paused on the stoop outside the building as if unable to go on nedda killed stick man said mallory he hanged himself with a slow nod riker was definitely holding out on her just as the daughter of the cop from maine had held out on martin pinwitty on the drive back to soho she waited for her partner to save himself to explain how he had recognized humboldts name a name he had never read in any book and he said nothing cleo appeared in the dining room with a coffee cup in hand nodding in neddas general direction as she sat down on lionels side of the dining room table the line of demarcation was always drawn this way two united against one did you sleep well nedda her sisters tone of voice might better fit the question why arent you dead yet after all nedda had unwittingly reneged on the prognosis the virtual promise of an early demise cleos eyes narrowed bittys not joining us this morning she had an early breakfast said nedda shes hiding isnt she not waiting for a response cleo rose from her chair and quit the room followed by lionel nedda was left alone and lonely the fantasy of her homecoming was in ashes she pulled the tarot deck from her pocket and bowed her head as she spread the cards on the table looking there for hope and finding the burning tower in every arrangement of painted images an old woman had given this deck to a very young nedda tapping the box illustration of the hanged man and saying memento mod a reminder of your mortality it had been a warning then but the child had failed to recognize it as such charles butler politely ended his longdistance telephone call to susan mcreedy in the state of maine then replaced the receiver in its antique cradle and shrugged his apologies to the two homicide detectives seated on the other side of his desk sorry miss mcreedy wasnt very helpful what do you think asked riker is the lady holding out oh definitely said charles the fact that she was suspicious and guarded would indicate as much and she had a few questions of her own where did i meet the redheaded woman what name did she go by now and how did i know the dead man was called humboldt she wasnt very happy when i didnt give her any answers youre a shrink said riker cant you give us more than that based on a telephone conversation charles sighed he hated the word shrink and it would not apply to him although he had the proper credentials and a special interest in abnormal bents of mind he had never had a private practice and never treated a single patient mallory leaned forward mcreedy lied to pinwitty didnt she it was a mistake to encourage her idea that he was a human lie detector her belief was founded on the fact that he could always tell when she was lying however this time she was correct ten years ago miss mcreedy had lied in her interview with the author the proof was all here in the folder that lay open on his desk pinwitty had been a wordforword recorder of conversations well if we begin by assuming this woman wanted to mislead pinwitty she did said mallory fine then the redhead who killed humboldt was young not middleaged id say the mystery womans hair was naturally red not dyed otherwise susan mcreedy wouldnt have made a point of mentioning that small detail while pretending to forget the womans name or what had become of her rather difficult to misplace a local murderess in a small town described as a truck stop and her defensive posturing on the phone might suggest a protective relationship with the missing redhead he shrugged to say that was all he had so youll be going up to maine to interview her no said mallory she call you back and when she does youll get more out of her than we would and you know this how she didnt brush you off said riker she asked a lot of questions that means youve got something she wants and shes wanted it for a long time said mallory good logic charles turned to the window looking up to a blue october sky and wondering where his own logic had flown how could he have been so far off the mark in his initial assessment of nedda winter i nearly forgot i gave miss mcreedy a date for the stabbing i was off by two days and she corrected me i think that was a slip on her part whats her profession a teacher something like that a librarian said mallory retired close enough so nedda winter was a fourteenyearold child when humboldt was stabbed to death you really believe that she yeah said riker everything fits ice picks seem to be her lifelong weapon of choice mallory leaned far back in her chair and charles was immediately on guard if she were a cat her tail would be switching like mad you like nedda winter dont you this was not a question she was making an accusation for miss winter was now solidly in the enemy camp mallory also turned a cold eye on riker no doubt suspecting him of the same treason i do like her said charles cant say i thought much of the rest of neddas relatives though bitty certainly deserved his pity you know its a dysfunctional family said riker when the one you like the best is a mass murderer chapter neddas body remained at rest there was no anxious wringing of hands nor was there any furtive sign of panic though she was alone the new housekeeper the latest in a parade of transient hires was out grocery shopping and bitty was off on some errand nedda had no idea where her brother and sister had gone lionel and cleo had simply walked out the door without a word to her and why not she was dead to them one did not consult with the dead about the days plans the sadness of this slight never showed in her eyes she continued to behave as if she were constantly being observed from all quarters of every room and would not betray any emotion that might be noted or charted poor bitty her niece must have had great hopes for the first family reunion nedda recalled the startled faces of cleo and lionel on the day they had visited the hospice what a grand surprise that had been bitty had dramatically thrown open the door to the private room and exposed their longlost sister whom they had always believed to be hoped to be dead true horror had set in after their barrage of questions which only a true sister could have answered finally cleo and lionel had been convinced that nedda was no grifter no fraudulent heiress and they had asked almost in unison why did you come back neddas joyful face had frozen into a fools grin and she had been trapped in that expression until her brother and sister had quit the room how mad she must have seemed to bitty in that next moment anguished crying foolish smiling mallory turned her small tan sedan eastward into the center lane of houston at the optimum time for the greatest flow of commuter traffic riker sat beside her unaware that anything was amiss in their relationship she braked to a full stop and killed the engine vehicles in flanking lanes whizzed by the drivers craning their necks at the odd sight of her stationary car in the middle of rush hour when all new york motorists went insane en masse the yellow cab behind her screeched to a halt and a long line of cars behind that one were also unable to change lanes mallory only stared at the windshield as if checking it for spots and bugs unruffled by the song of the city drivers honking putting great feeling into their horns leaning on them for maximum noise and the rising lyrics of shouted obscenities in peripheral vision she watched rikers head swivel in her direction silently asking what are you doing youre holding out on me she never raised her voice to be heard over the hell choir of honking and screaming and this forced riker to lean toward her straining to hear every word good she had his attention now when pinwitty mentioned humboldts name i know you recognized it but you didnt get it from a book or a oh sure said riker i know all of stick mans names bastard while she waited for him to elaborate on this little throwaway bombshell of his the trapped cars were stacked up all the way back to a gridlocked intersection the horns had doubled their number and volume and now a new note was added to the mix she could hear the angry tinny slams of compact cars and the heavymetal sound of trucks as drivers left their vehicles intent on laying some blame and taking some satisfaction out of her hide yeah right but one glance at riker told her that he was a believer in road rage a traffic jam like this one could make killers out of the besttempered nuns so tell me something mallorys words were slow and dead calm as if she had all damn day for this conversation when were you planning to share all these names an old man stood on the cement strip that divided the traffic bound east and west the elderly pedestrian had no stake in this event yet he was as outraged as any of the drivers gathering around her car he shook his fist and mouthed toothless angry words that were lost in the fray other men were massing near the windows on all sides riker held up his badge as if that would fix everything mallory slowly turned her head to glare at him to warn him he had better start talking and fast the people surrounding this car were murderously angry and this was definitely not the time for one of his longwinded stories and so riker told her a story charles butler sat at his desk reviewing paperwork on the latest client of butler and company this one was the most brilliant to date and the most troubled the teenager had dropped out of college descended into profound depression and continued his fall by dropping off the planet mallory had found a lead with an illegal perusalforprofit of police reports on missing persons she had then tracked the boy down to a hole in the swamp at the edge of the world her euphemism for a motel in new jersey during the employment evaluation all the right answers had been provided for every question on the personality profile and that had been a clue to a problem no one was so well balanced however the first warning had been the boys rolled down sleeves on an unseasonably warm day mallory had suspected drugs charles had believed the sleeves would hide the scars of an attempted suicide he looked up from his reading and noticed his copy of the winter house massacre lying on the end table by the couch so mallory had decided not to read it after all wise what a deadly bore was history in the hands of a bad writer he turned back to the matter at hand reading his business partners most recent research on their young job candidate she had turned up a history of no less than six therapists thus explaining how the youngster had sailed through all the psychological examinations practice charles read the headings for each of mallorys documents all of them had been raided from hospital computers in the tristate area she could not have gotten them by any other means even at one remove from theft it would be unethical to read this material and what would mallorys foster father have said of this theft of confidential patient files thats my kid and louis would have said that with great pride thoughts of this dead man linked up with the image of nedda winter skirting her ghosts on the staircase the night of the dinner party he had never mentioned that to mallory as an indication of a mind gone awry if that held true then he must count himself as a loon and a half the brown armchair beside the couch was the most comfortable seat in this office and yet he never sat there it was louiss chair even now that good old man had sat in this room on many a night when sleep was impossible because his wife was dead in a way all of louiss stories of life with the incomparable helen markowitz had been ghost stories had she not come alive in this room after a time charles had also come to grieve for helen though he had never met her and he still grieved sorely for louis he missed that great soul every day and charles could see his old friend clear as day seated beside him now gathering up hounddog jowls in a dazzling smile and was there just a touch of pity in the old mans crinkled brown eyes oh yes only louis could fully appreciate charless predicament with mallorys purloined documents as the former commander of special crimes unit inspector markowitz had made such good use of his foster childs skill with computer lock picks charles looked down at the raided information poisonous fruit from mallorys hand well it was definitely in a good cause life and death if his suspicions about their client proved true he read every line of the stolen data and discovered that each of the boys psychiatric examinations had followed police custody for a suicide attempt on halloween and what were the odds that he might forgo his yearly wristslashing well job placement was out of the question but now he could make the proper referral for longterm therapy mallory may have saved the boys life with this information stolen or not charles looked up at the armchair louiss chair his old friend the dead man shrugged then splayed one hand to say this is how it begins the seduction charles found himself nodding in agreement with a man who was not there yes he had actually rationalized a breach of ethics an unnecessary violation in truth mallorys theft had only supported his own suspicions he was actually quite good at his craft though he applied his skill to analyzing a potential clients gifts and suitability for employment retiring to the couch he stretched out to finish his reading in comfort he was surprised to turn a page and find mallorys job proposal for placing the boy in a remote scientific community there he would not be a solitary freak but one of many such freaks and he would cease his ritual attempts to kill himself every halloween this had been mallorys argument for selling an unbalanced job candidate oh of course never mind the fee and here he countered with her own trademark line yeah right mallory the humanitarian had also secured the client on the profit side of this transaction the new mexico think tank was funded with a truly obscene amount of grant money best of all and this was her final salvo the personnel director had not balked at the disclosure of the boys suicidal ideation and the project would provide longterm therapy thus far this was the only argument for job placement all that remained was the detail of signing off on mallorys paperwork he slowed his reading to a normal persons pace for his partner sometimes deviated from the standard boilerplate contract and he had learned to go slowly and scrutinize every line before signing anything true to form she had named a staggering fee that he would never have had the gall to charge and her conditions straddled a borderland between ethics and all that the traffic would bear she had added a penalty clause doubling their fee if the new mexico project failed to keep the boy alive through halloween charles stared at the ceiling averting his eyes from the laughing dead man reading that final contract clause in the best possible light mallory was not actually planning to profit on a death no she only wanted to ensure the boys ongoing survival he turned to face his memory of the late louis markowitz who knew her best the old man lifted one eyebrow to say but you re not really sure are you charles on a normal day he would be madly rewriting the terms of mallorys contract but now he simply bowed to the absurd and signed his name on the dotted line done with the business of the day he turned his attention to the telephone on the other side of the room willing it to ring he was looking forward to another conversation with susan mcreedy the lady from maine mallory had insisted that the woman would call again the detectives contracts were a bit dicey but her instincts were superb yes ms mcreedy would definitely call back he could see the woman clearly now sitting by her own telephone her hair gone to gray and her life as well facing the tedium of her retirement years this very moment all of ms mcreedys thoughts would be consumed by old acquaintance with a memorable icepickwielding redhead he reached out to the near table and picked up his history book as he turned the pages he marveled anew that riker could have ingested this dry text without the skill of speed reading and the mercy of a quick end while scanning the pages charles revisited mallorys theory on a twelveyearold girls involvement in the winter house massacre in a bibliophiles act of heresy he threw the book across the room next he abandoned logic replacing it with faith and feeling he liked nedda winter between dinner at eight and the last bottle of wine in the early hours of a morning he had come to think of her as a friend head bowed over her plate nedda winter finished supper in the kitchen then disregarded the automatic dishwasher to clean her plate in the sink she planned to retire early and spare her siblings one more encounter though she craved their company any company at all rather than to be alone that state where memory consumed her one benign recollection was of mrs tully wide as she was tall the cook and housekeeper who had died in the massacre this kitchen had been that old womans domain and october had been tullys favorite time of the year for weeks in advance of halloween she had always been allowed free rein to terrify her employers offspring that last time when five of the winter children had only a few more days to live they had all gathered in the kitchen all except baby sally the youngsters rocking on the balls of their feet had wafted back and forth between terror and delight and then the longawaited moment came when the housekeeper threw open the cellar door to absolute darkness and led them all down the stairs fiveyearold cleo had alternately laughed and squealed in anticipation before tully had even begun her scary work erica who had turned nine that year was much more ladylike practicing to be blase and determined that the old woman would not make her scream and the rest of them could hardly wait to be scared witless i never use mousetraps the old woman said as she led the parade of children into the dank basement by the light of a single candle she held the flame below her face to make it seem evil when she grinned at them no traps wont do might catch a child or two by mistake and break your little fingers and toes but no fear the house likes you all of you but the house hates vermin kills em dead it does tully had bent low to hold her candle over the small moldering body of a field mouse underneath a fallen box another mouse was found crushed by a wrench that had dropped from a shelf of tools looks accidental dont it but look around you my little dears did you ever see so many accidents in one place and then she had laughed highthroated wicked shining candlelight into corners illuminating other tiny corpses caught and crushed in the circumstances of apparent mishaps so many of them erica screamed nedda glanced at the clock on the kitchen wall she should go upstairs now lionel and cleo might come home at any moment after passing through the dining room she walked toward the stairs at an odd angle so that she might avoid the prone and lifeless mrs tully in her plain gray dress nedda began her ascent by hugging the rail and keeping to a narrow path so as not to tread on any part of her fathers body she paused as she always did farther up the staircase was her stepmothers corpse a small spot of blood marred the breast of a blue silk dressing gown and the eyes were rolled upward as if mortified to be seen in this unflattering sprawl of limbs nedda lifted one foot for she had just stepped on her fathers dead white hand sorry so sorry she looked down at his upturned face his startled eyes so surprised to be dying behind her she heard the familiar voice of uncle james calling out to her from across the room and more than half a century asking in a plaintive tone my god nedda what have you done mallory climbed the stairs behind her partner his new apartment was located on the floor above a saloon rikers big dream my grandfather was never on the case he said but the old man worked it on the side worked it all his life he visited every crime scene where an ice pick was used as weapon after opening the door and flicking on the light he waved her inside mallory remained standing while her partner flopped down on the couch raising a cloud of dust from the cushion every littered surface was filmed with gray though he had only occupied this place for a few weeks where was he getting his dust supply so your grandfather covered domestic disputes and bar fights everything said riker have a seat what for misunderstanding her he stood up and with no offense taken swept the leather seat of an armchair to send his unopened mail and smaller unidentified flying objects to the floor there you go she sat down careful not to touch the padded arms for she could not identify what he had spilled there next she flirted with the idea that be hod brought some of his trash from the last apartment perhaps regarding this formidable collection of crushed beer cans as a homey touch why would your grandfather cover the nickelanddime scenes its not like he expected them to tie back to stick man my father thought that was strange too in mallorys honor riker walked about the room bending low to pick up dirty socks and stuff them behind the couch pillows when granddad retired he lost access to crime scenes so dad collected all the details for him and now you do it and when would they ever get to the reason why she tapped one foot as riker opened the refrigerator and pulled out two cold beers accepting one from his hand she asked him again why riker what can you learn from gardenvariety stabbings every way you can stab another human with an ice pick this time he eased himself down on the couch cutting the dust fly by half the lead detective ruled out a pro in favor of a psycho but not my grandfather gran developed a signature for stick man now this is something you wont see in a rage killing the pick was pushed into the body perfectly level to pass through the rib cage no false strikes no bone chips ever just perfect the picks were honed narrow and needle sharp easier to pass through clothes and muscle then stick man made a little jog to the right and shredded the heart that enlarged the entry wound he eased the pick out no blood fly that way and he wiped the bloody end on the victims clothing he could ve slaughtered a battalion without getting a drop on his clothes after granddad retired my father used his clout to pull hundreds of old autopsy reports and they found matches there was no other stab wound quite like stick mans he used that same mo for almost a hundred years the cops caught him twice and twice he died a ghost story mallorys hands balled into fists she hated ghost stories nedda backed away from the staircase then stopped dead stop what was that the million fine hairs of her body were on the rise as she sorted out the noises of the house a light slap on glass came from the garden where a leafy branch licked the panes of the doors elsewhere a clock was ticking she turned around looking across the front room to the foyer and the burglar alarm there was no glowing light to assure her that the alarm was working she rationalized this away the new housekeeper had not set the alarm before going out and that was common enough they never stayed very long and few of them had found the time or inclination to memorize the daily change of the code that disabled the alarm upon reentering the house was the door even locked another noise a knock then a thud was followed by the sound of breaking glass nedda drifted across the room and down the hall toward the kitchen the source of her fear she could not stop herself though her legs threatened to buckle and fail she was like one of those elderly women on the hospital ward driven by a compulsion she could not name her limbs moving of their own accord on the kitchen threshold now eyes on the cellar door fascinated and afraid she was moving toward it one hand trembled on the knob and she opened the door to absolute silence that moment between one footstep and the next the still vacuum of holding ones breath and now she heard another noise by the dim light filtering downstairs from the kitchen she saw a mousetrap at the edge of the first step she wanted so much to believe that it was a rodent down there a big one with enough weight to make the sound of crunching glass underfoot but she was not so gifted at delusional thinking nedda backed away from the door keeping her eyes trained upon it as she reached out for the nearest drawer this was where bitty had found the old wooden ice pick the other night the one used to satisfy the curiosity of detective riker and now that pick was in neddas hand she backed out of the kitchen never taking her eyes off the door until she turned and ran lightfooted down the hall heading for the staircase bittys room on the floor above had a good strong bolt on the door nedda gripped the banister and stood there very still one foot upon the stair she shook her head she could not hide she could not take the chance what if this intruder surprised the next innocent to come through the front door well she would call the police and say what i hear noises in my house my burglar alarm isnt working the night of the breakin she could not remember having the luxury of time to question what she should do next nedda looked down at the ice pick in her hand she could do it again riker stood on a chair to reach the box at the back of his closet he hoisted it down and dropped it on the floor at mallorys feet i was just a kid then every night after dinner theyd spread all this stuff on the kitchen table mom called our kitchen the murder room he lifted the box and carried it to his own kitchen table the earliest cases date back to the eighteenhundreds but they all used stick mans signature they ended in the forties the year of the massacre somewhat mollified by rikers hasty disavowal of a ghost story mallory asked how many generations of hitmen three he sat down at the table and opened the box the first one was a crazy little bastard in hells kitchen he worked for the irish gangs started when he was only thirteen back in those days they called him pick what really spooked the locals was the daylight killing he d walk up to a guy on the street at high noon and just do him on the spot too crazy to worry about witnesses right and who wants to make an enemy of the neighborhood nutcase so everybody knew who he was even the local beat cop and nobody talked riker pulled out a handful of yellowed papers and photographs diagrams and scraps of paper with notes in faded ink he tapped a picture cut from an ancient newspaper and preserved in laminate this is his mother smart lady she was the broker for all his jobs and surprise she read tarot cards that was her front for the murder contracts and she never did one day in prison well her son was nuts and i mean a real standout kind of crazy but the mother paid off the cops when they started asking questions then one day theres a new commission to investigate police corruption so the cops run out and pick up her son just for show that closes a few dozen homicides in an afternoon and the department really shines in the morning paper he grinned at mallory dont you love this town thats when pick died the first time no not yet after the arrest he was committed to an asylum and thats where he hooks up with his replacement an orderly named jay holly riker had covered every inch of the table laying out his files in stacks of a dozen folders each one another death you wont find this stuff in police reports or history books pinwittys research was pathetic next to granddads he found a mug shot from a new orleans police department and handed it to mallory thats jay holly he did a deal with the fortuneteller wait she put out a contract on her her own son yeah her crazy son was too dangerous to keep alive it was just a matter of time before his mother was tied to the murders riker shuffled through more papers producing a list of assets expensive homes and purchases beyond a fortunetellers means but the old lady didnt wanna give up a good income so she hired jay holly to kill her son in the asylum pick was smothered with a pillow he pushed an old copy of the death certificate across the table mallory glanced at the date then picked up a column cut from a yellowed newspaper and five days after that theres another icepick murder all right i get it she pays jay holly to make her dead son look like an innocent man now the old ladys in the clear too yeah riker placed another file in front of her another death and then the next day shes back in business said mallory as the new hitmans broker but the cops dont bother her anymore my grandfather wouldve loved you kid yeah thats the way he figured it jay and the old lady did real well until she died of a stroke more likely it was murder there was no autopsy granddad figured that mustve been the first instance of the pick in the eardrum another fortuneteller took over the same storefront and this one was young and goodlooking then jay holly got caught in new orleans thats where he hooked up with our guy in a holding cell humboldt yeah but that wasnt his real name he handed her another sheet these are humboldts aliases he did time all over the south for fleecing women out of their savings a real charmer the last lady withdrew the charges so humboldt was about to get out of jail around the time jay holly was taken into custody they share a cell they do a deal yeah so now humboldt knows the style the day he gets out of jail theres another icepick murder same mo and the cops release jay holly then holly dies but its not an icepick kill humboldts smarter than that jay holly was found dead on a barroom floor hed been poisoned and the cops had no leads on the man he was drinking with that night humboldt goes back to new york and uses the same fortuneteller for his broker right and he keeps this one alive for a long time she was an old woman before he murdered her in the police station twelve days after the murders at winter house mallory drummed her fingernails on the table and your father keeps working on this no he stopped the night my grandfather died you think he could help us no i could never ask dad to do that its a long story mallorys face was a study in grim resignation there was no need to touch the light switch for the cellar from the top of the stairs nedda could see shards of broken glass clinging to the socket of the hanging bulb the last time she had visited the cellar it was to help one of the housekeepers replace a biownout kitchen tuse and then her own head had cleared that bulb by only a few inches so the intruder must be a tall one over six feet the new housekeeper was also tall but nedda had no illusions about finding the woman down there on some innocent errand however this might explain why an intruder had dared to come in by the front door he must have been watching the house he would have seen them all leave and go their separate ways perhaps mistaking the housekeeper for herself and then he must have heard approaching footsteps and fled for the cover of the basement nedda raised the pick high and because she was afraid she gathered dead brothers and sisters around her mrs tully an animated corpse of formidable girth led the procession down the cellar stairs just like old times the kitchen light petered out beyond the bottom step there would be a flashlight on top of the fuse box to her left but now she saw the bright rectangle of an open door on the other side of the basement whoever had broken into the house was long gone beyond the threshold ten steps led up to the backyard and escape a breeze called neddas attention to a high window its heavy wood frame was propped open with a stick this was how the intruder must have gained entrance as she drew close to the window dead brothers and sisters walked with her lending comfort all of them looked up to see a field mouse at the window testing the cellar air nose high whiskers twitchy its small pink hands were almost human as it gripped the wooden sill the tiny creature was half in half out and though the wind had ceased and there was no visible agency to move the propping stick the stick did fall the slamming wood frame broke the back of the mouse its mouth opened wide and in surprise it died mrs tully laughed nedda in concert with the children moved back from the window by the good light of the open door this small audience of the dead and the living could see wet drops of blood on the steps leading up to the backyard what had the house done to the intruder my father doesnt even know i have this stuff said riker you stole it from him riker shook his head i came by it the night gran died that old man literally worked this case right up to the end he had coroners reports from six states patching time lines and murder contracts together but nothing after the date of the winter house massacre so its twenty years later and the trail is as cold as it ever gets thats when gran figures stick man mustve died back in the forties the year of the massacre well he was only off by two years said mallory examining her nails if nedda killed stick man in maine yeah too bad the maine police werent on grans radar he mightve closed out the case riker knew she was wondering when this family saga would finally end he was always trying to connect with her on some human level forgetting who and what he was dealing with your dad she said prompting him for an explanation of why this door was closed to them okay he said now remember gran and my dad worked this case together for years from the day my grandfather retired until he died well granddad was always pumped dead or alive he wanted to bring red winter home all those nights at the kitchen table looking at clues and kicking around ideas that was the only time my fathers old man ever talked to him and this family custom of stone silence had carried into rikers generation the only time dad was really happy was when he was rilling the kitchen with cigar smoke emptying a whiskey bottle with my grandfather and talking shop so it was hard to understand what dad did when his old man died that was the night my father brought home a twentytwoyearold autopsy report on the second fortuneteller the one who died after the winter house massacre after granddad read it he got all excited he couldnt get the words out he stood up hugged my dad for maybe the first time ever then fell across the kitchen table dead later that night my mom was out on the porch waiting for a hearse from the mortuary and dad was in the kitchen with his fathers corpse i can still see him on the floor crawling around on hands and knees picking up all the papers that scattered when gran had his heart attack after my father had the whole file all bundled together he dropped it into the garbage can and never talked about the case again the files young riker had rescued from the trash still bore faint stains of what the family had dined on that night as much as your dad couldnt stand the sight of that file said mallory thats how much he loved your grandfather it was just too much pain thats why he tossed it in the garbage can riker nodded he had come to understand that over the passing years but mallory the machine should not have been able to work it out and so quickly but thats not the reason i cant ask for dads help with this case i know mallory pushed her empty beer botde to one side its because now you understand why your grandfather was so excited he couldnt talk for those twelve days between the massacre at winter house and the fortunetellers murder in the police station nedda was learning to read tarot cards that was the pattern a new fortuneteller to replace the old one what other reason could a hitman have for stealing a child and what a tall child one who could pass for a woman but so much easier to control an heiress who could one day reappear to claim a fortune this last piece dropped into place so neatly he could almost hear an audible click in the gears of mallorys mind riker stared at her for what seemed like a very long time perhaps no more than a minute but how those seconds crawled along she could still surprise him and sometimes this caused him pain he had watched her grow up but he could never really know her and fool that he was he was always tripping over himself each time he underestimated her and yet he never learned he nodded now she had gotten it right when his grandfather had felt the onset of a massive coronary when joy had overpowered fear and pain that must have been the moment when the old man realized that the stolen child could still be alive riker looked down at the sprawl of papers on his own kitchen table the family tradition of fathers and sons my father was a great cop none better that murdered fortuneteller was the key if hed gone on working this case dad wouldve followed through on humboldt he wouldve run him down to the icepick stabbing in maine and a redhaired girl mallory nodded he wouldve brought red winter home forty years ago i can never tell him that we have to stop meeting this way people will talk yes maam officer brill gallantly strained to smile at this line which had been an old one before nedda was born after opening the cellar door he clicked on his flashlight and she followed him down the stairs the yellow beam roved over the broken glass on the floor he had found one piece that he liked and put it into a plastic bag is that blood on the glass yes maam it is did you cut yourself not my hands she examined the backs of them and i had shoes on my feet you didnt stab anybody did you maam no im off that now officer brills polite smile widened into a genuine grin good to know he looked up as he redirected the beam of his flashlight to the broken bulb overhead there was more blood on one of the shards that still clung to the socket so well be looking for a tall man wearing a bandage on his head thats more of a description than we usually get back upstairs again the patrolman accepted her offer of tea but insisted on preparing it himself he seemed at home in a kitchen she guessed that he had a grandmother her age and during the course of their conversation this proved true the young man lived in the bronx with a large extended family that included both of his grandparents he spoke of them warmly as he pulled out a chair for nedda and seated her at the table when the kettle released its steam in a shrill whistle he was quick to kill the flame of the burner as he poured hot water over the tea bags in their cups he noticed the tarot deck on the kitchen table and he smiled my grandmother spends ten dollars every monday to have her fortune told well thats cheap she must know an honest fortuneteller by the expression on the young mans face nedda could tell that he considered this an oxymoron how could a fortuneteller ever be honest an old woman taught me to read tarot cards nedda unboxed the deck these belonged to her she selected the card that most resembled the young policeman this is your significator the knight of swords its what you are now think about the problem that troubles you most she shuffled the cards im guessing thats me after cutting the cards three times she laid them out in three piles put the deck back together and hand it to me he did as she asked and she knew it was only to humor an old woman for he was a child of the new century a firm believer in scientific explanations for everything she lifted one card from the top and laid it down upon the knight this covers you and with the next card laid lengthwise she said this crosses you for good or ill in quick succession she placed four cards at compass points all around the first three then dealt four more cards in a row to one side and now youre going to tell me my future no thats for the fool said nedda the kind of person who seeks patterns that arent there the sort who sees the virgin mary in a grocers deformed potato then pays a tendollar admission fee to worship it given a fools nature he deserves what he gets a lighter wallet and nothing more she covered the policemans hand with hers youre not like that you wouldnt want to see the future not even if you believed it was possible no this boy would never bow to the idea of a destiny writ in stone you already see a possible future the one you can forge for yourself nedda pointed to the west card this is where that future begins in your past you became a policeman not for the good pension plan but because you wanted to help people thats your nature she pointed to the south card this is the foundation of the matter youre exactly where you should be in the world you like what you are and thats rare her hand drifted toward the north card you strive to create order out of chaos her finger landed on the east card the immediate future and you will do this every day in small ways and big ones but you already know that youve made it your mission she studied the remaining cards now if im right and your worry of the moment is me t can tell yon that youll see me again but would she be dead or alive that was an easy one she said i spend a great deal of my day at the windows ive seen you drive by from time to time probably more often than you should you always slow down when you pass my house i suspect that you keep an eye on me a good guess she had taken him by surprise her hand drifted up to the last card dealt the culmination of all that had gone before in this matter where our paths have crossed we will each reap what we deserve but then thats true for everyone hardly magic or psychic phenomena she swept all the cards together jl keep you focused on the road ahead he must have intuited that this card play was a ruse to keep his company a while longer for he leaned toward her saying shock is a funny thing he cleared their cups from the table and set them in the sink sometimes it makes people weak in the legs sometimes theyre afraid to be alone if you hear any noises or if you just feel jumpy you can call and ask for me ill be on duty for another six hours the cleaning lady entered into a street right of sorts or so she would tell it later on as she wrestled over a wire cart filled with her supplies the young policeman insisted on carrying it up the stairs for her and by brute strength he won i dont tip cops yelled mrs ortega in brooklynese suits me fine the young officer countered with his bronx accent chump change ruins the line of my uniform and now that he had settled her cart by the front door to the mansion he tipped his hat and left her standing there agape and with no comeback line no need to ring the bell the door was opened wide by a woman as tall as detective mallory but much older the hair was white her eyes pale blue and what a curious smile youre from the temp agency lucky guess lady here you gotta sign this the smaller woman handed her a work order tapped out on mallorys computer and guaranteed to pass for the genuine article the names ortega she said you can call me mrs ortega and by the signature she knew this was nedda winter and now the cleaning lady had to fend off more good manners offers of tea and conversation for gods sake but she was firm i only got a few hours mrs ortega powered up her vacuum cleaner and kept her mouth closed until an hour later she opened the door to the closet in the foyer what the hell the shelves were narrow for a linen closet and they were lined with womens hats its a hat closet said miss winter theres no such thing said mrs ortega you know how many years i been cleaning houses like yours hell even fancier than this one and theres no such a thing as a damn hat closet this is a linen closet and you never find a linen closet in a damn foyer but thats not what i was talking about she leaned down and picked up one hat that had fallen from a lower shelf then pointed to a hole in the wall whats that a mouse hole i suppose would you like a cold beer two blocks west of winter house and two hours later mrs ortega was sitting in the front seat of mallorys car so i says to miss winter you got real classy rodents here thats a nice round hole between you and me mallory id say that mouse used a drill with a fourinch bit and it was a damn tall mouse that hole was two feet off the ground mallory nodded hardly listening the back of the closet was cheap plasterboard said the cleaning lady attempting to liven up her story now thats odd because the sides are cedar it dont make sense you see the problem no she guessed that mallory had lost interest in the closets of the rich and mrs ortega was still unclear about what service she had done to warrant a hundreddollar bill on top of her regular cleaning fee and so she felt obliged to elaborate drawing on her vast reading in truecrime paperbacks you know that house has a history right mallorys face had no expression that the cleaning lady could read mrs ortega offered a hint the winter house massacre ring any bells thats way before mallorys time said riker mine too he had returned from his deli run after settling into the backseat he handed mrs ortega her requested bagel and coffee now heres our problem he held out a sheet of paper with the letterhead of crime scene unit a rookie investigator has a note here suspicious hole in shallow closet crime scene huh another murder do you know how many dont get excited said riker it was a robbery oh sure said mrs ortega you two turned out for a robbery thats right said mallory pressing another large bill into the womans hand is there a problem here absolutely not mrs ortega pocketed the bill so this rookie did he mention the seam around the closet hole well that got their attention the backing on that closet is old and rotted but the hole and the seam not so old somebody cut out a section and then put it back in place theres a ridge of glue around the seam for the patch and theres dust on that ridge well that tears it said riker whatever got walled up in the closet its long gone now tell me about nedda winter said mallory real jumpy followed me everywhere and it wasnt like she thought i was gonna rob her blind she just wanted the company didnt wanna be alone thai was my take cieaned her room hardly needed it very neat no personal items theres a metal suitcase stashed under the bed i thought that was her house but she acts like a real polite guest who isnt sure how long she wants to stay so then the little one comes home bitty smyth right soon as i saw her i knew which room was hers never had to ask it had to be the one with all the stuffed toys on the bed like a kids room now thats because shes so small i bet people still pat her on the head she have teddy bears on the bed when shes ninety years old well as soon as she showed up i left good job mallory nodded to the police cruiser behind her car that officer will drive you anywhere you want to go mrs ortega looked back over her shoulder to the rear window and its view of a policeman in uniform the same cop who had wrestled her for the cleaning cart good a rematch as she closed the door of the car she leaned down to the open passenger window just one more thing you guys instead of asking yourselves what was walled up in that closet you might be wondering who it was a damned big patch no intruder could hide in the dark of an old house every creak of a timber and each footfall on the stair was kettledrum and timpani moments of silence were suspect and fraught with tension waiting waiting nedda rose from her bed and walked to the window evidently officer brill had not been impressed by the most recent breakin there were no police cars parked out front she held the opera glasses borrowed from her mothers old trunk in the attic raising the lenses to her eyes she looked out over the park bringing leaves into sharp focus and searching for a sign of movement among the branches her brother and sister had not returned they had been absent for yet another breakin and she wondered what the police would make of that coincidence cleo and lionel spent so much of their time at the summer house and nedda blamed herself for making the town house unbearable ritty had offered another theory they simply liked to drive it was nothing for them to make the round trip in a day only spending a few hours in one place or the other her niece believed that they used the summer house as an excuse needing some destination for their drives else they would drive in circles the pair had longtime acquaintances but no real friends to visit in the hamptons but they had each other and what of bitty she had no one but a lame cockatiel nedda refocused the opera glasses and strained to see a man in the mesh of leaves no there was no one there but she imagined him behind each tree the wind was rising and the branches lost more of their cover with every gust waiting waiting anticipating she closed the drape and lit the lamp next she sat down at the writing desk and picked up her pen nedda meant to explain her actions to her family or that was her intention but she could think of no way to begin her letter instead she wrote the same line over and over filling both sides of a paper then reaching for another sheet if things should go wrong tonight this might be the most eloquent explanation she could leave behind or was it a confession of sorts pages covered with her handwriting drifted to the floor as the hour grew late over and over again she wrote the same line cray people make sane people cray rising from the desk she switched off the lamp and returned to the window there were no pedestrians in sight and the traffic was light to nonexistent she focused the opera glasses there a face moving behind the trees near the stone wall that low barrier between the sidewalk and the park nedda looked back at the clock on her bedside table officer brill would have gone off duty hours ago what would she say if she called the police station i see a pale face in the woods no they would not send anyone to search central park for suspicious persons not on her account they would write her off as a crazy old woman and perhaps this was true she watched the wood across the way and saw him more clearly now but just the back of him moving deeper into the foliage nedda disrobed to stand naked before her closet moving hangers hunting for something night black when she was dressed she reached beneath her pillow to grab up the wooden handle of the ice pick with great stealth she slipped down the hall to the stairs finding her way in the dark descending slowly minding the steps that made noise the alarm light was on in the foyer she tapped in the number code to disarm it then found the switch to turn off the light above the outside stairs charles butler returned home from a charity auction his wallet lightened by a donation but no purchases had been made aside from cocktails at the bar none of the antique furniture had remotely resembled the gaming table of his dreams and now he had less than a week to replace the one that had been destroyed before he could insert the key into the lock for his apartment he saw the lighted glass of the door to butler and company mallory she liked the late hours he entered the reception area and saw a light at the end of the hallway but it was his own office and not hers charles found his cleaning woman fast asleep and slumped over a book in her lap now that was odd oh wait not odd at all she had been reading the book on winter house and that would put anyone to sleep he put one hand on her shoulder mrs ortega when her eyes opened he said ive never known you to work so late he glanced at his watch its after midnight this took some convincing she had to look first at his watch then her own ill be damned i couldnt clean your office this afternoon she said i had to do an errand for mallory i didnt think youd mind if oh but i dont mind so what sort of errand did you do for mallory i cant tell you ah sworn to secrecy i understand he walked to the credenza behind his desk and returned to join her on the couch holding a bottle of sherry and two glasses however it wouldnt count if i guessed would it undecided she accepted a glass and allowed him to fill it several times in quick succession he pointed to the book in her lap im guessing its something to do with winter house maybe she said and then she smiled are you a betting man you know i am indeed he never tired of losing at poker whats the wager she held up the thick volume i know what happened to red winter fascinating charles dipped the decanter to refresh her glass twenty dollars and a limo ride home to brooklyn its a bet i say red winter was never lost that kid never even left her own house the body was walled up in the foyer closet thats my theory really he filled her glass again mrs ortega had a high tolerance for alcohol and it might take awhile to get the entire story nedda stood on the sidewalk in a long black leather jacket and slacks she felt cold exposed a single car rolled by and she turned away from the headlights hiding the ice pick in her side pocket she ran full out to cross the boulevard when had she last run for her life or any other reason it made her young again the wind hit her face and picked at the loose weave of her braid she approached the low stone wall as a twelveyearold girl and easily scaled it her feet hitting the broken branches and cracking dead leaves on the other side and now she played the childs game of statue quieting her heart the better to hear a strangers footfall she was terrified exhilarated alive this was a better plan than waiting for him to come for her they were old friends now she and death it got easier each time they met and this time she had selected the meeting place her head snapped right with a sound of a dry stick broken underfoot and she walked that way pushing branches to one side going deeper and deeper into the wood and losing the light of the path lamps red winter said a mans voice just behind her back her hand closed around the ice pick in her pocket she turned around to face him but there was no one there my god its really you a tall figure stepped out of the foliage only a shadow and only his voice discerned his sex red winter you dont remember me do you he clicked on a flashlight and shined it on his own face making it ghoulish with sharp shadows riding the planes of his cheeks and the deep eye sockets yes he was a tall one and just as officer brill had predicted he wore a bandage high on his scalp where the lightbulbs broken glass had scratched him we met when you were very sick he said in a surprisingly normal voice hardly threatening you made a nice recovery didnt you she had not expected this a civilized conversation replete with polite inquires on the state of her health had they met in a hospital there had been so many of them over the years and then there had been the nursing homes and finally the hospice her grip on the ice pick remained very tight no he said lowering the flashlight you wouldnt remember would you you were really out of it then and now she must pin that down to one of three places they might have met in the last hospital where her health had severely declined or the nursing home where her life would have ended if not for bitty or was it the hospice the man was coming closer his white hands dangling from the arms of a loose flannel jacket that might conceal any number of weapons were you a patient too she asked as if this might be a normal chat with some acquaintance who had slipped her memory me in a nursing home he actually smiled not likely no he was only thirty years old at the outside so he had met her in the maine nursing home he placed his flashlight in the crook of his arm shining its light on the trees behind him and freeing both hands to open the buttons of his jacket did he have a gun an ice pick could not beat a bullet he was one step closer his right hand still concealed his backwardshining beam spotlighted another figure in the wood a lovely face with the luminous skin of a haunt mallory the young detective was only a few yards away holding a very large gun in one hand she crept closer with no clumsy breaks of twigs underfoot but padding like a cat taking her own time in neddas elongated sense of seconds expanding in slow motion the man was pulling his hand from the folds of his jacket what was that dark object in his hand mallory was smiling as her gun hand was rising the young policewoman was enjoying this moment and a moment was all it was before nedda heard the connection of heavy metal on bone the man made less noise when he dropped to the ground a uniformed policeman stepped out of the woods in the company of detective riker who hailed her with a broad smile and hey nedda hows it going mallory waved one hand toward the younger of the two men you remember officer brill yes of course said nedda he comes to all of our crime scenes she smiled at the patrolman how nice to see you again evening maam officer brill tipped his cap then turned to the chore of helping riker pick up the fallen man they carried the unconscious body up the path that would lead them back to the stone wall a police car was waiting for them its red lights spinning through breaks in the trees nedda was left alone with mallory who was slow to holster her gun what brings you out so late miss winter the young detective circled around nedda then dropped her voice to a whisper behind the older womans back hunting louder mallory said not enough action back at your house all nedda saw was the flash of one white hand before she felt a light tug on her jacket the movement was so quick there was hardly time to be startled before she realized that the detective had just robbed her pocket of the ice pick brill was so worried about you said mallory and he even knows how good you are at taking down violent criminals she glanced back over one shoulder perhaps wanting the assurance they were alone without witnesses incidentally that man had a gun but it was still holstered behind his back the detective held up a small camera this is what he had in his hand so its lucky i interrupted you before you killed another unarmed citizen lucky indeed nedda jammed both hands into her pockets not wanting this young woman to see her tremble so the detective was looking down at the ice pick resting on the flat of one palm then the camera in her other hand she seemed to be weighing one thing against another i dont know who to charge tonight its a real crapshoot if you dont mind a suggestion go for it nedda looked to the shadows where the police and their prisoner had disappeared it might be better if you charge him since you cracked his skull good point mallory held up the camera you run pretty fast miss winter yes we were watching you from the woods nice sprint she held up the camera three more shots left on the roll she pointed through the trees toward a path that was well lit i want you to run that way fast as you can when nedda hesitated mallory said do it now and nedda ran she stumbled the first time she heard the click behind her she had been shot with the camera she looked back over one shoulder to the startling sight of mallory running behind her and shooting her again thats good now stop nedda halted on command like a pet and turned around to see the detective removing a roll of film from the camera if anyone should ask said mallory my prisoner took those last three pictures youre asking me to falsify youve got a problem with that would you rather visit the local station house and explain what you were doing in the woods with a concealed weapon mallory rested one hand on her hip it was a gesture of total disbelief i see you at the window every night always looking out at the park youre holding out on me that man you were waiting for him to show up am i right mallory held up the ice pick you want to talk about this now no then meet me downtown in six hours what do you want me to do make a statement or you didnt get my message you agreed to take a polygraph exam miss winter i set it up for this morning were you planning to back out no ill be there the detectives rode in the back of the patrol car with their unconscious prisoner propped up between them mallory was going through the mans wallet this is trouble she said holding up a private investigators license issued in the state of maine so now we know hes got a permit for the gun said riker damn too bad you didnt shoot him kid fat chance we can keep nedda out of the papers now he rolled back one of the prisoners eyelids and waved his hand back and forth between the mans eyes and the cars dome light the pupils dont react i think you mightve caught a lucky break hes not gonna wake up anytime soon maybe never okay you win annoyed mallory leaned toward the driver cancel the soho station aim this car at the nearest hospital the prisoner transport swerved off seventh avenue and rolled into the emergency entrance for saint vincents hospital in greenwich village riker sarcastic alarmist gave her no credit for knowing how to pull her shots she had not hit the man all that hard and he would certainly live also and this was a bonus a prolonged awakening worked in her favor she could have the photographs developed before the man regained consciousness nedda parted company with officer brill on the stairs outside her front door she entered the house by herself despite his kind offer to come inside with her after crossing the room in the dark aided by memory alone her hand closed on the banister and she made the long climb to the secondfloor landing with time enough for deep regret to settle in why had she ever gone into the park the man with the camera was most likely a reporter and now irreparable damage had been done cleo and lionel would have to bear the consequence of her little walk in the woods tonight very soon perhaps in the early morning hours they would be accosted by microphones shoved in their faces cameras and questions to fend off gone was every hope for reconciliation she entered her room and switched on the bedside lamp then examined the disarray of her clothing her leather jacket was scored with the scratches of tree branches her slacks were ripped open in places and dirt caked both her shoes she turned to the only mirror in the room what a fright strands of hair had escaped the braid in wild profusion a branch had sliced into her neck and broken the skin she touched the wound and her hand came away with drops of blood on it she removed her jacket then jumped when the ice pick fell to the floor mallory must have covertly slipped it back into her pocket but why would an officer of the law do such a thing behind her there was a sudden intake of breath realizing that she was no longer alone in this room she whirled around to see her small niece standing in the open doorway all eyes and staring at the weapon on the floor the blood on neddas fingers oh god said bitty what have you done the elder woman started at these words echos of uncle james her first accuser bitty was back stepping into the hall and nedda bowed her head so sorry so utterly destroyed chapter rikers back was broken after five hours of bad dreams on a lumpy couch in the hospital lounge a voice close to his ear said i know youre awake mallory sounded so damned alert but she was young she could string three days together with catnaps and never miss the sleep well he might be awake but she could not force him to open his eyes i talked to the state cops in maine she said they went out to susan mcreedys place riker rolled over and away from her burrowing into the upholstery mallorys voice was louder more testy mcreedys gone the neighbors said she left town doing eighty miles an hour shes on the run i ran her credit cards no charges shes paying cash for her gas riker mumbled some people still use cash mallory morning light was breaking through the slits of his sore eyes maybe the lady just needed a vacation life in the boondocks of maine might be more exciting and stressful than he had previously supposed he rolled on his back eyes all the way open now and decided that naw susan mcreedy was on the run damn so that private dick upstairs is all we got left he was talking to the ceiling his partner was crossing the lobby forcing him to rise and lope after her nedda faltered on the stairs as she made her way up to the south attic where the trunks of the dead were kept all but baby sallys the light from the gabled windows was waning the morning was turning dark and promising rain she wandered the rows of stored effects until she found her mothers trunk and opened it the lid was heavier today so tired nedda dropped the opera glasses inside and closed the trunk softly reverently she moved on to the neat row of murdered parents and children one by one she dragged their trunks to an open space the sky was rumbling over her head as she arranged them in a circle and lightning flashed in every window when she sat down tailor fashion surrounded by all that remained of her dead this was the family following a crack of thunder rain streaked the glass panes as nedda cried so did the house nestled in her lap was the canvas sack of baby sallys rotted clothes this child was never far from her thoughts though she could only see her youngest sister as a newborn with hair of soft down fingers and toes impossibly small nedda called up a memory of solemn children gathered in the kitchen old tully the housekeeper had taken it upon herself to explain this impending death of their baby sister and she had done it badly telling them that they were all dying from the moment they were born thats what lifes about said tully not good enough the children not one philosopher in the pack of them had demanded a more concrete explanation obligingly the housekeeper had gone out into the yard captured a slug and returned with it laying the slimy creature on the kitchen table this is death she had said holding up a heavy mallet used for tenderizing meat the old woman had brought her weapon down upon the slug and smashed it into a smear on the tabletop there said tully its gone to live with jesus nedda held up a little dress that a fouryearold might wear sally my sally a childsize wraith in a white nightgown hovered by the attic stairs only bitty nedda swiped her wet face with the back of one hand then turned to her niece and braced herself for some new accusation bitty was lit by a flash of lightning her eyes rolled up toward the rafters and she stiffened slightly waiting for the thunderclap it never came im sorry aunt nedda about last night i got a call from officer brill this morning he wanted to know if you were all right he told me what happened in the park after everything youd been through i made you feel like a criminal dont give it any thought dear it was perfectly understandable bitty pulled a piece of paper from the pocket of her robe you had an earlier call last night after supper i didnt want to disturb you i thought you might be sleeping she held out the piece of paper as she walked toward her aunt its a message from that detective said bitty the tall blond one bang the thunder cracked overhead bitty jumped and her hands flew up like wings the note wafted to the floor nedda reached out to retrieve the fallen paper already knowing its contents before she unfolded it this was detective mallorys demand to appear at the police station this morning she looked up to see that bitty had recovered nicely from the inclement weather aunt nedda lightning returned to light up her face her worried eyes ive never practiced criminal law but i know its always a bad idea to take a polygraph i dont think you should do it dont worry dear i can deal with this bang when the patient regained consciousness mallory was the first thing he saw and riker felt sorry for joshua addison a private investigator licensed in the state of maine mallory leaned over the hospital bed both hands curling round the metal rail such long red fingernails and riker saw that old look on her face hungry as if she had not been fed for days and days startled the patient appeared to be playing dead with his eyes wide open riker watched the mans chest fascinated and wondering how much longer addison could hold his breath the private investigators survival instinct was slow to kick in and when he finally sucked in air and tried to raise his arms in a protective reflex he discovered that his right hand was manacled to the side rail what the hell is this what happened the way i remember it said riker you were making a move on a woman in the park when you tripped and fell now youre going down on a pervert charge thats ridiculous said addison you cant you need a lawyer said riker thinking it best to bring up the subject first the moment their suspect asked for counsel the interview must end yeah and make it a damn good lawyer a pervert charge is what youre crazy addison you were stalking an old woman and maybe we should add an assault charge mallory reached out to touch the bandage on the patients forehead her long nails were dangerously close to the mans eyes and he flinched as she peeled the bandage back to expose a jagged cut though there was no doubt that the wound had come from the broken lightbulb in the basement of winter house mallory said we need a picture of this scratch looks like the old lady tried to fight him off on cue riker pulled a disposable camera from his coat pocket and snapped a closeup photograph with a burst of light in addisons eyes youre both nuts half blinded by the flash the private investigator squinted at his accusers i never touched that woman mallory laid three photographs on the bedsheet riker knew that these pictures had been taken by his partner though she had given him the gift of deniability by lying to him unlike all the other shots from addisons roll of film these three had mallorys center fixation nedda winters head was in the precise center of each frame as if she had been shot through a gun sight in the first one the camera was facing the startled woman in the next one she was running away the third shot a personal favorite had nedda still on the run looking back over one shoulder a documented chase we have a lock on this case said mallory these shots came ixomyour camera she laid the private investigators license on his pillow and you can kiss this goodbye weve got you cold for breaking into that womans house she pulled out an evidence bag with officer brills signature it contained fragments of glass this came from a broken lightbulb in her basement its your blood type o negative ordering a dna test would be overkill riker smiled real jail time pal an old woman like that said mallory as if she had ever been sentimental about old ladies you freak i was working a case we dont think so said riker more affably we like the pervert charge i was working for a client and i can prove it said joshua addison riker was loving this normally it was like pulling teeth to get a client name from a private investigator whove you got lined up your mother he looked up at his partner lets book him im tired i wanna go home that old woman said addison i think shes red winter riker feigned mild surprise youre planning an insanity defense he turned to mallory in the guise of a translator red winter was a little girl a kidnap victim she disappeared maybe thirty years before you were even born he looked down at the man on the bed and last i heard shes still lost no said addison her house is across the street from the park shes back youre kidding said mallory thats your story you were waiting for her to come home you know said riker leaning on the bedrail as he opined this job is definitely losing its edge the perverts get dumber every year i was hired by bitty smyth said addison at the time i didnt know she was red winters niece i had to do some checking but now i yeah right said mallory the niece hired you to stalk her aunt no she hired me to find her aunt this is too confusing said riker the lady wasnt lost in the park she just went out for a walk listen to me frustrated addison raised himself up on one arm she was lost for fiftyeight freaking years he searched one detectives face and then the others only finding signs of disbelief shes red winter and i wasnt planning to hurt her last night i just wanted a photograph some proof that it was the same woman i found in the nursing home it was the bangor rest home in maine she looks so different now six months ago she was all bloated and yellow but her eyes those eyes riker pulled a small notebook from his coat then fished the rest of his pockets until he found his pen so let me get this straight you wanted to pass this woman off as red winter and you needed a picture he jotted down a few words a photograph you could sell to the tabloids riker looked up from his notebook youre telling us youre a con artist he shrugged okay with me pal well add that to the charges riker and mallory moved away from the bedside as if they could not leave this man fast enough hey wait a minute said addison wait they did not bitty smyth hung up the receiver on the kitchen wall phone then faced her aunt with a smile the arrangements are done i talked to detective mallorys superior a very nice man lieutenant coffey it took a bit of negotiating but i got everything i asked for how handy to have a lawyer around the house nedda spooned scrambled eggs from a pan onto ovenheated plates behind her on the stove bacon sizzled and hot water bubbled in the kettle you should go back to your fathers firm and perhaps that would assuage her guilt over bittys long sabbatical all that time lost to the search for a longlost child her niece shrugged off this suggestion i lined up an independent polygraph examiner lieutenant coffey said i wouldnt be allowed to stay in the room during the examination but i think i can get him to change his mind bitty sat down at the table and took up her fork waving it in the air as a baton good timing is very important in every negotiation well make a stand right before they no bitty its better if i do this alone nedda picked up the teakettle before the whistle could startle her niece then poured boiling water over the tea bags in their cups and then this afternoon we might visit some real estate brokers she sat down at the table and picked up a newspaper opened to listings for coops and condominiums several advertisements had been circled in blue ink im going to find a place of my own in another part of town i think cleo and lionel would like that but this is your house no aunt nedda its all my fault im the one who upset you first that scene at the dinner party and then last night im so sorry you cant leave you love this house yes she did but the house did not love anyone not anymore the house was sad and crazy and sick to death of love it has nothing to do with you bitty nedda reached out to cover her nieces small hand with her own you can come with me if you like call it a stepping stone to a place of your own you cant live with your mother forever can you the expression on bittys face was one of instant sorrow and nedda realized that she had trod upon one of her nieces many closet secrets though others seemed to underestimate this little womans complexity nedda never did sometimes even a simple conversation was like navigating a labyrinth with wrong turns aplenty she had learned to avoid every path of discourse that led to pain and now she folded the newspaper into her lap and out of bittys sight the detectives had finished a leisurely breakfast in the hospital cafeteria and now they were tying up a critical loose end how to explain away mallorys behavior last night the pistol whipping in central park they stood in the dark of a small room in company with a hospital physician who flicked on a light to illuminate joshua addisons xrays the doctor pointed to a fault line saying definitely a concussion thats why he cant tell you what happened right before he lost consciousness judging by the wound it looks to me like somebody hit him very hard with a a rock asked mallory raising a plastic bag with said rock neady pocked with red like this one we found it underneath his head she smiled so hopefully as if she cared about this mans opinion or do you think he mightve fallen and hit his head on the rock yes that would do it said the doctor who was young who had no experience in forensics who had never met mallory before yes an accident riker had to wonder how she made her prop so realistic he stared at the red fluid that spotted this rock taken from a construction site across the street it lookedlike real blood he could well imagine her smashing it down on the nearest living creature that came to hand so many small dogs in this neighborhood but he hoped it was catsup from the hospital canteen mallory glanced at the clock on the wall a signal that they had killed enough time they rode the elevator up to joshua addisons floor for a final word with the private investigator when they entered the room the man in the bed had a worried look about him your story doesnt check out said riker we called that nursing home in maine according to their records this womans the wrong age this was actually true the sketchy records had overestimated nedda winters age by eight years and one more thing said mallory your name is on the nursing homes discharge papers theyve got you listed as her next of kin and theyve never heard of bitty smyth yeah said riker explain that one are you trying to con the winter family out of some money hell no the niece asked me to make the arrangements to move her aunt to a hospice in new york state she wanted it done quietly mallory shook the bedrail to get the mans attention did the niece try to cut you out of the deal is that why you were stalking that old woman in the park addison could barely get out the word no we re just going by your own statement pal said riker it looks like a scam to us then its the niece bitty smyth its her scam all i did was find oh yeah i forgot said riker you did what thirty thousand cops couldnt do you found red winter just one snag said mallory its not her riker tossed a yellow pad on the bed make out a complete statement if we dont find any more lies well sit on the paperwork lor a lew days but if we find out that you passed this woman off as a member of the winter family then all the charges are solid including fraud and pal vv r the newspapers all ot em and that should neatly kill any idea of selling nedda winter to the tabloids to further the impression that the detectives were bored with the improbable story of red winters return riker stretched out on the bed beside addisons before the private investigator had filled out half the sheet riker was snoring convincingly and sleeping soundly half an hour passed before mallory woke her partner handing over the yellow sheets one by one as fast as she could read them the handwritten lines of the statement were filled with every detail of the search for an old woman in the state of maine joshua addison had done hundreds of interviews looking for someone who would fit bitty smyths specific list of characteristics for two years the man had covered the entire state oi maine well now they knew that bitty had not been leaving town on religious missions she had been visiting nursing homes up north but how had the woman known that her aunt was hiding out in the state of maine mallory carried a clipboard into the interview room and walked to one end of the long table she was ignoring the surprised polygraph examiner as she made a show of consulting her watch and writing down the time nedda winter was wired into the machine by rubber tubing around betchest and abdomen to measure her breathing a padded cardio cuff on her arm to keep track of her blood pressure and metal fingertips to catch her in the act of sweating the polygraph examiner cleared his throat twice but failed to get mallorys attention excuse me detective he said hardly disguising his annoyance i work alone if you have any questions i suggest you write them down then i can ask them during the im not here to question miss winter said mallory im here to evaluate you she glanced at the civilians polygraph equipment with a moue of distaste how far out of date is that machine of yours the examiner only stared at her casting about for some comeback obviously said mallory making a note on her clipboard you dont know how old your equipment is im guessing at least ten years she leaned down toward nedda showing the woman no more regard than furniture when she examined the padded arm cuff the detective made another note on her clipboard speaking the words aloud as her pen moved across the paper still using cardio cuffs for bloodpressure readings she turned back to the examiner we gave you a chair with stress plates why arent you hooked in she tapped her pencil on the notebook waiting on an answer then examined the back of his machine where the wires connected never mind she made more notes saying as she wrote outmoded machine no connections for stress plates she removed her blazer and draped it over a chair a clear signal that she planned to stay awhile and now her gun was exposed in the shoulder holster breaking all the rules of interviews and civilian etiquette all the power and authority was weighted to her side of the room she leaned against the back wall just visible to the examiners peripheral vision and in full view of nedda winter you can start now if any arguments had occurred to the examiner he swallowed them reaching into his briefcase he pulled out a deck of playing cards mallory rolled her eyes and nedda winter smiled vaguely amused by the show on the dark side of the mirror in a small theater of chairs tiered in rows two men sat up front near the oneway glass they were observing mallorys humiliation of the independent polygraph examiner charles turned to riker what was all that about mallory wants him out of the way so she can do the exam herself poor little guy hes toast riker reached over to a panel on the wall and turned off the volume funs over ive seen this next part a hundred times most of these idiots went to the same school for the tenweek course the polygraph examiner leaned toward nedda winter and appeared to be speaking in a friendly fashion in the absence of sound riker translated right now hes telling nedda that he wants to put her at ease thats a lie his whole job is to jack up her anxiety if he cant do that if shes not afraid of his machine he wont get any responses worth measuring if mallory keeps smirking at everything he says its hardly he wont last another five minutes now hes telling nedda what all the tools do what they measure she doesnt seem too impressed thats because shes taking all her cues from mallory the examiner laid four playing cards facedown on the table nedda selected one lifting up a corner to see which card it was the machine was turned on and the man stared at the rolling paper as he spoke again watch ing wavy lines and hardedged spikes jotting down small notes on the paper as it rolled by at the rate of six inches a minute this is the gettingtoknowyou stage said riker he told her to give him a negative response every time he tries to guess her card even if he guesses right hes telling her he needs to gauge her physical responses when he guesses the right card and she lies to him thats bull if he didiil know which response was a lie the polygraph wouldnt help so he memorized the order of the cards said charles he already knows which one she picked well then whats the point of this exercise if shes following his instructions then theres no attempt at deception its a lot like voodoo nedda has to believe in the polygraph when he guesses her card thats supposed to convince her that the machine can read her mind but see shes not buying it this test is only as good as the examiner and mallory made him look like a moron so its true what they say said charles and by they he meant the supreme court of the united states a polygraph has the same chance of detecting a lie as the flip of a coin right but thats not why we use it when a cop does this test its a fullblown interrogation without a lawyer sweet huh but this examiner isnt no hes an independent that was the deal we did with bitty smyth we picked the time and place she picked the examiner this guys only experience is interviewing applicants for lowlevel jobs riker leaned back and closed his eyes saying let me know when mallory takes over ill turn on the volume again while riker slept charles watched the tableau in front of him the lame card trick was set aside and they were moving on to other questions after each response the examiner made notations on the rolling paper mallory was drumming her nails on the clipboard regarding the man as a bug nedda always glanced at the detective before answering a question and now charles intuited mallorys stance as a prelude to a lunge he nudged riker to wake him shes almost ready rikers eyes opened good time to rock n roll he turned on the volume the examiner asked his next question did you ever kill anyone you know i did said nedda winter i already signed a statement to that effect once again if you could confine your responses to yes or no yes said nedda mallory stood behind the examiner watching over his shoulder as the paper scrolled across the top of his machine youre botching it she ripped the paper out the man half rose in protest she glared at him sit down and he did the detective made her own notations matching up the responses with respiration and heartbeats then tapped the different spikes on the chart each time she said inconclusive inconclusive inconclusive she turned on the examiner you dont know what youre doing riker turned the volume off again that might be the last true thing you hear from that room he looked back to the glass as mallorv slapped the top of the polygraph machine shes telling him his equipment is crap i think i guessed that said charles the examiners mouth had stopped flapping he could only gawk at the detective in disbelief fortunately said riker she just happens to have a brandnewnr oftheart polygraph parked right outside the door our machine doesnt work any better but it has more bells and whistles so mallory won the pissing contest the guys out of the game and he knows it theres no way to make a recovery now that nedda thinks hes a clown but dont feel sorry for him charles hes young he can still find honest work mallory carried a heavy suitcase into the room and placed it on the table she undid the snaps and opened it with a sideways glance at the civilian examiner saying now this is a lie detector she held up a large clip of plastic and metal trailing a wire and this is a transducer she attached it to neddas thumb treating the woman as an inanimate part of her showandtell exhibit this is what we use for cardio readings in the twentyrirst century the detective proceeded to strip nedda of all the paraphernalia that belonged to the independent examiner then neatly packed it away in the mans suitcase she spoke to nedda for the first time we can put this off for another day or get it over with now up to you im ready when mallory turned around again to face the examiner she feigned surprise to see him still here the man slunk out of the room lacking the energy to entirely close the door behind him mallory slammed it shut her voice was icy when she turned to the woman seated in the chair and said commanded take off your shoes charles turned to riker her shoes yeah the detective shrugged as he slouched lower in his chair some perps use countermeasures like a tack in the shoe it jacks up the response to a control question any question that raises a real sweat looks kind of pale by comparison so the response to a small anxiety disguises the larger one now you got it the detective was watching the other room as nedda following another order dragged her chair across the floor barefoot and wired to the machine she sat down with her back to the wall that chair is set up with a stress plate to catch muscle tension thats another trick the perps use to beat the box but i m guessing that youre not actually worried about nedda using countermeasures no in fact mallorys not even certified for this sort of thing is she charles it doesnt matter no polygraph exam is admissible in court but now we get to ask questions that no lawyer would ever let her answer i cant believe that bitty smyth would allow her to take this exam bittys a contract attorney never handled a criminal case charles watched mallory fasten restraints to the older womans legs i think i can guess what thats for shes pinned now helpless he turned to riker in the dark you know this isnt right i know but its what we do nedda winter stared at the wires that made her seem part machine bitty arranged for the independent examiner maybe i should talk to her before good idea mallory stood before her suspect but i need answers today your niece is downstairs if you dont feel up to this i can strap her in instead im sure shell be happy to take your place if this is too stressful yeah right no lawyer ever born would consent to a polygraph examination but nedda was nodding her head wanting to spare bitty smyth any unpleasantness barefoot and pinned by rubber tubes and wires restraints on both her arms and legs the old woman would not be able to imagine her timid niece in that chair mallory sat down at the table before the equipment she gave a cursory glance at the sheet of paper she had torn from the civilians machine youve got too many mixed responses here we have to start over if you like we can wait a few hours while we find an independent who knows what hes doing or would you rather get this over with i said id take the test but i dont fine mallory reached into the back pocket of her jeans and pulled out the deck of cards she had stolen from the civilian examiner lets try another trick that fool only used four cards she shuffled the deck as she spoke lets try it with fiftytwo possibilities pull out a card any card fanning the cards mallory held them just far enough away to make the older woman strain to reach one nedda had no sooner taken her selection from the deck when mallory said seven of hearts nedda nodded surprised i palmed the only cards you could reach and i memorized their order riker leaned far forward in his chair caught between surprise and confusion you heard right said charles she just told the truth and he understood why nedda must believe in mallory hang the damned machine the examiner your niece picked out was a useless cheat said mallory setting the deck on the table bad card tricks are a hacks game he wanted you to believe that he could read your mind now me i dont care what you believe she pointed to the waving lines at the top of the machine if you hold your breath ill know one long red fingernail moved down through the other lines if your heart beats a little faster ill know when you break a sweat ill see it on the machine before it shows up on your face she held up the sheet she had torn from the examiners machine his last question was inconclusive so well try it again she wadded the paper into a ball and threw it across the room nedda winter flinched perhaps believing that it was aimed at her a good start turning on the machine mallory said now lets go for a ride she picked up her pencil and watched the scrolling lines asking did you ever kill anyone yes or no yes mallory consulted the spikes on the scrolling paper making notes here and there you were very calm the night we came to your house but now your heart is beating way too fast is the burglar the only man you ever killed neddas voice was not much above a whisper asking what does this have to do with the yes or no if i knew your total body count would i be impressed charles sank low in his chair i think i prefer the dark old days of thumbscrews and the rack does mallory understand that shes reading signs of stress not guilt just being in the same room with her is enough to she knows said riker with a little preparation a braindead girl scout can beat the box but you can tell the truth and still fail the exam so its totally useless why would neddas our only lead we sent the maine cops to susan mcreedys house to ask a few questions and check out her story seems the lady disappeared neddas all we got left this was not entirely true the last resort would be bitty smyth who would lawyer up immediately and then they would lose their leverage over the woman on the other side of the glass i know you like nedda winter said charles why cant you do the interrogation instead of mallory no said riker i could never do what shes gonna do mallory turned off the machine this looks bad for you i cant help you if you hold out on me so we have to clarify your response right now all i know for sure is that the burglar wasnt your first kill the detective leaned far back in her chair no need to consult the machine nedda winters face said it all the woman had just been assaulted with no bruising no blood loss all the pain was in her eyes the mouth half open hands clenching so lets clear up that previous death suppose you had an accident ran somebody down in a car that would explain the readings i see on this machine give me the circumstances and then i can eliminate the last question nedda was flailing arms raising wires dangling from her body parts she looked at her right hand mechanized now and she was horrified all right mallory turned the machine on lets take an easy question a throwaway the other night at the dinner party i understand your niece gave you an old pack of tarot cards she said they were yours was that true youve been talking to charles butler nedda turned to the mirror is he there now bitty said shed picked him for the neutral observer charles turned to riker when were you going to tell me that never no reason to if bitty hadnt made you a condition of the test mallory wouldve asked you to come the key word here is neutral youre switzerland charles the hell i am next question said mallory another easy one have you been reading tarot cards for a long time yes wait nedda winter erased her answer wiping the air with both hands i mean no that was so long ago i was a child the last time i saw that deck a child was this before the massacre nedda looked up in dumb surprise her mouth opened to speak but she had no words did you get your tarot deck before the winter house massacre yes or no mallory drummed her nails on the table whats the problem miss winter too many murders im talking about one massacre your father your stepmother five small children the nanny and the housekeeper nine people did you get that tarot deck before they no nedda lowered her voice to a whisper no mallory switched off the machine all right you didnt hold out on that one but now ive got another problem she waited a beat then asked why did you come home again the woman looked down at her hands her head slowly moving from side to side the machine was switched on again are you telling me it wasnt your idea she glanced at the readings though she had no need of them since she already knew the answer thats it isnt it someone else brought you home was it lionel winter mallory made a note below a spiking line no not him was it cleo wintersmyth no im getting odd responses here nedda your brother and sister they didnt welcome you back did they the spikes on the scrolling paper were climbing not a very warm reception nedda shook her head no it was not and now mallory leaned far forward was it your niece did bitty smyth bring you home the detectives head dropped closer to the machine as she made the next notation yes it was bitty mallory looked up and where did she find you in a hospice no wait im sorry the nursing home i think i wasnt very clearheaded then i was moved into a nursing home after a diagnosis of endstage cancer the hospice was the last place i was taken there to die but you werent dying and you knew it even if your doctors didnt nobody comes back from the end stage so before the nursing home you were in a hospital nedda nodded her head but not a regular hospital not a place where they wouldve cut you open to look for a malignancy no expensive tests maybe a state asylum with a clinic nothing else fits nedda a real hospital wouldve gone looking for that cancer did you want to die was that it an asylum is junkie heaven all those drugs did you steal medication from other patients is that why you had yellow skin and odd results in your blood work nedda nodded how did bitty smyth know where to find you nedda looked up genuinely curious as if she had never considered this problem before a private investigator i think no said mallory that doesnt work for me its a country of three hundred million people six million square miles the detective unfolded a dust jacket from one of the pulp books written about the murders at winter house it was illustrated with the red winter painting do you see any resemblance between you and this little girl no even old family photographs wouldnt have helped to find you dont you wonder what bittys hiding why would your niece zero in on the state of maine she was working with insider information knowledge she could only get from her family you know what this means your sister and your brother always knew where you were nedda moved her head from side to side and they let you rot said mallory do they hate you that much they never wanted you back why do they believe that you slaughtered their family parents sisters brothers do they want you dead the old womans head tilted at an odd angle and her eyes were suddenly vacant as if the detective had just turned her off with the same switch used to shut down the machine tell you what said mallory rising from the table you think about it for a while she ripped her long tract of paper free of the polygraph i have to review my readings maybe youll feel better when i get back riker was quick to disillusion charles of the idea that mallory was showing the woman any kindness welcome to hell you have to stop this shes poisoning that poor woman against her whole family cant its a big mistake to get between mallory and a case and were so close charles close to what the only good result from a polygraph exam is a confession confession to a mass murder ill never believe that mallory stood in the doorway maybe the killer was breaking in an apprentice does that make it a little easier to believe a twelveyearold girl charles shook his head i dont think so new york has a criminal class of children said riker adults use them for robberies cause the kids are too young to do time they make the perfect little perps and sometimes they carry lethal weapons and sometimes they kill people said mallory now take that dead man on neddas rug the other night the detective was watching the glass window on the other room she killed that man in the dark no hesitation marks she just did him without even thinking about it i say shes had some practice she was protecting herself and bitty and then said riker theres history the one you wont find in pinwittys book there were three generations of hitmen with the same signature as the winter house massacre so they had apprentices and said mallory the apprentices killed the masters the icepick murders stopped when nedda was a little girl when she killed humboldt charless attention was riveted to nedda and she was looking his way by chance was she searching the mirror side seeking him in the looking glass wanting an ally needing a friend you cant go on with this i know what youre doing youre cutting this womans legs out from under her after you strip her of family support the only one shell be able to turn to is you shes safer with me than her relatives said mallory the one crime nobody expects me to care about is the death of willy roy boyd he was a piece of scum but he was my piece of scum and thats the case im working here somebody hired him to kill a woman that night probably nedda shes key to everything so i torture her a little and she lives or i can let her go and watch her die pick one find another way said charles this has to stop right now you can see how fragile she is and badly wounded indeed nedda had just been flayed to the bone of psyche mallory returned to the interview room but not to end the interrogation she started up the machine again and nedda lifted her head slowly sadly to face her interrogator lets get back to the man you stabbed the other night mallory turned the machine on again do you think your relatives hired that man to kill you no of course not you dont think theyre capable of murder nedda shook her head somebody hired him to kill you think about it nedda your brother and sister are always out of town when something happens how many people knew you were back and what happened to your baby sister we cant find any school records for sally winter you think she lived long enough to go to school mallory looked down at the machine youre heart is racing nedda stop it maybe they committed the perfect murder that little girl was detective mallory please stop now the attempt on your life that was a total screwup but what about your baby sister what do you suppose they did with her body dont you care we cant find any trace of her dead or alive neddas hands rose to her head warding off the words her head making small jerking movements hands rising like white fluttered wings playing bird to mallorys cat the detective pushed her chair back from the table her work was done she could roughly predict the moment when charles butler would come barreling through the door oh and here he was now such a gentleman and so angry mallory joined riker in the observation room they watched the ongoing show from the dark side of the glass charles removed all the mechanical devices that had bound nedda winter to the chair and the machine shell talk to charles yeah said riker but im not sure theres anything left for her to tell her partner had been against this idea of replacing the niece with a brandnew confidant for the old woman but he had come up with no better plan nedda preceded charles as he quit the interview room slamming the door behind him loud as a gunshot mallory his unintended target tensed every muscle in her body she turned to face riker but he looked away not wanting to meet her eyes anymore these small things the slam of a door the turn of rikers head they would remain with her for the rest of the day as a portent of things to come she was always losing people edward slope strolled up to the soho police station and a uniformed officer rushed to open the door for him though the younger man had no reason to recognize the chief medical examiner a rare visitor in this precinct dr slopes austere presence and excellent suit always commanded instant respect as he approached the front desk he wore his eyeglasses riding low on the bridge of his nose not caring that his vision was blurred the doctor had finished a mornings pro bono work at the free clinic two blocks away and he had seen quite enough for one day homeless people dying of old age in their thirties and forties impaired vision or not he could never have missed the physically imposing figure of charles butler no more than he could fail to notice a kodiak bear in his shower stall the man stood on the other side of the wide room a head above the police officers gathered here and there in loose groups of twos and threes charles was deep in conversation with a tall whitehaired woman and a child with pointed ears well that was interesting dr slope raised his spectacles the better to see the latter as a more mundane person a very small woman with a pixie haircut and ears that were disappointingly normal ah and now he had attracted charles butlers attention dr slope had never before seen this man angry charles had always impressed him as the most congenial of oversized humans one who seemed embarrassed when he dwarfed other people well this was a sight to behold the wideshouldered giant marching toward him with such grim resolution hands curled into fists and all the surrounding policemen seemed to agree their heads were turning sensing trouble so impressive was charles that all about the room hands were lightly resting on guns chapter when riker followed his partner into lieutenant coffeys office the chief medical examiner was waiting for them the pathologist was not a happy man and neither was their lieutenant dr slope fixed his eye on mallory reprimanding her with a cold stare and riker had to crack a smile this was a reminder of her kiddy days when the doctor had suspected her of some new criminal act each time they met slopes worst grievance against her was cheating at poker on those nights when lou markowitz had been on midget duty and taken his foster child along to the weekly pennyante game by lou markowitzs account his daughter had regularly cleaned out the doctors pockets and this had set the tone for slopes relationship with mallory down through the years so kathy said the doctor absolutely fearless in this forbidden use of her first name what have you done to charles butler predicting her trademark line i didnt do it he gave her no time to answer i saw charles downstairs a few minutes ago he all but slammed me up against a wall and demanded a prescription for valium and so of course i thought of you mallorys only response was to fold her arms shutting him out and making it clear that she was not going to play games with him today slopes expression was more suspicious than usual and he was puzzled too as if he knew he had caught her at something though as yet the doctor could have no idea what her most recent wrongdoing might be nothing to say for yourself kathy mallory she said correcting him as she always did and her eyes were promising payback for breaking this rule did the doctor care not at all slope handed an envelope to riker thats the report on your corpse are we still calling him a john doe burglar yeah said the senior detective we cant afford any leaks to the media i can keep willy roy boyd in paperwork limbo indefinitely said slope but its just a matter of time before somebody recognizes the corpse as mallorys ladykiller i examined the wound to his heart the sewing shears masked everything but the tip of another object something sharper narrower it wouldnt be inconsistent with an ice pick and what about the comparisons to stick man the doctor took a bundle of yellowed papers from his medical bag here your grandfathers notes i must compliment him on that signature strike superb police work i also read his summaries on the other autopsies however in this case there was so much damage done by the scissors theres no way to find any sign of it on boyds corpse and nothing stood out in the old autopsy reports on the winter house massacre of course with an exhumation the absence of any chips to the bone would no way said jack coffey im not spending money to dig up people who died back in the forties he looked up at his senior detective i cant believe you expected a stick man signature on mallorys perp i did said riker for about six minutes but now i think nedda was nedda winter slope stared at riker that was the name charles wanted on the valium prescription the doctor turned to mallory with a fresh accusation on his face though he could not name it not yet riker wished he could call his words back so little got by edward slope he could tell that the doctor was putting it all together now the passage of time a recent murder in winter house the old massacre investigation an elderly woman he had met downstairs someone with mallorys interrogation footprints all over her face and the doctors best guess at that womans age red winters age oh my god you found her charles butlers mood had improved perhaps due to drugs after filling the valium prescription at the pharmacy nedda winter had insisted upon sharing it with him rightly suspecting that his morning had been nearly as bad as hers he had already begun the work of undoing mallorys damage while collecting neddas belongings at winter house and now he had provided a safe refuge for the woman so that she could do further mending and in part he supposed that mallorys doomsday warning had spooked him and nedda too it had come as a surprise when she had accepted his offer of sanctuary so readily he set her suitcase down inside the door of his guest room and upon turning around noticed that his houseguest had been misplaced he walked down the hallway calling out nedda in here she said he entered the library and found her seated in the circle of new club chairs she seemed quite at home in this setting but then by her account she had spent most of her life inside of books a secondhand life she had called it is this where you do group therapy no he said ive never had a patient practice this is where i play poker charles sat down beside her and stretched out his long legs now in this big empty space try to imagine a gaming table made in should i imagine the cards as well no im not that far gone i gave away my old card table so id have room for one i bought at an auction the very next day the antique table was destroyed in a warehouse fire an antique you take your poker seriously and i always lose but i love the game and the company when my friend louis markowitz died i inherited his chair in a floating weekly poker game tonight will be the first time its ever been canceled because of me oh no i wasnt the one who canceled the game nedda smiled well not to waste these wonderful chairs if you cant find the right table you might open up a private practice youre a natural im something of an expert in therapists and i say youve got the gift she looked around at the other chairs which did indeed resemble a therapy group arrangement this was my life for decades one hospital after another and more doctors than i care to remember couldve fooled me he said you dont strike me as someone whos been institutionalized but then i suppose it makes a difference that you were never insane as i said you have the gift and now he picked up the threads of their earlier conversation so you believed that you could never go home again but then you did thanks to my niece but now i think it wouldve been better if id never come back well a few criminal intrusions a violent death thats quite a bit of trauma but thats not what you meant is it no youre a good listener charles you can hear things between the words i meant that it wouldve been better if my brother and sister never had to set eyes on me again im the intruder at winter house in this unguarded moment there was more sadness in her eyes than he could bear empathy was his strength and his weakness it was what suited him to a therapists role and what prevented him from ever treating a patient he would never be able to affect the professional detachment so key to the wellbeing of a therapists own mind he was already dying by degrees imagining every shock that nedda winter had born the cost of every death all the pain that she was feeling now and her terrible sense of isolation and then he pulled back emotionally and even physically he rose from his chair and unconsciously rubbed his hands together as if in the act of washing them clean of this woman well what you need now is rest this was what he also told himself this lie in reality he had just shut her down and shut her out he knew it and she knew it nedda was all alone again mallory sat in the front room of winter house sipping coffee and becoming acquainted with neddas siblings riker had begged off on this interview and she had only thought about his possible reasons in every other minute and now she made her final judgment on her partner he was losing the stomach for this case and for her company i dont understand said cleo wintersmyth why should nedda be staying at charles butlers house was that your doing asked lionel winter no mallory put down the teacup the time for good manners was fast passing it was dr butlers idea he didnt say why do you think he might have some reason to believe that nedda wouldnt be safe in this house brother and sister looked to one another for answers and now that she had knocked them off balance mallory continued addressing cleo maybe it was something your daughter said to him is she here shes not at home said lionel winter mallory understood his meaning his niece was not at home to the police the detective pulled out a small notebook a few questions came up in our investigation you had a younger sister who survived the massacre she looked down at the notebook page there was nothing written there sally was that her name i understand that she ran away from home cleo wore a frozen smile oh the dinner party thats what set charles butler off all those stories she spoke to mallory but would not look at her anymore lionel and i were away at school when sally left yes said the detective youre always away when things happen in this house she studied more blank pages in her notebook then faced lionel you fired sallys nurse shortly before the girl ran away he nodded mallory waited for him to fill in the silence with nervous explanations but soon realized that this was not going to happen he was simply tolerating her presence in the house she went for the soft spot moving her chair closer to his sister she leaned toward cleo wintersmyth but maam you said you werent here are you sure that sally ran away who was looking after her if the nurse our guardian lionel raised his voice he was looking after sally that day and yes were quite sure that she ran away while sister and brother were silently communing with one another mallory caught sight of bitty smyths reflection in a mirror that angled toward the grand staircase the tiny woman was gripping the banister and shaking her head mallory pressed on with cleo and lionel so there mustve been a report filed with missing persons what year was that brother and sister were having identical reactions and mallory knew they were doing the math in their heads this was the response of teenagers forced by a bartender to recall the date of a fictional birth on a fake drivers license so much pressure counting backward cleo fielded this one it was maybe fifty years ago she turned to her brother lionel give or take a few years he said our guardian would have filed the report with the police the detective appreciated guile prescient lionel winter had looked ahead to the next problem when the police came back to tell him that no missingperson report had been found then that bit of negligence could be blamed on a dead man uncle james mallory added sally winter to the body count for winter house that clears up most of my loose ends she produced a yellow pad the format for a murderers confession on a typical day in special crimes unit if you could just write out the details and the dates in your own words then sign it both of you she waited out the minutes it took for lionels terse written account of sally winters disappearance glancing at the mirror again she caught sight of bitty crouched below the banister rail on the secondfloor landing odd behavior for a lawyer that little woman should be rushing down the stairs to caution her mother and her uncle against signing anything for the police too late lionel was done committing this small crime the falsification of a police statement and both signatures were on the page mallory read the carefully printed words the faint erasure of numbers was barely visible in the margin he had finally worked out a year that would match up with the dinner party conversation theres something odd about this date if sally winter ran away fortyeight years ago she would ve been just under ten years old now thats odd most runaways are teenagers ive never sally mightve wandered off said cleo and she continued on in this classic mistake of explaining too much our uncle wasnt very good with children the woman looked down at her folded hands and the tone of her voice was more wistful now i had always hoped that some good samaritan had found sally lost maybe hurt and maybe lionel winter silenced his sister with one look right said mallory not bothering to disguise a tone of disbelief however cleos last words had the ring of something true well ill check it out with missing persons the detective stood up and walked to the foot of the stairs pretending to admire a large painting hanging high above her on the secondfloor landing below it bitty smyth was crouching behind the rail startled the little woman slowly rose to a stand though there was an ocean of air between them with mallorys every step forward bitty stepped back in this fashion the smaller woman was driven to the wall she edged slowly toward the door of an open room and disappeared the door closed softly how much had the little eavesdropper learned over all the years of growing up in this house was this how bitty knew where to look for nedda a woman who had disappeared long before she was born what other conversations had she overheard this way mallory turned her attention to another large oil painting as if she had needed this closer inspection of the two young men posed there charles butler had described this portrait of the winter brothers as a cartoon she turned to face the curious stares of cleo and lionel and then walked back to them killing their hopes of a quick end to this interview lets talk about the day of the massacre lionel was the first to recover from that little bomb theres no possible relevance to ill decide that i dont have much to work with i can put in a request for the file and the evidence boxes but the more i dig the more chance of a leak to the news media you want the reporters to know that red winter came home a suddenly alarmed cleo reached out to her brother stopping just short of physical contact on some level a silent conversation was going on between them for now lionel nodded in agreement with some unvoiced pact and his sister lost that frightened look in her eyes of course said lionel addressing the detective well do whatever we can to avoid publicity when we were children we couldnt go anywhere without reporters chasing us once cleo was nearly trampled in the street after that we were sent away to school and all our summers were spent in the hamptons it was years before my sister could live in this house without nightmares good mallory was satisfied that under the threat of headlines they would not be insulating themselves with a battery of lawyers you survived the massacre so im guessing you two werent in the house that day she sat down again crossing her legs leaning back and making it clear that she had all day long to hurt them as i said before youre never home when things happen here cleo stood up and crossed the room heading for the stairs and moving in the manner of one who has lost her sight hands gripping the furniture until she found the banister she climbed the stairs as slowly as an invalid mallory gripped the arms of her chair as if preparing to pursue the woman but this was only a threat of body language please let her go said lionel my sister was only five years old she cant remember the details of that day he looked down at his folded hands and i cant forget them it was a pure accident that cleo and i survived we didnt plan to be gone that sunday i had a fight with my father and stormed out of the house id only walked a few blocks before i realized that little cleo was following me she was crying my fathers temper always had that effect on her i took her to the park for a punch and judy show you know the puppets then i hired a rowboat and we drifted around the lake for another hour or so neither of us wanted to go home were there any outsiders in the house when you left i dont mean the nanny or the housekeeper i suppose its possible sometimes wed wake up and find strangers asleep on the couches people whod passed out at some party the night before but i dont remember seeing anyone else in the house that day cleo and i were away for a few hours two or three and nedda where was she she left the house before we did she went to a brunch with the smyth family sheldon may remember that he wouldve been twelve years old then i saw nedda leave in the smyths car late that morning and i never saw her again by the time cleo and i came back to the house it was all over the baby was crying in the upstairs nursery i remember that he fell silent for a few moments and mallory waited him out cleo ran through the house shaking all the bodies he said she doesnt remember that or she doesnt want to she came back downstairs crying she had the baby in her arms everyone was asleep she said and maybe sick like mommy and daddy then she tried to wake up our parents i yelled at her this tiny little girl theyre not asleep i yelled theyre dead and then i just stood there i couldnt move it was cleo who called the police that day and then she rocked sally in her arms until they arrived the policemen couldnt get the baby away from her i remember the officers taking them out the door i can still see them little cleo a baby with a baby in her arms you thought nedda killed them all didnt you this had no startling effect on him but he did not answer her mallory let herself out though there were lots of chairs around the garden riker a confirmed stoopsitter preferred his perch on the back steps of this mansion across the park from winter house the trees gave him shade from the sun of high noon he reached into his deli bag and took out the last of his lunch another cold bottle and he handed it to sheldon smyth who claimed to prize the detectives cheap brand of beer above all the costly wines in his cellar what bullshit smyth was playing the quintessential gentleman and putting the common man riker at ease but the old fart did it so well and now that the day had warmed a bit the lawyer removed his jacket and tie following his guests example so far riker had learned that despite sheldon smyths profession and a pansy tolerance for beer they had one thing in common and now they played another round of i hate divorce lawyers i shouldve tried harder to get custody of bitty smyth slurred his words bet it cost you a bundle in child support and alimony the settlement was staggering smyth upended the last bottle oh dear he said unable to extract another drop the old man banged on the back door until a woman appeared in a maids uniform he stood up none too steady on his feet to pull a wallet from his pocket upon opening it he stared at the money inside as if currency were a mystery to him riker smiled this man had no idea what beer would cost handing a wad of bills to his maid smyth sent her out for replacement bottles the man was under the impression that he had drunk only half the beer in the exhausted carton never suspecting the detectives great talent for nursing one drink indefinitely they were on a first name basis now sheldon and detective sounds pretty cold said riker the way your exwife treated your kid bittys adopted i suppose that made a difference but at least my daughter didnt inherit any of the winter genes my father disowned me you know when i married into that family cut me off no job no money i had to live at winter house for a while what was your old mans problem with the winters oh it dated back to cleos father quentin and his brother james very disreputable both of them neither one was worth anything financially or otherwise they broke their trust fund after their parents died spent all the money and so fast this is my fathers account you understand winter house was in foreclosure when the younger brother james left town with a slew of debts the older boy quentin was a dilettante who fancied himself a great artist the word dilettante had to be repeated twice first because riker could not understand the mans beer soaked speech and the second time because it amused the detective to hear a lawyer stumble this way quentin solved the money problem by marrying a wealthy woman that was neddas mother edwina as the old man rambled on riker learned that quentin winter had been livid when he discovered the terms of his late wifes will according to sheldons father edwina had changed her will once a month following fights with her husband in the last version all the money had been tied up in trust for nedda and her siblings edwina winter had been pregnant with twins when she died hence the sibling clause within a month of his first wifes death quentin winter had married his favorite model alice who was already pregnant with lionel no money said smyth but alice was a very fertile girl she produced eight siblings for nedda all those children ever meant to quentin was an increase in his guardian allotments bastard said riker so cleo and lionel take after their dad oh no nothing like him the two of them are moneymaking machines theyre worth millions but youd think theyd spent their childhood as starving orphans rather meanspirited about money and thats why you give your daughter an allowance yes bittys not up to working just now but cleo and lionel probably think shes malingering mightve been more human if theyd inherited something of their fathers spirit in spending and theyre not exacdy warm people poor bitty but you knew all the quirks when you married into that family right and i didnt care if youd only seen cleo when she was young what a beauty what put me off was the way she treated bitty from the moment i brought that baby into the house not a maternal bone in my exwifes body the only thing that stirs cleo is a rise in the stock market what about quentins brother james winter what did he do for money no idea i only know that he never did an honest days work in his life thats what my father said he liked to gamble but the man had no real profession riker had begun to wonder if sheldon was truly as drunk as he seemed was the man sharing or feeding information even lawyers stoned on cocaine were not so generous with the dark side of client histories did the police ever suspect james in the massacre the detective already knew the answer to this one but he was hoping to catch this man in a lie the police cleared james almost immediately he had nothing to gain from the murders since the trust fund was entailed to a charity he could never inherit and james was doing quite well in those days he lived in a suite at the plaza hotel but you said lionel caught him stealing from the trust yes i assume in later years james had a reversal of fortune the theft only amounted to housekeeping money fudging the figures and so on nothing major when did james winter leave town i think it was the year lionel turned twentyone yes the boy was preparing to take over the trust allotments when he noticed a few irregularities thats when his uncle james ran off probably wanted to avoid prosecution riker smiled to hide his deep disappointment so james winter was still alive years after humboldt had been stabbed to death in a little town in maine a pity uncle james had been such a great candidate for a hitman lots of cash but no visible means of support their fresh beer had arrived via the maid at the back door and when smyth had finished two more bottles riker decided to take his best shot before the attorney passed out i hate to bring this up sir but my partner still wants to see the trust documents you think i told you or was it your partner no matter no documents without a warrant but youre the executor the city attorney says that you can can but wont matter of principle riker well understood the problem so it wouldnt look good for the firm damn right it wouldnt said smyth for over a hundred years weve been known for absolute discretion and yet the detective had just completed a tutorial on the winter family faults okay said riker you got my word on this we wont tell anybody that your dad mismanaged the winter childrens trust fund the expression on sheldon smyths face could only be read as guilty surprise and in the absence of hot denial riker knew he was on to something hey im a homicide cop what do i care who diddled what and the statute of limitations is on your side but you dont want a gang of cops at the door i understand you want discretion you got it hows this you like charles butler dont you you trust him right instead of us getting a warrant to haul everything downtown suppose we look over the documents at his place neutral ground however drunken the man might be when he smiled the lucid face of the lawyer made a brief appearance just popping out long enough to say if you could talk a judge into giving you that warrant youd have it by now no deal sheldon smyths eyes were closing and riker left him sitting there amid the litter of empty bottles one more thing for the maid to clean up the quick rap on his door was somewhat annoying but hardly loud enough to wake his houseguest charles opened the new york times the rap went on most irritating he crushed his newspaper even if he had not recognized the impatient knock almost a signature he would have known it was mallory rap rap rap he glanced at his watch to see that she had allowed him a generous two hours to ply intimate secrets from nedda perhaps believing so insulting that he would never see through the ruse given time for reflection he had come to understand his true role at the polygraph examination riker had as good as confessed admitting that charles would have been mallorys guest if bitty smyth had not insisted on his presence rap rap bang eventually she would go away she had keys to the offices across the hall but none to his apartment though now he heard the sound of metal on metal oh fool i when had she ever been deterred by the lack of keys his intruder was so stealthy he never heard the door open mallory simply appeared at the end of the foyer her own surprise was fleeting there then gone he rose from the couch startled and speechless her preemptive strikes could be dazzling he was stunned that mallory was the first one to strike a pose of outrage and indignation oh the very idea that she should have to break into his apartment when he was just sitting there all the while all of this was in her face deliberately written there for him to read chief medical examiner edward slope spent his lunch hour on a treelined street in suburban brooklyn conversing on the freak warmth of october and lifting his face to the sun yes he agreed with rabbi david kaplan that every day of indian summer was a gift they both turned their attention to the mystery crate at the center of robin duffys garage while they waited for this charter member of the floating weekly poker game to join them one more time david the doctor regarded the crate with grave suspicion it was dropped off the back of an unmarked truck in the dead of night but you dont think kathy stole it the rabbi shook his head no and neither do you in edward slopes opinion the rabbi was too gentle to see the worst in others he also believed that this gentle man regularly beat him at cards by sheer luck and not by the cunning of a born poker player and in truth neither did the doctor believe that kathy mallory had stolen the crate but she might delight in this accusation perverse brat and if the truth were fully told edward slope her principal detractor loved her unconditionally a screen door slammed and they turned to see a short bulldog of a man walking toward them and grinning widely its all settled he said charles thinks the game was canceled edward slope was still grappling with the concept of a surprise poker game he faced the open garage his eyes passing over all the discarded hobbies of robin duffys experiment in retirement from his legal practice what a failure the walls were lined with tools for home improvements a halffinished canoe from the boatbuilding class and the potted remains of a dead herb garden kathy mallory was another one who did not deal well with drastic life changes she had grown up in this neighborhood and lived across the street with her foster parents the old house had burned down leaving a messy hole in her landscape until another house had been raised on the same footprint of land every fourth week of the pokergame rotation edward had remarked on the progress of the builders and now that it was done he could not claim to be shocked in the early stages of construction he had recognized something familiar in the raw timbers the bones of the house the completed structure was exactly the same in every maniacal detail this week the shrubbery had been added evergreens shaped the way helen markowitz had always pruned them the young tree recently planted in the yard was different of course or was it no that tree was the same size when kathy was a little girl he recalled the night when louis had come home with a birthday present for helen a genuine baby felon caught in the act of robbing a car what a surprise and the following week edward had helped louis to dig a hole and put a sapling into that same ground this had long been the custom of the markowitz family planting a tree when a child was born or snatched off the street during the commission of a felony robin stood beside him now admiring kathys handiwork as if what she had done was a normal thing the mailbox is the original she saved it from the ashes what about inside the house just a few things said robin but the kids still working on it took her months to find helens wallpaper pattern the company went out of business but she tracked down some rolls to a hardware store in montana the furnitures a problem too all family heirlooms some of it dated back to the twenties what a perfectionist huh every piece has to be exactly the same so she goes to estate sales on her days off he glanced back at the crate in his garage thats how she knew where to find the table robin entered the garage and selected a crowbar from the tools on the wall she says we can uncrate it to fit it through charless door but we cant unwrap it yet i think shes afraid well ding up the wood edward slope had lost all interest in the surprise poker game he continued to stare at the house across the street he tried to imagine kathy in there restoring the furnishings of the dead to make her ghosts feel more at home or was it an act of pure defiance creating this illusion that death had never come to her house either way it was quite mad but also tender and this argued well for a human heart confidential mallory was outraged genuinely this time as charles dragged her by the arm and they moved inexorably down the hall to the elevator you dont have patients she yelled no practice you cant claim protected status yes i can unperturbed he pushed the button to bring the elevator he was so calm as if forcibly dragging women around were an everyday thing with him he would not release her arm while he waited for the elevator doors to open neddas my patient he said anything she tells me is in confidence youre making this up said mallory you dont treat people thats not your line of work it is today his head lifted to watch the lights of the elevator i think it might be my true calling who knows no its just a stunt youre holding out on me obstructing justice well thats too bad something had gone very wrong with her day charles was turning against her and nedda winter was responsible for this yes it was neddas fault and he would see that once she had time to explain to make up some new lie that he could believe in mallorys anger shut down as if a switch had been thrown a circuit closed charless hand was lightly covering hers enclosing it in warmth his grip tightened as he pulled her into the elevator with him and she did not mind this human contact flesh to flesh was so rare in her life she did nothing to encourage it but when it came her way her eyes closed to the slits of a purring cat the elevator hummed with mechanical clicks and whirrs her own song of the machine and the doors opened too soon he pulled her along toward the street door maybe heading for a quiet cafe down the block they would talk and he next time you drop by the office he said you might give me a call first i cant have you running into my patient in the hallway he let go of her hand opened the door and put her out in the street like a cat the door slammed she looked upward at the sky and her lips parted with nothing to say a car pulled up behind her and riker derailed her thoughts of abandonment hey mallory she turned to see a police cruiser with a uniform behind the wheel and her partner at the rear window grinning saying its a raid kid you wanna come he opened the door in invitation then waved a folded sheet of paper i got a warrant for the winter family trust all the documents we can carry behind the cruiser were a police van and two more vehicles driven by uniforms the cherry lights were all spinning engines revving up to tell her that it was time to take this road show uptown they had lawyers to menace files to pillage a mess to make real carnage what a party nedda was standing at the stove adjusting the gas flame when charles walked into the kitchen lured there by the aroma of colombian coffee you know he said you and i might be the only people in town who know how to brew coffee in a percolator ive never made it any other way and with those words this woman thirty years his senior had won his heart he had not lied to mallory nedda would be his patient and every fear of subsequent damage to himself was put aside she had inspired him to be a braver man a better one and so he picked up their cups and led her back to the library over the next hour her eyes brimmed with tears and he felt the anguish he also took over her sense of isolation and her great fear of being alone and when she told him of her plan to find a place of her own he could not bear the idea he was drowning in neddas loneliness tell me how you got that warrant mallory demanded i went to three judges and they stopped short of spitting on me you didnt pick the right one kid and fortunately riker was not a graduate of the kathy mallory charm school he turned to watch the cityscape flying by his window then looked back to see his own personal caravan cutting through traffic and ignoring red lights ive been saving this judge for a rainy day he used to be a civilrights attorney loves the poor hates the rich god bless his liberal leftwing ass no i dont think so said the look on her face smart kid there had to be more to it than that this judge said riker hes a real old fart shouldve retired years ago he remembers when this town was turned upside down looking for red winter and hes been waiting fiftyeight years for the end of that story you told him who nedda was unspoken were the words you idiot riker let this slide still flush with the win of his warrant he had pulled off the perfect marriage of mallorys love for money motives and his own bonedeep distrust of lawyers yeah i told him everything laid it all out but dont worry this judge hates reporters more than cops now go back to the other day at the harvard club you told sheldon smyth his daughters life was on the line and he still wouldnt give you a look at those trust documents that was cold lawyers are almost human when it comes to their kids but not old sheldon so today i got him smashed in his own backyard turns out hes a flyweight drinker i sort of accused his law firm of embezzlement now that shouldve pissed him off right but no drunk as he is he says to me no warrant no documents and thats when i know hes got something to hide mallorys eyes rolled up searching the skies outside her window for winged pigs flights of angels and other miracles and the judge thought that was enough for a warrant no can i finish my story now so im in the judges chambers when he phones sheldon smyth figures its just a misunderstanding maybe we can settle this without a warrant well the lawyers still drunk when he takes the judges call his honor never gets out a word about the trust fund something on smyths end of the phone pissed him off the judge says to him suck your what and that was enough for a warrant i recommend more rest said charles a nap in the middle of the day is the worlds most underrated pleasure youre right i havent had much sleep lately nedda lifted the pan so he could admire the golden brown texture of her omelet and tonight i plan to have it out with cleo and lionel why the rush its time long past time she turned off the stove burner and carried her masterpiece to the kitchen table and ill have a better chance with them if were not sharing the same roof ah back to her plan for apartment hunting one of the most stressful activities in new york city nedda would fail to thrive in any solitary existence for profound depression would surely follow such a move well fortunately i own this apartment building he pulled down plates from the cupboard and laid them out on the kitchen table and i have a vacant apartment i think youd like it here but take my guest room for a few days if things work out well with cleo and lionel you may not need a place of your own when they were seated charles agreed that yes steak sauce was an interesting accent for the omelet and nedda asked if he had forgiven bitty for that little shrine in her bedroom my favorite is the shot of your birthday party you mustve made quite an impression on her that day yes and no said charles bitty wouldve been ten when that picture was taken she has obvious issues with selfesteem so she picked the one person she might approach without fear of ridicule someone so foolish in her eyes that she could be certain i wouldnt reject her then so as not to risk this certainty she never even spoke to me that day if she had i wouldve remembered her do you mind another theory you were taller than all the other children in that picture and even then you had the body of a young god i think my niece latched onto the idea of you as a protector and then on the worst night of her life you showed up that must have been quite magical for bitty i saw you talking to her it did her a world of good your kindness you were her hero that night and this morning you were mine before therapist and patient could complete this colossal blunder of trading places charles picked up his napkin and laid it on the table as his white flag bitty smyth had retired to her room hours had passed by since she had spoken to her aunt on the phone the cockatiel entertained her by walking about in circles and reciting his entire vocabulary rags only knew one word what the bird had learned this from her she rarely slept through the night always rising at some point sitting up in bed to say that word with each sound that roused her from sleep she knelt down beside the cage on the floor and filled the birds water cup after pouring him some fresh seed she realized that she was also hungry sensing no one at home anymore bitty ventured out to forage for food she made her way down the stairs creaking in all the places that made her believe the staircase was always only minutes from falling down the front door opened bitty grabbed the rail and held it whiteknuckle tight oh it was only the housekeeper with her grocery bags what was her name there had been so many of them none of them lasting for more than a week or so the new hire tapped in the code to disable the security alarm then proceeded across the wide front room bitty called down her late lunch order and could you bring it upstairs the woman scowled at this with good reason it was a chore and a half just to climb to the second floor and she had already made this trip too many times in one day of late bitty had developed a backbone and now she insisted that a meal be delivered to her room she had no plans to be caught downstairs when her mother and uncle came home retreating to her room she passed the time with the old family albums retrieved from storage in the north attic the bird clawed his way up the weave of the bedspread to join her in examining the photographs tasting the pages and tearing off the corners bitty absently stroked the comb of yellow feathers and ragss tiny eyes soon closed in sleep the photography had ended the year of the massacre in the yearly portraits of the winters and their brood all the children were gathered on neddas side of the photograph cleo clung to her eldest sister and lionel played with her hair the others were seated at neddas feet a loud knock on the door awakened the bird with a start what rags flapped his useless wings and dropped off the edge of the bed hitting the floor with a dull thud what bitty rose to answer the heavyhanded knocking this could only be the resentful housekeeper with her lunch upon opening the door she was faced with her worst fear for the evening her mother pushed past her to enter the room why is nedda staying with dr butler tell me cleo demanded what happened at that police station dont be difficult said uncle lionel as he also entered into the bedroom uninvited aunt nedda thought you didnt want her here uncle lionel was not surprised by this did neddy say why no but shell be back around dinnertime i know that said lionel holding up a folded piece of paper the housekeeper took a message from her she asked if we could both stay at home this evening she wants to talk to us do you know what this is about behind her uncles back the bird was climbing up the lace curtain his claws leaving holes and tatters in his wake he gained a perch on the curtain rod then spread his wings stepped off into thin air and dropped like a stone bitty watched the stunned creature stumble about in a circle lame for decades old rags persisted in the idea that he could fly well this was fun riker counted eight men and women the partners of this venerable law firm and they were almost gasping for breath the air was not so rarified on the lower floor of their holdings in this nether region accountants and clerks were caged alongside a storage area for files that dated back a hundred and twenty years riker doubted that the attorneys had ever visited this land of the underpaid though it was only three flights below their penthouse offices the firm was obviously a family business for he could see traces of sheldon smyth among the assembled faces a replicated nose or chin a pair of snake eyes here and there their ages ranged from the twenties to the sixties and yet they had lined up like children in a fire drill all eyes on the drill instructor his partner had quickly adjusted all of their attitudes and mallory had done this without the necessity of shooting one of them as an example to the rest they listened to her very attentively as she recited the parameters of the warrant two of the lawyers seemed on the verge of projectile vomit paul smyth son of sheldon went pale when mallory said the seizure of documents covers every file even remotely connected to the winter family trust that includes the firms financials she tossed this last phrase off as an afterthought leaving them all with the impression that it was true and she was not expecting any arguments riker held his breath for a moment then realized that she was going to get away with this amazing these people all held their own copies of exactly the same warrant the two detectives watched in silence while the storage room was gutted by uniformed officers carrying cartons stacking them in the waiting freight elevator and returning for more not satisfied with this staggering plunder of hard copy mallory slipped her own disc into the firms computer startling the partners anew saying this is federal software its coded to pick up only transactions for the winter family everything else is disregarded as inviolate material riker knew she was lying but the eldest lawyer no doubt left behind by the age of computers was actually nodding as if he had heard of this magical mythical software of hers the others perhaps a little more savvy were hemorrhaging as she copied their entire database this was a major gamble riker knew one elderly judge who would have a heart attack if mallorys fairy tale on the financials ever got back to him and now sheldon smyth had arrived his white head poked out of an elevator uncertain of his bearings in this strange new world of badly dressed underlings the knot of his tie was crooked and he weaved a bit as he sauntered out puffing up his chest in a prelude to voicing something lawyerly riker put up one hand to ward off mallory then picked up the warrant and flashed it faster than he could fire off a bullet this had the effect of deflating the old man who bent at the waist and plopped down in the nearest chair its all going to come out mallorys eyes were cast down to the computer keyboard as she spoke to the old man if you want to cut a deal nows the time she raised her face and graced sheldon smyth with a smile designed to make him wet his pants i know what you did it was not the petulant housekeeper but bittys mother who fetched the tray of food upstairs here eat something well discuss your aunt later on bitty had lost all interest in food but her mother prodded her and stood over her until the plate was cleaned and the teacup emptied im going to call your father sheldon will know what to do before the food could march back up bittys throat her mother lifted the tray and opened the door lionel coming of course he was brother and sister went everywhere together they were like twins joined by a shared brain uncle lionel walked toward the door then paused a moment to turn and stare at his niece it was that look he usually gave to her mother while they were silently communing he shook his head unable to read bittys thoughts no his niece was from some other planet bitty called it earth outside the raised window sash a siren was growing in volume rags rushed out of his cage running across the floor and screaming in concert with the fire engine believing it to be a giant bird coming to mate with him and bear him away to change his life and set him free her bird was in love with a big red truck the siren faded off down the street rags fell silent he walked back into his cage tail dragging behind him he tucked his head under one wing and squatted in a huddle of fluffed feathers this was a sign of deep depression in birdworld and bittys world as well she curled into a ball chapter charles butler cracked the door to his apartment and watched the heavy foot traffic of policemen marching down the hall their arms laden with boxes last in line riker set down his own carton to say hello and sorry about the commotion we got the trust documents so i see but we couldnt cart them back to special crimes said riker the boss wouldve freaked mallory walked by with a carton she never turned her head in their direction and charles gave no indication that he had even seen her he nodded his goodbye to riker then closed the door and locked it riker heard the sound of a second deadbolt and then a chain guard falling into place and mallory heard this too she turned back to the door as if the sound of three locks might be a message just for her trouble oh absolutely riker would never have believed that charles butler had the willpower to hold a grudge for six minutes and that would be a feud with a total stranger with mallory the poor bastard had no shot at all until today the uniformed officers were making their escape to the elevator when riker carried the last of the haul into mallorys private office at the back of butler and company he set it down at her feet saying what are the odds charles is gonna give us a hand with this you got another speed reader in your pocket better than that she said ive got a lawyer on the way oh well thats just great lawyers read at two hundred dollars an hour real slow he turned to the cork wall it had been cleared in preparation for their autopsy on a trust fund we dont need charles mallory opened a folder and held up a sheet with columns of words and numbers the documents are indexed and all the boxes are clearly marked she pinned up the first page of her document list in perfect alignment with the walls two pushpins riker could see their first problem in the making was his little neatness freak even capable of doing this without her usual timeconsuming perfection he decided to experiment taking a handful of sheets from her index folder he plopped them on the cork wall in haphazard fashion one pin a piece and every sheet dangling at a different angle one glance over his shoulder told him that it actually hurt her to look at his mess mallory we dont have years for this he walked off to the reception room to answer a knock when he reached the end of the hall the door was flung open and he was assaulted by a little man with the jowls of a bulldog riker was forced to endure a bear hug from the only lawyer he could abide robin duffy had lived across the street from lou and helen markowitz since forever and now in his retirement years with both his old friends in the ground robin looked upon every connection to them as his extended family he released his hold on the detective and stepped back his eyes were lit up and manic he was just so happy to be here wheres my kathy the old lawyer was in that small circle of friends allowed to address his partner by her given name and get away with it unscarred bitty smyths eyelids weighed ten pounds each she sat bolt upright on the bed to keep from falling asleep when would aunt nedda come home she poured another glass of water from the pitcher by her bed the edge of the glass blurred as she lifted it to her lips she returned the glass to the night table and knocked the alarm clock to the floor leaving the time of day a mystery or was it night she fumbled in the pockets of her skirt and found the business card that charles butler had given her fortunately she had memorized the office number for it would have been difficult to focus on the small print of the card bitty stared at the telephone as if the large numbers on the dial might be equally difficult no she would not call not yet she would give it a few more hours aunt nedda would surely come home for dinner without any prompting she had promised it was such a fight to stay awake robin duffy stood among the cartons trying to make sense of the numbers stenciled on the cardboard lowering his reading glasses he said give it up kathy the document index has no relationship to the documents all i can tell you at this point is that smyths firm is hiding something his eyes traveled over the towers of boxes each containing thousands of documents this is an old lawyers trick bury the sins in a ton of paperwork he glanced at his wristwatch its time to get charles riker listened for the sound of the reception room door closing on the lawyer he stepped up behind his partner were never gonna find the will without charles you think hell come mallory sat at her computer checking financial data she had raided from the law firm still following the money riker was at the point of repeating himself when she said hell come for robin from his turtleneck jersey to his formal evening shoes rabbi david kaplan had dressed all in black this was the proper attire in his understanding of the criminal underworld this evening he played the role of lookout man and loved it he leaned into the hallway then quickly withdrew to the elevator and spoke to edward slope in a stage whisper charles is leaving with robin he poked his head out again now theyre going into the office across the hall the coast is clear youve been waiting all day to say that line havent you please edward no noise together the chief medical examiner and the rabbi moved their heavy burden along on its rolling pallet out of the elevator and down the hallway as edward slope said once again theres no such thing as a surprise poker game shhh the rabbi was reveling in this crime of backward burglary he turned the knob of the door to charles butlers apartment as promised it opened easily pointing to a piece of tape that covered the bolt he said robins idea and that made this crime of breaking and entering a conspiracy of three the doctor and the rabbi wheeled the game table in the door snagging its padded cover on a hinge and tearing it had the table not been turned on its side it would never have fit through the door frame at the end of the foyer they stopped in heartclutching guilty surprise as if they had been caught in the act of removing something instead of depositing a gift before them stood a tall stately woman rubbing sleep from her eyes her hair was snow white and her smile was bemused she clearly recognized edward slope as the doctor who had written her valium prescription earlier in the day she studied the bulky object on the pallet its a table said edward slope as if the furniture padding might have disguised that fact ah she said i know just the place for it following nedda winter they wheeled the table into the library with no mention of the winter house massacre and the ladys celebrity status introductions were made to rabbi kaplan as the two men shifted the table off the pallet and placed it in the center of a ring of club chairs and now the rabbi began to explain what had happened to charles butlers last table burned in a warehouse fire said nedda yes i know but ive never heard of a surprise poker game the doctor consulted his watch should we unwrap it now or wait for robin you dropped something said nedda it fell out of that tear in the padding david kaplan bent down and retrieved the paper oh its the provenance kathy mentioned that it was an antique the rabbi scanned the text then abruptly sank into a club chair edward you wont believe where this table has been the job in mallorys office did not actually require a speed reader it had taken charles butler only a few minutes to break the index code childishly simple a few minutes more to locate the correct carton the correct folder and to hand over the original will to robin duffy its really quite easy charles looked down at the file inventory in his hand the last three digits of the listed items correspond to the first three digits on the cartons for the actual documents listed in the index disregard the first and last two digits of the index number and everything in the middle will match up with the numbers on the file holders he never saw their startled faces his head was deep in a carton as he fished out the folder that gave up the basic structure of the winter family trust fund done with this chore he asked what else am i looking for something incriminating said riker well ive got that right here robin duffy sat behind mallorys steel desk poring over papers covered with handwritten lines of faded blue ink im not surprised that you couldnt find a copy of this will in the public record back in the thirties you could buy off a clerk for pocket change and i can tell you right now that sheldon smyths father bought a judge thats the only way he couldve rammed this will through probate mallory stood behind robins chair and read over his shoulder so its a fake worse than that its what i call hysteric form confused and flawed edwina winter was angry when she wrote this and she wasnt thinking straight her husband was cut off thats like an invitation to contest a will everything was left to nedda and her siblings but the kids only get a draw from a family trust and theres nothing here to say that neddas siblings have to be edwinas children any sibling can benefit from the trust well said riker i guess the lady didnt count on quentin having eight more kids with another wife but heres the catch said robin she writes when my last child is dead the trust passes on to the newyork historical society sounds smart to me said mallory according to bitty smyth edwinas husband was the one who killed her maybe she saw it coming she wanted to take the money motive out of murdering her children to inherit makes sense said riker thats why nedda could never be legally declared dead charles thought of a more likely scenario edwina was preventing her husband from spending the money before the children were properly launched into the world but he kept this to himself with this wording said robin any judge would know it wasnt edwinas intention to support another womans children by a future marriage but thats a moot point the trust should never have been drawn up in the first place it was created from the instructions of a flawed will an honest judge wouldve set the will aside and divided the money between the infant nedda and her father quentin winter he looked up at charles i need to see the previous will charles flipped through the document index sorry theres only one then the law firm destroyed a preexisting will said robin duffy once you get past the hysterics the rest of it codicils gifts to friends and servants things like that its all in correct legal form she mustve copied it from her earlier will then we got em said riker the old man told me that edwina changed her will every time she had a fight with her husband in that case said robin pausing to look over the mass of cartons the earlier wills were misplaced you wont find them on the index you wont find them at all but theyre here charles butler stood at the center of the room sifting through another carton why didnt quentin winter hire a lawyer to break the will thats an easy one said riker the winter familys lawyers have always been smyths now i got a question why would the law firm keep all this stuff if it incriminates them why not destroy it lessons of nixon said robin the coverup is always worse than the crime theyd rather look incompetent than go to jail for fraud he waved one hand to include every carton in the room i dont have to look at their financials i know youll find a pennyperfect accounting for every fee and payout it might not be honest but itll look good on paper and itll pass an audit all right said mallory so the firm had to convince quentin winter that it wasnt in his best interests to contest the will right said robin if they couldnt create the trust from the will instructions then theyd lose a huge administration fee and its not like quentin was left out in the cold charles placed a folder on the desk thats a summary sheet for payouts in the first year he had more income than he could spend theres a generous housekeeping allowance a maintenance allotment for each child and a guardians draw robin studied the file then nodded the firm padded out his monthly draw my god this trust fund was worth twentyfive million dollars you know what that is in todays dollars maybe a quarterbillion more said mallory whose gift was calculation walking had become a great effort for bitty smyth when was aunt nedda coming home she undid the bolt and slumped to the floor one ear pressed against the door she listened to the loud conversation downstairs her fathers voice joined the cacophony of invectives and blame flying back and forth across the wide front room below sheldon smyth was slurring his words she knew her aunt had not yet arrived aunt nedda would not be privy to this conversation of family matters on hands and knees bitty crawled back toward her bed and pulled the telephone off the nightstand by its cord rags awoke with a start and flapped his wings what he came out of his cage on the run and squawking even the bird could see that something was wrong with his mistress charles butler and robin duffy had retired to the more comfortable furnishings of the private office across the hall where the furniture was not made of cold steel where a humidor was stocked with havanas and the whiskey was single malt when riker returned with a takeout meal his partner was standing before her cork wall studying the yellowed papers of financials from an era of filing cabinets for the first twelve years the trust fund outlay should never have exceeded the interest earnings she glanced back at her glowing monitor screen and its display of more recent data today the trust is only worth forty thousand dollars riker lit a cigarette and took a long contemplative drag he did his best thinking when he smoked figure costofliving increases more money for each new kid and you still cant spend it all not with a cap on the draw and now he dealt with the greater problem of finding something to pass for an ashtray he settled on a metal cup dumping its stash of paper clips out on the desk blotter experimentally he dropped in his burnt match and his partner did not hurt him he exhaled mallory walked half the length of the wall then stopped to tap one sheet of pinnedup paper here right after the massacre this is when it starts she moved on down the wall then paused again twenty percent of the money was drained in a period of two years the firm wrote it off as poor investment of capital you mean they stole it im betting the guardian helped with that said riker good old uncle james i say he hired stick man for the massacre him or sheldon smyths father my guess is collusion nedda went to brunch with the smyth family on the day of the massacre conveniently out of harms way mallory walked back to her computer and tapped the keys to change the document on the monitors screen i found the money only now its well over a hundred million all in personal brokerage accounts for cleo and lionel she printed out a sheet this is their investment history they took a bath in the nineties and again with the techstock fiasco now their holdings are zero risk hardly any growth but they show a deposit income of one million a year that doesnt derive from stocks and bonds and i know where it came from she split her screens to pick up an item she had flagged on the law firms financial data the law firm has a payout of one million every year its listed under client settlements lawyers paying clients not that simple mallory spent a few quiet minutes following the money through cyberspace switching screens diddling keys and robbing banks via their databases ive got a memo to purchase bearer bonds the dates and the amounts add up on both sides lionel and cleo cashed in those bonds to make their yearly deposits the screen changed again and riker turned away the moment he saw the logo for mallorys latest invasion bypassing lockouts to enter internal revenue files it always made him uncomfortable to witness a crime in progress they dont pay any taxes on the yearly million said mallory the tax is paid to the irs by a check drawn on an offshore account for a bogus corporation i feel a headache coming on said riker whos doing who best guess it looks like lionel and cleo busted the smyth firm for embezzlement but simple restitution wouldnt require money laundering on this scale what if they nailed sheldon smyths father for hiring a mass murder bitty had left the bolt undone and it had taken some time for this little horror to settle in her mind was slipping so sleepy and her limbs felt like cement she struggled to make the short trip from her bed to the door shuffling unable to lift her heavy feet from the carpet she slid the bolt home so no one would intrude upon her not until her aunt returned bitty sat on the floor her back propped up against the door listening waiting for rescue aunt nedda should have been here by now she must come very soon she must bitty called charles butlers office number again mallory continued to scroll down the lists of investments riker watched her run calculations of large figures on a split screen she was so good with the math of money motives the assistance of a forensic accountant would only have slowed her down i can access trades back to the early eighties she said allowing for dividends paid out and reinvested market booms and dives id say this stock portfolio was built up from the law firms yearly payouts over at least forty years the smyth firm is paying back the stolen money but not to the trust fund it all goes into lionel and cleos personal accounts proof of embezzlement said riker motive for a massacre and people ask me why i hate lawyers i guess murder runs in the family first the father and now the son sheldons gotta be the one who hired willy roy boyd he had to kill nedda before she started asking questions about the trust fund the detective crushed out his cigarette i love this case more and more every minute this financial arrangement works better for lionel and cleo instead of a lifetime draw on the trust fund they have access to all of the money and now theyre part of the embezzlement the restitution money shouldve gone back into the trust if nedda dies they get to keep it and now he understood the elaborate money laundering those two still dont know that the will and the trust were never valid mallory nodded because the winters attorneys have always been smyths charles poured a drink for robin duffy and ignored the telephone on his office desk one of mallorys machines would pick up the call at the reception desk before entering into a business partnership with her he had never been an answeringmachine sort of person if calls had gone astray he had always assumed that people would call back so simple and in case of emergency they would send a telegram to the door should he be out of town when people called well that was their hard luck and one less hassle to deal with now he could not escape his callers the machine seemed to work for their convenience and not his own machines were always conspiring to strip all the charm from his life once he had tried to disconnect the device and all of the phones had gone dead mallorys wiring was not to be trifled with he had never attempted another such insurrection the phone stopped ringing riker sat on the floor with the emptiedout contents of another carton searching for a lost child among the papers youre right mallory sally winter never attended a private school either no tuition payments i dont think she lived long enough for kindergarten said mallory leafing through her own stack of files theres no record of payouts for nannies after the toddler years lots of medical bills there was a livein nurse after sally winter turned four the nurses paychecks stopped so the kid was sick said riker maybe she died of natural causes i cant see any motive to kill sally then why would lionel say shed run away when she was ten years old you know that was a lie and why isnt there a death certificate on file with the city sally couldve died somewhere else maybe it was a case of neglect uncle james wouldnt want anyone to know he was an unfit guardian not before hed finished milking his cut from the trust fund riker turned to the open doorway to see charles and robin walking down the hall toward the reception room a moment later that distant door opened and closed he guessed that they were making a deli run for food and wondered if they would remember to bring him a beer mallory was sifting through the smallest carton the one that had belonged to his grandfather she began to pin the old mans diagrams of the massacre to the wall hey said riker you dont want charles and robin to see that stuff they wont be back theyll be playing poker all night charles butler entered his apartment behind robin duffy who headed straight for the library and now he heard edward slope call out its about time upon entering the booklined room he could hardly fail to notice an old gaming table surrounded by his new club chairs and three of those chairs were filled by the charter members of the weekly floating poker game oh its a beauty said robin admiring the ornate carving and the touches of gilt and inlays indeed it was a good piece of furniture in the sense of being solid and made of good hardwood but it was too ornate not the graceful antique of charless dreams this table had obviously been constructed in the twentieth century and one might even call it gaudy the provenance said edward handing a sheet of paper to robin whose eyes went round the doctor turned to charles saying its a gift from mallory it once belonged to bugsy siegel a mobster and a brutal killer but charles let this slide for it was so rare to receive a present from mallory that did not require an electronics manual to operate oh bugsy robin duffy ran one hand over the tabletop caressing it with real love in his eyes bugsy siegel the man who invented las vegas it just doesnt get any better than this indeed there were smiles all around the room even the rabbi approved and now charles realized that the other table the one linked to a former president would never have made them so happy mallory had found the magic that he had been searching for a history of smokefilledrooms and highstakes players a table with a provenance on the wild side he sat down in a chair and smiled at this company of friends he had inherited all of them from kathy mallorys foster father charless other bequest a seat in this poker game was also an ongoing treasure but the game had represented so much more to the late louis markowitz that crafty manipulative good man that stellar card shark charles had heard all the players war stories of watching kathy mallory grow up in the markowitz household and he had heard all the theories for why louis markowitz had taken a young child to the weekly poker game edward slope had once espoused the idea that louis was teaching his semireformed street thief to steal in a more socially acceptable manner rather than going straight for a victims wallet or ripping off cars david kaplan had been closest to the truth with the theory of playtime for young kathy had never had friends her own age she had always frightened normal children but these three men had never understood how truly devious their late great friend had been the policemans profession was prone to sudden death and louis had been a farsighted man he had forced these men to love his only child over the years when she was learning to cheat them and beat them all at cards and they loved her still though she had long ago outgrown their company and deserted their game of pennyante stakes and wild cards these men would never desert kathy mallory they were family now canny louis lionel and cleo were in the park that day mallory had pinned up all the old diagrams of winter house but stick man didnt know they were missing i think the original plan was to kill everyone in the house but the baby and nedda it had to look like a psycho on a killing spree instead of a hired murder but as long as they had nedda why would they need the baby the draw on the fortune goes to nedda and her siblings thats a lot of money to ride on the life of one child suppose they always planned to stash nedda somewhere else like an asylum right they can produce her if they have to but even if she dies in a hospital under an assumed name the lawyers can still keep her alive on paper and the money rolls on but james winter has to be established as the legal guardian of a surviving child this was what i got from the das office they say the court wouldve assumed guardianship for a missing child and the court couldve declared nedda dead after seven years so this is the only way that james can get his share of the money even if hed had the brains to contest the original will he wouldve been a murder suspect with a huge money motive said riker okay but sally was a bad choice the kid was sick she was a baby no friends no school connections if sally had been the only survivor they probably wouldve replaced her with another kid when she died i dont think anyone minded that cleo and lionel werent in the house that day that was an accidental bonus two spares nedda winter carried a plate of sandwiches into the library and set them on the game table amid the beer bottles and ashtrays filled with smoking cigars charles held a chair for her youll play of course i might watch for a while but im not much good at card games good edward slope opened a fresh deck at last charles has someone he can beat at poker youre one to talk said robin duffy when kathy was eleven years old she cleaned you out once a week he turned his wide smile on nedda poor litde kid she used to list to one side with the weight of all of edwards money in her pockets and lou laughed so hard he cried the doctor ignored this charles did you know that neddas father saw the shootout between the cops and twogun crowly on west ninetieth street my father and thousands of other west siders said nedda my grandfather was with him that day he said the shootout went on for three hours when twogun crowly gave up the fight he still had a pistol stuffed in each sock rabbi kaplan picked up the deck and dealt out the cards my father only took me to baseball games i had no idea the upper west side could be so exciting nedda charles edward and robin fell silent what if the massacre started at the top of winter house thats not the way the cops figured it at the time riker stepped back from the cork wall to take in the reconstruction of his grandfathers work but i think they got a lot of things wrong he added more pages from the old mans files check this out granddad made these notes in an interview with the lead detective this was right before fitzgerald died of cancer now this was maybe ten fifteen years after the murders it helps if you know that fitzgerald ruled out murder for hire the lawyers told him that the uncle knew the terms of edwinas will twelve years before the massacre james winter always knew that he could never inherit well that killed the only money motive if theres no adult who stands to gain then who hired the hitman thats why the cops settled for a lunatic on a killing spree fitzgerald figured it this way stick man starts on the first floor and works his way up then he runs out of steam when he gets to the nursery or maybe something scares him off before he can finish the job and kill the baby but your grandfather always figured it was a pro why fitzgeralds theory hung on what the lawyers said theyre the ones who killed the money motive but granddad never trusted lawyers nine people thats a lot of killing a lot of risk maybe stick man wasnt working alone three generations of hitmen what if there was a fourth an upandcomer a fledgling killer most of the poker chips were in neat stacks in front of nedda winter this is so embarrassing her comment was met with a chorus of encouragement the other players had been so eager to teach her the game that they had helped her to beat them at every hand eventually she did manage to lose all the money back to them but she had to fight them for the privilege the telephone rang and nedda glanced at her watch ill get it im sure its forme four gentlemen rose to their feet as she left the room david kaplan turned to charles shes a charming woman how did you meet charles made a slight stumble in his mind so many confidences to keep she sat next to me at a dinner party that was the truth was it not well no and now he could feel the heat rising to his face and how would the rabbi read this sudden blush david kaplans head tilted to one side he must find it odd and disconcerting to catch a friend in a lie his beard framed a sweet smile and his eyes were both forgiving and more telling his host that he could only believe the best of him david the master of cryptic logic had apparently deduced that honor must lie in the direction of falsehood and the new player was not what she seemed nedda returned to the table saying with regret i have a hired car waiting for me downstairs ill have to say good night and thank you all this was the most fun ive had in years send the car away said charles rising from his chair ill take you home no no you stay right where you are ill be fine we always use this driver my niece has a car service then i can at least walk you down to the street i insist when the apartment door had closed behind them charles said maybe its unwise right now i mean hashing this out with your brother and sister after what youve been through in the past few days i shouldve done this the day i came home dont worry about me charles opened the door to the waiting car and handed nedda into the backseat and then he gave her a set of his house keys promise youll come back tonight no matter how late he watched the taillights of the car disappear as it rounded the corner onto houston then turned back to see mallory in shadow leaning against the wall of the building this is getting out of hand charles suppose you gave your house keys to a mass murderer you dont expect me to believe that he said you dont i know shes killed before selfdefense he said and that man was a serial killer nedda didnt know that and he wasnt holding a weapon when he died could you stab an unarmed man in the heart could you even imagine it i dont think you could ever kill another human being youre just not made that way she followed him inside the building close on his heels saying whats nedda made of dont you wonder imagine her sticking that ice pick into a mans chest she d have to be fast no hesitation one clean strike no fear thats enough he walked past the elevator and opened the door to the stairwell and she did it in the dark mallory climbed the stairs behind him chasing words with pictures she planted in his head he never saw her coming for him she followed him through the stairwell door and down the hall to his apartment and what about that man in the park last night what if shed killed him too would we still be talking about selfdefense they stopped outside his door but the poisoning went on relentlessly when we found her in the park she had an ice pick in her pocket remember that charles how could he forget ever nedda will always be welcome in my house mallory looked as if he had struck her and im not im just annoying you oh no on the contrary he could never encounter mallory without feeling a sudden lightness of the head a fullness of the heart and a gang of birds fluttering inside his rib cage he reached out to touch her but his hand dropped back to his side never did they truly connect and they never would for his nature had made him incapable of two things for a certainty he could never kill a human being and he could not tell this woman that he would love her until he died how sad was that the door to his apartment opened finally a grinning robin duffy took mallory by the arm and pulled her inside edwards winning streak is back you have to stop him kathy hes murdering us lying on the floor her head pressed to the wood bitty awakened to a shrill sound from the telephone receiver an alarm to remind her that the phone was off the hook rags was running about in circles shrieking to hold up his end of the conversation with this mechanical noise bitty struggled to raise herself up to a sitting position then cracked the bedroom door to listen for the sound of aunt neddas voice but she was not there not home yet the other voices were growing more distant fading off to another room with a door they could close for privacy aunt nedda where are you any more delay could cost dearly if she closed her eyes one more time she might never wake again robin duffy had found the only flaw in mallorys gift a hole in one of the struts that branched out from the tables pedestal it had been drilled by the previous owner a ships captain so he could run a chain through the wood and secure the table in rough weather however given the original owner a renowned gangster robin had hopes of a more exciting explanation his eyes were wide with great expectation is that a bullet hole yes said mallory thats exactly what it is she dealt the cards out all around and away we go the name of the game is five card stud no wild cards no nickels and dimes in the pot skys the limit this is not your grandmothers poker game four men mentally fastened their seat belts she had to smile at charles he was looking down at the best hand he had ever held and she knew he was pondering a problem of ethics one he could not solve if his cards had been dealt from the bottom of the deck a little gift from herself it would not be right to play the hand and he should fold what a gentleman it was too easy for her to read his thoughts now he was worried since she knew he held a worldclass hand if he folded his cards instead of playing them it would be like accusing her of cheating oh but if he won and had to show his hand then everyone would know she had cheated the hand was that good she should know kathy mallory was not only a master of palming cards she could also tie a fair gordian knot this one had been designed with no possibility of an honest resolution he would have to settle for the least damage just as she did every day charles played the hand he was dealt she knew he would fortunately for him he could never run a bluff the other players read victory all over his giveaway face and they folded no one called him on his hand and asked to see his cards of course she had predicted that outcome just as he had his winning pot was small but so was his guilt mallory fell a bit short of tradition by not taking all of the medical examiners money within half an hour of play she had left him a short stack and edward slope eyed his dwindled chips with illdisguised dismay she folded her own cards and that seemed to give him a glimmer of hope the doctor won this hand but that was pure mercy on her part ive got a problem she said addressing the doctor how does a man move through a mansion killing floor by floor stabbing nine people with an ice pick and theres not one scream to give him away while edward slope was pondering this mallory watched the rabbi david kaplan had that look of trying to recall an elusive dream the nightmare of the winter house massacre and now he let it go and looked down at his cards this settled her mind on the problem of the other players keeping her confidences the doctor sipped his beer then leaned back in his chair if the murderer had chased his victims through the house there would ve been lots of noise so obviously it didnt happen that way more than likely the victims werent expecting to be stabbed like neddas dead burglar are you listening charles edward slope studied the hand she had dealt him the first reaction would be stunned surprise the heart is shredded blood draining shock sets in ill take two cards she dealt them out and they were good ones happier now the doctor continued next the sensation of cold is followed by sudden weakness throughout the body then loss of consciousness a quiet death charles would be wondering if neddas burglar had died quietly and now he must realize that she had never needed to ask these questions of the doctor who knew more about violent death than she did yes at last he understood that she was maligning nedda winter for his own sake their eyes met across the table almost imperceptibly he moved his head from side to side to tell her that this was not working the rabbi folded his cards saying im out he then went off to the kitchen in search of another cold beer mallory leaned toward the medical examiner saying so the hitman wasnt a stranger to that family and that narrows it down said charles to a hundred gangland types who attended parties at winter house yeah said robin nedda told us that lucky luciano came to dinner one night can you imagine that but you can cross that bum off the list his murders were messy mallory was thinking about a little boy just four years old and his drawing of a stick figure she pictured a bit of blood and one tiny hole where the ice pick had pierced the paper and a childs heart in one strike there was only one scenario in the moment before his death the boy had been holding up that drawing showing it to someone he knew maybe someone he loved saying a childs ritual line look what i did the front windows were dark as nedda climbed the stairs to the front door of winter house her hopes died lionel and cleo had no doubt bolted for the summer house in the hamptons there would be no family gathering no reconciliation tonight she unlocked the door and opened it onto a dark foyer calling out bitty are you home upon crossing the threshold she saw a dim light coming from the hallway that led to the kitchen but the front room was pitch black she was turning round with the intention of finding the wall switch for the chandelier when she heard the sound of footsteps rushing up behind her she could hear the voice of uncle james coming from a long ways off and many years ago yelling nedda drop the ice pick drop it now chapter the front room flooded with light from the chandelier lionel ran past her to the front door nedda had forgotten to turn off the alarm she murmured apologies to her brother as he madly tapped the button pad on the foyer wall entering the code that would prevent it from going off crisis over and now that they were spared another visit from the nypd he said neddy we couldnt reach dr butler we thought you mightve gone back to the police station possibly under arrest we couldnt get anything out of bitty arrest for which of her crimes did he mean the stabbing death of a man in this same room or the other man she had planned to kill in the park or was her brother alluding to the mass murder of their family members she turned to the sound of more footsteps cleo entered the front room followed closely by her exhusband sheldon was no doubt here by design her brother and sister had no wish to be alone with her tonight she was wondering where her niece might be hiding when a weak voice called down from the staircase here up here four heads were turning lifting to the sight of bitty dragging herself to the edge of the stairs in a childish gesture one small hand raised slowly as if to wave bye bye and then she laid her head down on the floor and closed her eyes nedda was the first to reach her none of them could wake her charles was holding a rather mediocre hand of cards when he answered the knock at his door his unexpected visitor was a stout woman from a more ludditefriendly century an oldfashioned carpetbag sat on the floor at her feet o pioneer she had the wellmuscled arms of a woman who labored hard for her living and the iron gray hair was bound in braids her walking shoes were sturdy and the blue dress had great integrity so plain and serviceable he half expected her to produce a pitchfork or some other farm implement she stared him down with great sensible brown eyes then extended a hand to greet him albeit somewhat reluctantly the calluses on her palms fitted so well with the social slot he had created for her later he would learn that the hobby of her retirement years was rock climbing hence the good muscle tone and calluses that she hailed from a large city in the state of maine so much for the farm life that she held advanced degrees in library science and was a denizen of cyberspace susan mcreedy she began not one for unnecessary pronouns and verbs of introduction i dont take you for a sneak mr butler and ill tell you why when i asked you blunt questions on the phone you didnt lie to me you wouldnt tell me the truth lord knows but you wouldnt lie and i suspect that goes against the grain with you so tell me straight out is she still alive after escorting their new interview subject into charles butlers private office riker sat down in an armchair beside the librarian from maine mallory regretted agreeing to second chair in this interview out in the hallway her partner had argued that little old ladies were his forte that they loved him on sight this might well be true but susan mcreedy was not little nor did she look all that old and she could probably take riker down in two falls out of three riker began with small talk and offers of coffee or tea the woman from maine tapped one shoe barely tolerating this waste of her time off his game today he had missed the other signs of her fidgeting fingers and lips pressed tight he compounded his error by pausing a beat too long to allow her the full impact of his widest smile miss mcreedy did not respond in kind her mouth dipped down on one side and now both shoes tapped the floor with irritation this baffled him he must wonder what foot he had put wrong so obvious youre sure i cant get you a cup of coffee the woman only glared at him finding him suspicious because of his engaging grin too quick and easy too professionally charming mallory had a cure for excess charm she rose from the couch and moved into that narrow area between their chairs too close to allow this woman any personal space and closer she put her hands on the arms of miss mcreedys chair and bent low until their eyes were level closer so your father was a cop was he a lousy cop didnt he raise you right every inflection dropped out of her tone and each word had equal weight when she said i am the law i dont have time to mess with you start talking though susan mcreedy never twitched or blinked she did smile in approval you want the whole story or just the salient points riker stood up conceding his chair to the new champion of seniorcitizen interviews and mallory sat down saying i want everything youve got on the redhaired girl dont leave anything out all right the girls hair wasnt red the first time i saw her it was shoepolish black dyed and cut real short miss mcreedy had lost her edge almost mellowing as she described the night fiftyeight years ago when two local boys had seen the yellow stalks of headlights beaming up beyond the rim of a bottomless quarry pool the car was hung up on an outcrop of rocks twenty feet below the rim just hanging there smashed to bits all turned around and ready to fall another fifty feet to the water when dad and the neighbors got to the lip of the quarry it looked like it was going down any second there were six flashlights altogether all aiming straight down through a broken windshield and they could see the girl plain as day so much blood the twisted metal pinned her down on the passenger side it was a sheer drop between the edge of the rock face and that car riker interrupted her leaning in asking how did your dad read the scene that night did he take it for an accident susan mcreedy turned to mallory with a raised eyebrow to ask if this interruption was necessary mallory only stared at her in silence and the woman took this for an affirmative my father had two different theories two years apart that night he figured it for an accident the quarry pool was a good place to lose a car a body too but leaving the headlights on would defeat that purpose wouldnt it now the door on the driver side hung open and angled down toward the water so he figured the driver dad was guessing a teenage boy ten wrecks out of ten were teenagers well he thought the driver mustve dropped into the pool and drowned that was assuming the crash didnt kill him first you could expect a corpse to bloat up with gas and rise to the surface after a while but that one never did mallory made a rolling motion with one hand to move the story back on track well a sheer drop like that one youd need a rope to get down to where the car was dad and my uncle were rockclimbing fools they had all the gear in the trunks of their cars and pretty soon both of them were rappelling down that rock wall by the light of the neighbors flashlights they worked for hours to free the girl from that car one wrong move the car would drop and the girl would be lost nothing has ever come out of that pool except bloated dead bodies animals mostly and a few suicide jumpers all the while they worked they did a balancing act to keep the car from teetering off that outcrop of rock hooked their own lifelines onto the metal they couldve died that night they didnt care they were going to carry that girl out if it killed them both to do it so the ambulance crew lowered the stretcher then dad and uncle henry strapped her in after they hauled her up the ambulance driver took one look at that poor broken girl and told my dad shed never make it well dad climbed into that ambulance and rode with her to the hospital talking to her all the while demanding that she survive and she did but it was a few years before she was mended it was one operation after another she was real brave all that pain years of it riker asked what about the car it fell into the quarry pool dad and his brother were on the way up when the car went down it was that close so your dad never traced the car no need he knew whose car it was while he was still up on the rim it was stolen from my uncles parking lot uncle henry had a little restaurant the only one for miles around riker exchanged looks with mallory i know what youre thinking said miss mcreedy but youre getting ahead of the story you said every detail right well dad figured the girl was at least eighteen if not older full grown she was a tall one so thats what he put in his report if the doctors thought different they never said or maybe they just couldnt tell she was so smashed up poor thing no part of her was whole and she could never tell dad anything helpful not her name or who the driver was nothing at all the hospital called her jane doe we called her our jane she lived at our house between hospital stays dad could never quite let go of that girl until the day he died and his brother felt the same way the three of them were forever tied together in a way that wasnt quite like family in some ways it was a closer bond i know that sounds odd i understand it said riker mallory knew she had missed something important here but she let it slide away for it had nothing to do with her case susan mcreedy was less annoyed with riker when he asked about her fathers second theory im getting to that she said the poor girl had gone through four operations before she was off the crutches for good then she wanted to earn her own keep two years had gone by we thought she was at least twenty years old by then the woman reached down and pulled a paperback book from the carpetbag at her feet but i guess we all know better now she was only twelve when we found her isnt that right miss mcreedy turned from mallory to riker her expression was almost a challenge to contradict her she was satisfied by their silence and continued so she was just fourteen years old when my uncle gave her that little apartment over the restaurant i wish that we had known she was just a little girl the woman stared at her shoes overcome by sadness mallory and riker kept their silence everyone admired our jane for working in the restaurant so public and all customers tended to stare at her in all the wounded places that showed but she soldiered on looked them all right in the eye as if her face were normal good as theirs thats when we came to believe she was really on the mend mallory stared at the cover illustration of the book in the womans hand it was a reproduction of the red winter painting a store receipt stood for a bookmark this woman had only recently worked it all out i guess said susan mcreedy i can put one thing and another together pretty well first that new york author calls me a few years back and then mr butler the same questions the librarian held up the book when she said im sure you guessed our jane didnt look anything like this on the night of the accident or anytime after that her face was broken nose cheekbones her jaw and that childs legs oh lord they rebuilt her with steel pins and sewing needles susan mcreedy paused but not to any dramatic effect she was having difficulty going on with her story and she had not yet come to the most important part riker was leaning forward to interrupt one more time mallory glared at him to warn him off so one day all of us were going up to bangor to see my grandma but jane wanted to stay behind well my uncle closed the restaurant that weekend and he guessed the girl wanted to spend her free time reading always had her nose in a book that one a habit she picked up in the hospital i guess two days later we came home and found her in that little apartment over the restaurant she was sitting on her bedroom floor beside a dead body a man with an ice pick in his chest flies everywhere but our jane didnt seem to notice them or him either she d gone all the way crazy just rocking back and forth i dont think she could hear us when we spoke to her it was all too clear that miss mcreedy was seeing that tableau again fresh as yesterdays blood and blowflies and your dad said riker how did he read that crime scene it was obvious the man shed killed hed broken into her place no doubt about it he broke down the bedroom door to get at her it was off its damn hinge she mustve been so frightened and said mallory she just happened to keep an ice pick in her bedroom yes and that was the saddest part that nearly killed my father and thats how he put the whole thing together she fell silent for a moment so thats when he worked out his second theory said riker gently prompting her susan mcreedy nodded it was an old ice pick he found in the dead mans chest the painted handle was flaking it used to be in uncle henrys restaurant he told dad he tossed it out just after our jane moved in upstairs the girl must have found it in the trash and kept it all that time dad saw flakes of that same color paint on the underside of her pillowcase and thats how he knew for all that time shed gone to sleep every night with that pick underneath her pillow all that time shed been waiting for that man the one whod left her for dead at the quarry shed been waiting for him to come back and finish her off the retired librarian looked down at her hands as she folded the paperback book into a fat cylinder and then came the second theory of what happened at the quarry pool dad figured our jane was the only one in the car when it went over the rim that night so that was no accident it was attempted murder dad didnt see the driver as a local man nobody who lived in walking distance hed stolen that car because hed be needing his own car to make a getaway so he was a stranger just like our jane after she killed that man with the ice pick if dad had only known how young she was well if hed known then i dont think he wouldve let them take her to the hospital that day or any other day from there she went to a state asylum that made dad and my uncle so crazy they tried time after time to get her out of there and bring her home but every time they got a new sanity hearing shed do something to mess it up once she slashed her wrists another time it was her throat finally dad had to let go of her he came to understand susan mcreedys hands were clasped tightly around her paperback and squeezing it this really hurt him but he realized that our jane felt safer in that place than home with us he didnt protect her when she needed him most my father went to visit her every weekend until he died then the asylum was closed down for medicare fraud and the patients were scattered all over creation years later i tracked one jane doe to a nursing home north of auburn but it wasnt our jane all right said mallory moving on your father mustve traced the dead mans fingerprints yes he did it took a while no national data base in those days the dead man had a record in three southern states con games and stealing never killed anybody that we knew of he was jailed under a slew of names but never for any great length of time what about humboldt said riker remember that one and all his other names she bent down to the carpetbag at her feet and pulled out a thick envelope opening it she emptied the file folders onto the coffee table mallory leafed through the decades of yellowed documents one mans search for a redhaired girls past an ongoing inquiry that had lasted another twenty years after nedda had killed stick man and now she was staring at the original cards bearing the dead mans fingerprints so said susan mcreedy regaining her poise you think that man humboldt killed her family you think thats why our jane took him down with an ice pick she held tight to the paperback book with the painted image of a naked child red winter her jane so she saw that her family murdered twelve years old and she words had failed the woman from maine yeah said riker if the reporters get hold of this story he knew that he would not have to finish that thought for her the woman was nodding saying i understand we never talked and i was never here she turned to mallory but could i see her just a picture of her mallory held up one finger to tell the woman to remain where she was then rose from her chair and left the room taking the files of jane doe along with her when she returned she held out a crimescene photo and not the one that pictured nedda winter seated near a more recent corpse it was a simple shot of the old woman standing before the grand staircase majestic her face and body no longer broken as they were in miss mcreedys memories here take it keep it thank you the woman stared at the image of her jane grown old she looks good doesnt she i never saw her face after she looked up at mallory smiling at a sudden recollection my father paid for that you know after she was committed to the asylum three more operations with a plastic surgeon and it cost the moon to do it but dad just had to finish putting her back together again miss mcreedy became lost in the photograph once more oh what a pretty robe shes wearing and that looks like a real fine house yeah said riker a mansion the woman looked up from this treasure that marked the end of her own family quest this story doesnt have a happy ending does it no said mallory dont expect that and now that susan mcreedys usefulness was over the young detective turned her back and left the room and went to her own office where she began to pin the contents of the maine file to her cork wall fifteen minutes had passed and she was not yet done marrying these pages to those in the file made by rikers grandfather when her partner sang out hey mallory you gotta hear this she walked into the reception room to find robin duffy and riker bent over the answering machine they were playing back the messages from bitty smyth slurring her words more with each call and asking when her aunt was coming back home neddas gone said robin and so is charles a little while ago nedda called him on the phone in his apartment he was off like a shot going to the hospital he said something about an overdose of pills cleo wintersmyth her brother and her exhusband were seated in the hospital lounge and all three heads were slowly turning to follow the progress of charles butlers march from the street door to the front desk a nurse assured him that yes he was on the restricted list of visitors he could feel three pairs of eyes on his back as he walked to the elevator apparently these family members had not made the cut curious riker folded his cell phone theyre all at the hospital the whole family came in together sheldon smyths there too good mallory doubleparked her car in front of winter house then theres nobody home to mess with the crime scene according to rikers source at the hospital the only crime had been an attempted suicide but his partner loosely translated this to an attempted murder that would give them free access to the house without the tedium of chasing down a warrant they climbed the short flight of stone steps to the front door mallory was unwrapping the small velvet pouch that held her favorite lock picks hold it riker turned the knob the door opened id say that speaks well for the family he entered the foyer and looked around nobody home they were in such a hurry to get bitty to the hospital they forgot to lock up not quite one of them stopped to set the alarm she punched in the numbers and the glowing light went out howd you know the code he held up both hands never mind i never asked a door was closing on the floor above them theres someone in the house mallory raced up the stairs and reached bitty smyths bedroom in time to hear the toilet flush and smell the vomit beneath a layer of cleaning solvent the evidence was now swirling down the drain a woman in a shapeless dress hired help by the looks of her emerged from the private bathroom to see mallory standing there angry and the woman screamed you cleaned up after bitty smyth said mallory unperturbed by the highpitched wailing who told you to do that police the woman screamed help police riker was in the doorway panting and reaching into his back pocket for the badge that would shut this woman up he could not yet speak heavy breathing was all that he could manage the woman screamed again louder this time bitty had been drifting in and out of consciousness when she was fully awake the hospitals resident psychiatrist ordered the room cleared the two visitors retreated going off in search of the cafeteria nedda relied on charles to follow the signs and arrows that would lead them to hot coffee he guided her into a brightly lit room of formica tables sparsely populated with people in street clothes some sitting alone others huddled in twos and threes only matters of life and death could account for the laymen gathered here at this late hour charles seated his companion at a secluded island table close to the wall and far from eavesdroppers when he returned with their coffee in paper cups he picked up the conversation begun in the corridor so youre quite sure it was a suicide attempt she nodded bittys not a strong person i remember when i was drowning in despair i know all the signs my own suicide attempt took years i used to swallow pills that other patients spit out on the floor but your niece has a prescription for sleeping pills no chance of an accidental overdose none bitty also has a phobia she cant swallow tablets they have to be crushed in water before she can get them down you see how unlikely it is that she could lose track of them did you mention that to the psychiatrist yes bitty gave my name as next of kin im sure my sister didnt appreciate that and consequently this would not be the time for any family meeting with the object of reconciliation what triggered the attempt any ideas my fault said nedda looking at this through bittys eyes i blame myself she worked so hard to do this wonderful thing for cleo and lionel she found their lost sister it should have been a magnificent present poor bitty she couldnt know that i was the last person they would ever want to see why such animosity because of the murders their parents their brothers and sisters every time they look at me it hurts them more than knives cutting into their eyes when charles and nedda returned to bittys hospital room her attending physician was waiting for them saying its all settled shell be with us for a few days and there be a cop posted on the door said mallory striding into the room she glared at the tiny woman on the bed as if this attempt at suicide had been a ploy simply to annoy her charles could tell that bitty was only feigning sleep this time but he said nothing to give her away mallory turned her attention to nedda you shouldve called the police first now its too late all the evidence is gone no one told those idiots in the emergency room to save the stomach contents the doctor was about to take offense at this for she was referring to his idiots but now thinking better of that with perhaps a keen eye for disturbing personalities who carried guns he was edging away from mallory and toward the door then gone theres no mystery about her stomach contents said nedda prescription sleeping pills my niece took an accidental overdose she lied nearly as well as her opponent calling the police never entered my mind that much was certainly true oh no mallory was leaning over bitty for a closer look saying shes faking shes awake thats enough said nedda my niece needs rest and you need to leave this room the young detective was squaring off against the older woman when charles appeared at neddas side lending support to the idea that mallory should leave and right now it was an unsettling moment charles looked into mallorys eyes and roughly guessed her thoughts she was wondering if he would humiliate her if he would physically move her out of this room laying hands on her for the second time in one day and no he would not have the heart for that but she chose not to give him the benefit of that doubt in her mind she turned and left the room mallory could commit any sort of bad act and depend upon him to feel the guilt how did she do that riker sat with the family members in the reception area of the hospital his pen moved across the page of his notebook taking down their statements on bittys overdose any idea how many pills she took no we never thought to ask said bittys mother it was quite a scene nedda was jamming her fingers down my daughters throat to induce vomiting i was on the phone said lionel finishing the sentence calling for an ambulance sheldon smyth was being unusually quiet for a lawyer riker wanted to stick a knife in the old man by asking exactly when cleo and lionel had discovered that the law firm was ripping off their trust fund but mallory would shoot him for tipping their hand too soon he looked up to see his partner marching across the lobby heading toward this little family with all the deadly resolution of a train on the way to a wreck he turned back to cleo resident of a planet where people communicated via telepathy the woman was staring at her brother something passed between them and they were of one mind riker was sure of that before their heads turned in unison to stare at mallory these people were creeping him out this time bitty was not faking she had fallen into a natural state of sleep and there was no conversation between charles and nedda neither of them wanting to disturb her rest but now the patient stirred eyes opening to smile at her aunt i knew youd come to the rescue said charles so you knew you were in trouble tonight i must have taken too many sleeping pills all the signs of a lie were there eyes shifting away from his fingers fidgeting on the blanket so uncomfortable in this falsehood youre not sure he smiled to say never mind i heard your messages on my machine it seems like you knew what was happening but you waited for nedda why not call an ambulance yourself i wasnt thinking very clearly perhaps she had not believed that her family would have opened the door to an ambulance that was one possibility the one that kathy mallory would have liked best mallory sat in the hospital lounge facing cleo and lionel with the clear understanding that they were a unit what they had suffered as children might have formed that weird bond or it might have developed while they were murdering their little sister the only winter child still unaccounted for bitty smyths near death had expanded the possible scenarios for sally winters disappearance where would two children hide a little corpse not in the hat closet that had so intrigued mrs ortega children did not wall up bodies they buried them as they buried family pets the dead girl would have taken up no more ground than a goodsize dog childs play brother and sister sat together with the same body language arms folded eyes level and calm meeting her gaze and awaiting the inevitable interrogation she let them wait sheldon smyth seemed sober now the old lawyer was tensing also bracing for an onslaught of questions his brow was lightly filmed with sweat though the hospital lounge was cool and dry this old man was going to be so easy to break she could watch the works of his brain churning behind his eyes trying to anticipate her first question heart racing all three of them were waiting for her wondering when she would begin the inquisition the three of them were leaning slightly forward expectant crows on a wire mallory stood up and turned her back on the trio then crossed the lobby in tandem with her partner and without a single word spoken the documents raided from the smyth firm gave mallorys private office at butler and company the look of a temporary warehouse but one located in that other dimension where chinese puzzle blocks were born she was stacking cartons of varied sizes to form an enormous cardboard cube at the center of the room while she explained that the outer shell was made with asyet unread documents riker admired the walls of her structure from all sides it was a maniacally efficient use of space and very disturbing to a man who tossed discarded beer cartons into the corners of his apartment so he could readily discern the empties from the partially emptied riker wrecked her perfect symmetry by dragging a carton out of formation an hour later he was sitting on the floor almost done gently laying out the last of the brittle pieces of paper from the middle years of the previous century these canceled checks bore the signature of the guardian james winter and they were arranged in the order of their dates if sally winter didnt die of natural causes we can rule out uncle james for the killer he looked up at his partner she was engrossed in pinwittys book and paying no attention to him arent you going to ask me why hmm mallory turned another page riker had finished working backward in time to lay out the last check it looks like james skipped town before sally died all the signatures in this group were traced every one of them exactly the same i guess the smyth firm didnt want to break in a new guardian so they kept him around on paper but these forged checks are still making payouts for doctors visits and home nursing for the kid i never thought james winter killed sally mallory held her place marking the page with one finger as she closed the book this text is unreadable but the pictures are interesting were there any prints on stick mans ice pick theres nothing about it in this book or your grandfathers notes who knows i told you all the evidence boxes were robbed gutted for souvenirs that ice pick disappeared fifty years ago one long red fingernail tapped the book cover so how did pinwitty get a photograph of the pick what there arent any photographs in that book then charless copy must be a revised edition mallory opened the volume and showed him the clear picture of an ice pick in an evidence bag you can even read the detectives signature on the label upon their second visit to martin pinwittys oneroom apartment the first thing the detectives noticed was an elaborate profusion of flowers exotic blooms well beyond the authors purse its a sympathy bouquet my mother died yesterday pinwitty rushed to the stove and began a lame attempt at hospitality lighting a flame under his teakettle this time the detectives did not feel obliged to eat stale pastries and drink cheap swill riker turned off the gas burner just give us the ice pick and well go pinwittys lips parted as if to scream riker was holding up the book and it was opened to the picture of the murder weapon in an evidence bag this pick i bought that photograph i never actually had the no said riker you dont wanna lie to a cop he flipped through the pages of the picture section you took all these shots yourself cheaper that way right your publishers even gave you a photographers credit i dont have the pick anymore yeah you do said riker the winter house massacre is your whole life once you had that pick youd never let it go my mothers illness was very costly i had to sell off a lot of things riker shook his head to let the man know that he was not buying this excuse you wouldve sold your mother for medical experiments before you sold that pick pinwitty was backing away when he made eye contact with mallory he turned back to face riker finding him less threatening a mistake and now the author made a little stand of sorts he straightened what passed for a spine and thrust out his chin what there was of it the pick is mine i bought and paid for it well said riker that makes my job a lot easier you just admitted to buying stolen goods give me the pick or we tack on a few more charges statute of limitations said the author i bought it more than seven years ago you got me there pal i can see that i just dont watch enough cop shows on television so i guess all weve got on you is concealing evidence in an ongoing case no wait a minute if you broke the seal on the bag we can add tampering with evidence and then theres my personal favorite obstruction of a homicide investigation he stepped toward pinwitty and the man fell back into a chair startled to be suddenly sitting down and looking up at the detectives angry face riker put his hands on the padded arms of the chair and leaned into the authors face as he explained the worst of this mans crimes and youre pissing off my partner riker pointed to mallory who was seated in a chair next to the sympathy bouquet idly ripping the heads off of flowers the chief of forensics personally returned the ice pick to mallory and riker more accurately he dropped the pick on his desk blotter and threw the paperwork in rikers direction the big man leaned forward voice icy saying you told my people this was a rush for a fiftyeightyearold homicide you bastards im up to my eyeballs in work and you come in here with this crap riker was mentally digging himself a foxhole underneath his chair so said mallory so casually as if she were not in deep trouble for lying to hellers staff you got a match on the fingerprints and now it was her turn to receive a flying object the small white card with nedda winters elimination prints from a more recent crime scene it sailed across the desk and landed in her lap riker regarded finnegans bar as the front room for his upstairs apartment it saved him the trouble of picking up his dirty socks when company came calling and now he greeted his first guest of the evening and waved the man to an empty bar stool reserved in his honor hey thanks for coming charles butler had been to finnegans before but he still turned heads with the regulars men and women with guns he stood a head above the rest broader in the shoulders and entirely too well dressed for this dive and this company of walltowall police when will they release nedda shes not a prisoner riker held up one hand to flag down the bartender two fingers in the air netted him a nod and a promise of two beers she can walk out any time she likes this wasnt mallorys idea nedda wanted to do it ill get a call when its over youre sure the lady doesnt want police protection tonight no she was adamant about that shes positive that her niece attempted suicide and i agree with her maybe it was a cry for help but not attempted murder so neddas moving in with you for a few days charles accepted a beer from the bartender maybe longer you didnt discuss any of the evidence with her did you i mean the will the trust fund no it never came up in the conversation and i dont think she gives a damn about money thats mallorys fixation not neddas charles sipped his beer not inclined to volunteer any more so im guessing you and mallory are at odds right now im guessing cause the kid never tells me anything i suppose i question her methods yeah she does things that youd never do riker drained his glass and a few things i wouldnt do either thats what makes her a great cop now if she was working for the opposition id lose sleep at night did you have any time to look at my file charles laid the ancient folder on the bar it contained more of pinwittys collection pictures recently acquired for the next revision of his book the old crimescene photographs showed all the dead bodies of the massacre some large and some painfully small i agree with you it fits better with a murder for hire not the work of a lunatic or someone with anger issues he lowered his head and spoke to his glass you know whats most disturbing about the massacre at winter house oddly enough its the lack of rage assemblyline carnage how do you profile a killer like that someone sane who kills for the money well charles you dont you know why these people dont drop in from another planet they dont start out as psychos theyre us he could see that charles was resisting this idea i can tell you how its done how theyre made you take a youngster out in the woods the boys first kill is all set up for him the victim is kneeling on the ground hands tied behind his back all the kid has to do is put the gun to the back of this mans skull and squeeze the trigger but the victim is begging for his life and crying therere maybe two three other men watching the kid theyre all junkyard dogs but they wear silk suits they drive nice cars and the boy looks up to them he cant back down can he naw too humiliating plus hes scared shitless hes either one of them or hes a liability hell of a choice hes got so he does it its a small thing they tell him just squeeze the trigger kid they say and thats what the kid does he blows a human being away and gets sick all over his shoes hes crossed a line and he cant get back the next time is easier soon its just his job he wasnt born to do this i guess thats why the mob would call him a made man hell spend most of his life in prison but the boy doesnt know that yet you can make a hitman out of almost anybody but its better if you get em young riker nodded toward the window beyond the glass a twelveyearold boy stood on the sidewalk talking to a girl his flawless face growing pinker by the second he was falling in love for the first time his whole shining life ahead of him that kid would do charles turned his face to the window and the youngster on the sidewalk so innocent the raw makings of evil what about mallory when she was younger naw she wasnt the best scratch material did that sound reassuring would charles buy a lie when she was ten years old she was a fullblown person he smiled at this memory of a wildly talented street thief with the chilling eyes of a small stone killer and she hasnt changed all that much charles seemed genuinely relieved what a gift for denial poor bastard he was always seeking evidence of a beating heart and a bit of a soul never appreciating the true marvel of mallory that she functioned so well without them chapter lieutenant coffey was in the dark and he was in awe on the other side of the oneway glass nedda winter was seated at the long table passively watching a police aide who laid out the polygraph equipment the rubber tubes the clips and their wires so thats red winter jack coffeys words were as soft as whispers in church when the lady came in she told the desk sergeant that your polygraph exam was never finished the lady nedda winters supporters were legion now this was her idea not mine mallory sat down beside the lieutenant but no pressure right he kept his eyes on the woman in the next room i know her niece attempted suicide tonight you didnt make any threats against bitty smyth did you even bitty had champions when the police aide had departed from the interview room nedda winter reached out for the transducer and attached this cardio device to her thumb next the woman bound herself with the rubber tubes that would record her breathing and last she attached the clips to her fingers dragging her wires with her she moved her chair back to the wall after removing both her shoes she sat there very still staring at the oneway mirror the window for the two police sitting side by side watching all the years ive been on this job said jack coffey ive never seen anybody do that before he turned his eyes to mallory unspoken was the question what did you do to that woman he could never voice his suspicions contrary to policy mallory had failed to tape the previous polygraph examination now he was assuming the worst of her and only grateful that there was no proof mallorys hands curled into fists under cover of darkness rising from his chair the lieutenant said lock up this room before you go in there i dont want anyone to see this and he would not watch either no stomach for it wait said mallory you think im a monster right so why dorityou take over her tone was pure acid go on fix the old lady a nice cup of tea be her new best friend see if she tells you anything useful anything at all jack coffeys hand rested on the doorknob he would not turn around and he could not leave but first said mallory you can take my badge she rose from her chair and stepped closer to the window on the interview room then leaned her forehead against the glass im so tired of everybody lining up behind nedda winter whats the point of me showing up for work anymore mallory reached into her back pocket and pulled out the leather folder that held her gold shield the old womans holding out on me and thatll get her killed but what the hell if she dies she dies right and nobody cares who massacred her family and sally winter more old history who cares if that little girls body was stuffed in a hole like a dead dog not me not you jack coffey turned around to face his detective i know youll never let go of that badge mallory youre better at this than your old man when he was in his prime he quit the room closing the door softly just to let her know that though she had cut him at the knees there were no hard feelings and now that she had beaten coffey she glanced at the window on the interrogation room one down and one to go she looked over her handiwork this barefoot woman wired to a machine every muscle tensing bracing they stared at one another nedda was blind to mallory but well aware that she was being watched from the other side of the mirror the woman was waiting so patiently for the game to begin she raised her head as if to ask the young detective when kathy mallory left the observation room locking the door behind her not out of deference to jack coffeys wishes but for the sake of privacy alone she entered the brightly lit interview room and nedda winter looked up with no reproach for what was about to happen to her mallory knelt down on bended knee and lifted neddas right foot in her hand noting its fragile paperthin skin and the raised blue veins that came with age and a hard life she gently slipped one shoe back on the womans foot and carefully tied the laces not too loose not too tight when she had done the second shoe she raised her face to neddas the night you killed willy roy boyd you didnt find that ice pick on the bar in the dark you had it under your pillow didnt you nedda nodded between wariness and surprise mallory removed the metal clips and unfastened the tubes that bound the womans breast you never feel safe anymore do you no not for a long time not since you left the last hospital mallory walked back to the table and pulled out an ordinary wooden chair that had no wires sit here fumbling with her list of rules for a life she added the word please when nedda had joined her at the table the detective said suppose we just talk and nedda did she began with the morning of the massacre counting up the dead all those bodies when i got to the top of the house and saw the nanny on the floor i couldnt go into that nursery i didnt want to see sallys body i couldnt find cleo and lionel but id only searched the rooms upstairs returning to the staircase she had stopped awhile by her stepmothers corpse she was a silly flighty woman but i loved her so much she was the only mother i ever knew then i sat down on the steps beside my fathers body james winter had entered the house as she was pulling the ice pick from her fathers chest uncle james bundled me into the car and we drove to a dingy little building in greenwich village he left me there for days and days said he had to go back for the ice pick because my fingerprints were on it when i saw him again he told me it was no good the police got to the house before he did and they had the ice pick he said theyd found the bodies of all the children cleo and lionel too and the baby was dead they were hunting for me he said he cut off my hair and dyed it with shoe black i stayed in that room for a long time i dont know how many days i lost count an old woman brought my food clothes too i think they were hers she was very kind to me shes the one who taught you to read the tarot cards said mallory how did you know that i know almost everything just a few more loose ends go on one night the street outside my window was full of police i thought theyd come for me the old woman came upstairs she said we had to clean the place right away and then id have to leave if the police found any trace of me shed go to jail we worked all night into morning washing down the walls the floor the furniture while she was downstairs getting a suitcase for me the police came and took her away later that day uncle james came back we waited for dark and then we drove up to maine he said he had a summer cabin there when we crossed the state line he stole a car from a restaurant parking lot and left his own car in its place i remember a road into the woods after that all i have are missing pieces of memory like uncle james turning off the headlights i thought that was queer the road was so narrow and the woods were pitch dark we were driving blind the last thing i recall was the cars inside light coming on i dont remember the crash when i woke up i was in the dark and the car was rocking i was in so much pain i turned on the headlights they pointed straight up at the sky and below me there was nothing but black space i screamed a cop named walter mcreedy rescued you yes later he told me that the driver had drowned in the quarry pool you never told mcreedy who the driver was i thought uncle james was dead walter said the body would float up eventually but it never did and he never mentioned finding my uncles abandoned car in the restaurant parking lot i could never ask him about it i told him i couldnt remember anything and thats how you knew your uncle meant to kill you that night yes uncle james must have jumped from the car just before it went over the edge thats why the inside light came on and the police never found his car because he d used it to drive back to new york so i knew hed tried to kill me and he was still alive you couldnt tell walter mcreedy the truth no and i couldnt go home again i didnt know that there was anyone alive to come back to and the police had my fingerprints on the ice pick this pick mallory reached into her knapsack and pulled out a plastic bag containing the murder weapon there were only two fingerprints on the handle thats how the police ruled you out as a suspect thumb and index finger the prints you left when you pulled the pick out of your fathers body theres no other scenario for the way they appeared on the weapon otherwise the pick was clean so the lead detective figured the killer had the presence of mind to wipe that pick after using it to murder nine people so why leave two clear prints behind on a murder weapon the fingerprints cleared you those cops only wanted to find you and bring you home nedda bowed her head if i had known that cleo and lionel were still alive i wouldve told walter mcreedy everything but i believed uncle james when he told me that their bodies were found in the kitchen i never got to that room mallory leaned toward her one hand resting on her arm you spent two years with the mcreedy family off and on between surgeries most of the time was spent in the hospital the mcreedys never talked about the winter house massacre that was national news nedda almost smiled once there was life before television you cant imagine that can you but we had radio on a clear night one station from bangor that played gospel music you were famous but i wasnt the lindbergh baby just the debris of a crime that happened somewhere else the local paper was a twopage weekly newsletter and the biggest news in that small town was the story of the mcreedy brothers rescuing me and risking their lives to do it now you see why my uncle took me there to die mallory nodded and all that time you spent with the mcreedy family you were waiting for james winter to come back and kill you yes twice i thought he was dead and i was wrong both times when i was fourteen i thought i was being watched no i knew he was watching me your uncle james yes i found cigarette butts at the edge of the yard and sometimes id see them glowing in the dark from my window i didnt want uncle james to come after me while i was living with the mcreedys i couldnt lose my second family that way so when the family left town to visit relatives i stayed behind you set yourself up as bait to draw him out i loved the mcreedys nedda looked down at her folded hands the man came for me in the dark he broke down my bedroom door but i was ready for him id been ready for two years you stabbed him with an ice pick you kept under your pillow yes but it wasnt uncle james i sat next to the corpse all night long when morning came i never looked at the mans face i couldnt bear to see him i was still afraid of him even then can you understand that no mallory could not but she nodded saying you were only a little girl when the mcreedys found me there with the body i was sent to a hospital they said i was in shock i couldnt speak for days it took a long time for walter mcreedy to identify the corpse he visited me in the hospital and told me that id killed a smalltime criminal named humboldt i asked him over and over if that could be a mistake and he said no that was impossible fingerprints never lied so you stayed in the hospital to keep that family safe you figured james winter was always out there waiting for another chance to kill you this also explained the death of willy roy boyd and the neardeath experience of the private investigator in the park it was nedda winters job in life all her life to protect the people she loved the detective laid two sets of fingerprint cards on the table one had been found in pinwittys stash of stolen evidence souvenirs of a massacre these are your uncles elimination prints the police took them on the day of the massacre they wanted to rule out family members the second set of prints had come from the new orleans police this was the fruit of rikers grandfather and his lifelong search for red winter this set of prints belonged to the man you stabbed in maine theyre a perfect match for james winter thats impossible nedda shook her head my uncle was alive for years after i stabbed humboldt no thats the story you got from your family and the real story after two years as guardian james winters signatures were forged on all his checks he was dead you stabbed him to death when you were fourteen years old he died in maine the night he came back to kill you she held up both sets of cards walter mcreedy was right fingerprints cant lie your uncle and humboldt were the same man mallory waited out a long silence in something close to pity or mercy as close as she could come to these qualities she had just told this woman that her life in hiding had been for nothing that she could have gone home to grow up in her own house with cleo and lionel her family and now the truth was slowly quietly killing nedda winter if you like i could get you a cup of tea said mallory as if she had not just destroyed this woman nedda reached out for the detectives hand but she must have sensed that her touch would be unwelcome and she withdrew these are just copies mallory slid the fingerprint cards across the table making a little bridge to nedda winter with these sorry bits of paper you can keep them if you like the womans mouth opened wide to emit a strangled cry she doubled over as if her great pain were physical and her wounds mortal and then came the tears and now mallory knew what she must do she left the room to fetch a cup of tea the magical properties of this drink were writ large in her inherited rule book for life in copland tea was a detectives official bandage for grief and tears so said her foster father coffee made people jittery lou markowitz would say and sodas just as bad oh but a cup of tea could soothe all the bloodless wounds the killer pain that came with the worst news of life and death in new york city mallory had simply accepted this arcane lore and gave it equal credence with her store of instructions for the best way to bag bloodsoaked clothing and the meaning of maggots in a ripe corpse tea would fix nedda winter the three of them silently advanced down the hospital corridor but cleo and lionel were not part of sheldon smyths united front they had reservations and sheldon must have sensed this for he turned to his exwife saying cleo we simply cant leave bitty here why not it doesnt matter now said lionel winter the decisions been made for us bitty isnt going anywhere he pointed to the end of the corridor and the police guard posted outside of his nieces room he wont be a problem said sheldon i can get a court order if it comes to that im not without friends in this town and family said cleo indeed there were smyth connections to all the major fortunes of new york city they were prolific with their seed all but sterile sheldon he had been forced to adopt his familys bastards paul and bitty the cuckoos eggs planted in other peoples bloodlines bitty will be in my custody said sheldon weil see countered his exwife lionel stood at her side to form a little wall of two that would brook no resistance cleo left her exhusband to the chore of cowing the young policeman while against the officers protests she and lionel walked into bittys hospital room charles butler entered the interrogation room to find nedda with her eyes red and swollen her face was wet with tears he held his arm out and she took it allowing him to raise her from the table as they moved toward the door she did an odd thing considering whom she was dealing with tonight nedda rested one hand on mallorys shoulder and lightly kissed her hair the young detective never moved she only sat there rigid unyielding alone charles and his elder companion strolled arminarm out of the police station and down the narrow soho street heading in the direction of his apartment building she corrected his premature judgment on her weeping mallory has given me the greatest gift ive never been so happy charles struggled with the image of mallory as a bringer of gifts and joy however it was hard to argue with the evidence of this smiling woman at his side she pressed the precious fingerprint cards to her breast you know it was bitty who told me that they were alive my brother and sister i had something to live for someone to come home to you cant know how badly i wanted my family back she paused in a pool of lamplight and studied her cards now thanks to mallory i can prove that i was innocent and that i never abandoned them or stopped loving them an hour later charles was still coming to terms with the gift terrible and wonderful that nedda had received at the police station oh the waste of all those years tonight this woman glowed by candlelight that softened the evidence of age and he could see what her alternate life might have been far from the narrow confinement of hospitals her intelligence and grace wealth and beauty would have laid open the entire world for nedda winter he found her lack of bitterness remarkable and so he was the one who felt the profound sense of loss they sat at the kitchen table sharing a late evening repast of wine a wide selection of cheeses and a generous assortment of ovenwarm croissants stuffed with sweetmeats charles fobbed this off as snack therapy stuffed with his good intentions of excess food his houseguest pushed back from the table this is so charming a psychologist who holds sessions in the kitchen how wise so cozy and secure good he said im glad you approve the next session is breakfast nedda glanced at her watch i wonder if bittys asleep i suppose its too late to call her at the hospital no need to worry about her i think itll do bitty good to be out of that house for a night and you too he had made up the spare room and intended to bar mallory from the door indefinitely even if it meant laying his body down across the threshold tomorrow night well have your brother and sister over here for dinner and that of course means group therapy and down the road well include your niece when shes ready charles did you find it odd that bitty never wanted to move out of winter house and get a place of her own no not at all i dont think shell be able to leave until she has her mothers approval i assume thats the reason she went looking for you to finally please her mother she got no thanks for that with just a few words uncle james made me believe that i was the prime suspect im sure he had an easier time convincing two younger children youre quite sure he did that yes it was pretty obvious the first time i saw them at the hospice horrible isnt it for lionel and cleo i mean no wonder they spent all their time at the summer house and poor bitty not the response she expected from them but she couldnt take back her gift and now this suicide attempt ive been such a disappointment to her bitty smyth stepped out of the rollsroyce her father and mother held her arms as they supported her imprisoned her and uncle lionel drove off to the parking garage with his precious car bitty looked up at the only home she had ever known and its dark parlor windows so like dispassionate eyes winter house did not care what transpired within tonight not because it was inanimate but because it had grown accustomed to the lack of love and the plethora of death chapter cleo wintersmyth fumbled in her purse for her own prescription sedatives she handed the pharmacy bottle to her exhusband sheldon youll have to crush these in water why because your daughter could never swallow pills bitty watched him amble off toward the kitchen she was always startled by each reminder that her father knew less about her than strangers did but now this pain was put aside uncle lionel would be back from the garage soon and this was rare and precious time a few minutes alone with her mother i want to show you something she retreated to the foyer closet flung open the door and swept three hats from a lower shelf no bitty dont do that cleo had the tone of one reprimanding a fouryearold as she came up behind her daughter and bent low to collect the fallen haberdashery but now the hats dropped to the floor as her hands flew up to cover her face my god its a mouse hole but the house hates mice how could this no mother i drilled that hole myself see how shallow the closet is and the back wall isnt cedar all the other closets in the house well of course its shallow its a hat closet its always been a hat closet theres no such thing aunt nedda said this was a normal closet when she was a little girl she said coats were kept in here well the house was rented out when we were children one of the tenants must have changed it into a hat closet no its a normal closet with a false wall if you look through the hole not a mouse hole said cleo well thats a relief her eyes traveled over the exposed section of the wall youre right its not cedar looks cheap i cant believe ive never noticed that before but then its always been full of hats there was a time when everyone wore them so it made sense you see to have a place to its not a hat closet this was bittys attempt at yelling but it came out as an impatient squeak its a hiding place she hunkered down in front of the drilled hole with more composure she said if you shine a light in there you can see a trunk its just like the trunks in the attic did you ever count them mother one for every dead winter except for sally didnt you ever wonder about sallys trunk the south attic we never go up there why would we why would you i dont think i want to oh no bitty i asked yon not to do that hats were in flight once more as bitty cleared one shelf and then another cleo ran about the foyer rescuing hats on the fly and yelling bitty stop stop it this instant she reached high in the air to catch one with a wide brim sailing by like a frisbee bitty lifted one board from its moorings and then the next she never heard the door open but now uncle lionel was behind her asking whats going on bitty have you lost your mind bitty was laughing though not hysterically this was genuinely funny she might be the only one in the house who could pass a psychological evaluation cleos arms were wrapping round her daughter as she yelled youre not well you dont know what youre doing this has to stop oh yes the terrible insanity of skimming hats across the foyer bitty wrestled free she ran through the doorway and across the front room aiming herself at the kitchen like a missile she collided with her father a glass of water fell from his hand and crashed to the floor she circled round him ducking his hand and almost slipping in the wide puddle upon entering the kitchen she pulled open the glass cabinet that housed the fire extinguisher and the ax bitty returned to the front room to enjoy one shining moment as the center of attention the three of them were agape and staring at the fire ax in her hand her father was shaking his head trying to make sense of this sight his daughter armed with a lethal weapon ah and now she discovered a new side effect as she walked toward them and they moved back power she entered the foyer to stand before the closet it was now bare of every shelf within her reach she took one mighty swing of the ax to crack open the brittle plaster wall her second swing was too high slicing through one of her mothers hats and trapping the blade in the cut of high shelf braver now the trio entered the foyer hands reaching out dont you dare bitty pulled the ax free and turned on them her mother held up her hands like a mugging victim its all right dear everything is going to be all right bitty swung the ax again putting another hole in the thin board of the closets back wall and raising a small cloud of white plaster dust thats enough said her mother sternly now as if her fortyyearold child were merely acting up in front of company bitty made another swing wielding the ax with all her might the wall cracked inward she used the ax as a hammer to drive the shards of the wall back into a hollow space thats enough said cleo stop it completing her very first act of open rebellion bitty pulled loose other sections of the ruined wall working like a dervish to expose the small trunk on the floor behind it as she gripped a brass handle and dragged it out it became wedged in the opening with one hard tug the trunk came loose and flew backward with bitty into the room landing on its side and falling open to spill its contents at her mothers feet a rotted nightgown a yellow braid a tiny skeleton if a doll had bones lieutenant coffey had been almost flattered almost when district attorney buchanan deigned to visit special crimes unit at this late hour having left a dinner party and one royally pissedoff campaign contributor during an election year the dapper little weasel had come accompanied by an honor guard of five minions all of them dressed in tuxedos and shiny shoes there were rarely any of the female assistant das in his traveling entourage they were much too tall in high heels buchanan liked to surround himself with small men following the principle that no head should be higher than the kings for the past ten minutes the lieutenant had endured the protocol of ascending and descending speech he was always called jack and buchanan was addressed as sir or mister district attorney and now buchanan had run out of breath in a rather onesided argument or perhaps he had simply exhausted his store of insults the lieutenant picked his next words with care well sir its the kind of case that comes along once in a career thats no excuse i told your detectives to stay clear of that law firm they completely disregarded my direct order and now i understand that theyre harassing one of sheldon smyths clients a seventyyearold woman for gods sake shes being watched around the clock yes sir we have a plainclothes detail guarding nedda winter coffey sat down behind his desk and picked up a pen well jack you can forget that court order for protective custody i blocked it yes i know jack coffeys grin was wide and impolitic as he finished scribbling his note and now he passed it to the district attorney who read the single line oh jesus christ the note dropped to the floor as buchanan stood up and cleared the room waving his adas out the door yelling move now when his entourage had fled the office the district attorney lowered his voice to a conspirators whisper red winter you plan to implicate the smyths in the winter house massacre do you want me to have a heart attack right here right now oh yes and if there was a god no fucking way jack the lawsuit potential is staggering now listen carefully this is another direct order from me to mallory and riker from now on your detectives stay away from the smyth firm and nedda winter in that case screw it you dont get to order my detectives around thats my job and if youre not gonna help them then stay the hell out of their way buchanans mouth was moving but no words were coming out this was almost an assault these words of insurrection and now it must occur to him that the lieutenant had a bomb in his pocket he did i smell conflict of interest said coffey and this was a roundhouse punch of words hell youre going out of your way to advertise it he walked around his desk to loom over the shorter man and buchanan lowered himself into the chair the lieutenant bent down working his way into the mans personal space and the da had nowhere to go im betting that law firm turns up on your alist for campaign contributions you like the smyths so much fine then you go down with them heady words in an election year mallory appeared out of nowhere neither man had heard her coming she laid a copy of sheldon smyths canceled check in the das lap to back up the lieutenants charge of conflict of interest buchanan was a long time staring at that check as if he were counting the many zeros of his purchase price as if mallory only wanted change for a dollar she said i need a court order to force nedda winter into protective custody no judge will sign off on that until they get a call from you the mans eyes were little gray pinballs as he considered his options and now buchanan the weasel was back eyes sly and calculating he crushed the photocopy in one whiteknuckled fist perhaps with the idea that women were easier to intimidate is this your idea of a gift mallory dusted imaginary lint from the shoulder of her blazer yes thats exactly what it is youll want to return that campaign contribution before we make the arrest mallory was now dead to the district attorney he turned his angry face on the lieutenant all right jack youll get custody of the old lady but thats all you get he held up the photocopied check down the road you dont get to use this crap on me again deal and coffey would abide by it the favor bank of cops politicians and other felons depended upon the principle of honor among extortionists cleo wintersmyth made a break with manikin demeanor she was so much softer now leaning down to the trunk she wiped ages of dust from the small brass plaque to read the name of her youngest sister sally the woman sank to the floor and knelt before the spilled remains of a dead child there was no flesh on the bones a hole had been gnawed in the trunk and that could only be the work of hungry rats so much for the theory that it was the house and not the exterminator that killed the vermin and other pests the rodents had left behind a long cornsilk braid cleo caressed it with a trembling hand baby sally thats what we called her she picked up a tiny shoe brittle with age the laces had rotted away in a stutter of tears she said we were a family sally lionel and me bitty was stunned mother instinct had been there once but it had been exhausted on a little girl who had died so long ago mother can you see me im standing here right beside you im alive look at me look at me this was the lament of a child and it had never worked bitty stared at the ax in her hand and the destruction of the closet wall she was still invisible for all of this baby sally echoed lionel with more feeling than bitty would have thought possible suddenly the bizarre little family reunion with a skeleton was done feelings spent brother and sister donned their masks again and turned in unison to face sheldon smyth lionel stepped toward the man as if to strike him your father told us she died in the hospital but sally never made it that far what are you saying the lawyer was backing away uncle james was long gone said cleo sally didnt have a guardian to authorize hospital care did that worry your father sheldon maybe said lionel he was afraid the authorities would ask too many questions they might find out that our guardian had abandoned us cleo seamlessly continued her brothers thought the court wouldve appointed another guardian and asked a lot of questions but the smyth firm wasnt finished draining our trust fund lionel pointed to the bones at his feet so it was sallys bad luck to get between the lawyers and the money you cant believe my father would have any part in murdering a small no i dont said cleo sally was dying from the day she was born but i think her death was damned inconvenient for him and when she was dead said lionel your father put her inside that wall if she was ever found then uncle james could take the blame if he ever came back if uncle james ever demanded the rest of his cut said cleo theres no other explanation for keeping sallys body in the house or did your father intend to blame it on us lionel winter turned to his niece with mild surprise as if noticing bitty for the first time your mother and i were only children so easy to intimidate uncle james disappeared after a few years and the three of us were left with a nanny and sallys nurse if the authorities found out what our situation was they wouldve split us up and put us in foster care thats what the lawyers told us they said we were penniless sheldons father moved the three of us into the summer house he said the cost of taking care of us was out of his own pocket his generosity his money he told us we were worse than penniless said cleo he said this house would have to be rented out to pay down the family debts one day your mother and i came back from school and the nurse told us our litde sister had been taken to the hospital we never saw sally again she was here all that time cleo glared at her exhusband if the ax were in her mothers hand id like to know said lionel was sally dying or dead when the nurse called your father out to the summer house to collect her no sheldon said cleo dont shake your head dont pretend that you dont know all the details i know your father wouldve warned you about a little body walled up in this house the smyths are longterm planners said lionel cleo looked down at her daughter another smyth didnt you ever wonder why your father never wanted custody of you the smyths plan ahead for generations bitty turned to her father but he was looking elsewhere all her life she had been told of a custody battle that had never taken place and all this time she had been her fathers tie to the winter family fortune a tie that could not be undone until a day when all the money would flow back again the other way generational planning the lawyer in sheldon smyth was smiling at his exwife if this is made public cleo you and your brother lose everything back to the trust fund when nedda dies it all goes to the historical society youll be dead broke the both of you and lucky if you dont wind up in jail but we didnt do anything wrong said cleo we were the victims i dont think the district attorney will see it that way said sheldon it all depends on what sort of a deal i make for myself if it comes to that if you push me to it you two became coconspirators when you had the trust fund money repaid to your personal accounts you were originally intended to have a lifetime draw but you wanted all the money those were your terms that was so long ago said lionel surely the statute of limitations it doesnt apply here ask my daughter shes a lawyer the yearly reparations installments oh lets call it extortion that makes it an ongoing crime lionel and cleo turned to bitty silently asking if this was true it was an interesting moment for a legal consultation bitty loosened her grip on the ax then idly shifted it from hand to hand giving this problem actual consideration did either of you sign anything to get those yearly payments damn right they did said sheldon that money is trust fund restitution it cant be disguised as any other form of compensation if the firm goes down so do they sorry bitty shrugged thats how daddys firm ensured your silence they made you part of the crime she looked down at the tiny skeleton at her feet two crimes and no statute of limitations said sheldon who was enjoying this just too much you see the trust was never entirely drained the theft of the restitution money is a crime in progress conspiracy grand theft he nudged sally winters trunk with the toe of his shoe and may i point out that youre the ones in possession of a dead child the fact that the body was hidden well that guarantees a homicide investigation reporters camped out on the doorstep television people and their cameras following you everywhere you go you find that appealing no they did not cleo was holding on to lionels arm for support so said sheldon it appears that we have a lot to talk about and then we have to put sally back in the wall he turned to his daughter bitty my love youre also a part of this now he gave her his most radiant smile then turned back to his exwife cleo suppose you put on a pot of coffee well all sit down together and bitty said cleo go up to your room ill call you down when weve agreed on something she reached out and plucked the ax from her daughters hand as if this deadly weapon were no more than a disallowed sweet that might ruin bittys dinner go on now defenseless bitty climbed the stairs when she turned back she saw her uncle picking up the bones of his little sister and gendy reverendy placing them in the trunk nedda was drinking courvoisier in charless front room when she began to beep she pulled the pager from her pocket bitty made me take this when we were at the hospital horrible invention said charles id never own one pagers and cell phones those gadgets dont make life easier for people they simply make escape impossible she looked at the glowing display of digits on the face of the pager and of course this number is bittys cell phone then ill give you some privacy said charles i have some work to do in my office across the hall i might be awhile so dont wait up sleep well see you in the morning nedda waited until he was gone then rang bittys number charmed by the oldfashioned rotary dial on the antique telephone she held the receiver to her ear and only counted one ring before she heard bittys voice hello dear how are you feelingwhat calm downyes dear but why did you leave the hospital why would they dont upset yourself no of course i dont mindwell sort this out when i get there nedda found paper and a fountain pen in the drawer of a small writing desk she left a note for charles explaining that bitty needed her and that she might be gone for a few hours her next call was to the car service an unmarked police car stopped beside a recendy vacated stretch of curb outside of charles buders apartment building the watchers were changing shifts and all the attention of the man behind the wheel was devoted to the task of parallel parking his partner stood on the sidewalk directing the stop and starts of squeezing the car into a tight parking space that done a perfect job they settled in for the last tour of duty on this plainclothes detail when the custody order arrived the old woman would be taken away by police from another division it was going to be an early night and they were both thinking ahead to cold beers and hot slices from rays pizza as the taillights of nedda winters limousine disappeared around the corner harry bell the desk sergeant in the soho station house looked up to see a rookie standing before him though he should not have seen the youngsters face for another five hours the cop was supposed to be sitting in a chair outside of bitty smyths hospital room an unauthorized posting that had drained the bank of favors owed to detective mallory peterson said the sergeant you should be uptown guard duty at the hospital is it all coming back to you now i was relieved of duty said peterson tacking on a belated sir now thats funny kid cause i dont remember calling you back here so whose idea was it was the family they relieved me the mafia that family was gunplay involved no sir the boy made the mistake of smiling at his sergeants little joke instead of running for his life it was sheldon smyth hes the ladys father and hes a lawyer oh well that makes it okay sergeant bell knew he could shoot this boy right now for just cause and get away with it i guess they changed the line of command now its lawyers giving orders to the uniforms instead of their sergeants well somebody shouldve told me harry bells smile grew wide and wicked as the young cops face quickly reddened the torture of raw recruits passed for sport on a slow night that was what rookies were for that was why god had made so many of them tell you what kid why dont you go upstairs and explain all of this to detective mallory no go ahead shell understand ever met her no sir perfect well she looks like a babe real pretty but dont let that fool you down deep shes a motherly type harry bell watched the rookie drag his feet climbing the stairs to special crimes unit if the sergeant had been wearing a hat he would have removed it and whistled a funeral hymn winter house was dark when nedda opened the front door by the dim glow filtering in from the street she could see the floor strewn with haberdashery and bits of plaster her nieces frightened ramble on the telephone seemed more coherent to her now the wall switch would not work but the security alarm still glowed she tapped in the code to disable it then crossed the threshold into the front room moving toward the staircase in total darkness her only weapon was beneath the pillow in her bedroom she looked up at the sound of her name whispered from the secondfloor landing by the light of a candle bitty drifted down the stairs pausing halfway with a finger pressed to her lips to caution silence she lifted the candle high to light neddas way as they climbed slow and stealthy toward bittys bedroom once they were behind a closed door her niece said i called the police theyre not coming maybe i put it badly i might have seemed hysterical i told them i was afraid to leave my room the lights wouldnt work they already think im crazy they said i should call an electrician scores of candles were alight on every surface and wavering with the drafts of the house nedda picked up a candlestick and walked back to the door ill go down to the cellar i know where the fuse box is but first she would go to her bedroom to fetch the ice pick no bitty grabbed her aunts arm pulled her away from the door then slid the thick bolt safe home theyre all downstairs in the kitchen theyll see you they uncle lionel and my parents why does that please aunt nedda this was probably not the time for a rational conversation she only wanted to end bittys fear all right dear if that worries you ill use the garden door to the cellar but one of them pulled out the fuses so ill put in new ones theres a big supply of them on top of the fuse box a flashlight too nedda put one hand on the doorknob dont leave me alone the look on bittys face was pure anguish nedda was wondering how much of this could be put down to hysteria and then bitty described the trunk of sally winter and its sad contents hard news as though her youngest sister had died only this moment and the grief was new sally my sally so the house truly sickened was coughing up its dead tonight i know why the house has gone dark said bitty im supposed to have an accident on the stairs the desk sergeant noted every head in the station house turning toward the stairs and it was no surprise to see kathy mallory flying back to earth her feet touching down on every third step apparently young peterson had confessed with eyes cast down sergeant bell feigned interest in his paperwork as the detective sped by his desk he inquired after the health of his young rookie did you kill him he looked up to see the back of mallory pushing through the door and into the street ill take you back to charless place in soho nedda looked through her purse by the light of a dozen candles finally emptying it out on the bed to search for a scrap of paper with a phone number for the car service here i found it she picked up the telephone receiver and listened to a dial tone well the phone is still working bitty screamed and grabbed her aunts arm nedda whirled around on the far side of the room the wastebasket was in flames the fire climbed the curtains with astonishing speed eating the lace flames licking the ceiling and spreading along the wallpaper bitty was yelling and waving her arms the bird ran from its cage wings flapping in a fair imitation of his mistress nedda scooped up the bird and crammed it into a deep coat pocket then grabbed her niece by the arm we have to go bitty we have to get everyone out of the house nedda slid back the bolt and dragged her niece into the hall closing the door as the bedcovers burst into flames they were at the edge of the stairs when she saw a march of three candle flames below and the glow of three disembodied heads floating in the dark the small procession of cleo lionel and sheldon moved toward the staircase smoke seeped out from under the door and rising in a draft drifted across bittys face oh god she broke free of her aunts grasp and ran up the stairs to the next landing no bitty come back nedda gave chase as the little troop of candles had dwindled to two and climbed the stairs bittys face was a picture of abject horror as she looked back toward her room the smoke was escaping through the wide crack beneath the door and winding upward following her up the stairs nedda caught up to her niece but failed to get hold of her bittys hands were windmills to fend off all comers as she ran upward the smoke went with her rising in her wake she stumbled and would have tumbled back but nedda was behind her to break the fall a gray cloud was forming below and billowing toward them obscuring the stairs bitty we have to go back through the smoke hold your breath no no nedda warded off the swats from her nieces flailing hands below her she heard the bedroom door being opened no she screamed close that door ive got bitty ill get her out save yourselves the smoke was spreading and thickening blotting out the landing below she dragged her niece down into the smoke the only way out it cost her precious air to scream cleo lionel get out get out of the house beloved faces were emerging from the black cloud coughing choking hands reaching out bitty was loose again running upstairs to where the air was still breathable fire the homeless man banged on the glass door of the apartment building he was in tears fire people are dying dont you believe me no probably not it was one of those upscale places where tenants walked toy dogs that ran on batteries for all he knew the rich were a different species and he had never suspected them of sanity or humanity the doorman with his white gloves and fake gold buttons had been among these people too long when he turned to the glass he did not see the shabby madman crying outside in the cold banging the door in frustration trying to save a few lives no this man looked right through the bum then turned his back well insulated from the sounds of the street the chill of the night air the smell of derelicts and smoke bastard the temperature was dropping and the homeless man pulled up the collar of his threadbare coat as he ran back to the house next door the tiny woman sprawled on the steps was rolling on her side a cell phone fell from the pocket of her dress and clattered to the steps the derelict grabbed it up to punch in the emergency number that would bring out the fire engines and now he was believed a small tan car pulled up in front of the house with a screech of brakes followed by the slam of a door a longlegged greeneyed blonde was bearing down on him oh lady what cold eyes you have in a split second he identified her as a cop for so many years he had been kicked awake by cops while huddled in doorways uptown and down and no mistake this woman was one of them big trouble he knew what an odd sight he was a raggedy bum with a cell phone he held out the phone to surrender it yelling i didnt steal it okay it fell out of her pocket and this was followed closely by a silent prayer that he would not be hurt the cop was staring at the dark front windows no flames were visible but the reek of smoke was strong and now she looked at him actually saw him spoke to him you called nineoneone yeah he looked down at the woman who lay at his feet theres more people in there an old lady carried this one out and then she ran back inside she said to tell the firemen they were all upstairs dont know how many he watched the cop pull a penlight from the pocket of her blazer as she marched up the stairs to the door a puny penlight he knew it would be useless where she was going he called after her i tried to stop the old lady then i closed the door behind her you never wanna feed oxygen to a fire a fireman had told him that and now he watched the cops back as she disappeared into the house and he gave her up for dead he knew the odds against her ever finding her way back it was the smoke that killed and not the flames he had learned this the hard way in a flophouse fire barely escaping with his life but not all of his hair and skin another smoke alarm went off loud and piercing mechanical shrieks calling out to survivors would be a waste of air and effort mallory pulled her tshirt up to cover her nose and mouth she entered the dark front room on the run heading for the staircase guided by the thin beam of a penlight that lit up a stream of gray fog on the lower floor she aimed her light at the stop of the stairs the pathetic beam could not penetrate the thicker smoke flooding the second floor it only bounced off a roiling black boiling upsidedown sea and she was going into it eyes tearing shut tight she pocketed the penlight and gained the secondfloor landing as air exploded from her lungs she hit the floor and sipped from the inch of air above the floor then crawled along the carpet she found the first body by touch a man by the feel of him and he was dead like a sack of sand the corpse lacked the yield of an unconscious victim this flesh was only a bag for meat and bone and mallory moved on how many survivors how many rooms in this house lungs bursting she ducked her head to sip more air from the floor strained through her silk tshirt the smoke alarms were deafening more of them were going off in sequence as the smoke climbed upward through the house and this was happening in seconds that were hours long she would never find the others the alarms were maddening her with their screaming urgency she wished they would just stop and they did the smoke alarms were shutting down one by one were their plastic covers melting in the heat now she could hear the flames the crack and dull roar but not see them above her there was a shriek that was not mechanical not human the pet bird that creature could not have lasted six seconds in this lethal atmosphere someone had to be sheltering it from the poisoned air mallory crawled toward the sound of the screaming cockatiel and her groping hands met the next flight of stairs coughing choking she rose to a stand found the rail and took the stairs three at a time stone blind to the next landing back down to the floor crawling again drinking air from the ground and finding it poisoned coughing coughing on her right side a door opened into the hall slamming into her shoulder and two bodies tumbled out mallory sucked better air from the closet floor as her hands passed over the two women wrapped in one anothers arms one living nedda by the long braid and one dead cleo mallory pulled the sisters apart then yanked up neddas coat to shelter the womans face from the smoke crawling on all fours she dragged the unconscious nedda feeling her way following the margin of wood floor between the carpet and the railing which way was she turned around where was the dead mans body down below where the music was someone had turned on a radio she heard the slurry static of changing channels and now a saxophone was calling her down luscious siren notes she moved away from the rail dragging her burden with her and found the first stair rising she lifted nedda onto her back in a firemans carry and made her way down falling kneeling at the last step on the second floor diving down to the ground again for air all smoke now coughing coughing choking starved for air muscles weakening then shot the music swelled up all around her the stab and jab of horns rising to the high notes wake up get up get up on hands and knees she crawled with nedda on her back moving toward the music she found the landmark of the dead mans body she put her mouth to the carpet and sipped all the oxygen there was then pulled back the sheltering coat and covered neddas mouth with her own she kissed her with a breath of air then rose to stand lifting the woman again so heavy too heavy mallory fell and nedda rolled off of her and away the heat was sapping strength from arms and legs it would be over soon she was already half dead the single notes of a clarinet were falling down the scale laughing taunting trumpets screamed high and the slap of a bass beat with the rhythm of her heart a sly trombone sang go girl the sax was back luring her away from the heat this way then a shout of horns this way out this was the sound of adrenaline she was rising lifting nedda onto her back down the stairs so many stairs the fire was behind her she could hear it spit and crack the heat was at her back pitching forward now and falling one wild hand found the railing and she leaned all of her weight against it this eased the heavy burden on her back downstepping now half sliding only seconds going by hours of stairs she lost the precious air in her lungs before she touched down on level ground she fell on her knees and the sharp pain revived her the music was loudest here the most lethal air was above her but she was drinking smoke from the ground coughing choking lungs on fire she could not get up one more time music all around her no direction up was down and there was no longer a concept of forward or back the way out was lost the door was on the moon she opened her eyes stinging burning hoping for a sliver of street light from the front windows to orient her position in the room instead she saw the glow of flames a small fire that lit up the brass knob of the door a signal fire to light her way yes and she was up on all fours crawling toward it the heavy weight on her back pressing her kneecaps down on knife points paying dearly for every foot of ground someone turned off the radio seconds passing listening for footsteps the door flew open clean air rushed in and life itself with the sound of heavy boots pounding toward her flashlights blinding her eyes closing again her body collapsed hands were lifting neddas body off her back then helping mallory to rise feet off the ground strong arms enfold ing her carrying her out she looked down to see the small fire by the door it was nested in a hubcap another pair of boots sent it flying outside gulping air lungs burning searing eyes opening almost blind for the stinging tears a fireman set her down on the sidewalk yelling where the hell is that ambulance more firemen were dropping from the truck and running toward the house and one carried nedda winter to the ambulance as it screamed up to the curb no one but mallory saw the small ball of feathers drop from the old womans coat pocket the bird thudded to the sidewalk weakly fluttering its wings it rolled off the curb and into the gutter slowly mallory was bending down to this lame creature reaching for it when a fireman gripped her by the shoulders unable to speak she pointed upward toward the door then found the words coughing wheezing to tell him there was someone else alive in there someone had turned off the radio he shook his head not making any sense of this then let her go her knees buckled and more hands were reaching out breaking her fall as she slumped to the ground and lay on her side she opened her eyes to see the bird a few feet away from her face it was struggling to breathe she watched it die mallory was rolled onto her back and her face was covered with a plastic mask attached to a tank of oxygen a raggedy man knelt on the ground beside her sorry about your hubcap he said as a paramedic covered his shoulders with a blanket she recognized him as the derelict who had used bitty smyths cell phone to call out the fire engines beneath the blanket he was shivering in shirtsleeves to fuel his little signal fire he had burned his coat the corridor was filled with detectives from special crimes unit riker knew that most of them had already pulled a double shift yet they were pumped jazzed on coffee and busy hammering firemen and paramedics doctors and nurses for information taking statements doing paperwork and biting down on stale sandwiches from the hospital canteen they were tying up loose ends and taking care of business all for mallory one of their own every single one of those beautiful bastards had responded to the call of an officer down but she would not stay down dirty and tired and stinking of smoke mallory was still working her case detective janos a brutallooking man the size and shape of a refrigerator carton hovered near her sometimes stealing up behind her to gingerly replace the blanket around her shoulders each time she shook it off the rest of the squad was giving her a wide berth had she been any other cop they would be slapping her on the back swallowing her up in bear hugs and there would be a disgraceful exhibition of tears in the eyes of grown men this scene of human warmth tears and joy was what riker had wanted for mallory what a fantasy that was one she had no use for human contact and two she was busy the case was all but wrapped the only enduring mystery of the night was a skinny little bum who roamed the halls carrying soda cans and bags of potato chips and wearing mallorys leather coat he never strayed far from her his only source of change for the vending machines the bum approached her now and she mechanically dipped into her pockets to give him more quarters her face was a bare inch from the glass window in the door to the intensivecare unit riker joined her there together they watched charles butler bow down to the patient on the bed holding neddas hand so gently as he strained to catch her words a doctor and two nurses were also in attendance and showing grave concern detective mallory was persona non grata among these tender caregivers never mind that she had walked through fire to save this womans life thats my kathy she was always on the outside looking in but she never whined about her lot and he had to love her more for that in one hand she clutched a paper bag mallory called its contents evidence riker called it a dead bird the kid was clearly not herself tonight she was entirely too patient as she waited her turn at the elderly patient on the other side of the glass she faced riker asking whats the body count one less than we figured bittys father was there all right but he didnt die inside the house looks like old sheldon was the first one out the door what a man huh a couple of patrol cops found him a few blocks away he was dead looks like a heart attack riker held up a yellow pad lined with fountainpen dollops of ink amid the flourishes of a witnesss oldfashioned penmanship we got this statement from an eightyyearold priest youll like it it really classes up our paperwork for the night for this special occasion of wrapping a case he donned the reading glasses that he never wore in public and read the priests observations on the death of sheldon smyth the poor man was terrified as if the devil himself was after him and he even smelled of smoke chilled me it did so he was running to beat the devil all in a sweat from hellfire when he clutched at his chest his eyes rolled back to solid whites blind he was and dead im sure of it that was the moment yes it was and here it gets strange i swear to you he was still running stone dead maybe three steps before he dropped to the ground riker quickly pocketed his spectacles its enough to make the fire a mitigating factor in his death so if you like sheldon for hiring willy roy boyd were done weve got three dead four if we count that little skeleton in the trunk bitty loses both her parents and her uncle in one night i wonder what shell do now maybe shell grow said mallory riker shrugged it was a good thing that lieutenant coffey had broken the news to bitty smyth mallory was no good at this part of the job whether the newly made orphans were forty years old or four there was someone else in that house she said you know who it was no kid everybodys accounted for the body count squares with what bitty told us nobody else was in that house then who turned on the radio oh back to that again the firemen never found the icu door opened and charles stepped out into the corridor one look at his eyes and anyone could see that he was destroyed riker turned away charless strong personal attachment to nedda was something he had never foreseen and the damage of this night just went on and on mallory said charles she wants to see you but before you go in she doesnt know about lionel and cleo that was my decision so please you cant tell her theyre dead its just too much too cruel neddas already in a world of pain and i think she knows that shes dying she wont take the morphine until shes spoken to you mallory did not have all night to wait for him to finish the icu door was closing on her back lieutenant coffey made room for charles butler on the bench by the nurses station then turned back to the chore of editing his senior detectives report he drew thick black lines through all the passages that incriminated damned to hell district attorney buchanan who had dragged his heels on the protection order for nedda winter the woman was not expected to live through the night but rikers career was ongoing and jack coffey planned to keep it that way one more line was crossed out and detective rikers pension was saved mallorys statement posed a different problem the arson team had already interviewed her and so he could not erase the passage about the radio he added a line about oxygen deprivation that would fix it the lieutenant laid his pencil down on the clipboard and turned to the sorrylooking man beside him charles you look like hell ive been there the man leaned far forward elbows propped on his knees and buried his face in both hands mallory only told me six times that nedda was in grave danger i should never have been trusted to look after her hey charles if it makes you feel any better mallory never trusted you to look after that woman the mans hands fell away from his face and jack coffey could only describe this naked expression in terms of a slaughterhouse steer stunned with a bat and awaiting the blade that would slit his throat the lieutenant rushed his words to explain all the failures of the night naming the names in rikers original unedited report and describing the precautions taken it was our job to keep nedda winter alive not yours he ended this litany with the officer who bungled the last watch bad timing all around tonight and everybody gets a piece of the blame except you nothing said had undone the damage to charles butler for he was hearing none of this the psychologists eyes were fixed on the window of the intensivecare unit where nedda his only patient lay dying the old woman seemed so frail so tired and older now by at least a decade and once more she had been invaded by high technology wires ran from the bandages that taped electrodes to her flesh and connected her to monitors perched on a pole by the bed wavy lines charted every function of her body tubes ran in and out of her carrying fluid to the veins of her bruised arm and other liquids were carried away and emptied into plastic bags her eyes opened and closed in long slow blinks as mallory approached the bedside nedda asked did the fire destroy the house no its still standing lots of smoke damage everywhere but the fire was contained on the second floor poor house she turned her eyes to the detective that night in the park i always wondered why did you return my ice pick i thought you might need it so you didnt think i was paranoid just a crazy old woman oh yes mallory had believed that this woman had been driven insane long ago but now she said no youve seen the trunk with sallys bones mallory nodded you risked your life to save me tonight said nedda its greedy i know but i have a favor to ask name it mercy for lionel and cleo her words were more labored now see them as i do as they were children with no one to love them all they ever had was each other i promise you they didnt kill sally they could never she coughed up a bit of blood but stayed mallorys hand as the detective reached for the nurses call button please listen those three children shared a bond of abandonment and loss can you understand that mallory understood it too well she was always losing people all right ill never go near them i promise ill leave them in peace no mallory i want you to talk to them tell them about the massacre what really happened and tell them i didnt know they survived it the old woman faltered drawing breath and creasing her face with deepening lines of great pain what was it costing her to say these words she reached out for mallorys hand and wound her weak fingers around it theres a metal suitcase under my bed maybe it survived the fire find it itll help you make them understand that i never abandoned them never stopped loving them her fingers tightened on the detectives hand theyll believe it if it comes from you mallory nodded of course they would she was the one person who would never stand accused of insincere platitudes and lies of kindness nedda had chosen her messenger well but too late i promise ill tell them everything the words sounded awkward and false and she credited this to her lack of practice in her attempt to lie with good intention to be kind and yet she was believed nedda winters mouth twisted between a smile and a grimace at least at the end i was there for bitty my life wasnt really wasted and i understand walter mcreedy so much better now if saving bitty was all that i had ever done with my time on earth its enough i finally found out what i was made of and i was better than i knew the eyes closed and the muscles of the face relaxed in the absence of pain years fading off with the loss of agony lines the lines of life signs on two of the bedside monitors went flat and a third continued on with its recording of a body function displayed in electricorange waves of light but mallory knew that the technology lied there was no mistaking death for even the deepest sleep it was the unnatural stillness that gave it away that frozen quality of a bird photographed in flight good night red winter mallorys left hand was slowly rising closing to a fist a hammer she rammed it into the wall above the bed wanting the pain this was not righd it was not fair again and again she attacked and cracked the plaster as she counted up all of the dead on her watch she was bleeding when the doctors came to take her away and to mend her broken hand chapter sleepless charles butler had taken to barefoot wanderings at all hours it was five oclock in the morning when he padded down the narrow hall of butler and company to the office in the rear mallorys computer monitors were all aglow and her knapsack lay on the desk alongside the remains of a takeout meal the halffilled coffee cup was still warm he faced her cork wall and the penultimate symptom of a neatfreak spiraling out of control a violent sprawl of paperwork her case elements were pinned in a horizontal splatter pattern how many hours had she spent on this all night long yes her loss of sleep was apparent in the abandonment of perfect alignments the wall was so messy that at first he thought this must be rikers work but no there was a rudimentary order in the chaos however primitive this linear progression was very unrikerlike and all mallory her signature ruthlessness survived in the singleminded march of data across the wall when would she ever let it go when would he charles sat down at the desk and covered his face with both hands somewhat surprised to discover that he had grown a threeday stubble of beard and how many days had he worn this bathrobe grief and profound depression were exhausting him guilt was even more tiring and he was not yet done secondguessing his time with nedda winter that was the horror of hindsight there were always a hundred different paths that one might have taken to a different outcome what truly drove him mad was that he had not listened to mallory how many times had she warned him that nedda might die accidental death or not if he had only kept nedda close she would be alive at odd moments tears streamed down his face he had no control over them before him there was always a picture of nedda happy in the realization of a simple little dream nedda free of sorrow and pain what might have been he laid his head on the desk he would never take on another patient her burden was more difficult more death than he was accountable for unaccustomed to failure mallory had never acquired the emotional muscles necessary to pick herself up when she tripped and fell from grace how well he could empathize with that but he could not help her spliced together he doubted that he and she would make one complete and healthy human the other impediment was their friendship friends did not call attention to one anothers bloodstained souls and psyches half the contents of her knapsack had been spilled across the desk blotter he picked up a bottle with the hospitals pharmacy label it was filled with pain medication prescribed for her broken hand there was no need to count out the tablets he knew that she had taken none of them mallory would not want to dull her beautiful brain not while she was obsessing over all the details of one terrible night gone awry however he was also assured that she was not suffering not likely to pay much attention to the aching throb of broken bones and damaged muscle to paraphrase an old song from his youth she did not have time for the pain and so he felt the pain thus crippled he picked up her pen and passed an hour writing letters to mallory long sorry lines of apology taking all the blame for neddas death and then he had the good sense to lay down the pen how unfair to burden her with his own obsession charles smashed the pages into the pockets of his robe then rose from the chair to stretch his legs he walked the length of the giant bulletin board a disaster zone on several levels well maybe not at first her pushpin style had been perfect in every alignment of paper and then as she had continued down the wall pinning up new documents they hung increasingly askew as if she had become more and more agitated in her rush from one end of the wall to the other the new configurations of diagrams and photographs text and sundry bits of paper were laid out like a jigsaw puzzle without any helpful irregularities in the pieces he had only the gist of the thing neither of them could quite let go of nedda winter and truly it seemed impossible that such a person could be removed from the planet by a freak accident mallorys linear paper storm relentlessly moved on down the wall toward that same conclusion at the very end of the wall a report from the fire marshal knocked everything else out of his head this was not possible he read it twice there were no portable radios in winter house none that would work without current and the antique radio in the front room had not been in working condition for many years oh no madness was a recent thing with him and there was nothing wrong with his memory charles returned to the desk took up pen and paper once more then left a note pinned over the technical report the bold lines of red marking pen stood out from all the rest and this bit of tampering with her wall could not fail to annoy her the moment she walked in the door it was a simple message mallory loved brevity only three words writ large this is wrong it was late afternoon when bitty smyth approached her own home like a thief stealing through the park keeping to the elongating shadows of rock formations and evergreens the police vehicles were no longer parked in front of winter house the reporters were long gone and there was a sense of emptiness about the place and desolation as aunt nedda would say poor house bitty eased herself over the low stone wall and sprinted across the wide boulevard dodging traffic her fugitive brown eyes darting left and right she raced up the front steps and faltered with the keys dropping them twice before she could undo the locks finally she opened the door to an acrid smell of stale smoke and mildew three days later the air was still dank from the water hoses fearing an electrical fire she hesitated to turn on the foyer light fear of the dark finally weighted her decision to flip the wall switch the lights flickered on and off and bitty sucked in her breath vandals the smokestained walls of the foyer had suffered fresh damage they were cracked by huge nails driven into the plaster with great force each nail staked a sheet of paper senseless violence as she scanned the papers bitty fancied that she could hear the echo of every nail hammered in anger bang a fire marshals diagram of her bedroom the point of origin for the blaze bang another diagram showing the location of the cellar fuse box bang an official finding of arson impossible the fire had been the pure accident of a candle falling into a wastebasket neither she nor aunt nedda had been near the candlestick when it had fallen off the bureau bang a drawing of the cellar that marked the place where the pulledout fuses and the spares had been hidden bang a forensic report on a flashlight recovered from the ashes of a bedroom closet its round head matched to paint chips and a circular pattern of dust on the fuse box in the cellar bang bang bang a score of documents led to the end of the wall and turned a corner bitty screamed no no no rags this was too cruel her pet cockatiel had been staked to the next wall one nail for each tattered wing and for a few moments the flickering lights gave the dead bird the illusion of flapping feathers and flight bang beside ragss tiny carcass was mallorys witness statement the detective had found three prone victims trapped above the fires point of origin most damning were the final words the only survivor will inherit millions bang an application to freeze the assets of the winter fortune in probate limbo though the house was utterly silent absent all but imaginary hammers bittys hands rose up to cover her ears and then she held her breath the better to listen she heard no voice or footfall yet bitty knew that she was not alone in the house creeping toward the threshold of the front room her eyes were slowly adapting to the soft remains of sunlight slanting through the parted drapes and falling from the skylight dome at the top of the house now she could see every detail of a workmans scaffolding inside the curve of the blackened staircase it was a network of wooden planks and buttressing metal rods swirling upward mallory dressed in dusty blue jeans a tshirt and a gun hung there in midair bitty blinked no the detective stood on a high platform at the center of this giant skeleton of wood and steel a suitcase resting at her feet so like a woman waiting for a train or a bus to pass by high in the air and so patiently as though mallory had been waiting there all this time days and days one crippled hand in a plaster cast dangled at her left side her hair and clothes bore a darker dust of ashes that had come down from the second floor with the metal suitcase the one that aunt nedda had kept under her bed always locked the detective picked up the suitcase held it high over her head and sent it crashing to the floor below it fell open disgorging leatherbound journals the sort that came with small locks and keys decades of diaries i like money motives said mallory and now you have one bitty was shocked into a calmer state than she could otherwise have managed she moved farther into the room drawn along as people are drawn to accident scenes the lawyer in her was surfacing and it wanted a look at those diaries at last she stood before the scaffolding believing that there was hardly any fear in her voice when she forced a smile and looked upward saying what a droll sense of humor im not known for that still smiling bitty splayed her hands but i havent committed any crimes no mallory bent down to pick up two electrical cords lets count them in a sleight of her one good hand she joined the cords together plug and socket the room flooded with light from all quarters brilliant spotlights a dozen or more whitehot suns perched atop high poles bitty covered her face with both hands and closed her blinded eyes when she could see again she turned in the direction that every light was focused upon all the mirrors had been taken down from one wall it was covered over with hundreds of papers and nails and cracks running jagged down the plaster after a full minute of stunned silence she looked back over one shoulder the detective had not changed her stance but was she at least one platform lower closer how did you get these trust documents bitty strived to convey a suspicion of theft no judge would ever sign a warrant to raid a law firm for your father didnt tell you why doesnt that surprise me mallory stepped off the narrow wooden plank and dropped to the wider platform below this time her running shoes made noise with contact old sheldon didnt like you much did he well maybe you pissed him off when you tried to blackmail his law firm you cant be you threatened him with a very old crime mallory pointed to the wall right below the trust documents youll find the warrant for your fathers safetydeposit box thats where i found the restitution agreement for the embezzled trust fund it proves that the law firm stole money from the winter children that was my partners favorite piece of evidence proof of lawyers robbing orphans bitty turned to face the scaffold one hand shading her eyes from the bright lights i swear to you i never you knew when you worked in your fathers firm you had lots of time to study the trust fund documents i also found a copy of his will two years ago he cut you off without a cent thats how i know you didnt leave on sabbatical he fired you ive seen the firms financials yours too he paid you hush money your allowance thats what he called it ten percent of your old salary you actually made less money as a blackmailer the detectives smile was derisive you just couldnt stand up to him could you he called your bluff and you folded you crept away with a few pathetic crumbs like a good little mouse mallory stepped to the edge of the platform bittys head snapped left toward the distraction of a faulty pole light blinking on and off when she turned back to the scaffold mallory was gone and this silent piece of work was more alarming than the sound of the crashing suitcase could mallory have dropped to earth from such a high place without making the slightest noise or could she fly i know everything now said mallory bitty jumped her heart banged her eyes went everywhere where had when blackmail didnt work you came up with a new swindle bitty slowly revolved her eyes alternately squinting at bright lights and peering into shadows i have no idea what youre i know how you found your aunt the detective stood under a spotlight at one end of the wall as if she had simply materialized there it was a job that generations of good cops couldnt do that bothered me from the beginning if you had only asked bittys hands joined tightly fingers interlaced but not in prayer i wouldve told you about the investigator joshua addison yes my private investigator no hes mine now mallory ripped a sheaf of papers from the wall this is his statement all your requirements for the job bitty nodded unconsciously she knew this list by heart find an old woman approximately seventy years of age tall and fair and blue of eye a woman without documents or memories of family and home it was a shopping list for a doppelganger said mallory you werent even looking for your aunt any old woman would do as long as cleo and lionel believed she was their sister you didnt even have to worry about a dna test by the time i wanted to please them no you didnt they were horrified thats the way nedda put it in her last diary the one she started in the hospice she mentioned you too in detail it was her impression that you werent all that surprised by the reception she got from cleo and lionel now back to your pis shopping list addison told me you were only interested in nursing homes good hunting grounds for old women who cant even remember their names bitty eased herself down to the floor fearing that if she did not sit down she might fall on weakening knees mallory had erred on one point not just any old woman would do to separate her family from their money it had taken years and all of her savings to find just the right one a senile old crone with a resemblance to the winter family how astonished she had been to discover that the best candidate of the lot was the genuine article i even know why you picked the state of maine mallory was moving across the room and it seemed to bitty that the detective would walk over her or through her but the young woman stopped suddenly as a train would stop just short of collision maine was close enough to keep tabs on your search said mallory but it was far enough from new york city so you wouldnt have to worry about the smyth name being linked to the winter family the pi was pretty lame and im guessing thats why you picked him but he finally made that connection bitty was always looking up at people and suddenly she tired of this she fixed her eyes on a middle ground and her voice was insistent when she said i didnt break any laws i never your plan was too complicated mallory hunkered down to bittys eyelevel thats why so many things went wrong you had to improvise too much but in every new game plan nedda was meant to die your mother and your uncle would take the blame you supplied them with a motive their uncle james planted the idea but youre the one who convinced them that nedda murdered their family as bitty formed the idea that mallory was using pure guesswork the detective was shaking her head saying i know how you poisoned them against nedda so you planned a revenge motive for cleo and lionel they do everything together dont they get one you get two with them in prison youd control all the money mallory held a sheet of paper within an inch of the other womans face now you get nothing pulling back bitty recognized the page torn from a book on new york state law the underscored passage mandated that felons could not profit from a crime she watched the paper drift to the floor in one fluid motion mallory was risen then gone and bitty was left to stare at the fallen page washed in bright light i didnt commit any felonies theres no proof of lets start with willy roy boyd the scum you hired to kill nedda the detective ripped a newspaper clipping from the wall and held it up for bitty to see the headline recounted the capture of a serial killer this was your idea of the helpwanted pages it cost you a lot of money to get him out on bail with that new hearing hed need lots more to keep his pricey lawyer he wouldve killed a battalion of women for you she let go of the clipping and it drifted to the floor bitty turned away you cant seriously im dead serious mallorys voice came from behind and bitty could feel the breath on her neck i talked to boyds lawyer another piece of paper rattled close by bittys ear i have the letter you sent with the payoff money bitty raised her head with new hope in my handwriting i dont think so the letter had been typed on a computer dont even try to run a bluff on me mallorys face appeared in front of her blotting out everything else in the world your bedroom was the only one with locks two heavyduty bolts recently installed you were afraid that boyd might get carried away and kill you too he never knew that you were the one who hired him no there was an attempted breakin the previous week you know that right i always wondered if that one inspired the second try or did you arrange both of them was boyd your fallback plan heavy guns bitty a serial killer but at least he was a proven commodity hed already killed three women mustve been a shock when nedda brought him down with an ice pick you never imagined that did you well some plans only work on paper mallory stood up suddenly impatient and walked back to the wall willy roy boyd died during the commission of a felony you hired him to kill your aunt by law his death belongs to you thats absurd oh really did you sleep through every class on criminal law the next charge is conspiracy in attempted murder for hire pecuniary gain raises the ante on the penalty look it up bitty rallied and lifted her head feeling braver when speaking to the younger womans back you have nothing to link me with that man youre right mallorys smile was a chilling piece of work in your original plan nedda would die and boyd would survive so youd never give him anything that would lead the police back to you but im sure you fed him enough detail to implicate your aunt and uncle supposition yes its a very weak case lucky i have you for multiple murders no said bitty head slowly shaking from side to side what are you every death by arson is murder i only have to prove one and the jury will throw in all the rest for free including willy roy boyd the detective padded toward the scaffolding and knelt down by the open suitcase and its spilled contents she picked up one of the diaries and flipped through the pages until she found an entry that she liked listen to this it begins love me again she means cleo and lionel all nedda wanted was a reconciliation with her brother and sister the detective turned ahead a few pages for a while she was making progress then it went sour after nedda stabbed boyd that was your work bitty she held up the book its all here oh one more thing i know what you did with the videotape the one that went missing that night all right i burned it to protect aunt nedda i thought shed killed an unarmed burglar nice touch bitty always a good idea to work a little truth into the lie i believe you burned the tape but thats not what i meant your car service logged the trip to the summer house the next morning a very early ride you showed that videotape to cleo and lionel didnt you you wanted them to see neddas handiwork with an ice pick the same kind of weapon that slaughtered their family it mustve destroyed them to watch that film too bad you dont have the tape anymore it mightve come in handy at your trial the state will say you burned incriminating evidence boyd was dead before the lights came on but maybe the tape showed you pulling out the ice pick and driving a pair of shears into his corpse i didnt do that bitty i never thought you could do it but will the jury believe you now just take it a little further the autopsy proves two strikes and two different weapons maybe two killers maybe boyd wasnt quite dead when he was stabbed the second time the prosecutor might argue that you were afraid boyd could identify you as the one who hired him thats not true mallory arched one eyebrow so she looked down at the journals in her hands when the jury reads these diaries neddas little dream theyre going to hate you bitty theyre going to kill you too on the night before the fire nedda called you from soho she was planning another attempt to reconcile with her brother and sister that wouldve ruined all your hard work shoring up the revenge motive so you staged a suicide and you cut it close but then you expected nedda home for dinner hours earlier charles butlers fault he invited her to a poker game the detective busied herself with picking up all the spilled diaries and putting them back into the suitcase lets see more crimes oh right the night of the fire you turned out the lights at the basement fuse box there was an old flashlight kept on that box the arson investigator found it in your closet did you think youd have time to plant the flashlight in someone elses room after your aunt died the fire was accidental i know so what were you planning for nedda that night a fall down the stairs no too uncertain most people survive that sort of tumble you were the one who pointed that out on the night of the dinner party mallory reached back into the suitcase and pulled out a diary its all here your aunt was a great one for detail you planned to push nedda over the banister right according to you thats the way edwina winter died a triedandtrue method she opened the diary and turned the pages here it is nedda describes you rushing charles buder at the banister for a minute there she thought he d go over the rail that was your dress rehearsal bitty for the real thing you had to pull the fuses turn off every light its the only way you could do a murder behind the back and in the dark the prime suspects would be cleo and lionel but now that theyre dead you inherit everything good motive for arson but you know it was an accident the fire was where it all went wrong wasnt it the smoke and flames you panicked you ran up the stairs instead of down yes i believe it was an accident youd never take that kind of risk but once again bitty will the jury believe you mallory paced the floor snapping her fingers stay with me bitty do the math willy roy boyd counts as the first murder charge when the arson investigation is finished the body count will stand at five she ripped a sheet from the wall this is the autopsy report on your father it links the trauma of the fire to a fatal heart attack every death by arson is murder it was an accident the detective smiled and bitty grasped the irony before it was voiced after years of planning and scheming youll get tripped up by something you didnt do but you did pull out the fuses and hide the spares you lit the candles that set the house on fire and those people died do you think i care if you only planned to kill one of them mallorys voice was calm and all one note almost bored as she walked along the wall tearing off more sheets in quick succession so now ive got you for patricide matricide the murders of your aunt and uncle and willy roy boyd too bad you couldnt commit mass murder in another borough now the queens da wont kill anybody not even cop killers but the manhattan da loves the death penalty the wave of mallorys hand encompassed all the chaos of the wall and the suitcase of diaries now you might remember this from a law class you didnt sleep through the da calls it a preponderance of evidence the sheer weight of it is enough to crush you to death and theres more juries love things they can hold in their hands like the fuses and the spares you hid by the garden door thats what really sealed the arson finding then theres the pack of diaries aunt nedda was insane she had a history of no according to dr buder all those diaries were written by a perfecdy sane woman so things the jury can hold on to theres the flashlight and the fire ax with your fingerprints on it you know why my prints are on the ax i used it to yeah right little sally winters bones that was another nice touch bitty some malicious slander to paint cleo and lionel as the kind of people who could murder a child why not nedda what you dont know is that your mother was on the phone with my partner before the fire broke out she was making plans to surrender the trunk to the coroners office in the morning cleo and lionel only wanted to know how long it would be before the family could bury that little girls remains that was all they cared about finally a proper burial for sally winter you know i used that ax to get sallys trunk out of the closet right thats what you said in your statement but we only have your word on that your mother never mentioned you so the da will argue that you used that ax to keep those frightened people from escaping a burning house no there was a witness who saw nedda carry me out i was unconscious i couldnt have stopped anyone from leaving if a witness you mean the homeless man who called in the fire the arson team went looking for him turns out someone bought him a train ticket to a warmer climate now where was i oh right the prosecutors closing remarks hell paint a picture of you swinging that ax scaring those poor people driving them up the stairs and then setting the fire to trap them there when hes done with the jury theyll want to climb out of their box and kill you with their hands is that what youd like to do no mallory shrugged its all the same to me nothing personal just a job she handed bitty a small white card this has your miranda rights youre under arrest read the card fast bitty we have to go i know what youre doing detective so transparent you want to scare me into a plea bargain a guaranteed conviction instead of risking a lost trial no ive never known a lawyer to confess to anything and im counting on that so is the district attorney you expect me to believe that all this this spectacle and what you did to my bird nailing him to a wall that was just fun for you yes said mallory thats exactly what it was bitty wished that this young woman would not smile it was so unsettling and those eyes it crossed her mind that the detective might be seriously disturbed or was this calculated just another part of the show now said mallory ill tell you whats going to happen to you and thatll be fun too the courts might unfreeze just enough money for a reasonable criminal defense they will not give you millions of dollars to buy legal talent when your cutrate attorney sees the trial going sour hell try to plead you out on the weaker case the murder for hire one death willy roy boyd youd be neddas age when you got out of prison but youd be alive heres the snag once the trial has started and all the facts are out the da cant accept a plea on a lesser charge hes a political animal its an election year the voters would crucify him you see the beauty of it bitty you wont pleabargain until your case is sinking but the da cant settle for less than mass murder and the death penalty not if hes winning and he cant lose the detective slung a coat over one arm then picked up the suitcase of diaries we have to go now she consulted a pocket watch youll be arraigned tonight whats your plea this was the showdown or at least a countdown of sorts for bitty was tensing her body as mallory tapped off the passing seconds with the toe of one shoe times up the electric lights went out leaving only the illumination from the skylight dome bright motes of dust swirled around mallory catching light and endowing her with a cylindrical aura as the detective moved forward bitty backed out of the room slowly retreating to the foyer where the body of the dead bird was staked to the wall but all she could see was the detective crossing the front room coming closer and growing in height and mass with each footfall oddly enough a stone weight was rising from bittys breast her nerves had calmed and she could breathe more easily she called out to mallory almost defiant you lied to me this case was personal wasnt it mallory had been all too right about one thing bitty had no intention of pleading guilty to any charge done with hysterics she was coolly plotting the destruction of the case against her all circumstantial evidence and if she could not win at trial she would win on appeal if she confessed all was lost her last thought was that the detective could read her mind and sense the rebirth of hope the suitcase dropped from mallorys hand to the floor bitty knew this moment would be burned into memory until the day she died years from now she might recall the angry young avenger standing there with a great sword in her right hand and perhaps that peculiar fantasy would arise from a glint of gunmetal in the shoulder holster that coupled with this stunning sight of mallory with eyes burning bright and hair disheveled as if she had just stepped from the whirlwind only now as the last few steps between them were closing did bitty understand that this case was indeed a personal matter to mallory that some great harm had been done to this young woman deep damage beyond the evidence of her broken left hand oh her eyes that fixed stare a cats dare for the mouse to move even to twitch and the gun in her right hand was on the rise bang chapter lieutenant coffey sat in a cop bar on greene street downing straight shots of bourbon with his senior detective the mood was not celebratory though riker believed that mallory would never be punished for what she had done the lieutenant lifted his head to pose a question one that could only be asked at that point of inebriation where he had hopes of forgetting the answer by the time his hangover kicked in what the hell happened the real story whatd buchanan tell you i never asked for his version i want yours okay since the lieutenant was buying riker ordered another round that morning we laid it all out for the district attorney more evidence than hes ever seen for one case a ton of documentation buchanan didnt care he refused to prosecute bitty smyth little coward he was actually afraid to risk losing the biggest case of his career in an election year can you beat that after all this work what does he say to us he says its all circumstantial he was right said coffey riker ignored this because it was true so mallory says the whole package is enough to bury bitty smyth buchanan says no he says juries are too stupid to follow her evidence it would be a fight just to keep em awake long enough to present the case the mans right again said coffey so mallory asks him point blank whats it gonna take then buchanan says bring me a full confession riker slammed the flat of his hand on the bar and thats exactly what she did that afternoon we went to winter house to wire the place for sound i dont remember listening to any tapes riker never got a chance to plant the mikes bitty showed up as soon as the last cop car pulled away from the house in other words no tape was better than an edited tape he did not hold with the idea of tampering with evidence after a goaround with bitty smyth the detectives had returned to the das office and handed the womans confession to buchanan along with the terms of a plea bargain and then said riker buchanan really pushed his luck he told us he wouldnt accept the confession said it was probably obtained under duress that pompous little weasel never even talked to bitty smyth he didnt know squat was he right riker was selective in his deafness timing was so important tonight well the da went back on a solid deal the detective leaned toward his commanding officer this is just between us right jack coffey nodded his understanding and this was his promise his seal of silence half of the battle for mallorys job security was won good said riker so mallory staked the confession to the das desk with an ice pick he averted his eyes from the lieutenants startled face as he added on a point of historical interest it was the same pick that was used in the winter house massacre now he turned back to coffey and smiled it was a gift in a sudden change of heart inspiration of cowardice district attorney buchanan had accepted the confession electing to follow that timehonored credo never make an enemy of a psycho cop and bonus the little man had wet his pants further guaranteeing that what had happened in that room would never leave that room riker had not enjoyed any of this mallory had scared the hell out of him too and he had almost felt sorry for a lawyer sometimes in unguarded moments he forgot that she was always dangerous and more so now that she was wounded the cast on her hand broke his heart how much more should he disclose to jack coffey before he requested a long leave of absence for his partner and which one of them would take mallorys gun away from her wait riker back up how did mallory get that confession you skipped over that part stalling for time and just the right words riker checked his watch a police transport would be en route to the womens prison by now the case had ended without a trial only bittys anticlimactic confession in open court she had pleaded guilty to a charge of murder for hire and four counts of manslaughter all sentences to run concurrently the only proviso of the plea bargain had been that mallory not be present during the proceedings bitty smyth got a better deal than she deserved that may be said coffey but why did she waive her right to a trial no wait i got a better question what did mallory do to that woman nothing riker was feigning indignation and he must be doing it badly the boss was still waiting on his answer how should he put this as if he had just recalled some minor detail he said well she shot the head off a dead bird riker was quick to raise his right arm in the gesture of an oath my hand to god thats all she did the kid never even yelled at bitty smyth so mallory spent a bullet whered it go its not in the wall anymore you cant even tell where the hole was and the headless bird it went to swim with the fishes in the east river of course that would depend on the vagaries of plumbing and sewage routes mallory had flushed the bird down a toilet this evening charles butler was dressed and showered but not shaved his cleaning woman had hidden the razor mrs ortega watched her employer pulling volumes from his library shelves he called them guidebooks for the road where yagoin not every journey involves leaving the house he said she perused a volume by hermann hesse but found the print too dense for her taste me i like a good fast read she said with lots of white space on the page he ran one finger down a row of titles on a lower shelf plucked out three novels and handed them to her here gifts firstedition hemingways i think youll like them she set them on top of her cleaning cart then turned back to his own short stack i dont get it if youve already read them what good are they mrs ortega could wait all day for an answer to that one charles butlers eyes had gone all strange as he focused on some point above her head and behind her she turned around to see mallory standing just inside the door spooky kid quiet as a cat one icy glance from mallory told the cleaning woman that she was dismissed from this babysitting job and mrs ortega was glad to go she was sometimes afflicted with magical thinking from the irish side of her family over a passage of days she had sensed a change in the very air of this apartment it was thickening with sadness and she could hardly breathe charles butler sat beside mallory as she drove along central park west she had not yet convinced him that he was not responsible for nedda winters death but she had finally succeeded in getting him out of the house they were going on a field trip to see the radio shock therapy the man was badly broken his eyes had a shattered look and other fracture lines were showing in his face and in his rambling speech somehow she must put him back together again without any helpful manuals on human frailty his world was more fragile than she knew charless luck with parking spaces was riding with her tonight she pulled up to the curb in front of winter house he was still going on and on about the radio when they climbed the steps to the front door why did he have to pick that one thing to obsess about mallory led the way into the house he was beside her in the foyer as she trained her flashlight on the two silver control panels by the door this one is for the security alarm and this one is for the sound system theres a panel just like it in every room it works the same way yours does she tapped the builtin speaker the music you heard after the dinner party when you and nedda were sitting outside on the steps it came from here no i told you nedda couldnt work this thing and neither could i she played the old radio in the front room all right lets have a look mallory took him by the hand and led him across the foyer threshold preceded by the beam of her flashlight she pulled the smokestained drapes aside allowing the light of streetlamps into the room and she opened the front windows to cut the smell of mildew with clean cold air charles was staring at the oldfashioned radio mallory pulled it away from the front wall and turned it around to expose a rotted backing with holes in it charles moved closer as she used a metal nail file to undo the screws she removed the back panel to expose the innards another centurys technology of cracked glass tubes frayed wires and loose connections there were also cobwebs made by generations of spiders spinning their homes inside this antique box the bones and skull of a longdead mouse completed the evidence of a nonworking radio and now mallory deconstructed this tiny crime scene for charles twenty or thirty years ago this mouse took a hit of current from an exposed wire it made him wild he batted around in the dark and broke these tubes probably bled out on the broken glass you see this radio has been useless for a very long time the one in neddas room is in worse shape it doesnt even have a cord no its a trick this is a different radio mallory shook her head and waited for his good mind to kick back into gear to shake out the dust of deep depression and function logically once more butyou heard a radio the night of the fire said charles and no one has questioned your sanity well i know it wasnt this one even if this radio had been in working condition bitty pulled out all the fuses that night no electricity what i heard was probably a small portable it mustve been destroyed in the fire he seemed so suspicious now did he know she was lying no there was also doubt in his face her lie was making sense to him apparently charles did believe in the rules governing electricity in truth if a batteryoperated radio had been in the house even if it had been near the fires point of origin the investigators would have found residue materials but there were none and because it was so important to account for everyone in the house on that night the arson team had gone looking for signs of mallorys radio operator the one who had turned the music on and off they had even run tests for music seeping in from neighboring buildings all negative yet like charles mallory could not admit to imaginary songs she never would he must i saw her play this radio twice he said insistent the first time was at the crime scene and ive got a lot of witnesses for that performance she nodded i heard music that night but the builtin sound system and i heard it again said charles angry now the night of the dinner party it was a warm night nedda opened the front windows we sat outside on the stoop we drank wine and listened to this radio for hours when nedda thought she was disabling the alarm she probably hit the control panel for the stereo system im sure nedda believed the music came from the radio but she was insane no she wasnt i never had a conversation with her that wasnt perfectly lucid he turned his back on mallory and left the house she followed him as far as the open front door and watched him sit down on the steps after a few minutes of scavenging she had found a wine cabinet behind the bar and the rubber seal on its door was still intact she selected a good sturdy merlot the only wine that had a prayer of surviving the heat of the fire on the upper floor with the wine and two glasses in hand mallory joined charles outside on the steps indian summer was long gone but he did not seem to feel the cold night air of fall all right she said well restage what happened that night she held up the bottle for his inspection and he examined the label this was served at the dinner party i always wondered how sheldon smyth knew the vintner of my private stock do you have any idea what these bottles cost not a problem charles youre receiving stolen goods from a police officer she uncorked the wine and set the bottle down on the steps to let it breathe he would consider it a worse crime if she simply filled their glasses before the wine had time to mellow and mallory had brought some reading material to pass the time she opened her knapsack and withdrew a small leatherbound book this is neddas last diary i used it to run a bluff on bitty smyth open it he did every line was the same the same words written over and over crazy people make sane people crazy charles flipped through page after page incredulous he turned his stricken face to hers i have a whole suitcase full of them she said all exactly alike i believe nedda was sane when she went into the first asylum but not when she came out of the last one that would be expecting too much from her you know why these lines are true charles any cop will tell you that we deal with crazy all the time and it rubs off it gets into your head and your gut it drives you crazy nedda wanted me to have her diaries she asked me to show them to cleo and lionel maybe she thought shed written something else on those pages and im sure that nedda believed she heard music on the radio totally mad he continued to turn the pages and i didnt see it how could i have failed this woman so badly after a few therapy sessions you said all her conversation with you was lucid and im sure it was trust me she was a strong lady very good at holding things together in situations where all the sane people crack up mallory took the diary from his hand and looked down at the pages lines of madness lines of truth not your fault charles she seemed sane enough to me too nedda was probably using all her energy to keep her mind together for a while she had unfinished business with her brother and sister he nodded if cleo and lionel had seen the diaries the relationship would have been quite different they wouldve taken better care of her said mallory so if nedda listened to a radio that never worked but im not insane he hung his head suddenly recognizing that this was now open to debate the night you called me to the crime scene i saw her play that radio she raised the volume and turned it off with the dial the whole face of the radio wouldve lit up when it played did you see that yes less sure of himself he added i think so youre no worse than the average eyewitness people see what they expect to see she reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a sheaf of papers this is the play list for all the radio stations the night of the dinner party nedda told you her station only played jazz from the forties thats wrong theres only one that plays jazz that time of night but its a mix of contemporary and i know what i heard do you your sound system only plays classical music when i programmed the channels those were the only ones you wanted to hear remember nedda was the expert on jazz i dont know what tunes you were listening to that night but she only heard what she wanted to hear i know jazz when i listen to me one more time all right before nedda came outside with the wine she probably tried to disable the alarm im betting it wasnt even turned on so she tapped the control buttons for the sound system by mistake that was the music you heard a local station that plays no thats not it her sister had that system programmed for popular music rather crass and i promise you nothing as elegant as duke ellington you know how easy it is to mess up the programming she had reset the channels on his own sound system many times before painting the onoff switch with nail polish and forbidding him to touch any other buttons you wouldnt know the dates of every piece you heard that night nedda would but she was listening to music inside her head no songs older than the winter house massacre so first said charles still the skeptic she mistook the stereo panel for the alarm then she just got lucky with all those buttons and called up the one jazz station out of all what at core do you believe in coincidence and luck or a haunted radio her solution had trumped his ghost story she could see that he was defeated at least he had ceased to resist her takenoprisoners logic a graceful loser charles smiled but not in the usual inadvertent manner of a happy loon he had learned a new expression more sardonic and mallory knew that he would never be the same the cost of closing her cases had become too damned high she poured the wine the medicine into their glasses then lifted hers in a toast to the lady who loved jazz charles clinked his glass with mallorys and they sat very close together in the chill night air sharing wine and a bit of body heat and the illusion that life had not been forever changed by a death too many nearby was a burst of static and a radio began to play an old count basie tune mallory drummed her fingers to the same rhythm charles did not if he heard the music he never acknowledged it not by the tap of his foot or a nod in time to the beat no of course not he was stable now and smiling as he looked up at the stars the silent stars all was right on charles butlers planet mallorys fingernails dug deep into her palms making red crescent wounds in the flesh as if pain could drown the low notes of a string bass thrumming close to the earth the ripple of piano keys that flew over the trees and up to the sky crazy people make sane people crazy she looked back at the open windows of winter house expecting to detect a faint glow from the dial of an oldfashioned radio carol oconnell born in carol oconnell studied at the california institute or artschouinard and the arizona state university for many years she survived on occasional sales of her paintings as well as freelance proofreading and copyediting at the age of carol oconnell sent the manuscript of mallorys oracle to hutchinson because she felt that a british publisher would be sympathetic to a first time novelist and because hutchinson also publish ruth rendell having miraculously found the book on the slush pile hutchinson immediately came back with an offer for world rights not just for mallorys oracle but for the second book featuring the same captivating heroine at the frankfurt book fair hutchinson sold the rights to dutch french and german publishers for six figure sums mallorys oracle was then taken back to the states where it was sold at auction to putnam for over carol oconnell is now writing full time
