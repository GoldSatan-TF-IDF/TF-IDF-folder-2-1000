evils timothy part one her stupid old american car wasnt working again so now luz lopez was sitting on the bus with her sick son ramiro dozing beside her this time of day midmorning the streetcar wasnt crowded and she was glad of that ramiro small for eleven years old had room to curl up with his head on her lap she stroked his cheek gently with the back of her hand he opened his eyes and smiled at her weakly his skin was warm to her touch but not really burning she was more concerned about the cut on his lip than the sore throat there was something about the look of it that bothered her hed banged it on some playground bars on monday and today thursday it was swollen puffy yellowish at the edges but when the sore throat had come on yesterday ramiro had complained not about the cut lip but the throat luz knew her boy wouldnt make a fuss unless there was real pain he was up half the night with gargling and tylenol but this morning he told her it wasnt any better she had to take the day off so he could see a doctor time off was always a risk though shed been halfway to her business degree when shed left home now she worked as a maid at the osaka hotel in japantown and they were strict about attendance even if the reason was good luz knewthat every day she missed work counted against her the clinic said they could see him before noona miracleso maybe she could get his prescription and have ramiro back at school by lunchtime then she could still put in a half day back at the osaka she had lived in san francisco for over ten years now though she would never call the place home after the opponents of land reform in el salvador had killed her father a newspaper publisher and then her brother alberto a doctor who had never cared about politics she had fled north with her baby inside her it had taken her husband jose almost three years to follow her here and then last year la migra had sent him back now unable to find work back home he lived with her mother she shifted on her seat on her way to the judah clinic which was not on judah street at all but two blocks before judah began where the same street was called parnassus why did they not call it the parnassus clinic then she shook her head these small things keeping her mind from what it wanted to settle on which was the health of her son and of course the money always money ramiros tiny hand lay like a dead bird in hers as they walked from the streetcar stop to the clinic a converted twostory victorian house when she opened the front door she abandoned all hope that theyd get to her quickly folding chairs lined the walls of the waiting room more were scattered randomly in the open space in the middle and every seat was taken on the floor itself a half dozen kids played with ancient plastic blocks or little metal cars and trucks that didnt have all the wheels on them behind the reception window four women sat at computer terminals luz waited then cleared her throat one of the women looked up be just a minute she said and went back to whatever she was doing there was a bell on the counter with instructions to ring it for service but the computer woman already had told luz shed just be a minute although now it had been more like five and luz didntwant to risk getting anyone mad at her they would just go more slowly but she was angry and sorely tempted at last the woman sighed and came to the window she fixed luz with an expression of perfect boredom and held out her hand health card please she entered some information into her computer didnt look up ten dollars she said after shed taken it and put it in a drawer the woman continued your sons primary care doctor is dr whitson but hes unavailable today do you have another preference luz wanted to ask why dr whitson was unavailable but knew that there would be no point in complaining if dr whitson wasnt here he wasnt here asking about him wouldnt bring him back no she smiled trying to establish some connection sooner would be better though the woman consulted her computer screen punched a few more keys dr jadra can see ramiro in twentyfive minutes just have a seat and well call you the words just popped out but there are no seats the woman flicked a look to the waiting room over luzs shoulder onell turn up any second she looked past her next while ramiro dozed fitfully luz picked up a copy of the latest edition of san francisco magazine there were many of them in the room all with the same cover photo of a strong anglo businessmans face luz read english well and soon realized the reason for the multiple copies the story was about the director of parnassus healthher insurance company the mans name was tim markham he had a pretty wife three nicelooking children and a dog he lived in a big house in seacliff and in all the pictures they took he was smiling luz cast a glance around the waiting room no one was smiling here she stared at the face for another minute then looked down at her sick boy then up at the wall clock she wentback to mr markhams smiling face then read some more things were good in his life his company was experiencing some growing pains yes but markham was on top of them and in the meantime his patients continued to receive excellent medical care and that was the most important thing that was what he really cared about it was his lifelong passion finally finally a nurse called ramiros name luz folded the magazine over and put it in her purse then they walked down a long hallway to a tiny windowless room with a papercovered examining table a sink and counter a small bookcase and shelves posters of california mountain and beach scenes perhaps once vibrantly colored now hung faded and peeling from the walls ramiro laid himself down on the table and told his mom he was cold so she covered him with her coat luz sat in an orange plastic molded chair took out her magazine and waited again at jadra knocked once on the door then opened it and came in small and precise completely bald the doctor introduced himself as he perused the chart busy day today he said by way of apology i hope you havent had to wait too long luz put on a pleasant expression not too bad were a little shorthanded today twenty doctors and something like eight have this virus going around he shook his head wearily and youre ramiro samp her boy had opened his eyes again and gotten himself upright how are you feeling not so good my throat jadra pulled a wooden stick from a container on the counter well lets take a look at it can you stick out your tongue as far as you can and say ahh that examination took about ten seconds when it was over jadra placed a hand on the boys neck and prodded around gently does that hurt how about that just when i swallow five minutes later luz and ramiro were back outside theyd been at the clinic for over two hours it had cost luz ten dollars more than she made in an hour plus a full days wages dr jadra had examined ramiro for less than one minute and had diagnosed his sore throat as a virus he should take childrens tylenol and an overthecounter throat medication he explained that the way viruses work symptoms go away by themselves within about fourteen days or two weeks whichever came first a joke luz supposed though it didnt make her laugh two days later ramiro was worse but luz had to go to work last time theyd warned her about her absences there were a lot of others who would be happy to take her job if she didnt want to work at the hotel anymore so she had to take ramiro into urgent care at night after she got off on the bus she gathered him in next to her wrapped her own coat over his shivering little body he curled up and immediately fell asleep his breathing sounded like someone crinkling a paper bag inside his lungs his cough was the bark of a seal this night the clinic was less crowded luz paid her ten dollars and within a half hour full dark outside now she heard ramiros name called she woke her boy and followed a stout man back into another tiny office similar to dr jadras except there was no art even faded ramiro didnt notice he climbed onto the papercovered examining table curled his knees up to his chest and closed his eyes again she covered him with her jacket and again she waited until she was startled awake by a knock at the door i could use a nap myself the woman said gently in good spanish she wore a badge that said dr judith cohn she studied the folder then brought her attention back to luz so tell me about ramiro where did he get this cut at school he fell down but he complains of his throat the doctor frowned deeply reached for a tongue depressor after a longer look than dr jadra had taken drcohn turned to luz the throat doesnt look good but i really dont like the look of this cut she said in spanish id like to take a culture meanwhile in case it isnt a virus ill prescribe an antibiotic but the other doctor yes she reached out a hand reassuringly its okay whats your question the other doctor said it was a virus now it might not be i dont understand dr cohn about the same age as luz was sympathetic sometimes a virus will bring on a secondary infection that will respond to antibiotics the cut looks infected to me and the drug will take care of that the doctor nodding already had the prescription pad out does ramiro have any allergies good then now if for some reason the cut doesnt clear up i might want to prescribe a stronger antibiotic but ill let you know when i get the results of the test when will that be the results usually two to three days three more days couldnt we just start with the stronger antibiotic now then i would not have to come back for another appointment the doctor shook her head you wont have to come here again i can call in the other prescription if we need it luz waited then whispered there is also the expense the two prescriptions dr cohn clucked sadly im sorry about that but we really dont want to prescribe a stronger antibiotic than ramiro needs she touched luz on the forearm hell be fine you dont need to worry luz tried to smile she couldnt help but worry ramiro was no better in fact she knew that he was worse despite her resolve a tear broke and rolled over her cheek she quickly angrily wiped it away but the doctor had seen it are you really so worried a mute nod then im afraid the doctor sat down slowly and leaned in toward her shespoke in an urgent whisper everything will be all right really hes got an infection thats all the antibiotics will clear it up in a few days but i feelin my heart she stopped dr cohn straightened up but still spoke gently youre both very tired the best thing you can do now is go home and get some sleep things will look better after that luz felt she had no choice but to accept this she met the doctors eyes for a long moment then nodded mechanically and thanked her then she and her bundledup and shivering son were back out in the cold and terrible night at around on the morning of tuesday april a fortysevenyearold businessman named tim markham was on the last leg of his customary jog every weekday when he wasnt traveling markham would run out the driveway of his mansion on mclaren within minutes on either side of he would turn right and then right again on twentyeighth avenue jog down to geary go left nearly a mile to park presidio then left again back up to lake at twentyfifth hed jog a block right to scenic way cut down twentysixth and finally turn back home on seacliff where it ran above phelan beach in almost no other ways was markham a creature of habit but he rarely varied either the route of his run or the time he took it this morninggarbage day in the neighborhoodhe was struck by a car in the intersection just after he left the sidewalk making the turn from scenic to twentysixth the impact threw him against one of the trash receptacles at the curb and covered him in refuse markham had been jogging without his wallet and hence without benefit of identification although he was a white man in physically good health he hadnt yet shaved this morning the combination of the garbage surrounding him with his oneday growth of beard his worndown running shoes and the old sweats and ski cap he wore made it possible to conclude that he was a homeless man whod wandered into the upscale neighborhood when the paramedics arrived from the nearby fire station they went right to work on him markham was bleeding from severe head trauma maybe had punctured and collapsed a lung hed obviously broken several bones including his femur if this break had cut an artery it was a lifethreatening injury all by itself he would clearly need some blood transfusions and other serious trauma intervention immediately if he were going to have a chance to survive the ambulance driver adam lipinski was a longtime veteran of similar scenes although the nearest emergency room was at portola hospital twenty blocks away in the inner richmond district he knew both from rumor and personal experience that portola was in an embattled financial state right now because it was forbidden by law to do otherwise any hospital would have to take this victim into the er and try to stabilize him somewhat but if he was in fact homeless and uninsured as lipinski suspected there was no way that portola would then admit him into the hospital proper lipinski wasnt a doctor but hed seen a lot of death and knew what the approach of it could look like and he was thinking that this was one of those cases after whatever treatment he got in the er this guy was going to need a stretch in intensive care but if he didnt have insurance lipinski was all but certain that portola would find a way to declare him fit to move and turf him out to county last month the hospital had rather notoriously transferred a dayold babya babyto county general after shed been delivered by emergency csection in the er at portola in the middle of the night six weeks premature and addicted to crack cocaine the mother of course had no insurance at all though some saint of a doctor taking advantage of the administrations beauty sleep had simply ordered the baby admitted to portolas icu by the next day someone had decided that the mother and child couldnt pay and therefore had to go to county some portola doctors made a stink arguing that they couldnt transfer the mother so soon after the difficult surgery and birthshe was still in grave condition and transporting her might kill her and the administration had backed down but it countered that the baby emily crack addiction and all would clearly survive the trip across town she would be transferred out separated from her mother within a day of her birth at county general emily had barely held on to life for a day in the overcrowded special unit for preemies then jeff elliots citytalk column in the chronicle had gotten wind of the outrage and embarrassed portola into relenting if not for that lipinski knew that the poor little girl probably wouldnt have made it through her first week as it was she got readmitted to portolas icu where she stayed until her mother left ten days later and where the two of them ran up a bill of something like seventy thousand dollars and all the while politicos newspaper people and half the occupants of their housing projectwhom the administration accused of stealing drugs and anything else that wasnt tied downgenerally disrupted the order and harmony of the hospital in the wake of that portola put the word outthis kind of admitting mistake wasnt going to happen again lipinski knew beyond a doubt that once todays victim was minimally stabilized portola would pack him back up in an ambulance and have him taken to county where they had to admit everybody even and especially the uninsured lipinski wasnt sure that the victim here would survive that second trip and even if he did the icu at county was a disaster area with no beds for half the people who needed them with gurneys lining the halls but there was still time before he had to make that decision the paramedics were trying to get his patient on a backboard and the police had several officers knocking on doors and talking to people in the crowd that had gathered to see if anyone could identify the victim even rich people snug in their castles unknown to their neighbors might recognize the neighborhood bum because the body was so broken it took longer than hed originally estimated but eventually they got the victim hooked up and into the back in the meantime lipinski had decided that he was going directly to county portola would just screw around too much with this guy and lipinski didnt think hed survive it hed just shifted into gear and was preparing to pull out when he noticed a couple of cops running up with a distraught woman in tow he knew what this was shifting back into park he left the motor running opened his door and stepped out into the street as the cops got to him he was ready at the back door pulling it open half walking half running the woman was a few steps behind them she stepped up inside and lipinski saw her body stiffen her hands come up to cover her mouth oh god he heard oh god he couldnt wait any longer slamming the door shut behind her he ran back and hopped into his seat they had their identification and he was going to portola in the days long ago before hed hit the big fouroh dismas hardy used to jog regularly his course ran from his house on thirtyfourth avenue out to the beach then south on the hard sand to lincoln way where hed turn east and pound the sidewalk until he got to ninth and the bar he coowned the little shamrock if it was a weekend or early evening hed often stop here to drink a beer before age wised him up and slowed him down later on the beverage tended to be a glass of water hed finish his drink and conclude the fourmile circuit through golden gate park and back up to his house the last time hed gotten committed to an exercise program maybe three years ago hed made it the first week and then about halfway through the second before he gave up telling himself that two miles wasnt bad for a fortysevenyearold hed put on a mere eight pounds this past decade much less than many of his colleagues he wasnt going to punish himself about his body the shape he was in but then last year his best friend abe glitsky had a heart attack that turned out to be a very near thing glitsky was the elder of the two men by a couple of years but still until it happened hardy had never considered either himself or abe anywhere near old enough to have heart trouble the two men had been best friends since theyd walked a beat together as cops just after hardys return from vietnam now glitsky was the chief of san francisco s homicide detail halfblack and halfjewish glitsky was a former college tight end no one among his colleagues would ever have thought of describing the lieutenant as anything but a hardass his looks contributed to the rep as wella thick scar coursed his lips top to bottom under a hatchet nose he cultivated a fiercely unpleasant gaze a buzzcut fringe of gray bounded a wide intelligent forehead glitsky didnt drink smoke or use profanity he would only break out his smile to terrify staff or small children for fun six months ago when hed married treya ghent the administrative assistant to the new district attorney several of his inspectors had bet that the new lifestyle would mellow him out considerably they were still paying the installments hardy was a successful defense attorney though he and glitsky were on opposite sides of the fence professionally there was also most of a lifetime of history between them when glitskys first wife flo had died some years before hardy and his wife frannie had taken his three boys in to live with them until abe could work his way through some of the emotional and logistical upheaval last fall hardy had been the best man at abes wedding they didnt talk about itthey were guys after allbut each was a fixed point of reference in the others life the heart attack got their attention since a month or so after abes marriage theyd fallen into some semblance of a regular exercise program where a couple of days a week one would goad or abuse the other into agreeing to do something physical after the macho need to demonstrate their awesome strength and breathtaking endurance to each other in the first few weeks had almost made them quit the whole thing because of all the aches and pains they finally had arrived at a brisk walk a couple of times a week or perhaps throwing some kind of ball on the weekend this morning they were eating up maybe three miles an hour walking on the path around stow lake in golden gate park it was a cool and clear morning the sun visible in the treetops a mist hung over the water and out of it at the near shore a swan with her brood of cygnets appeared glitsky was talking work as usual complaining about the politics surrounding the appointment of two inexperienced inspectors to his detail of elite investigators in reaction to the unexplainable renaissance of hitandrun accidents in the city by the bay in the past twelve months glitsky was saying ninetythree persons had been struck by motor vehicles within the city and county of these twentyseven had died of the sixtysix injury accidents that didnt result in deaths fourteen were hit and runs i love it how you rattle off all those numbers hardy said anybody would swear you knew what you were talking about those are the real stats im sure they are which is why im glad were on this path and not the street where we could be senselessly run down at any moment but how do these numbers affect your department i thought hit and runs werent homicides glitsky glanced sideways at him technically they are when somebody dies well there you go thats why they come to you youre the homicide detail but we dont investigate them we have never investigated them you want to know why first because theres a separate detail cleverly named hit and run thats a good name if they do what i think hardy said its a fine name glitsky agreed he knew although the police department would deny it as a matter of course that no hitandrun incidentseven the homicideswere more than cursorily investigated by inspectors what usually happened was that a couple of members of the hitandrun detail would take the paperwork at the hall of justice the day after the incident maybe they would go to the scene of an accident and see if they could find a witness to provide a description or license number of the vehicle if that failed and there were no good eyewitnesses in the report that was essentially the end of the investigation if they had a license number they punched it into their computers to see if they had a street address associated with the vehicle sometimes if the accident got a lot of press and they had a vehicle description they would call a body shop or two and see if any cars matching the hitandrun vehicle had surfaced usually the answer was no its a fine department even but it doesnt do what we do which is investigate murders in spite of your details name which indicates an interest in all homicides hence the confusion glitsky said some of our civic leaders remain unclear on the concept they walked in silence for another moment whats second hardy asked whats second what you said you dont investigate hitandrun homicides first because theres a separate hitandrun detail when you say first it implies theres a second glitskys pace slackened then both men stopped second is that hitandrun homicides tend not to be murders in fact theyre never murders never say never this time you can you want to know why its hard to ditch the murder weapon thats one reason another is that its tough to convince your intended victim to stand in front of your car when there are no witnesses around so you can run him over most people just plain wont do it so whats the problem the problem glitsky said is that with twentyseven dead people in twelve months the citizenry is apparently alarmed i know i am hardy commented perpetually yeah well as you may have read our illustrious board of supes has authorized special funding for witness rewards and to beef up the investigation of all vehicular homicides and a good idea it is wrong its a bad idea glitsky said theres no special investigation of vehicular homicides to begin with not even in hit and run ninety percent of em you got a drunk behind the wheel the other ten percent somebodys driving along minding their own business and somebody runs out from between two cars in front of themblam then they freak and split they probably werent even doing anything wrong before they left the scene these are felony homicides okay because the driver is supposed to stick around but they are not murders and this concerns you because because now and for the past two months ive had these two new politically connected clownsexcuse me inspectorsin my detail that ive been telling you about and they seem to be having trouble finding meaningful work and lets say that this hasnt gone exactly unnoticed among the rest of my crack staff who by the way refer to them as the car police maybe they mean it as a compliment hardy said glitsky shook his head in disgust then checked his watch lets walk hardy could imagine the plight of the new inspectors and knew that their treatment at the hands of the veteran homicide cops wouldnt be pretty despite all the scandal and controversy that had ravaged the selfesteem of other details in the police department over the past few years the twelve men and women inspectors who served in homicide considered themselves the elite theyd worked their way up to this eminence and their jobs mattered to them they took pride in what they did and the new guys would not fit in so abuse is being taken hardy asked somebody painted car fiftyfour on their city issue then you know the fullsize streetlight weve had in the detail for years somehow its gotten plugged in and set between the two guys desks so they cant see each other when they sit down oh and those little metal cars kids play with six or eight new ones every day on their desks in their drawers everywhere i guess were moving into the abuse realm glitsky nodded that would be fair to say at a little after nine oclock glitsky sat behind his desk in his small office on the fourth floor of the hall of justice the door was closed his two new menharlen fisk and darrel braccohad so far been called out on injury hit and runs about ten times in their two months here and in theory they should have been rolling already on this mornings accident involving tim markham but this time they were seeking their lieutenants guidance before they moved glitsky blamed neither fisk nor bracco for being upset with the conditions theyd endured to date in the detail but until this morning he couldnt say hed lost any sleep thinking about it they were political appointees and they deserved what they got in their brief stops up the promotion ladder hopscotching over other inspectors who were smarter more qualified and worked harder harlen fisk was the nephew of city supervisor kathy west he went about six three two fifty and was selfeffacing almost to the point of meekness darrel bracco was trim crisp clean exarmy the terrier to fisks saint bernard his political juice was a little more obscure than his partners but just as potent his father angelo bracco had worn a uniform for thirty years and now was mayor washington s personal driverbracco would have the mayors ear whenever he wanted so these men could just as easily have gone whining to their supporters and glitsky could right at this moment be getting a formal reprimand from chief rigby whod heard from the mayor and a supervisor that he was running his detail in an unprofessional manner but they hadnt gone over his head instead they were both here in his office coming to him with their problem the situation gave him pause and inclined him to listen to what they were saying if not with sympathy then at least with some respect for their position bracco was standing at attention and glitsky had been talking for a while now reprising many of the salient points of his earlier discussion with dismas hardy thats why our office here in homicide is on the fourth floor he concluded with the lovely view of the roof of the medical examiners office whereas hit and run has a back door that opens into the alley where the waste from the jails kitchen comes murderers are bad people hitandrun drivers have made an unfortunate life choice theres a difference bracco sighed so theres no real job here is there glitsky came forward in his chair brought his hands together on the desk before him im sorry but thats how it is the young mans face clouded over so then why were we brought onboard this called for a careful response i understand both of you know some people maybe they dont really understand some technical matters fisk was frowning what about the man who was hit this morning markham what about him glitsky asked he wasnt dead at the scene but if he does die then what then as i understand it you get the case from h and r and do what with it bracco asked try to find the driver i dont know glitskynothing he could dospread his palms shrugged look guys he said maybe i could talk to the chief and see if he can arrange some kind of move you both might want to think about transferring to gangs or robbery or someplace do some good work on some real cases work your way back up to here where youll get some real murders which this is not bracco still in the atease position wanted to know his assignment in the meanwhile were here what do you want us to do sir on this mornings accident the entire situation was stupid but in glitskys experience stupidity was about the most common result of political solutions maybe these boys would learn some lesson you want my advice go out there yourselves look a little harder than h and r would maybe youll find something they missed they werent happy about it but bracco and fisk thoroughly canvassed the immediate neighborhood although they found no witnesses to the event itself they did not come up completely emptyhanded at very near to the time of the accident a fortyfiveyearold stockbroker named john bandolino had come out of his house on seacliff just west around the corner from twentysixth to pick up his newspaper he was on his way back inside when suddenly he heard a car with a bad muffler accelerate rapidly then squeal around the corner since this was normally a serene neighborhood bandolino ran back down to the street to see if he could identify the troublemaker who was making so much noise so early in the morning but the car was by then too far away to read the license plate it was green though probably american made not a new car certainly the other corroborating witnesses on the car were george and ruth callihan brown both retired and on their way to their regular tuesday breakfast with some friends they had just turned off seacliff onto twentysixth george driving when ruth saw markham lying sprawled in the garbage up ahead after the initial shock both of them realized that some kind of a mediumsize green car had passed them in the other lane as they were coming up they both turned to see it disappear around the corner heard the muffler noise the acceleration but they didnt even think to pursue it markham was unconscious and bleeding where he lay they had their cell phone and he needed an ambulance the crime scene reconstruction expert had trouble pinpointing the exact location on twentysixth where markham had been struck the force of the impact had evidently thrown him some distance through the air and there were no skid marks to indicate that the driver had slammed on the brakes in panic or indeed applied the brakes at all lunchtime and lou the greeks was hopping without any plan or marketing campaign and in apparent defiance of common sense or good taste lous had carved its unlikely niche and had remained an institution for a generation maybe it was the location directly across the street from the hall of justice but there wasnt any shortage of other bars and restaurants in the neighborhood and none of them did as well or had hung on as long as the greeks people from all walks of life just seemed to feel comfortable there in spite of some fairly obvious drawbacks if one chose to view the place critically the entrance was through a frankly urinestained bail bondsmans corridor which led to an unlit stairwaysix steps to a set of leatherette double doors the floor of the restaurant was five feet below ground level so it was dark even on the brightest day and never smelled particularly or even remotely appealing a row of small windows along one wall was set at eye level indoors though at ground level out this afforded the only meager natural light unfortunately it also provided a shoeseye view of the alley outside which was always lined with garbage dumpsters and other assorted urban debris and often the cardboard leantos and other artifacts of the homeless who slept there the walls had originally been done in a bordellostyle maroonandgold velveteen wallpaper but now were essentially black the bar opened at for the alcohol crowd and did a booming if quiet business for a couple of hours thered be a lull when the workday began across the street but at the kitchen opened and the place would fill up fast every day lous wife chui would recombine an endless variety of chinese and greek ingredients for her daily special which was the only item on the menu lou or one of the morning drinkers would give it a name like kungpao chicken pita or yeanling happy family and customers couldnt seem to get enough given the quality of the food no one would call it cuisine and the choices available lous popularity as a lunch spot was a continuing mystery even for those who frequently ate there themselves the party at the large round table by the door to the kitchen fit in this category for several months now in an unspoken and informal arrangement a floating group of professionals had been meeting here on most tuesdays for lunch it began just after the mayor appointed clarence jackman the district attorney at the time jackman had been in private practice as the managing partner of rand jackman one of the citys premier law firms and the previous da sharron pratt had just resigned in disgrace jackman viewed himself mostly as a businessman not a politician the mayor had asked him to step into the normally bitterly contested political office and get the organization back on course prosecuting crimes staying on budget litigating the citys business problems jackman seeking different perspectives on his new job asked some colleagues from different disciplinesbut mostly lawfor a lowprofile lunch at lous this move was startling enough in itself even more so was everyones discretion lunch at lous wasnt so much a secret as a nonevent if anyone noticed that the same people were showing up at the same table every week they werent talking it never made the news jackman faced the kitchen door the coat of his tailored pinstriped suit hung over the back of his chair his white dress shirt heavily starched fit tightly over the highly developed muscles in his back his face was darkly hued almost blueblack and his huge head was perched directly on his shoulders apparently without benefit of a neck lou the greek must have gotten a good deal on a containerload or so of fortune cookies because for the past couple of weeks a bowl of them incredibly stale was on every table for every meal the das lunch today had been consumed with the serious topic of the citys contract for its health insurance and when jackman cracked one of the cookies open and broke into his deep rolling laughter it cut some of the tension i love this he said this is perfect and right on point dont get sick he took in his tablemates who writes these things did one of you pay lou to slip it in here i think when they run out of license plate blanks at san quentin this was gina roake a longtime public defender now in private practice despite the thirtyyear age gap she was rumored to be romantically linked to david freeman another of the table guests no way marlene ash was an assistant da on jackmans staff shed taken her jacket off when she sat down too revealing a substantial bosom under a maroon sweater chestnut shoulderlength hair framed a frankly cherubic face marred only by a slight droop in her right eye no way a convict writes dont get sick itd be more like die muthuh thatd be an unusually polite convict wouldnt it treya ghent asked unprecedented glitsky agreed and its not a fortune anyway the lieutenant was two seats away from the da and next to his wife who held his hand on top of the table a fortunes got to be about the future dismas hardy spoke up its in a fortune cookie abe therefore by definition its a fortune how about if there was a bug in it would that make the bug a fortune guys guys san francisco s medical examiner john strout held up a restraining hand and adjusted his glasses a thin and courtly southern gentleman strout had crushed his own cookie into powder and was looking at the white slip in his hand now this heres a fortune you will be successful in your chosen field he looked around the table i wonder what thats goin to turn out to be i thought you were already in your chosen field roake said i did too strout paused sheeit now what everybody enjoyed a little laugh a silence settled for a second or two and jackman spoke into it thats my question too john now what he surveyed the group gathered around him only two of the other people at the table hadnt spoken during the fortune cookie debate david freeman seventysomething hardys landlord and the most wellknown and flamboyant lawyer in the city and jeff elliot in his early forties and confined to a wheelchair due to ms the writer of the citytalk column for the chronicle it was freeman who spoke theres no question here clarence you got parnassus sending the city a bill for almost thirteen million dollars and change for services they didnt render over the last four years theyre demanding full payment with interest within sixty days or so they say theyre belly up its nothing but extortion plain and simple even if you owed them the money which is not established marlene ash said freeman shrugged okay even better you charge their greedy asses with fraud and shut em down cant do that jackman was using a toothpick shut em down i mean not fast anyway although im already testing the waters with some other providers but its not quick certainly not this year and the parnassus contract runs two more years after that and whoever youre talking to isnt much better anyway am i right hardy asked define much jackman made a face hopefully thered be some improvements treya put a hand on her bosss arm why dont we let them go bankrupt just not pay them were not going to pay them in any case marlene ash answered but we cant let them go bankrupt either then who takes care of everybody whos taking care of them now roake asked and the table went silent the way it worked in san francisco city employees had several medical insurance options depending on the level of health care each individual wanted it seemed straightforward enough people willing to spend more of their own money on their health got better choices and more options in theory the system worked because even the lowestcost medical careprovided in this case by parnassus was adequate but no surprise to anybody that wasnt so couldnt parnassus borrow enough to stay afloat glitsky asked jackman the da shook his head they say not gina roake almost choked on her coffee they can get a loan trust me she said maybe not a great rate but a couple of mil prime plus something no problem what ive heard jackman said their story is that they cant repay it whatever it is theyre losing money right and left every day as it is and our original problem they dont need a loan anyway if the city just pays them what it owes which it doesnt marlene ash repeated owe i mean can you prove that glitsky the cop wanted to see the evidence i intend to ash said go back to the original invoices grand jury hardy cracked a fortune cookie ash nodded grimly thats what im thinking how can they say theyd run up thirteen million extra dollars and never saw it coming roake asked thats what id like to know jackman turned to her actually that was fairly clever they say their contract with the city covers outpatient aids treatment mental health and drug abuse counseling and physical therapy and theyve been providing it all along without being reimbursed the key word is outpatient theyre out the money theyve already provided the service we owe it to them he shrugged they distort the hell out of the contract to get to that position but all the unions want to read their contracts to cover those services so parnassus has some political support so its a contract language dispute freeman said tell them to sue you in civil court we would jackman said except that were starting to think we know ash interrupted were starting to think jackman repeated giving his ada a reproachful glare that they didnt provide the care they allege it was all outpatient stuff after all the record keeping appears to be uneven to say the least grand jury hardy repeated jackman broke a professional smile i heard you the first time diz maybe but im also thinking about freezing their accounts and appointing a receiver to keep em running which is the last thing parnassus wants but if they think it might get them paidand they do need the money youre sure of that freeman asked jackman nodded theyre not paying their doctors im taking that as a clue weve received a couple of dozen complaints in the last six months so finally we wrote a letter told them to straighten up pay their people or maybe wed need to get involved and sent a copy to each of their board members still being paid by the way at an average of three hundred fifty thousand dollars a year a year glitsky asked every year a little more i think jeff elliot said every year the lieutenant couldnt get over it im definitely in the wrong business no youre not dear treya told him youre perfect where you are hardy blew glitsky a kiss across the table anyway jackman forged ahead the threat got their attention in fact if you want my opinion that was the proximate cause of this demand for the thirteen mil so what happens if we let them go bankrupt glitsky asked how bad could it be freeman chuckled may i clarence he asked the da then proceeded without waiting for any response let me count the ways lieutenant the first thing that happens is that every city employee and that includes you loses their health insurance so instead of paying ten dollars to see your doctor now youre paying sixty eighty a hundred and fifty thats per office visit full price for prescriptions so every union in town sues the city because youre guaranteed insurance as part of your employment contract then the city sues parnassus for not providing the service then parnassus countersues the city for not paying for the service so now everybody in town has to go to county general for everything and theres no room for anyone this side of multiple gunshot wounds if you only have cancer take two aspirin and call me in the morning bottom line is if it turns out to be a bad year for the flu or aids or earthquakes letting parnassus go bankrupt could bring the city right along with it freeman smiled around the table bad news always seemed to stoke him up did i leave anything out that was pretty succinct david thank you jackman pushed the remains of his fortune cookie around on the table in any event parnassus must be close to broke if its resorting to this weve got to charge them with something ash said freeman had another idea i like bringing an action to freeze their accounts and appoint a receiver to investigate their books and keep the business going the old man gave the impression he wouldnt mind taking on the job himself jackman shook his head wed have to go a long way to proving the fraud david we cant just walk in and take over even if they havent paid their doctors roake asked id call that a triggering event it might be jackman agreed from his expression he found the idea potentially interesting well he said thanks to you all for the discussion im sure ill come to some decision jeff he said across the table youve been unusually quiet today i seem to remember youve written parnassus up for a few items recently dont you have some advice youd like to offer on this topic the reporter broke a cynical smile under his thick beard youve already heard it sir dont get sick though he was nearly fifty years old rajan bhutan had only been a nurse for about ten years hed arrived with his wife in the united states in his midtwenties for some time he had made do with a succession of retail jobs selling womens shoes and mens clothes in chain stores this was the same type of work hed done in calcutta although it didnt suit his personality very well small of stature moody and somewhat introspective by nature he had to force himself to smile and be pleasant to customers but he was efficient honest intelligent he showed up for work every day and would stay late or come in early without complaint so while he wasnt much of a salesman he tended to keep his jobshis first one at macys herald square where he stayed six years then at nordstrom for five more his wife had augmented their income by giving piano lessons and for about ten years they had been reasonably happy in their little apartment in the haight the only major disappointment in their lives the fact that chatterjee was unable to get pregnant then finally when they were both thirtyfive she thought that the miracle had occurred but it turned out that the something growing in her womb was not a baby but a tumor after chatterjee died rajan no longer found smiling or sales to be tolerable during the months hed nursed his wife though hed discovered that giving physical care appealed to him in some important way over the next four years he used up most of his savings going to nursing school fulltime until he finally received his rn from st marys and took a fulltime job at portola and true to form he stayed the doctors and administration liked him for the same reasons his bosses in retail had always kept him on but he had few if any friends among the nurses dark and brooding now to an even greater degree than hed been before when hed worked in sales he made little effort to be personable but he was good at giving care over time to his shift partners he became almost invisiblecompetent and polite albeit distant and with his hooded demeanor somewhat ominous now he stood over the bed of james lector after checking the connections on all the monitors he smoothed the blanket over the old mans chest and turned to look behind him across the room where dr kensing was with his partner today nurse rowe adjusting the iv drip on mr markham whod only just been wheeled in from postop rajan looked back down at lector on life support now for these past couple of weeks he had recently stabilized but who knew for how long looking at the old mans gray inanimate face he wondered againas he often didabout the socalled wonder of modern medicine the memory came back fresh againin the last days they had kept chatterjee alive and supposedly free from pain with life support and narcotics but as the years had passed hed come to believe that this had really been a needless crueltyboth to him for the false hope and to her for the denial of peace he believed in helping the sick in easing pain this was his mission after all after chatterjee but the needless prolongation of life this was what bothered him now as it always did when he worked the icu he looked down again at mr lectors face then back over to dr kensing and nurse rowe working to save another person who might be permanently braindamaged at best should he survive at all folly he thought so much of it was folly shaking his head with regret he sighed deeply and went to the next bed dr malachi ross stopped at the door to the intensive care unit and took a last look to make sure everything was as it should be the large circular room had seven individual bed stations for critical cases and all of them were filled as they were at all times every day of the year the odds said that five of the patients in them and possibly all seven would not live ross knew that this was not for lack of expertise or expense indeed the expense factor had become the dominating element of his life over the past years he was the chief medical director and cfo of the parnassus medical group and keeping costs under control while still providing adequate care which he defined as the minimum necessary to avoid malpractice lawsuits was his ever more impossible job which was he knew about to enter another period of crisis in the short term at least for occupying one of the beds here today was his colleague and chief executive officer tim markham struck down on his morning run an exercise he practiced with religious zeal in an effort to stay vigorous and healthy to a ripe old age ross supposed there was irony in this but he had lost his taste for irony years ago the monitors beeped with regularity and the other machines hummed all around the room white shades had been pulled over the windows against the feeble spring sun markham was in the first bed on the left all hooked up hed been up here for three hours already the fact that hed lived this long with such serious injuries some kind of a miracle ross took a step back toward the bed then stopped himself he was a doctor yes but hadnt practiced in ten years he did know that the bag for the next transfusion hung from its steel hook next to the bed where it ought to be the other iv was still halffull he had to assume everything was in order exhausted he rubbed his hands over his face then found himself looking down at them his surgeons hands his mother used to say his face felt hot yet his hands told him he wasnt sweating drawing a deep breath he turned and opened the door to get out he stepped out into the hallway where three more icu candidates postsurgery or poster lay on their own gurneys attached to monitors and drips theyd arrived since markham had been admitted now as the beds in the icu became available these patients would be transferred inside for theoretically better intensive care dr eric kensing was supervising the unit this morning and now he stood over one of the beds in the hallway giving orders to a male nurse ross had no desire to speak to kensing so he crossed to the far side of the hall and continued unmolested the short way down to the icus special waiting room distinguished by its amenities from the other spaces that served the same basic purpose the intensive care waiting room featured comfortable couches and chairs reasonably pleasant art tasteful wallpaper shuttered windows and noisekilling rugs this was because a vast majority of the people waiting here were going to hear bad news and the original architects had obviously thought the surroundings would help ross didnt think they did it was just another waste of money at the entrance he looked in noting with some satisfaction that at least brendan driscoll had left the immediate area for the time being and he wouldnt have to endure his reactions and listen to his accusations anymore driscoll was markham s executive assistant and sometimes seemed to be under the impression that he not his boss was the actual ceo of parnassus he gave orders even to ross as though he were as soon as hed heard about the accident driscoll had evidently left the corporate offices at the embarcadero to come and keep the vigil at markham s side hed even beaten ross himself down here but now thankfully he was gone banished by an enraged dr kensing for entering the icu for god knew what reason probably just because he wanted to and thought he could but disturbing though he could be driscoll was nowhere near as serious a problem to ross as carla markham tims wife sitting at one end of the deep couch as though in a trance she looked up at him and her mouth formed a gash of hostility and sorrow both instantly extinguished into a mask of feigned neutrality hes all right ross said then quickly amending it the same she took the news without so much as a nod he remained immobile but his eyes kept coming back to her she sat stiffly her knees pressed together her body in profile suddenly she looked straight at him as though shed only then become aware of his presence the same is not all right the same means he is near death and that is not all right and if he does die ross stepped into the waiting room and put up a hand as though physically to stop her hes not going to die he said youd better hope thats true malachi we dont have to talk about that ive heard what you said and youre right there were troubles but no crisis when tim comes out of this well talk it out make some adjustments like we have with a thousand other issues this is not like any of them his mouth began to form a knowing smile she was so wrong instead he cocked his head and spoke with all the conviction of his heart dont kid yourself he said theyve all been like this he stared down at her watching for any sign of capitulation but she wouldnt hold his gaze instead shaking her head once quickly from side to side she reached some conclusion he wasnt going to make adjustments this time the adjustments were what kept tearing him apart if he doesnt live i wont either he couldnt be sure if she was referring to living herselfshed threatened suicide the last time markham had left heror to making the kind of adjustments her husband had learned to live with carla he began softly dont be but she wasnt listening suddenly she was standing up in front of him the semblance of neutrality dropped for now i cant talk to you anymore dont you understand that not here maybe never theres nothing to say until we know about tim now excuse me ive got to call the children she walked by without glancing at him on her way out of the room ross sat in one of the leather settees and pushed himself back into the chair he gripped the edges of the armrests to keep his surgeons hands from shaking ross heard first the monitor alarm then the code blue for the icu for twenty minutes the commotion nearly reached the level of bedlam even out in the hallway when almost as abruptly as it had begun all the activity and noise came to a halt and then suddenly tim markham was dead ross had gotten up out of his chair and was waiting outside the icu standing there when doctor kensing appeared from inside his handsome face stricken and drawn he met rosss eye for a moment finally looking down and away i dont know what happened he said i thought we might have got him out of the woods but the words trailed off and the doctor shook his head in defeat and misery if he was looking for commiseration ross thought he was barking up the wrong tree in fact ross found himself fighting the urge to say something spiteful even accusatory the time would come for that kensing had been rosss particular nemesis for a couple of years questioning his medical and business decisions defying his edicts crusading against his policies with the rest of the medical staff kensings presence on the floor now in the icu directing markhams ultimately failed care was from rosss perspective a bitter but not unwelcome act of fate that he would exploit if he could after the initial impact of the tragedy had passed but it would have to wait now ross had business to which he must attend he didnt wait for kensing to reappear in the hallway with his no doubt selfserving postmortem analysis of what had gone wrong as if he could know by now he had no stomach for the condolences handholding andwringing that he knew would attend the next hours at the hospital instead he left the floor by elevator and got out in the basement parking garage where he got in his lexus and contacted his secretary joanne on his cell phone tim didnt make it he said simply ill be there in ten minutes david freeman and gina roake straightfaced told dismas hardy that they were going to continue their walk from lous up to freemans apartment on mason to look over some documents freeman would be back in the office later if hardy would be so kind as to tell phyllis id be delighted david any excuse just to hear her sweet voice so coming into the lobby alone hardy was congratulating himself for his restraint in not commenting on david and ginas lame documentperusal excuse when the dulcettoned phyllis stopped him mr elliot from the chronicle would like you to call him as soon as you can thank you did he say it was important not specifically but i assume so hardy walked up and leaned against the top of the receptionists partition phyllis hated when he did that but then she hated when he did anything he smiled at her why why what obviously thinking evil thoughts phyllis stared at his arms crossed there on her shelf why do you assume its important to phyllis trained by freeman everything to do with the law was intrinsically important hardy was untrainable and try as she might to remain the complete professional she couldnt seem to maintain her composure when he started in on her she sighed in exasperation tried to smile politely but didnt entirely succeed i assume all calls to your office are important mr hardy mr elliot took time out in the middle of his workday to call you in the middle of yours he asked you to call as soon as you could it must have been something important he might have just wanted to talk that happens you know clearly phyllis believed it was not something that should happen would you like me to call him and ask why phyllis hardy stepped back took his arms off the shelf looked at her approvingly i think youve just told a joke and during business hours when you should have been working i wont tell david she remained silent as he turned and got to the stairway up to his office oh and speaking of david he wont be in for a while hes with ms roake working on some documents though ive never called it that before called what phyllis asked suddenly he decided hed abused her enough or almost enough he pointed up the stairs nothing listen ive enjoyed our little chat but now ive got to run and call mr elliot it could be important hardy worked in stark monklike even industrial surroundings gray metal filing cabinets hunched on a gray berber walltowall carpet the two windows facing sutter street featured oldfashioned venetian blinds which worked imperfectly at bestnormally he simply left them either up or down rebecca and vincent his two children had painted most of his wall art although there was also a poster of the giants new home pac bell park and a sierra club calendar his blond wooden desk was the standard size its surface cleared except for his phone a photo of frannie an officemax blotter a sweet potato plant that reached the floor and his green bankers lamp under four shelves of law books and binders the dried blowfish and ship in a bottle hed brought from home livened up a formica counter with its faucet its paper towel roll on the wall and several glasses upside down by the sink the couch and chairs were functional sears faux leather and the coffee table came from the same shopping trip about six years before his dartboard hung next to the door across from his deska piece of silver duct tape on the rug marked the throw line at eight feet his tungsten blueflight customs were stuck two bullseyes and a twenty where hed last thrown them the phone was ringing as he opened the door and he reached over the desk punching his speakerphone button yo he said phylliss voice again but giving him no time to reply lieutenant glitsky for you and then abe was on guess what i just heard youre going to like it the giants got piazza in the real world diz thats the real world and id like it how about tim markham how about him is he a catcher ive never heard of him hardy had gotten around his desk to his chair and picked up the receiver hes the ceo of parnassus health glitsky said a jolt of adrenaline chased away the final traces of any lunch lethargy glitsky usually didnt call hardy to keep him up on the days news unless homicide was in the picture so he put it together right away and hes dead yes he is isnt that interesting hardy admitted that it was especially after all the talk at lous but more than that did somebody kill him yes but probably not on purpose you remember our discussion this morning about hit and runs youre kidding me nope lets remember not to talk about nuclear holocaust on our next walk somebody really ran him over more like plowed into him they kept him alive at portola until a half hour ago then lost him they lost him at his own hospital i bet that was a special moment it was another thing i thought youd like but evidently they couldnt do much he was critical on admit and never pulled out and it was an accident i already said that twice now hardy said you believe it so far hardy listened to the hum on the line the same week he tries to shake down the city his companys threatening to go bankrupt theyre not paying their doctors and theyre screwing around with their patients and suddenly the architect of all this winds up dead yep and its a coincidence thats your professional take on it probably it often is as i mentioned this morning except when it isnt lots of things happen that never happened before not as often as youd think glitsky replied this time the pause was lengthy but youve answered my question i just wanted an opinion from the average man on the street youll have to call somebody a little dumber than me then hardy said but ill send you a bill anyway jeff elliots call turned out to be about the same thing but he wasnt interested in hardys coincidence theory dismissing it even more definitively than glitsky had with one line you dont murder somebody with a car diz not when guns cost a buck and a half and knives are free id bet its been known to happen although glitsky says not too see and even if it has it also has been known to snow in the sahara is that true i dont think so but if it is it proves my point a sigh diz can we leave it hardy was thinking that all of his friends had lost their senses of humor he didnt really think it was probably a murder either but it was interesting to talk about and so much else wasnt okay jeff okay so how can i help you actually you cant this is just a mercy call see if youd like to take the rest of the day off which i noticed at lunch you might be in the mood for that obvious huh im a reporter diz nothing escapes hardy looked down at the massive pile of paperwork on the floor by his deskhis own and other lawyers briefs which were anything but memoranda administrative work that hed been neglecting billing a couple of police incident reports from prospective clients the latest updates of the evidence code which it was bad luck not to know he had an extremely full workload at the moment he was sure he ought to be glad about this although the why of it sometimes eluded him elliot was going on im thinking the shits got to be hitting the fan over at parnassus it might be instructive to swing over and check things out see if anybodyll talk to me and maybe ill get a column or two out of it so what do you say you want to play some hooky more than anything hardy said but not today im afraid is that your final answer he pulled some of the papers over in front of him desultorily flipped through the stack of them a trained reporter like elliot if hed been in the room would have recognized some signs of weariness even malaise certainly a lack of sense of humor hardy let out a heavy breath write a great column jeff make me feel like i was there it wasnt the kind of thing glitsky was going to talk about with any of his regular professional associates but he couldnt keep from sharing his concerns with his wife jackman let treya take a formal fifteenminute break sometimes if she asked and now she and abe stood in the outside stairway on the seventh street side of the building sipping their respective teas out of paper cups an early afternoon wind had come up and they were forced to stand with their backs against the building the view limited to the freeway and twin peaks out beyond it and here i thought you brought me to this romantic spot so we could make out in the middle of the day we could do that if you want glitsky told her im pretty easy that way she kissed him ive noticed but you were really thinking of something else he told her about markham how intensely uncomfortable he was with coincidences and markham s death fell squarely into that category but i wasnt lying when i told diz that probably it wasnt an intentional homicide that was the voice of thirty years experience whispering in my ear but what but my other guardian angel the bad one keeps on with this endless maybe what if how about you mean if somebody ran him down on purpose he nodded im trying to imagine an earlymorning justafterlight lyinginwait scenario but i cant convince myself it just couldnt have happened in real life well maybe it could have but i dont think it did why not she was about the only person he ever smiled at and he did now how good of you to ask ill tell you the first and most obvious reason is that the driver didnt finish the job markham lived nearly four hours after the accident and if he hadnt been thrown into the garbage can he might have pulled through it the driver couldnt have known hed killed him if hed planned to he would either have backed up over him or stopped got out of the car and whacked markham s head a few times with a blunt object hed been carrying for just that reason sweet treya said but true he went on to give her the second reason the one hed given hardy a car was a stupid and awkward choice as a murder weapon if someone were going to take the time to plan a murder and then lie in wait to execute it with all the forethought that entailed abe thought even a moron would simply buy a gun which was as easy if not easier to purchase far more deadly and simpler to get rid of than any vehicle would be okay im convinced he probably wasnt murdered i know thats what i said but but you want to keep your options open correct which leads me to my real problem did you get the impression at lunch today that my friend and your boss clarence jackman is going to get considerable political heat around anything to do with parnassus the death of its ceo isnt going to hide out in the chronicles back pages and then disappear in a couple of days when it isnt solved no i dont think so treya agreed so who gets the case which is definitely a homicide and might conceivably be but probably isnt a murder treya had been living with the problems within the homicide detail and had a good sense of the dilemma in the normal course of events abe would never have anything to do with this case it was a hit and run someone from that detail would be assigned to locate the vehicle they probably wouldnt and that would be the end of it now because he had fisk and bracco hed have to give the case to themin fact he already had if he tried to pass it to one of his veteran inspectors first his guy would be insulted and laugh at him then the mayor and the supervisor would demand his head and probably get it and then ifwonder of wondersit turned out to be a reallive politically charged highprofile murder after all hed have given it to his two rawest players who would probably screw it all up and that would not only infuriate jackman it might harm the district attorneys relations with the police department for a good portion of this administration id say youve got to let the new boys keep it thats what ive come to myself but its loselose luckily she said touching his cheek gently with all the practice youve gotten so good at those but he had fisk and bracco back in his office at the end of the day and gave them the best spin he could put on it an opportunity to give you guys some quality time you do good on this people here might be inclined to think you might turn into good cops after all he paused and purposefully did not add and not just political stooges darrel bracco was as hed been this morning and as he always was in herestanding almost at attention behind the chair where his partner sat we never asked to get moved in here lieutenant neither one of us but we did jump at the chance who wouldnt okay glitsky could accept that heres your chance to make it work a few minutes later he was reading from a notepad hed been filling with ideas as they struck him on and off for most of the afternoon girlfriends and if so did they just break up then his children how did he get along with them excuse me fisk had a hand up like a third grader glitsky looked over his notepad yes with exaggerated patience harlen i thought this was about all the problems markham was having with his business and now youre talking about his family glitsky pulled himself up to his desk and placed his pad flat upon it his blue eyes showed little expression i want you both to understand something the odds that mr markham was killed on purpose and hence this is a murder investigation at all are not large harlen you and i and inspector bracco were talking this morning about the fact that you didnt have much to do here in the detail i thought you might enjoy taking a look at this thing from the ground up and the ground is a victims family its got nothing to do with the car youre saying the lieutenant kept his impatience in check no im not saying that the car is what hit him and if somebody he knew was driving it then it starts to look a lot more like a murder which i repeat and you should too it probably isnt but it will keep us out of the detail bracco said is that what youre saying glitsky nodded it might do that and that is to the good i think youll agree when the inspectors had returned from their mornings exertions they discovered a tom terrific beanie on the center of each of their desks the detail didnt appear to be moving toward acceptance or even tolerance of the new crew it was a drag to have to deal with glitsky thought but he wasnt going to get involved in disciplining the hazing activities that wasnt his job and if he tried to move in that direction hed lose whatever authority he did have before he knew it so yes it would keep fisk and bracco out of the office a good thing glitsky picked up the notepad again and read from it do any of his children have friends with a green car what about the wifes social life if any beyond that everybody you talk to needs an alibi and remember the accident happened at six or so in the morning so anybody who says they werent sleeping should be interesting what about his work fisk asked parnassus well get there its a process glitsky said evasively this was after all mostly a charity mission for his new inspectors and he wasnt inclined to let them get in the way and muddy the waters in case jackman did decide to convene a grand jury over business irregularities at parnassus which may or may not have involved markham lets see where it takes us he said but then he did remember a detail youd better take a look at the autopsy too the guys eyed each other and bracco cleared his throat he died in the hospital sir he said we know what he died of we do glitsky replied what was that he got run over thrown about thirty yards smashed into a garbage can and your point is look lets assume we find somebody who wanted to run over mr markham and in fact did a pretty good job of it so we arrest our suspect and somehow weve never looked at the autopsy you know what happens it turns out he died of a heart attack unrelated to his injuries in the accident or maybe somebody entirely different from our suspect stuck an ice pick in his ear or poisoned his ice water maybe he was a spy for the russians and the cia took him out the point is somebodys dead we check the autopsy first every time capisce he looked up and gave them his terrible smile welcome to homicide boys where the good times just keep on comin eric kensing still wore his bloodspattered green scrubs he was slumped nearly horizontal in a chair in the doctors lounge on the ground floor his long legs stretched straight out before him his feet crossed at the ankles the room was otherwise empty a lock of grayspecked black hair hung over his forehead which he seemed to be holding up with the heel of his right hand he heard the door open and someone flicked on the overhead lights he opened his eyes it was his soontobe exwife ann they said id find you here her voice at whisper pitch under tight control looks like they were right she started right in at least you could have called me eric thats what i dont understand instead i find it out on the goddamn radio and with the kids in tow she added thank you very much he got to his feet quickly not wanting to give her the edge where are they now are they okay of course theyre okay what do you think i left them at janeys theyre fine well good he waited forcing her so why didnt you call me he backed up a step crossed his arms he had an open almost boyish face in spite of the worry lines the bags under his eyes a puffiness at his onceproud jawline but around his wife hed learned especially in the past year or two to suppress any animation in his face not that he felt any conscious need to do that now anyway but he was resolved to give ann nothing he might have been molded from wax and could easily have passed for someone in his early fifties though he was fifteen years short of that why would i call you his wife was here his family besides the last i heard youd broken up again for good she set her mouth drew a determined breath i want to see him she said help yourself as long as carla and his kids are gone id ask you to try and be sensitive if theyre still around oh yes mr sensitive thats your role isnt it bedside manner comforting the bereaved sometimes he shrugged i dont care you do what you want you will anyway thats right i intend to her nostrils flared how did he die here how could that happen he got smashed up ann badly people get smashed up all the time they dont die well tim did and you dont care do you what does that mean i dont like to lose a patient but he wasnt her voice took on a hysterical edge he wasnt just a patient eric she glared at him dont give me that doctorspeak i know what you really think oh you do whats that youre glad hes dead arent you you wanted him to be dead for a long time he had no ready response finally he shook his head in resignation and disgust well its been nice talking to you now excuse me he started to walk by her but she moved in front of him where are you going back to work ive got nothing more to say to you you came here to see tim you found me easy enough you wont have any problem now please get out of my way ive got work to do she held her ground oh yes the busy doctor then taking another tack they said you were on the floor what floor you know what one he backed up a step what are you talking about when he died thats right he said warily what about it hed had long experience with her when her emotions took over with the sometimes astounding leaps of logic of which she was capable now he saw something familiar in her eyes a kind of wild lucidity that he found deeply unsettling i should tell somebody she said ill bet i know what really happened up there i dont know what youre talking about yes you do eric im the only one who knows what youre really capable of how unfeeling you can be how you are oh please ann dont start i will start you killed him didnt you he thought shed been going there and now that she had the depth of his rage allowed for nothing but pure reaction summoning all of his control he turned to make sure no one else was within earshot then leaned in toward her inches from her face he forced a brutal smile absolutely he said with all the cold conviction he could muster i pumped his iv full of shit as soon as i could get away with it she backed away and froze he had her her delicious panic impelled him to continue striking i kill people here all the time its one of the unsung perks of the job she stared at him with real fear for a long moment but hed shocked her back to herself her shoulders relaxed she gulped a few breaths you think thats funny she asked you think its something to joke about you think im joking were you joking when you asked me but then suddenly it had gone far enough get a grip ann did i kill him jesus you were there and you hated him so what maybe you didnt understand the message he got run over and brought here it was the closest er ann i didnt somehow arrange it you should have taken yourself off his case and why is that so i wouldnt have a chance to kill him maybe you dont get ithow about if i wanted to kill him how about that he stared at the total stranger with whom hed lived a dozen years whod borne him three children for an instant he wanted to get another rise out of her but that gambit had played itself out she shook her head finally you didnt kill him she said you dont have the guts you said it not me but whether i did or not hes gone isnt he thats going to be tough on little annie isnt it hed hit her again where it hurt she set her jaw then suddenly reached out and pulled violently at a sleeve of his scrubs you son of a bitch what am i supposed to do now eric tell me that what am i supposed to do whatever you were going to do ann i dont really care he wasnt coming back anyway then a last thrust dont tell me you dont have a fallback boyfriend she came forward now in a wild fury her fists flailing at him you bastard she kept coming pounding at him spewing obscenities until finally hed gotten ahold of both of her wrists he gripped them tightly in front of him ow let me go youre hurting me good let me go damn you dont you dare swing at me again you hear me he held on for one more moment squeezing with all of his strength she continued to struggle against him making little inhuman cries with the exertion trying to pull her arms away to twist her body but he had her and wasnt letting her go finally he pulled her close in to him and locked her in his gaze she wasnt ready to give it up not yet but he kept her in an iron grip until at last he felt the fight go out of her do you hear me goddamnit he whispered yes let me go he stepped back and pushed her away as he released her im leaving he said get out of my way she was rubbing her arms then holding them out look what youve done she said youve hurt me youll live he said she stepped in front of him all but daring him to go another round but leached out of the hurt and rage he had no more stomach for fighting her why dont you go home ann back to the kids you dont belong here but she stared obstinately up at him i need to see him where is he now he knew what she meant she wanted to view markhams body but fuck that he thought best guess right this minute he said somewhere close to the center of hell then he pushed past her and made it out of the room little league was playing havoc with the hardys schedule vincent practiced on mondays and wednesdays and hardy was coaching so he and frannie had had to change their sacred date night to tuesdays for the duration of the season tonight at a little after hardy pushed open the door of the little shamrock where they were supposed to rendezvous but she hadnt yet arrived her brother moses mcguire though was behind the rail talking to a young couple who were decked out in a lot of black leather in one of his manic phases mcguires voice boomed enough to drown out sting on the jukebox who wasnt exactly whispering himself hardy pulled up a stool by the front window half turned so he could watch the cypresses bend in the stiff wind at the edge of golden gate park across the street moses glanced at him and began to pull his guinnessan automatic call for hardy nine times out of ten the foam in the stout would take several minutes to fall out and this way moses could keep talking until it had no point in breaking up a good story which continued so the guyd had a stomachache for like nine months theyd already taken out first his appendixwrongthen his gall bladderwhoops wrong again nothing helps and they dont find anything and finally send him on his way telling him hes stressed out well no shit so he starts doing acupuncture seeing a chiropractor taking herbs getting massagesnothing helps and meanwhilehere mcguire turned to hardy pointed at his pint almost readymeanwhile the guys trying to go on with his life hes supposed to be getting married in a few months the couple asked almost in unison so what happened so two weeks ago he wakes up doubled over cant even get out of bed they cut him open again but this time close him back up and say theyre sorry hes got a month they must have missed it a month to live the girl asked is that what they meant yeah but it wasnt a month either moses concluded turns out it was five days the guy was staring through his drink shaking his head five days mcguire nodded in disgust i served him a drink in here three weeks ago and went to his funeral on monday he grabbed hardys pint and walked it down the bar hardy drank off a mouthful that was a fun story who were you talking about shane mackey you didnt know from his own days as a bartender hardy had known mackey when hed played on the shamrocks softball team for a couple of years he couldnt have been much beyond forty years old hardy remembered buying him and his fiancee a drink at the new years party here four months ago he carefully put his glass on the bar and swirled it was that a true story the good parts anyway the wedding was going to be next month susan and i had already bought them some dishes at malachi ross was in his office in his leather eames chair a cup of coffee grown cold on the glass table in front of him across from him in his wheelchair a yellow notepad on his lap and a tape recorder next to rosss coffee sat jeff elliot through the vertical blinds ross was looking past the reporter out over downtown from the seventeenth floor but he noticed neither the lights of north beach dancing below him nor the stars clear in the windswept sky above he hadnt eaten since breakfast yet felt no hunger theyd been at it for almost a half hour and ross had brought the discussion around to himself his background how hed joined the parnassus board as a doctor whose original job was to provide medical legitimacy for the companys profitdriven business decisions this was back in the first days of aggressive managed care and ross told elliot that he had come on as the standardbearer for designating a primary care physician or pcp for each patient as the gatekeeper of the medical fortress a concept which by now had pretty much become the standard for hmos everywhere in the country but not a popular idea elliot observed ross came forward in his chair and met the reporters eyes give me a better road and im on it tomorrow he said but basically it works although patients dont like it a resigned shrug lets face it mr elliot people are hard to please i think most patients appreciate the efficiency and that translates to satisfaction he wanted to add that in his opinion people were overly concerned with all the touchyfeely junk the body was a machine and mechanics existed who knew how to fix it when it broke the socalled human element was vastly overrated but he couldnt say that to elliot its really better for the vast majority of patients and why is that the reporter asked doesnt it just remove them from any kind of decision loop okay thats a reasonable question i suppose but ive got one for you although you wont like the sound of it why should they be in it again he held up his hand stopping elliots response its hard enough to keep this ship afloat with professionals who know the business if patients had the final say theyd sink it financially now im not saying we shouldnt keep patients informed and involved but but people would demand all kinds of expensive tests they dont really need ross smiled with apparent sincerity there you are healing takes time mr elliot and youd be surprised at how many health problems go away by themselves he stood up and went over to the small refrigerator at the corner of the room and got out a couple of bottled waters he gave one to the reporter and sat back down look he said leaning forward and speaking ostensibly from the heart i know this must all sound pretty callous but nobodys opposed to losing the money on tests if theyre necessary hell thats what insurance is all about after all but if fifty guys show up month after month and each one gets his test when only five really need it then instead of parnassus losing twentyfive grand which is covered by premiums we lose a quarter mil to cover that wed have to increase premiums and copays by a factor of ten which nobody can afford so the whole system falls apart and no one gets any health care elliot drank some water but lets say out of the fifty guys who want their tests ten in fact need them not five what happens to them they get identified mr elliot maybe a little late which is regrettable nobody denies that theyre tough choices i admit i personally wish nobody had to go through any pain ever honest to god thats why i became a doctor to begin with but its my job now to keep this ship afloat and if we tested every patient for everything they wanted as opposed to everything they truly needed wed sink like a stone and thats the cold hard truth then nobody would get any tests because nobody could afford them you think that would be better let me ask you one elliot replied ive heard a rumor you havent paid some of your doctors would you care to comment on that ross kept on his poker face but elliots awareness of this fact startled and worried him he also thought he knew the source of itthe always difficult eric kensing whod admitted baby emily and then he suspected been elliots source on the breaking story but he only said i dont know where you would have heard that its not accurate this evidently amused the reporter is that the same as not true ross sat back in an effort to appear casual what we did was ask our doctor group to loan a sum to the company with interest that would come out of the payroll reserve it was entirely voluntary and weve paid back everyone whos asked jeff elliot had been sitting listening to malachi rosss apologies and explanations for over an hour now the chief medical director was talking lecturing really about the rationale for the parnassus drug formulary maybe hoping that jeff would spin the selfserving chaff into gold in his column get some pr points for the group in rosss coming war with the city look ross said lets say the genesis corporation invented a cancercuring drug called nokance the budget to research and develop the drug and then shepherd it through the zillions of clinical trials until it got fda approval comes in at a billion dollars but suddenly its curing cancer and everybody wants it sufferers are willing to pay almost anything and genesis needs to recoup its investment if its going to stay in business and invent other miracle drugs so it charges a hundred bucks per prescription and for a couple of years while its the only show in town nokance gets all the business but eventually the other drug companies come out with their versions of nokance perhaps with minute variations to avoid patent disputes but some of which might cause side effects a pained expression brought rosss eyelids to halfmast rarely mr elliot really very rarely so look where we are these drugs also cure cancer but to get market share theyre priced at ten bucks in response nokance lowers its price to say fifty dollars thats a lot more than ten yes it is and youd think that once we educate people tell them all the facts everybody would stop using it and go for the cheap stuff wouldnt you they dont never or statistically never given the choice the patients almost always choose nokance its the brand name people recognize theres confidence in the product like bayer aspirin exactly ross silently brought his hands together as though he was applauding soand heres the pointalthough it costs us forty dollars more per scrip to supply the nokance if we approve it and keep it on the formulary it costs the patients the same amount it always has which is ten bucks the drug copay so we delist it the nokance right butthis is still hypothetical nowyoure saying its good stuff and you dont let your patients get it they can get it but we wont pay for it if we did it would wipe us out were dealing with extremely small margins for the survival of the company here youve got to understand that the point is that nokance isnt the only stuff that works thats what im trying to get through to you the generics do the job elliot had his own very strongly developed ideas about drug formularies he had been suffering from multiple sclerosis for over twenty years and on the advice of his doctors he sometimes thought that hed tried all the various generics in the world for his different and changing symptoms not invariably but several timesat least enough to have let him develop a healthy skepticismhed experienced side effects or discomfort with the generics when hed gone back to the brand name the problems vanished so ross would never sell him on the universal benefit of generic drugs so just to be clear on your position elliot said your view is that this gatekeeping and cost cutting from managed care to generic drugs is essentially consistent with your hippocratic oath for example where the emphasis is first to do no harm then to heal basically yes ross seemed pleased with this take on it but elliot knew he wouldnt be for long were in medicine mr elliot he continued the goal is maximum wellness for the most people and theres no conflict between your business interests and the needs of your patients of course there is ross was leaning back in his chair comfortably his legs crossed but we try to minimize it its all a matter of degree the company needs to sustain itself so it can continue doing its work and also make a profit lets not forget youve got to show earnings thoughrightto please your investors ross smiled and spread his hands in a selfdeprecating way well were not doing too well at that lately so i hear elliot came forward in his wheelchair spoke in a friendly tone do your investors ever express displeasure with the salaries of your officers and directors ross blinked a few times but if the question bothered him he covered it quickly not often our board members are skilled businesspeople if the pay werent competitive theyd go elsewhere good help is hard to find and when you find it you pay top dollar for it and this good help what does it do exactly run the company thats right and yet youre close to bankruptcy it wasnt a question but elliot let it hang for a beat which makes one wonder if lesserpaid help could do any worse doesnt it fisk and bracco may have come across as a matched pair to their fellow homicide inspectors but they really couldnt have been much more different from each other as human beings and this meant they were different kinds of cops too when it got to be five oclock harlen fisk asked his partner if hed drop him off at tadichs the citys oldest restaurant in spite of his pregnant wife and baby boy waiting at home hed be meeting his aunt kathy and several of her supporters for dinner and schmoozing well into the night he didnt invite bracco to join them and there were no hard feelings either way the fact was fisk was a political animal with his eye someday in the distant future on political rewards by contrast bracco was the son of a cop but even so until he got the promotion to homicide he hadnt clearly understood how much his fathers connection to the mayor was affecting his career how much the regular guys resented him and hed never asked for special treatmentit had simply come with the territory political people in the department thought they could make the mayor happy by being nice to the bracco boy and they werent all wrong but when fisk had told him that he was thinking about going to his aunt the city supervisor to complain about their continued illtreatment on the fourth floor bracco had talked his partner out of it one thing hed learned from his father was that cops didnt whine ever the thing to do was talk to glitsky hed said ask straight and deal with the answer which was that there was probably no intentional homicide here with the hit and run and hence nothing to look into bracco believed that this was the truth but what else was he doing with his time so after he dropped harlen off downtown he spent a few hours checking leads that theyd picked up on the car during the course of the day he didnt expect any results but you never knew his experience in hit and run had taught him that most of the time the drivers would wait until they thought nobody was looking for their car anymore theyd park it out of sight keep the garage door closed after a month they would take it to a car wash or body shop and that would be the end of it but maybe this timelong odds but possibleit would be different theyd gotten eleven patrol callins during the day these were vehicles fitting the description that were parked at the curb or in driveways around the city reported by patrolling cops fisk hated this kind of legwork bracco on the other hand put in a couple of hours checking out each and every one the impact that had thrown markham would have left a sign even on an old thickskinned american car and a quick walk around with a flashlight would tell him if he would need to come back with a warrant but none of the cars had anything close not exactly knowing why he killed another half hour walking through the parking garage at portola hospital but there wasnt one old green car so feeling like an idiot he sat in his car and wrote some notes to jog his memory tomorrowcheck the rentawrecks dont forget the callins to h r from citizens interested in the reward from the supervisors fund ten thousand dollars for information leading to the arrest and conviction et cetera finally on his way home after a piroshki gutbomb he bought at a place on nineteenth avenue he decided to head back up to seacliff to markhams house start as glitsky said with the family look at the cars parked outside after all he reminded himself wryly he was the car police can i help you bracco straightened up abruptly and shone his flashlight across the hood of the white toyota he was examining it was the last one of what had been twentythree cars parked on markhams block the beam revealed a man of aboveaverage height who brought a hand up against the glare and spoke again in a harsh strained voice what the hell are you doing bracco noted with alarm that he was reaching into his jacket pocket with his free hand freeze police it was all he could think to say dont move bracco didnt know whether he ought to flash his badge or draw the gun from his shoulder holster he decided on the latter and leveled it at the figure im coming around this car his blood was racing dont move one muscle he repeated im not moving okay now slowly the hand in your jacket take it out where i can see it this is ridiculous but the man complied bracco patted the jacket reached inside and removed a cell phone then backed away a step look im a doctor the man said a patient of mine who lives here died today so i come out after paying my condolences and somebodys at my car with a flashlight i was just going to use the cell to call the police myself after a moment bracco handed the phone back to the doctor and put his gun back where it belonged if hed felt like an idiot before walking the parking lot at the hospital now he was mortified although he wasnt going to show it could i see some identification please the man turned to look toward the house for a moment then came back to the inspector i dont see he began im finally he sighed and reached for his wallet my name is dr eric kensing he said i was the icu supervisor today at portola hospital where mr markham died right he was myboss i guess why are the police out here now bracco found himself coming out with the truth im looking for the hitandrun vehicle kensing blew out impatiently could i please have my wallet back he slipped it into his pocket then suddenly asked youre not saying you really think somebody tim knew hit him on purpose then came here to visit the family no but wed be pretty stupid not to look wouldnt we it sounds a little farfetched to me but if thats what you guys do he let the thought go unfinished listen are we done id like to go now my car didnt hit him you see any sign that i hit him you want to check again and make sure i interrupted you in the middle of it something about the mans tonea mixture of arrogance and impatiencestruck bracco he knew that people reacted to cops in all kinds of different ways every once in a while though he believed that the reaction revealed something unusual perhaps a consciousness of guilt kensing was reaching for the door handle but bracco suddenly and instinctively wanted to keep him for a few more words you say mr markham was your boss i didnt realize he was a doctor kensing straightened up at the car door and sighed again he wasnt he ran the company i work for parnassus health so you knew him well did you a pause not really he shifted his gaze back over braccos shoulder again now if were done here whats in the house bracco asked what do you mean nothing you keep looking back at it do i he shrugged i wasnt aware of it i suppose im worried about them its been a real tragedy theyre devastated in there bracco was picking up an off note that might have been fatigue but might be something else he could turn his questions into an interrogation of sorts if he could manage to keep the right tone i thought you said you didnt know him well i didnt yet youre worried about his family do you have some problem with that last time i checked it wasnt a crime to care about a victims family kensing swiped a hand across his forehead cast a quick look up and down the street look officer are we going somewhere with this that im missing bracco didnt answer instead he asked a question of his own so you didnt have any strong feelings about him the doctor cocked his head to one side what do you mean as a boss any way this time the doctor paused for a long moment whats your name officer if you dont mind i like to know who im speaking with bracco sergeant inspector darrel bracco homicide as soon as bracco said it he knew it was a mistake kensing nearly jumped at the word homicide yes sir and youre investigating tims death why does somebody think he was murdered not necessarily a hit and run that results in death is a homicide this is just routine routine checking the cars coming to his house right and you just called him tim does that mean something his name was tim you didnt know him very well and yet you called him by his first name kensing was silent shaking his head finally he let out a long breath look inspector i dont know what im supposed to say the man died in my unit today while he was under my care ive known him for fifteen years and i came by here to pay further condolences to his wife and family its almost ten oclock and ive been up since six this morning and im the walking dead right now i dont see where calling the man by his first name has any meaning and if you dont mind ive got an early call again tomorrow id be happy to talk to you at the hospital if you want to make an appointment bracco realized that maybe hed pushed his spontaneous interrogation too far everything kensing said tone or no tone made perfect sense there was no real point in harassing this probably decent doctor who had in fact voluntarily opened the door to another interview tomorrow the inspector knew hed overreached youre right but i may call you in the next few days thatd be fine kensing said im not going anywhere they both stood in the street for another beat then bracco told him good night and turned for the house glitsky had told him it started with the family and maybe hed find something inside get some valuable first impressions but he hadnt gone two steps when he heard kensings voice again youre not thinking about going up to the house are you he stopped and turned i thought i might the doctor hesitated seemed to be considering whether to say anything finally he spoke up well youll do what youre going to do inspector but you might want to consider giving them a break tonight and coming back tomorrow theyve had a bad day theyre wrung out i guarantee none of them drove your hitandrun car what are you going to ask them that cant wait bracco had had a long day himself he looked back at the house still lit up it struck him that his need to find something anything to do with tim markhams death and thereby prove his worth to glitsky was pushing him too far too fast hed invented phantoms and made some interrogation mistakes here with kensing just now and he was about to do it again with the family when he had no plan and there was really nothing to ask he should leave them to their exhaustion and grief tomorrow was another day bracco nodded thats a good call but you and i might be talking again soon ill look forward to it kensing said and opened the door to his car glitsky had lived in the same upper duplex for twenty years and now between the blessing of rent control and the latest surge in san francisco real estate he knew he would be living there when he died even if the owner sold it a new owner could never make him leave unless he wanted to move in himself and that would take forever and cost a fortune glitskys rent could never go up beyond a piddling percentage and with converted condo onebedroom fixeruppers now going for half a million dollars anywhere in the city he knew he could never afford to buy something else as it was he paid rent of less than a thousand dollars a month for the place which was on a quiet dead end a really beautiful treelined block north of lake his backyard opened onto a greenbelt and running path at the border of the presidio so he often woke up to birds chirping rather than sirens wailing deer and raccoon sightings were common he didnt kid himselfhe knew he was one of the very fortunate still it wasnt as though he lived in ducal splendor ducal splendor he felt was hard to come by in thirteen hundred square feet especially when that area was subdivided into three bedrooms a kitchen and a living room still with flo hed raised his three boys here the lack of room had never really been an issue then and it wasnt now for the past several years a housekeeper named rita schultz had lived with him and orel and she had slept behind a screen in the living room rita was gone now which made the living room seem gigantic treyas sixteenyearold daughter raney had taken over what had for a short while been the television room down the hallway behind the kitchen they had plenty of room it was now and both kids had gone off to school glitsky and treya were both drinking tea reading the newspaper at the kitchen table which wasnt big enough to spread out the sections so they played a quiet game covering a portion of each others pages whenever they turned their next one when treya had done this for the fourth time covering the lengthy article glitsky was reading about the latest news on the ancient water flows on mars and what they all might mean he put down his mug reached over and quite gently ripped the offending page down the middle he then dropped it on the floor you are such a fun person she said i dont care what everybody says are there people who dont think im fun some i think glitsky shook his head this is very hard to believe hardy told me the same thing just last year he made a caricature of a smile which his scar rendered grotesque but put another page over mine before i finish this article and ill rip your heart out okay we need a bigger table he was trying to get back to reading but stopped again and looked across at her yes we do but wed need a bigger kitchen to hold it and then where would we be maybe we could knock down a wall hereno im serious and then the doorbell interrupted her and she looked at her watch who could that be one of the kids forgot something abe was up and moving nope he said business he opened the door good morning darrel youre up early wheres harlen then howd you find out where i live harlen fisk had known from somewhere darrel explainedpoliticians always knewand had pointed the place out to him so this morning heading downtown from seacliff bracco had to pass glitskys duplex and he decided to stop and maybe save himself the trip back now as they drove his lieutenant sat beside him clearly exercising his patience so let me get this straight you were out in the street in front of mr markhams house until nearly ten last night then decided it was too late to go in and start asking questions and why were you going to do that again ask questions you said it started with the family thats true so i was going to talk to them if i could but a lot of people had come by for condolences and so on and i realized that the family must have had a long hard day so i thought id let them get some rest it could wait until today and you were there again by when six thirty closer to seven i figured the kids would still have school and i wanted to catch them if i could i didnt think any of them were going to sleep very well anyway but nobody answered bracco flicked a glance across the car seat nothing the first time when i just knocked so im thinking theyre still sleeping so i gave it another twenty and rang four or five times and waited he hesitated they were in the house when i left lieutenant dr kensing had just come out from visiting them im ninetynine percent sure that they went to sleep there i dont know why they didnt answer i think i would have woken them up at least arms crossed glitsky merely nodded he didnt know what if anything was going on at tim markhams house he did consider it entirely possible that the household had slept through braccos knocking and ringing hed seen families of murder victims physically exhausted and emotionally depleted sleep around the clock and then some or they might have decided just not to answer the door to some unknown man at the crack of dawn but on another level glitsky was glad to see his inspector showing such initiative even if it might turn out to have been misdirected theyd know soon enough it was another clear cold morning they parked directly in front of the twostory mansion and walked to the front stoop an expanse of flagstone broader and wider than glitskys living room bracco knocked then pressed the bell a booming threetone gong easily audible outside the door i dont think theyd sleep through that do you glitsky reached around pressed the button again and they waited after one more try and another minute abe told darrel to stay where he was and went to check around the house the plantation shutters in the front windows were closed but through the garage windows he saw two cars parked where they should have been opening the gate through the fence to the backyard he was struck by the silence and walked more briskly to the window in the back door a large dog apparently asleep on the floor was visible at the far end of a kind of mud room and glitsky knocked forcefully several times the dog didnt move jogging now coming back around to the front of the house he saw that a woman had joined bracco on the front porch he checked his watch and saw that it was just eight oclock slowing down now walking back up to the stoop he had his badge out and introduced himself she was anita tong as hed guessed the maid arriving at work for the day were you expecting mrs markham to be home this morning ms tong nodded mr markham just died yesterday where would she go i dont know glitsky said i was asking you there was no answer do you have a house key may i see it please nervous now nodding she was biting her lower lip she rummaged in her purse extracted a set of keys and dropped them onto the flagstone im sorry she said picking them up here this one glitsky turned to his inspector darrel i want you to stay here ms tong you should wait right here too with inspector bracco do you understand dont go inside glitsky then opened the door and found himself in a large bright circular foyer a spacious room opened off to his left and he walked a couple of steps into it and looked around all seemed in order across the foyer a dining room complete with formal table and chandelier was also as it should be as was the breakfast nook beyond that silence though everywhere dead silence he went back through the dining room to the kitchen and hadnt gone a step into it when he saw the womans body lying on its side a gun on the floor by her head crossing to her in several long strides he avoided the pool of drying blood and knelt by her for a second he saw the source of the blood a hole in the scalp low and behind the right ear although there was no doubt he touched the cold skin of her neck then pulled out his gun and started to check the rest of the house two minutes later he walked to a wall phone upstairs in the master bedroom and punched in the number he knew best the crime scene investigation team had already been working the house for an hour and now its sergeant jack langtry was walking across the front lawn to where glitsky stood with a small knot of medical examiners people and police the sun was out but it hadnt warmed appreciably everyone standing around had their hands in their pockets langtry hailed originally from australia and was normally a hearty rugbytype guy in his late thirties today his face looked somehow crooked and blotchy and he seemed to lurch from side to side as he walked almost as if he were drunk glitsky separated himself from the general and subdued mass and met him in the middle of the lawn langtry let out some air and squeezed at his temples with one hand he kicked at the ground raised his eyes looked out at the horizon you know one of the things i loved most about this country when i first came here no restrictions on who can own guns but i think im getting to the point where im changing my mind you put guns in a house with distraught peopleive just seen this too bloody often stupid sods glitsky thought he understood what langtry was implying but this wasnt a time for guessing he wanted to be clear on the crime scene investigation units position what do you think happened in there jack langtry scratched under the collar of his shirt looked again at the bright blue sky when his eyes got back to glitsky he was back in professional mode it was markhams gun we found the registration in the same drawer where he probably kept it in his office off the kitchen it was right by her hand all right it was his gun in her hand whats that mean by itself i dont know for sure the lab might tell us something we dont know other than what other than what it seems like glitsky took a beat we playing twenty questions here jack or what you were asking them abe you want to know what i think we can go straight to there she did them all then killed herself carla was that her name yeah she killed her kids too langtry seemed to get a little defensive you telling me youve never seen it ive seen it a lot jack maybe just not like this not like what but glitsky discovered he couldnt quite put his finger on what nagged at him about this theory i dont know jack maybe im whistling through my hat faro come up with anything faro was lennard faro the crime scene lab technician langtry nodded hes still in there you can talk to him you wanted my take its probably what it looks like unless you know something i dont it was a question and glitsky shook his head just why why the whole family but this wasnt a hard one for langtry her husband died yesterday right thats what i heard yeah hit and run and maybe they were having problems before that i dont know did you hear that someplace no but its the profile you know as well as me maybe not glitsky replied though he thought he did tell me langtry squinted into the sky again organizing his thoughts the worlds too horrible to live in theres too much pain and it all means nothing anyway so shes sparing them from that doing them a favor maybe glitsky knew that this was the standard reading in his career hed seen distraught women kill their families before hed read or heard about several others it was always difficult to imagine or accept but in his experience those eventsterrible though they had beenhad a different quality to them a more immediate and somehow more painful impetus than the simple death of the husband he rememberedyears ago nowa family of five whod escaped from vietnam the oldest boy a young teenager had died on the boat coming over and then a few months after theyd arrived they were packed into a onebedroom place and one of the chinatown gangs broke in took some stuff and thenpossibly angry that the family didnt have more stuff to stealshot the husband dead the next day the mother had suffocated the two young kids then cut her own wrists hed seen another young woman in a socalled burning bed case her boyfriend had been beating her and finally she shot him in his sleep then did the same with her baby and herself about two years ago a clinically depressed suicidal woman named gerry patecikfor some reason he remembered her nameoverdosed herself and two out of her three kids with barbiturates in milk shakes after her husband walked out and filed for divorce so glitsky had seen itthe bare fact of murdersuicide wasnt unknown or even terribly uncommon given its heinous nature but all the other cases hed seen or heard about had a certain overtheedge quality that seemed to be missing here and hed never before seen or heard of teenage victimstheyd always been younger children this was an apparently comfortable family whod simply lost their father tragic yesbut could carla markham have been that close to the kind of complete and utter despair that would seem to be in evidence and still entertain a reasonable crowd here the night before it was hard to imagine goddamnit abe langtry suddenly said he turned back toward the house as though looking to it for some answers goddamn stupid stupid stupid glitsky hated the profanity but he empathized with langtrys fury four people were dead in the house the woman and her three teenage children shot in their beds upstairs with the death of tim markham yesterday this made an entire family wiped out in twentyfour hours i hear you jack he said you got anything else i need to know nah its all peaceful as a bloody tomb in there it is a bloody tomb christ at that moment a woman from the csi team appeared in the doorway carrying the rag doll body of the markhams dog a large and beautiful golden retriever glitsky watched as sagging under the weight she crossed the flagstone stoop langtry took a step toward her said carol and got stopped by her glare crying silently she didnt want any help at the curb she placed the lifeless form in the back of one of the ambulances still parked there then walked over to one of the patrol cars and sat down inside closing the door behind her glitsky laid a quick fraternal hand on langtrys shoulder as he passed him then went up across the lawn and through the front door inside he found lennard faro the crime scene lab specialist standing by the sink in the kitchen dark and wiry with a thin mustache and a tiny gold cross in his earlobe he had his arms and legs crossed in an attitude of casual impatience the photographer was taking pictures and he seemed to be waiting until he finished up glitsky stopped for a second at the entrance to the kitchen took another glance at mrs markhams body then joined faro at the sink jack langtry tells me she shot the gun he said faro turned his head sideways maybe there it is close enough the gun lay on the floor about a foot from carlas right hand she righthanded glitsky asked a mirthless chuckle youll have to ask her glitsky thought he deserved that why dont you tell me what you know keep me from asking more stupid questions faro took a beat then straightened up you mind if we get out of here the view pales after an hour or two he crossed the kitchen back out to the grand dining room then into the foyer where the front door was still open fresh air coming in okay the guns a twentytwo revolver holds six slugs although weve recovered only five casings which fits as i see it she started upstairs with her son why do you say that its the only one she tried to silence the shot was through the pillow okay then what faro pointed upstairs the dining room was expansive and open its ceiling over twenty feet high with a large skylight at the roof midway up around the sides of the room a banister marked the walkway to the rooms on the second story the next room over at the end faro said is where the girls slept twins it looks like she went in there next no point in trying to silence the first shot so she probably just did it quick then went downstairs and killed herself faro corrected him the dog first suddenly the niggling detail he couldnt place earlier when hed been talking with langtry struck glitsky even if carla markham thought the world too cruel for herself and her children why would she shoot her dog certainly not to spare it the pain of going on much more typical would have been a note leaving the pet in the care of a relative or close friend sir faro asked did you say something just talking to myself len how about her own wound back of the ear right side which fits again but no exit wound so i cant hypothesize about the trajectory strout ought to get all that im sure he will abe said but let me ask you this len youre going with jack on murdersuicide i take it but the analyst shook his head were not done here by a long shot sir i dont see anything that rules it out lets put it like that it looks like she fired the gun no sign of any struggle anywhere he raised his shoulders let them down but i dont know you got a better idea ill look anyplace you want i dont know if its a better idea glitsky said but id ask strout to doublecheck for the trajectory and find out if she was righthanded with his own right hand glitsky pointed to a spot at the back of his right ear it seems a little awkward dont you think harlen fisk had been dispatched out from downtown and had joined his partner here at the house where glitsky had assigned to them the task of interviewing anita tong now the lieutenant joined the three of them who had gathered around the table in the breakfast nook the maid was still visibly shaken when glitsky had first come outside after discovering the bodies shed all but collapsed onto the stoop upon hearing the news which had seemed incomprehensible to her for the first several minutes she kept returning to the same questions then arguing with the answers what did he mean dead glitsky must have been wrong he didnt mean that they were all dead did he they couldnt all be dead that wouldnt be possible not ian at seventeen the eldest child he was too big too strong and competent almost a man now certainly he would have heard someone coming into his room and woken up wouldnt he was glitsky sure he saw both of the girls chloe and siggy maybe he hadnt he might want to go back up and check again someone could still be alive anita tong was a petite and wellspoken woman shed been part of the markhams household for seven and a half years they were her only employers she lived a couple of miles south in the sunset district and worked in the house five days a weekmondays and tuesdays offfrom am until pm now pulling up a chair glitsky straddled it backward he picked up on ms tongs story as she was telling the inspectors that shed offered to stay on for the nighthe assumed she meant last nightand thank god she hadnt but carlamrs markhamsaid she and the kids could handle things i should go they didnt expect many more people how many were there when you left bracco asked ms tong considered a moment her coffee group mostly which is six other women they meet every friday morning i think when they heard about mr markhamanyway they brought some casseroles and things like that so i thought she might have wanted me to stay and heat them up and serve them but no fisk was nodding as though this was all somehow relevant bracco was taking notes on a yellow legal pad at least glitsky noted with some surprise and relief his new guys had put a tape recorder on the table but he could see how they hadnt gotten very far if all of tongs answers had gone this way he decided to speak up keep things on point maybe give a little instruction while he was at it so ms tong he said gently what time did you wind up leaving mrs tong she corrected him a little before seven and there were only mrs markham and her six friends in the house when you left nobody else she turned to face him well the kids and a couple of their friends too ians really not the girls two of them i think so teenagers they sat in here two of ians friends then glitsky said do you know their names one was joel burrill hes here all the time the other one i think mark but she shook her head how about the names of the coffee group women glitsky asked this was more promising and mrs tong brightened up slightly well theres ruth fitzpatrick i know and jamie rath oh her daughter lexi was here too shes in siggy and chloes grade jamie lives right around the corner i could show you glitsky made a little writing motion signaling bracco that he should be jotting down these names to mrs tong he continued that would be good when were finished here if you dont mind now as to the rest of the guests was anyone else here when you left or just the coffee group and ians friends and siggy and chloes classmate well of course mr markhams assistant was here the whole time brendan just crying and crying worse than mrs markham sometimes then there was frank husic next door hes a very nice man he heard about mr markham on the radio and came right over to see if there was any way he could help mrs tong closed her eyes for a moment then nodded to herself thats all when i was still here after that i dont know so you didnt see dr kensing glitsky asked mrs tongs expression was instructive she reacted visibly with recognition and glitsky thought shock dr kensing coming here surprises you it took her a moment to phrase one syllable well she stopped the inspectors waited finally she shrugged yes i guess she said and why is that mrs tong was starting to close up she drew her head down slightly between her shoulders glitsky kept at her did you know dr kensing mrs tong was he a friend of the family not exactly a friend no i didnt know him but the namethe name is familiar glitsky hadnt moved his chair but he somehow seemed to have gotten closer to her and you wouldnt have expected him to come by why is that before mrs tong could frame an answer one of the inspectors interrupted bracco eager to show off what hed learned pumped in he was on call at the icu when markham died he probably felt he should glitskys gaze would have frozen flame he turned mildly though back to his subject mrs tong im sorry what were you going to say why you wouldnt have expected dr kensing to come and visit i just shed picked up the tension between glitsky and his inspectors and it didnt increase her comfort level i dont know she said finally in some ways glitsky knew this interview and their interruptions might someday prove instructive to fisk and bracco but it wasnt any solace at the moment as a willing and cooperative witness was clamming up before his eyes because he couldnt establish a rhythm which was halfway to rapport but he wasnt through trying yet shed opened a different door a crack and maybe he could get her to open that one all right he said but you did say that dr kensing wasnt exactly a friend i believe those were your words didnt you say that i think so yes could you tell us what you meant by that he threw another apparently benign look at his rookies but it delivered the message loud and clear shut up and let her answer well he worked for mr markham so you meant he wasnt exactly a friend because he was more an employee when she appeared to be considering that glitsky clarified it further as opposed to not exactly being a friend because he was more an enemy they waited and this time mrs tongs check around the table revealed a universal and hopeful expectation that prompted a more open response his name came up sometimes she began with carla and her friends i couldnt help but hear serving them you know actually not so much his name as his wifes suddenly another thought struck her though should i be saying any of this do i need to have a lawyer with me glitsky put his finger in that dike immediately i dont think so maam you havent done anything wrong youre not in any trouble having said that he came right back at her hoping a new question would trump the lawyer issue why did dr kensings wife come up at this coffee group she talked about divorcing him the antecedents hung in the air in an unidentifiable jumble dr kensings wife glitsky asked was divorcing him no mrs tong shook her head impatiently carla mrs kensing wasi think everybody knows thismr markham had an affair with her fisk brought his baby face forward it was alight with excitement and possibility with dr kensings wife he asked avidly no glitsky wanted to say with his deepest sarcasm with the golden retriever but he bit it back one more time though and he really was going to have to tell them to leave he kept his own voice uninflected are you saying that dr kensings wife ann okay ann she and mr markham were having an affair you mean it wasnt over it was supposed to be when it all blew up when was that about five or six months ago just before thanksgiving thats when carla found out she kicked him out for a couple of weeks then i didnt think he was ever coming back but he did she asked him back if it were me i dont think id have forgivenwell but thats me but mr markham did come back mrs tong nodded swearing it was over of course but it wasnt i dont know now a shrug carla wasnt sure i dont think but she thoughtshe told the coffee group she was getting a private investigator and if he was seeing her again she was leaving him a silence settled for a long moment after which mrs tong turned to glitsky and picked up the thread so when i heard dr kensing had been here last night youre right i was surprised feigning a nonchalance he didnt feel glitsky leaned back and folded his arms over his chest the information about ann kensing and tim markham made him reconsider two contradictory possibilities first that mrs markham might have been depressed for a long while before last night which would strengthen the argument for murder suicide but second here was an apparent possible motive for a murder he would consider each more carefully when he got some time but for now he had one more line of questioning for the maid as far as you know mrs tong did dr kensing know about the relationship between mr markham and his wife i think so yes when carla heard that they were getting divorced kensing and ann theyre divorced now too over this i dont know if its final yet but i understood that theyd separated at least when carla heard theyd started the proceedings she tried to make sure mr markham wouldnt get named in any of the papers so dr kensing he must have known dont you think dismas hardy was standing on the sidewalk on irving street talking with another lawyer named wes farrell the two men had only met once or twice before but the most recent time had been at glitskys wedding last september where theyd independently and then together explored the limits of human tolerance for champagne it was it turned out for both of them pretty high last night frannie had eventually shown up at the shamrock and she and hardy had gone on their datechinese food at the purple yet wah when they got home he couldnt get mcguires story about shane mackey out of his head this morning hed called around and discovered that mackeys family had indeed hired an attorneyfarrellto explore malpractice issues surrounding his death after all the medical talk recently then tim markhams death yesterday he was curious to know more farrell would be a good source of information he could also he knew be a hell of a good time so when wes got to his office at a little after hardy was standing outside on the sidewalk holding a bottle of bubbly with a ribbon around it farrell greeted him like a longlost brother but then seeing the offering backed away in mock horror i dont think ive had a sip of that stuff since abes wedding which is okay since i had about a years worth that day if i recall which im not sure i do its like riding a horse hardy said youve got to get right back on after it bucks you off churchill drank it every day you know for breakfast and he won the nobel prize for champagne drinking hardy shook his head peace i think no wait a minute maybe literature it would have been good if it was peace farrell turned to let hardy in past him i love how they wind up giving the peace prize to these worldclass warriors henry kissinger le duc tho yasser arafat churchill would have fit right in these guys arent exactly gandhi you know statesmen hardy said if youre a statesman you can kill as many people as you want as long as youre in a war and then when you stop everybody in sweden is so grateful they give you the peace prize except for the fact that sweden doesnt give the peace prize it doesnt who does norway when did that start pretty early on i think all the other nobels come from sweden but norway gives the peace prize dont ask me why theyre probably better statesmen hardy said i could be a statesman farrell said id like to kill lots of people he was sitting now rearranging the pens on his blotter maybe then i could defend myself which would mean i had a client hardy sat back and crossed an ankle over his knee things a little slow lately farrell waved a hand vaguely at their surroundings barely worth opening the office every day he sighed if i didnt care so much about a couple of my clients the mackeys for example farrells shoulders fell he wagged his head back and forth a couple of times in despair then looked up through bassett eyes dont tell me they came to you hardy barked a note of laughter then checked it losing business wasnt a laughing matter no he said i promise im not stealing your clients wes but it is about the mackeys what about them besides that theyve not only lost a son but are screwed to boot screwed how because our great supreme court recently ruled as you may have heard that individuals cant sue their hmos for medical malpractice because they dont practice medicine theyre business entities not medical entities he spread his palms lifted then dropped them in frustration unfortunately diz this rejects more or less exactly the argument id filed in behalf of the mackeys and my other five clients and master of timing that i am i hitched my wagon pretty much fulltime to this issue figuring it was the wave of the future anyway so now ive got to rewrite all the pleading on some new cause of action failure to coordinate care general negligence the admin of the plan caused the pi like that but meanwhile theres no billings all the way back in his chair hardy sat with his arms crossed halfway enjoying the rave he knew the realities of billing if you couldnt handle them you didnt belong in the business so what happened with shane shane is like textbook farrell shot up and went to his file cabinet from which he pulled a thick folder look at this check this out hardy stood and came over to the desk farrell had the medical records of everything that moses mcguire had described in the shamrock the previous night but they went over it in a lot more detail and with a final twist that made shane mackeys death even more tragic one of shanes doctors suggested that he might possibly have something that could respond to a new treatment being performed at cedarssinai in la but shanes hmo had determined that this treatment was experimental so they would not cover him which meant the cost to shane would be about three hundred thousand dollars out of pocket and after months of agony trying to decide if he should incur the cost he went for it he and his parents sold their houses basically cashed out and he went down to la where guess what he died hardy said soberly he died farrell repeated but ive got a witness down there who says that if he would have come in three months earlier they might have saved him hardy whistled if hes credible that could be worth a lot of money for you yeah but its not coming in tomorrow let me tell you farrell closed the folder anyway the bad part for me is that its all omission very hard to prove stuff somebody might have or should have done but didnt because parnassus doesnt allow hardy straightened up nearly jumped at the word parnassus thats the group here were talking about a nod sure shane worked for the city so they covered him and what about your other clients were they with parnassus too sure theyre the biggest show in town after all and with these other clients somebody died every time yep were they all omission cases like with shane not all there was one little girlsusan magers she was allergic to sulfa drugs and the doctor she saw forgot to ask i mean can you believe that youd think theyd have allergies flagged in the computer when they call the patients name up but they elected not to load that software about five years ago save a few bucks he shook his head in disgust but let me ask you diz if you dont have a client whats your interest in all this hardy sat on the corner of the desk im not sure to tell you the truth i heard about shane just last night and got to wondering if his fiancee or his family needed any help which brought me to you but when i hear its all parnassus whats all parnassus hardy frowned reluctant by habit to disclose information hed been given in relative confidence instead he temporized the names just been coming up a lot lately you heard about tim markham didnt you what about him hardy looked a questionwas wes putting him onbut apparently not he got killed yesterday hit and run youre kidding me farrells face went slack ive really got to start watching some nighttime television reading the paper something when did it happen yesterday morning they got him over to portola where he died god in his own hospital i love it they must be shitting over there farrell broke a smile maybe i could call his wife and see if she wants to sue them wouldnt that be sweet sue who portola parnassus the usual suspects except that they didnt kill him wes he got hit by a car farrell sat forward still grinning his elbows on his desk listen to me diz did you know tim markham well i did he gets admitted to a hospital filled with the doctors hes been screwing for fifteen years hes not getting out alive no matter what i guarantee it hardy was smiling too its a good theory wes but i dont think it happened farrell pointed a finger you wait he said hardy sometimes wondered why he had a downtown office hed stopped in for an hour after seeing farrell then he and freeman had eaten a long lunch in belden alley at a little after three oclock he had finally settled into the brief he was writing when he was interrupted by a call from his friend pico morales who didnt want to bother him but it was an emergency having to do with one of his friends he needed a criminal lawyer could hardy please come down to the steinhart aquarium and talk to him the guy pico said was one of his walkers hardy knew what that meant when pico went on to say that the friend was a doctor named kensing with parnassus that clinched it hardy was going for another drive back to the avenues as the curator of the steinhart picos longstanding ambition was to acquire a great white shark for the aquarium in golden gate park four six nine times a year some boat would haul up a shark and pico would call his list of volunteers a lifetime ago hardy had been one of the first he would let himself in to the tanks in the bowels of the aquarium where his mind a blank hed don a wetsuit and walk a shark for hours round and round in the circular tank in theory the walking would keep water moving through the animals gills until they could breathe on their own it had never worked yet halfhidden by shrubbery the back entrance was all the way around behind the aquarium down six concrete steps in the dim hallway someone had left on a small industrial light hardy pushed at the wired glass door which opened at his touch after all the years that had passed since hed last been here he was surprised at how familiar the place felt the same green walls still sweated with it seemed the same humidity the low concrete ceiling made him want to keep his head down although he knew he had clearance he heard muffled voices sounding as if they came from the inside of an oil drum his footfalls echoed too and he became aware of the constant almost inaudible hummaybe generators or pumps for the tanks hardy had never really learned what caused it the hall curved left then straightened then curved again right at last it opened into a round chamber dominated by a large aboveground pool filled with seawater against the side of which leaned the substantial bulk of pico morales under an unruly mop of black hair picos face was a weathered slab of dark granite marginally softened by a large drooping mustache and gentle eyes he held an oversize chipped coffee mug and wore the bottoms of a wetsuit stretched to its limit by his protruding bare stomach in the tank itself a man in a wetsuit was dealing with the shark one of the largest hardy had seen hereover six feet long its dorsal fin protruded from the waters surface and its tail fanned the water behind him but hardy had pretty well used up his fascination with sharks over the years the man who was walking the shark however was another matter ah pico said in greeting the cavalry arrives diz dr eric kensing the man in the tank looked up and nodded he was still working hard and nearly grunting with the exertion step by laborious step nevertheless he was close to the edge of the tank himself and he nodded youre hardy he asked id shake hands but then more seriously thanks for coming hey when pico calls he says youre in trouble not yet maybe but at that moment as hardy and pico watched the fish twitched and broke himself free from the mans grip and he swore then turned to go after it let it go pico snapped the man turned back toward the side but paused for another look behind him it was only an instant but in that time the shark had crossed the tank turned and was heading back toward him picking up speed pico never took his eyes off the shark and didnt miss the move get out now look out kensing lunged for the side of the pool hardy and pico had him each by an arm and hoisted him up over and out just as the shark breached and took a snap at where hed been offhand hardy said im thinking thats a healthy fish hungry too kensing said maybe he thought pico was a walrus hardy nodded deadpan and thoughtful honest mistake they were all standing at the edge of the tank watching the shark swimming on its own pico kept his eyes on the water on the swimming fish hed had his hopes raised around the survival of one of his sharks before and didnt want to have them dashed again you guys need to talk anyway why dont you get out of here the little shamrock was less than a quarter mile from the aquarium after the doctor had gotten into street clothes they left pico to his shark still swimming on his own hardy drove the few hundred yards through a rapidly darkening afternoon now they had gotten something to drinkhardy a black and tan and kensing a plain coffeeand sat kittycorner in front of the fire on some battered sunken couches more suited to making out than strategizing legal defense so hardy began howd you get with pico a shrug a sip of coffee his son is one of my patients we got to talking about what he did and eventually he told me about his sharks i thought it sounded like a cool thing to do he invited me down one night and now when i really cant spare the time i still come when summoned how about you i heard you used to volunteer too i didnt think pico allowed people to quit i got a special dispensation the answer seemed inadequate so he added i got so i couldnt stand it when they all died a bitter chuckle dont go into medicine no hardy agreed i figured that one out a long time ago he killed a moment sipping his pint but rumor has it you need a lawyer now for the first time hardy noticed a pallor under the ruddy complexion the fatigue in the eyes you know who tim markham is hardy nodded he got hit by a car yesterday then died in the hospital thats right i was staff physician at the icu when he died and he was fucking my wife so youre worried that the police might think you got an unexpected opportunity and killed him i dont think thats impossible but you didnt kensing held hardys gaze no were you tempted trying to lighten things up he almost broke a smile i used to fantasize about it all the time except in my version it was always much more painful first id break his kneecaps maybe slash an achilles tendon cut his balls off anything that would make him suffer more than he did he shook his head in disappointment there really is no justice you know that hardy thought he maybe knew it better than dr kensing but justice or no he said youre worried it wasnt a question he nodded somberly if the police start asking about tim i can just hear me yeah i hated him youd hate him too im glad hes dead i dont think so hardy didnt think so either but all of this was really moot let me put your mind to rest a little its my understanding that markham died from his injuries and if thats the case youre not involved in any crime what if somebody says i didnt do enough to save him is there such a thing as malicious malpractice or something like that as a homicide issue hardy shook his head ive never heard of it why because some homicide inspector named bracco came by yesterday and theyre doing the autopsy today i wouldnt worry about that they autopsy everybody no they dont especially if you die in the icu after surgery we did a pm at the hospital and i signed off on the death certificatemassive internal trauma from blunt force injurybut they hauled him off downtown anyway he died of a hit and run hardy explained thats a homicide so they do an autopsy every time but the doctor had another question okay but last night i met bracco checking out my car at markhams place bracco hardy shook his head perplexed you sure hes san francisco homicide not hit and run i dont know him thats what he said he had a badge and he was checking out your car why were you at markhams house anyway i knew carla his wife i thought it would be appropriate to go by and give my condolences to see if there was anything i could do he let out a sigh you cant help it you feel somehow responsible so what was this cop doing with your car staring around the bar as though wondering how he got there kensing considered a moment then came back to hardy i think he was checking to see if it looked like my car had been in an accident if id hit markham there were some other people there too before i left visiting with carla other cars i got the impression he had checked every one of them this seemed unlikely on its face but then hardy flashed back to the talk hed had with glitsky during their latest walk the car police this bracco must have been one of the new clowns that was taking so much abuse in the homicide detail well in any event from what im hearing it doesnt sound like youve got any real problem here you didnt kill him but he died under my supervision and it wasnt any secret i hated him so one more time did you kill him no he died of his injuries right did you make them worse no so look youre fine clearly the message still wasnt getting all the way through so hardy continued let me ask you this what were the odds markham was going to die even if you did everything right which i did granted but not the question the doctor gave it some real thought statistically once youre in the icu only maybe two in ten get out alive truly surprised by the figure hardy sat back on the couch thats all two in ten kensing shrugged maybe three i dont know the exact number but its not as high as most people think so the odds are at best youd say thirty percent that markham would have survived even if you did everything that could have been done which i did but yes roughly thirty percent so that leaves it as a seventy percent chance that the hit and run would have killed him no matter what any doctor did or didnt do am i right hardy came forward on the couch heres the good news even if you made a mistakenot saying you did rememberwhoever ran him down cant use malpractice as a defense in his trial someone charged with homicide is specifically excluded from using the defense that the doctor could have saved the victim kensings eyes briefly showed some life youd think i would have heard that before why is that because if it wasnt every lawyer in the world would begin his defense by saying that it wasnt his client shooting his wife four times in the heart that killed her it was the doctors who couldnt save her it was their fault not his clients kensing accepted this information with it seemed a mixture of relief and disbelief but there wasnt any malpractice here he spoke matteroffactly really he added i believe you im just saying i cant see where youve got any kind of criminal charge looking at you what put markham there in the first place was someone running him down in a car thats who this guy braccos looking for the driver of the car but an earlier phrase that had nagged suddenly surfaced did you say you knew mrs markham kensings shoulders slumped visibly as the world seemed to settle on him he looked down at the scarred hardwood floor then back up you dont know thats the other thing hardy waited apparently something happened last night he paused shes dead and the rest of her family too lord hardy suddenly felt pinned to the sofa kensing continued it went around the offices sometime late this morning i was seeing patients and didnt hear until about noon then a little after that bracco called to make sure id be around he wanted to come by and talk about it so you talked to him today too kensing shook his head it might have been a mistake but i had my receptionist tell him i wasnt in pico called about the same time with his shark i dont see patients wednesday afternoon anyway and i didnt want to talk to the police until i could sort some of this out so i came over here to the aquarium and essentially hid out walking francis francis the shark pico named it francis so i just hung out until id come up with a plan which was get a lawyer and pico knew you he made a face apologetic and confused so here we are and now what hardy nodded and sat back remembering his pint he reached for it and took a drink well youre going to talk to the police whether you want to or not so what do i tell them about my wife if they ask hardy had already answered that but this was the beginning of handholding time id just tell the truth and try not to panic but if they look at all theyll know about markham and your wife right so be straightforward and deal with it it doesnt mean you killed anybody kensing let the reality sink in okay its not going to matter if theyre looking for the driver of the hitandrun car anyway right thats how i see it hardy looked across into kensings face his eyes were hollow with fatigue are you all right he managed a weak chuckle im just tired but then again im always tired he said ive been tired for fifteen years if i wasnt exhausted beyond human endurance i wouldnt recognize myself hardy leaned back into the couch and realized he wasnt exactly in the mood for dancing himself but still youre out on your afternoon off walking sharks for pico yeah i know kensing said it doesnt make any sense to me either i just do it that was me too hardy had walked his own sharks at the low point of his life at the end of a decade of sleepwalk following the death of his son michael his divorce from jane it made no more sense to him then than it did to kensing now but for some reason walking his sharks had seemed to mean something and in a world otherwise full of nothing that was something to cling to both men stood up hardy gave kensing his card and along with it a last bit of advice you know they might just show up at work or your house they might knock on your door with a warrant or a subpoena if any of that happens say nothing dont let them intimidate you you get the phone call kensings mouth dropped a fraction of an inch he blew out heavily shaking his head this is starting to sound like serious hardball no hardballs a game hardy might be all for client reassurance but he didnt want kensing to remain under the illusion that any part of a homicide investigation was going to be casual but from what ive heard were okay you werent driving the car and thats what killed him his wife has nothing to do with you right right so the main thing is tell the truth except leave out the part about the kneecaps john strout worked through his lunchtime conducting the autopsy on tim markham the damage done to the body from its encounter with the hitandrun vehicle and then the garbage can was substantial the skull was fractured in two places and multiple lacerations scored what the medical examiner thought might have been an unusually handsome face in lifea broad brow a strong jawline with a cleft chin markham had been struck on the back left hip bone which broke on the impact along with its attached femur apparently the body snapped back for an instant against the cars hood or windshield and this might have accounted for one of the skull fractures the other probably occurred strout surmised when the body ended its short flight the right shoulder had come out of its socket and three ribs on the right side were broken among the internal organs besides the digestive tract only the heart the left lobe of the lung and the left kidney escaped injury the right lung had collapsed and the spleen liver and right kidney had all been damaged to greater or lesser degrees strout with forty years of medical experience was of the opinion that it was some kind of miracle that markham had survived to make it to the emergency room he thought that blood loss or any number of the internal injuries or the shock of so many of them at once should have been enough by themselves to cause death but strout was a methodical and careful man even if tim markham hadnt been an important person the medical examiner wasnt putting his signature on any formal document until he was satisfied that hed as precisely as humanly possible identified the principal cause of death to that end he had ordered the standard battery of tests on blood and tissue samples while he waited for those results he began a more rigorous secondary examination of the injuries to the internal organs a particularly impressive hematoma on the back of the liver was commanding his complete attention but he was subliminally aware of his assistant joyce making her way back through the length of the morgue when she stopped next to him and hovered he continued with his examination for a moment then drawled this here coulda done it by its lone self then looking up and seeing her expression of worried concern he pulled away from his work is something wrong darlin joyce was new to the staff but not as new as the equipment theyd recently bought to upgrade the lab for the past few days strout had been supervising joyce as she conducted tests to calibrate these machines which ran sophisticated scans on blood and tissues since he had tim markhams body on the slab this afternoon hed given joyce samples from his body now she appeared extremely nervous and for a moment strout thought she must have broken one of the expensive new toys whatever it is it cant be that bad he told her whats the problem she held up a slip of paper the results from the lab tests shed been running i dont think i could have done this test right i mean the machine she let the thought hang strout took the paper and squinted at the numbers saw what she was showing him and pulled off his sanitary gloves that the right number thats what i wanted to ask you could that be right i ran it twice and i think i must have done something wrong his eyes went to her face then back to the paper which he now took in his hand and studied with great care this is from mr markhams blood yes sir dang he whispered mostly to himself from the morgue strout walked down the outside corridor that connected his office with the back door of the hall of justice a biting afternoon breeze had come up but he barely noted it after passing through the guards and the metal detector he decided to bypass the elevators instead he turned directly right to the stairs which he took two at a time glitsky wasnt in his office as was the norm in the middle of the day there were only a couple of inspectors pulling duty in the detail and neither had seen the lieutenant all day strout hesitated a second asked the inspectors to have abe call him when he got in then turned on his heel and hit the stairway again one floor down he got admitted to the das sanctumhell hed come all this way he wanted to talk to somebodyand in another minute was standing in front of treya ghents desk asking if clarence jackman was available in his room next door somethin pretty interestin had come up but even before she answered her look told him he guessed it wasnt going to be his lucky day hes been at meetings all morning john and then scheduled at other ones all afternoon thats what das really do you know they dont do law they go to meetings strout considered ms ghentor was it mrs glitskya very handsome darkskinned mulatto woman with a few drops of asian or indian blood mixed in somewhere and now she smiled at him helpfully is there anything i can do for you he thought a minute do you know where abes got to she shook her head no he left the house this morning with one of his inspectors i havent heard from him since why although she knew the answer to that strout wanted to see her husband because he was head of homicide there was no doubt that the somethin pretty interestin hed referred to wasnt a hot stock tip the lanky gentleman sighed then sidestepped and after asking her permission let himself down onto the waiting chair by the side of the door got to catch my breath a little i came up by the stairs which at my age aint always recommended it must have been important treya said she hoped with some subtlety not that strout needed the prompt he was fairly itching to get it out you recall the discussion we all had the other day over to lous about the parnassus group of course she did mr jackman was still mulling over his options well you just watch its goin to get a lot more interestin in a new york minute in a few sentences strout had brought her to the crux of it when hed finished she said potassium what does that mean it means the hitandrun car didnt kill him tho he mighta died from those injuries eventually if theyd just left him alone but they didnt it couldnt have been an accident somebody grabbing the wrong needle he shrugged anythings possible i spose but on purpose or not he got loaded up full of potassium and the thing is that can look pretty natural even if someone does an autopsy so im thinkin you might know where your husband might be hes goin to want to know when jackman got the news about the potassium he asked treya to patch abe in his car and have him come to his office as soon as he arrived back downtown then hed called marlene ash and john strout both of whom had replied to the summons and were here now too it was and the freshening afternoon breeze had transformed itself into a freezing gale the howl of which was easily audible even in the almost hermetically sealed das office as jackman stood at his office window looking down at the stillcongested traffic below him on bryant street the first large drops of rain flung with great force seemed to explode onto the glass in front of him unconsciously he backed a step away he was aware of the hum of urgent shoptalk behind him the discovery about the potassium had been extraordinary enough but when glitsky had finally responded to treyas call and told her where hed been all day and what had happened to the markham family a sense of impending crisis seemed to wash through the hall of justice like a tsunami at almost the same moment that abe told treya about the markham family word of the tragedy hit the streets and the calls started coming in to jackmans office from all quartersnewspapers television radio the mayors office the board of supervisors the chief of police just as jackman turned away from the window glitsky appeared in his doorway abe good come on in the lieutenant touched treyas arm nodded around the room jackman sat on the front of his desk facing them and wasted no time on preliminaries so we got a whole prominent family dead in a twelvehour period the mans company has the citys contract for health care and its damn near broke im predicting media madness short term and long term god knows what chaos if parnassus cant recover anybody disagree with me he knew nobody would and he clearly expected the same unanimity with his next question does anybody here have any ideas about how were going to characterize these developments im going to need some good answers when people start asking the scar through glitskys frown was pronounced he cleared his throat we say were looking into it no further comment i thought that would be your position its the only position clarence glitsky still slightly shellshocked from his day at markhams home didnt know where the da was going with this meeting why it was being held at all its also the truth he added as far as it goes yes it is but im thinking we might want to help people decide how they want to think about this all of it i think we want to say right up front that tim markham was murdered glitsky glanced at the faces around the room at this point the conversation seemed to be about him and jackman do we know he was murdered we know what happened abe marlene interjected its obvious i hate obvious glitsky replied evenly couldnt it have been an accidental overdose was he on potassium anyway for some reason he faced strout couldnt somebody have just made a mistake in the hospital the coroner nodded couldve happened but jackman didnt like that answer and he snorted then whyd the wife kill herself who said she killed herself glitsky asked thats the preliminary report i heard jackman said you know why they call it preliminary clarence because its not final it might not be true we really dont know anything yet about the wife and kids that whole situation sergeant langtry told me it was clearly a murdersuicide abe just like many hed seen before and you too isnt that right there might be some similarities but there are also differences its just plain smarter if we dont say anything until we know but jackman was pacing in front of his desk commanding the room with his presence i may know whats plain smarter too abe i may even agree with you but humor me other inquiring minds are going to want to knowthe press the mayors office you can guessand theyre going to ask me im concerned that if we dont say anything it looks like we dont know anything we dont know anything its okay if it looks like that jackman ignored the interruption repeating his earlier statement we know markham was murdered we believe his wife was a suicide i dont know if i believe that at all clarence john here hasnt even done an autopsy on her yet glitsky reined himself in a notch jackman was playing devils advocate he knew but he would hate it if the da committed his office to a public stance when it wasnt necessary it would be more politics messing with his job all im saying is that its possible somebody could have gone to a lot of trouble to make it look like a suicide i know langtry thinks it might be but we havent eliminated any possibilities yet and id be more comfortableyoud be more comfortable clarenceif we could eliminate a few before we start talking to the press jackman frowned youre saying maybe somebody killed her and her family and tried to make it look like a suicide they find anything at her place that supports that not yet no sir but theres still a lot of lab work to be done glitsky pressed on ill go with suicide the minute we can prove it clarence i promise you but for now weve got a theory that looks squirrelly to me which is markham gets to the hospital all banged up nearly dead in fact and somebody decides spur of the moment to take the opportunity and kill him jackman wasnt backing down i honestly believe it will look just precisely like that to some reporter somewhere okay so tell him youve got a problem with that like why take the risk if he was probably going to die anyway jackman went back to strout he wasnt necessarily going to die was he john conjecture wasnt strouts long suit but the da had asked him a direct question and he felt he had to say something maybe not especially once hes out of the er he stopped lifted his shoulders let them drop he could have survived so jackman took strouts answer as a ringing endorsement somebody maybe even his wife maybe even the wife this was new and to glitskys mind completely bizarre youre saying carla killed her husband at the hospital jackman backed off all right maybe not but somebody at the hospital came to the conclusion that markham was going to pull through and for some reason couldnt have that all im saying then clarence is lets find the reason the exchange was threatening to grow heated and treya stepped in maybe there neednt be a rush on the wife clarence you only need to make the point that somebody killed mr markham and i think well all agree treya added quickly turning to her husband that the potassium points much more clearly to a murder than an accident at the hospital wouldnt that be true abe could you agree to that glitsky understood what she was asking him more what she was doing and while now with the potassium overdose glitsky believed it likely that markham had indeed been murdered belief wasnt certainty and never would be okay he said to his wife lets for the moment agree markham was murdered in the hospital so you tell whoever asks that were investigating thats what we do whats the rush to go public from treyas expression glitsky realized that finally hed asked the right question jackman raised himself off his desk just this abe if markham was murdered it goes to the grand jury i can legitimately use an investigation into his death as a way to get into the books and business practices at parnassus weve got every reason to look in his files take the place apart see if we can find out why and whos gonna complain somebody killed their top guy why wouldnt they want to cooperate in every way jackman let his words hang in the air then continued if we begin any kind of inquiry on the billings and their lawyers get into it were talking months maybe years delay on subpoenas delay delivering records that they may have shredded by then anyway or forged new ones plus all the public bickering loss of faith in the citys institutions blah blah blah this way were in its a murder abe and even in this town a solid majority of the voters oppose murder nobody will see it as more complicated than that at least for now the grand jurys looking into the murder of tim markham there is every justification in the world to probe his relationships and even business practices and since he was killed in portola hospital theres a demonstrable link there but glitsky was shifting in his seat again it was a bad idea to get the das office involved in his investigations particularly if markhams murder was just the cover for a financial probe of parnassus what if we find markhams killer before you get finished he asked marlene answered well leave the grand jury impaneled we just keep going on the financial stuff abe frowned at this but he knew that technically marlene could do just that the grand jury was not crime specificjackman and ash could simply use it to go fishing but ill still have your support for the murder investigation as the priority he asked i dont want to get a suspect close to the net and not be able to bring him in that wont happen abe marlene said couldnt happen jackman repeated were on the same team glitsky smiled all around fooling no one well with that assurance he said as he stood up id better get to work part two hardy hit the button shutting off the alarm throwing off the covers he forced himself to sit up lest he give in to the urge to lie back down just for a minute frannie murmured something from behind him and he felt her hand brush against the small of his back reaching around he squeezed it quickly then let go and stood up the house felt dark he stood a minute summoning the will to move outside a fresh gust rattled the windows the storm still blowing after hed showered and shaved he pulled on his pants and a shirt in the bathroom so hed be as unobtrusive as possible he didnt remember distinctly but he must have had a rough nights sleep he still hadnt quite gotten to fully awake frannie hadnt yet stirred eitherhe thought hed go downstairs and bring a cup of coffee up for her that way they would get a few minutes of peace together before the daily marathon of getting the kids off to school in the kitchen he turned on the light and fed his tropical fish the long hallway to the front door seemed especially dark as well but hed already concluded that it was the weather so he didnt give it any more thought when he opened the door he noted with satisfaction that the chronicle had made it up onto the porchby no means a daily occurrence maybe it was a sign he was in for a lucky day but god he thought it was dark hed often expressed his belief that one of the greatest of modern inventions was the automatic coffee machine that began making your critical morning brew about the time that your alarm went off so that when you got to it it was ready for you but when he got back to it he stopped frowning the carafe was empty worse the little green program light was still onwhen it went into run mode the light turned red what was going on he distinctly remembered preparing the coffee last night before hed gone up to bed and now he leaned down squinting and checked the clock turning around he looked up at the large clock on the kitchen wall same time finally he thought to consult his watch and got the third corroboration it was quarter to five on thursday morning and he was wide awake dressed up and nowhere to go and for no particular reason other than that somebody had obviously reset his alarm when he found out which kid it had been there would be hell to pay he had half a mind to wake both kids up now identify the culprit break out the thumb screws but so much for his run of good luck and he still had to wait for his damn coffee to brew with nothing to do now except kill time he angrily opened the paper and threw it down on the dining room table sitting down he noticed that yep it was still dark at least now he knew why then he noticed the headline hmo chiefs death called murder with the subhead about potassium he had all he needed to know although he read the whole article his new client appeared only once as the attending staff physician at the icu but once was enough hardy started to worry the accompanying article on markham s family ratcheted his concern up even further the paper characterized the event in ambiguous terms hinting that the evidence seemed to implicate the wife in murdersuicideanother senseless american tragedy the reason for which might never be known but in his guts hardy felt that markham s death being ruled a murder made any conclusion about the how and why of the familys slaughter decidedly premature when he finished the second article he sat in contemplation for several minutes then he got up and poured a cup of coffee came back to the table and read jeff elliots column citytalk by jeffrey elliot as medical director of parnassus health the beleaguered hmo that is under contract to insure the citys employees dr malachi ross has been under a lot of pressure over the past months from his original and eventually overturned refusal to allow prescriptions of viagra as a covered expense to the much more serious baby emily incident at portola hospital his business decisions have come under almost continuous fire from any number of consumer public interest and watchkeeping organizations including this newspaper now in the wake of the death on tuesday of parnassus ceo tim markham and ross election to that position by the parnassus board it looks as though his real troubles may have only just begun as this column goes to press the chronicle has learned that mr markhams death has been called a murder by police investigators early last week as one of his last official acts mr markham presented the city with a bill in excess of million for previously undiscovered outpatient care at various neighborhood clinics a source at the das office describes the paperwork on these billings as at the least irregular and quite possibly fraudulent at the same time parnassus has applied for a rate increase of per month for every covered city employee which if approved represents an extra hit of nearly a month to the citys budget at the same time the woes of parnassus and of its flagship hospital portola continue to grow in an interview on tuesday evening dr ross admitted that the medical group is mired in a deep cash crisis although he characterized the nonpayment of some parnassus doctors as a voluntary loan program another sourcea doctor within the grouphad a slightly different take sure he said its voluntary you volunteer to loan your salary back to the group or youre fired nevertheless ross remained confident that parnassus can weather this crisis the goal is maximum wellness for the most people he said when asked if he saw any conflict between the groups business interests and the needs of its patients ross replied the company needs to sustain itself so it can continue doing its work because it conducts business with the city parnassus finances are a matter of public record last year the average staff physician with parnassus had a salary of the average executive board member of which there are thirty sustained himself to the tune of nearly including bonuses per person for a total expense to the company of approximately million as ceo the late mr markham had the highest salary in the group million and dr ross was next drawing million in salary and performance bonuses imagine how well hed do if parnassus was not going bankrupt glitsky was in the elevator and when the door opened on the fourth floor he was looking at dismas hardy who said i was just at your office you werent there youre kidding glitsky stepped out into the lobby when just now i wasnt in my office no sign of you one of the things ive always admired about you is that keen eye for detail the two men fell into step together heading back toward the homicide detail whats another one hardy asked another what thing youve always admired about me one implies there are more glitsky glanced over at him walked a few steps shook his head on second thought thats the only one keen eye for detail at homicide inside glitskys office hardy took one of the foldup chairs in front of the desk he looked around critically you could use some art in here he said its a little depressing i like it depressing glitsky said it keeps meetings short speaking of whichhe pointed at his overflowing inboxthat is todays workload and im behind already what can i do for you my keen eye for detail tells me that youre not in much of a sociable mood this morning so ill get right to it i take it bracco is one of your car police that would be accurate he reached for his inbox well drop by anytime its been a real pleasure ive got one more what do you know about tim markham glitsky stopped fiddling with paper cocked his head to one side and frowned who are you representing eric kensing swell when did that happen recently glitsky sat forward in his chair and brushed a hand over his scar as i recall the last time i talked to you about a case at this stage i lost my job for a couple of weeks true but it was the right thing to do a year before glitsky had been put on administrative leave after hed shown hardy a videotape of his clients questionable confession before the das office had cleared it for discovery purposes and you know what davy crockett always said be sure youre right then go ahead i always thought that was the stupidest thing id ever heard the jails are full of people who think like old davy genghis khan i believe had the same motto and a fine leader he was ive just got a couple of quick questions they wont get you fired promise ask one and let me decide and quickly if thats possible though history argues that it isnt is kensing in trouble glitsky nodded in appreciation that was pretty good for you a shrug well no matter where we stand on charging markhams murder im betting your client is one guy whos definitely going to need a lawyer on the malpractice side alone aside from that glitsky threw a glance over to the doorclosed he came back to hardy i suppose he told you hes got a motive he paused then gave it up he was also the last person with the family you mean markhams family the paper implied that it was the distraught wife yeah i read it glitsky sat back i think youve had your question you think it wasnt the wife and if it wasnt it was the same person who did the husband i dont think anything yet im keeping an open mind but if my clients a suspect for markham then hes glitsky stopped him were not talking about this diz youre way over your quota for questions thats it okay this isnt a question i talked to kensing this morning before i even left the house he wants to talk to you sure he does and im the queen of bavaria youre going to let him i told him it was a dumb idea i was even a little adamant but maybe youve heard doctor knows best he figures youll hear his story and leave him alone hes a witness not a suspect is he talking immunity at this stage no nothing like that he didnt do anything wrong hes a witness and the best defense is a good offense hardy shrugged it wasnt his idea he knew glitsky might take it that way but he thought that his job at this point was to mitigate kensings discomfort and arrange the talk on his schedule so how about my office close of business glitsky considered then nodded okay doable and hes a witness not a suspect i believe youve mentioned that a few times though you havent said youre okay with it theres that eye for detail again glitsky said then sitting back he is what he is diz im afraid well just have to see how it plays out after leaving homicide he went down to jackmans office to see if he could come upon any potentially helpful scrap of news regarding his new client it wasnt likely but the da was relatively inexperienced in criminal matters and might inadvertently drop something if he and hardy were simply two friends casually schmoozing at jackmans outer office hardy stopped in the doorway treya on the telephone saying yes sir a lot to someone smiled a greeting and held up a just a sec finger hardy came in walked over and kissed her on the cheek then sat in the chair next to jackmans door treya continued with her proper responses in her modulated professional voice but she rolled her eyes and made faces in the midst of them watching her hardy broke a grin when glitskys first wife had died hardy would never have believed that anyone could have approached flo as an equally compatible mate for his best friend but in a little less than a year treya had won him and frannie over not only competent and confident treyas sense of humor went a long way toward blunting abes razor edge at last she hung up the mayor she explained always wanting my opinions on the issues then a questioning look did you have an appointment is clarence expecting you i dont have you down no im just dropping by seeing if he had a minute to chat i dont think chats on his agenda today he just had me tell hizzoner he wasnt in she smiled sweetly maybe you would like to do it the normal way and schedule something i would but im not sure when ill be back at the hall heres an idea diz you could plan to be others have been known to but clarence and i go way back were pals he feels the same way i just hate to see the spontaneity go out of our relationship treya nodded sympathetically so does clarence he frets about it all the time ill put you down for tomorrow at three you can talk about it then the phone on her desk rang and waving hardy goodbye she picked it up back at his office hardy phoned the aquarium and discovered that francis the shark was still alive and swimming under its own power but pico still wasnt admitting victory he hasnt eaten a damn thing swimmings one thing but hes also got to eat how do you know its a he how do you think i got to be curator here could it be the phd in marine biology the ability to tell males from female fish one of those i always figured it was affirmative action of some kind what are you trying to feed it fish food pico was clearly done with hardys input on the subject can we talk about something else howd it go with eric hardys brow clouded his tone grew serious ive got one for you how well do you know him pretty well hes been our family doc for years we used to be closersocially i meanbefore he and ann broke up why do you think he could kill anybody pico snorted no way a pause you want to hear a story what hes like more than anything if it makes him look good okay you remember when danny first started having his problems sure picos eldest was seventeen now but ten years before hed been diagnosed with leukemia hardy remembered some of the high drama surrounding the diagnosis and treatment which had resulted in bone marrow transplants and ultimately remission was that kensing yeah but what maybe you dont know is that he made the tentative diagnosis long before some board would have approved the treatment he ordered they said it was way too expensive they wanted to wait have him take more tests like that so what did eric do tell me he didnt think we could wait if we waited danny might die so he lied to who the hmo whens the last time you heard about a doctor risking his paycheck to save a patient well eric did he made dannys records appear that the leukemia was more advanced than it was if he was wrong and it cost his hmo big bucks for nothing sorry but if he was right danny lives pico checked his voice back a notch anyway so thats who eric is diz check it out he does this kind of stuff all the time christ he makes house calls he walks my sharks you ask my opinion the guys at the very least a saint if not a certified hero but when hardy hung up a thought nagged at him picos story had a downside kensing might be a saint and a hero but a good crossexaminer could make the point that he had also proven himself capable of a sustained and elaborate fraud he falsified medical records possibly cheating his own employer out of maybe thousands of dollars and if he did it once with danny morales the odds were good that hed done it with many other patients and that at least some of those times the odds were good that hed been wrong david freemans enormous office was panelled in a burnished and ancient dark wood burgundy drapes framed the two windows in the center of which presided the lions clawfooted leathertopped desk most of its fortyeight square feet of surface cluttered with papers files ashtrays inand outboxes paperweights celebrity photos a couple of telephones the fully stocked wet bar also featured a temperaturecontrolled wine cellar anchor steam beer on tap two cigar humidors and an espresso machine a couple of seating areas gave clientsand opposing attorneysa choice between a formal or informal setting on the floor persian rugs on the various pedestals and tables knickknacks from half a century of rich and grateful clients a bufano sculpture of st francis of assisi blessed the room from one corner a selection of original john lennon erotic lithographs added a counternote in a byzantinestyle glass case a selection of alleged murder weapons alleged because their respective owners all got acquitted testified eloquently and mutely to freemans skill in the courtroom the fact that david could acquire them from prosecutors and police after hed won the case was further testament to his popularity hardy crossed a leg over a knee and sipped from the demitasse of espresso then put it back on the arm of the sofa his landlord had brewed himself a cup as well and brought it over to his desk where he blew on it once and engrossed in some paperwork drank it off in a gulp replacing it carefully in the exact center of its little porcelain saucer for another full minute or more freeman didnt look up but turned the pages in front of him occasionally making a note occasionally muttering a phrase or two to himself arguing or agreeing with what he was reading as he watched him work hardy couldnt help but be struck again with the mans almost childish energy and enthusiasm freeman was seventysix years old hed been practicing law for fifty years and though hed seen it all there was still precious little about it that didnt energize him he came into his office every day of the week by about seven oclock and when he didnt go to court which he did as often as possible he stayed at his desk until late dinnertime then often returned for a nightcap or two while he whipped out a quick twenty pages of memos or correspondence it seemed to hardy that the old man had shrunk three or four inches in the eight years theyd been associated and put on fifteen pounds he could almost braid his thin long white hair if he let them grow he could probably do the same with his eyebrows a downright slovenly dresserjuries dont trust good clotheshe favored brown suits many of them picked up in thrift stores whether or not they fit perfectly he never had them pressed he smoked andor chewed cigars constantly and drank at least a bottle of wine himself every day at the office and probably most of another for lunch and then again at dinner he never exercised the skin of his hands and face was mottled with liver spots today he had bloodstains around his collar from where hed cut himself shaving looking at him hardy thought he was the happiest and possibly the healthiest person on the planet and he didnt miss a trick you feeling all right diz getting enough sleep hardy thought hed been looking right at him but he hadnt noticed him look up there was no point in getting into it the mistake with his alarm clock the whole question of children in ones life if hardy started whining freeman would only say you made that bed get over it so hardy left it at postlunch slump is all plus i got up early i hope it was billable freeman said he pointed across to his bar area you want another cup help yourself meanwhile speaking of billable im at your service but talk fast im due in federal court in forty minutes the appeal on latham god bless his wealthy murdering heart so what got you up hardy gave him an abridged version of his meeting with dr kensing and the old man clucked disapprovingly you talked to a new client for more than an hour even de facto took his case a possible murder suspect and the subject of your fees never came up in the world of criminal law you collected your fees up front hardy had experimented a time or two with being less than rigorous on that score and had discovered that the conventional wisdom turned out to be true if you were successful and got your clients off they didnt need a lawyer anymore and why should they pay you on the other hand if you failed and they went to jail why should they pay you for that either so you usually wanted to casually mention the word retainer within about six sensitive minutes after saying hello freeman the kind mentor was merely reminding him this is why my son im afraid youre going to die impoverished and there is really no excuse for a good lawyer to die poor yes sir i believe youve mentioned something like that before anyway i emphasized to glitsky that hes a witness not a suspect ah freeman nodded genially the good lieutenant wants to get to know him a little better is that it the old man pulled himself up straight behind the desk and summoned his courtroom bellow are you out of your mind he got his voice back under control a witness not a suspect hes a prime suspect and ill tell you something else kensing sure as hell thinks he is why do you think he wanted to get a lawyer onboard in fact the more i think about it the more i like him youve never met him so what youve only met him once are you trying to tell me that you know hes not guilty of murder he injected markham with potassium or ran him over maybe both david why not the dead guy was screwing his wife which is the oldest motive in the world so after waiting two years he killed him his worldview intact freeman sat back serene as buddha happens every day seriously diz what about this doesnt work for you it looks pretty good to me solid enough anyway for an indictment easily for an arrest you know how that works seeing it now through freemans eyes he was forced to concede that his client in fact did have motive means and opportunity to have killed tim markham in his day hardy had won many grand jury indictments with any two of them occasionally with only one and now hed brokered this stupid little meeting with the head of homicide in a few hours kensing might show up here in the office and if more evidence had come to light glitsky might serve him with a grand jury subpoena or even arrest him on the spot and all hardy had done for kensing to date had been to send him off to work with some lowwatt advice and a little kneecap humor he realized now that the familiar settings of the aquarium and the shamrock and the two mens mutual friendship with pico morales had gotten him off on the wrong foot here temporarily blinding him to the realities kensing faced what had he been thinking suddenly he was on his feet excuse me david he said ive got to get out of here i have this incredible sense of deja vu glitsky said didnt we already do this that was this morning hardy replied new opportunities abound if we but have the courage to face them the lieutenant leveled his eyes at his friend across his desk then zipped open the side pocket of his allweather jacket pulled out a few disks of some kind of white stuff broke off a piece and popped it into his mouth want some of this rice cake its awful he looked at it for a long moment before he pitched it into the wastebasket what happened to the peanuts hardy asked for years one of glitskys desk drawers was the homicide details peanut receptacle and the lieutenant would often carry a few handfuls around with him i could eat a few peanuts too much cholesterol or fat or one of those i forget which so on top of the heart stuff you got crs too glitsky sat back folded his arms and stared im not going to ask okay fine if you dont know you dont know and if you guessed wrong youd just say something negative anyway but its never too late to change you know accentuate the positive latch on to the affirmative glitskys voice was the essence of dry ive got another one for you lets call the whole thing off hardys brow clouded different song and notice a negative theme again but this time as it turns out precisely what i had in mind whats that well i regret to inform you that my client will not be available for our interview this evening after all this case is just too hot for me to let him talk however if youd like to give me inquiries in writing id be happy to try and get you any information you require glitsky chortled and if youd like to kiss my toes perhaps i shall become a ballerina its been my dream the two men looked benignly at each other glitsky finally broke the impasse all right he said whats crs hardy paused for dramatic effect cantremembershit he grinned one sad day you wont ask glitsky had made it clear that the respective performances of bracco and fisk yesterday during the interview of anita tong left something to be desired so much so that hed forbidden them to talk directly to any of the other witnesses tong had mentioned specifically they were not to approach eric kensing or anyone at parnassus headquarters if they developed new leads for themselves and found anyone else on their own they could use their judgment provided they immediately reported back to homicidedailywith any results the lieutenant had even suggested that since it was their area of expertise maybe it would be an effective use of their time to visit some body shops and car washes follow up on patrol sightings of suspicious vehicles in the projects and neighborhoods fisk accepted this assignment with relative good humor tinged possibly with acceptance and even relief but after a couple of hours of it driving around in a continuous steady rain bracco lost his patience goddamnit this isnt a hit and run anymore harlen glitsky told us to build a case and were probably gonna break some eggs making any kind of decent omelette out of it but im damned if im driving around anymore looking for a fucking car all this miserable day thats not what killed him anyway they had come up from the mission and now were stopped at a red light on van ness near city hall fisk huddled down in the passenger seat with his arms crossed against the chill was shaking his head glitsky said look for the car dont mess with kensing okay but how about his wife shes fucking markham you know shes in this somehow this made fisk uncomfortable i dont know thats pretty close to kensing dont you think besides where is she up on anza behind usf ive got her address howd you find that i called information and asked he grinned over at his partner believe it or not it works she lives like four blocks from the kaiser on masonic i played a hunch and called there sure enough you ever notice how all doctors wives are nurses i say we go talk to her fisk still didnt like it but after a beat he brightened you know the other night you dropped me at tadichs i mentioned the case to my aunt kathy and she said the whole parnassus mess had been really hard on nancy ross she felt so sorry for her nancy ross malachis wife i dont know malachi ross bracco admitted fisk allowed a small smile parnassus he said with markham gone he runs it now you didnt read citytalk today it was pretty interesting are you turning into a cop on me harlen so your aunt knows his wife pretty well i think she knows everybody its something bracco pointed and even as we speak city hall looms on the right abruptly making up his mind he pulled directly over to the curb lets go say hi kathy west showed no sign of sharing any of her nephews genes maybe bracco thought she was the wife of the blood relation to harlen in her midfifties with a nononense stopandstart demeanor and frail bone structure her little bob of graypeppered hair she reminded darrell bracco of nothing so much as a sparrow a friendly really intelligent sparrow the office of the city supervisor on the second floor was smalltinybut pleasant there was an antique desk builtin bookshelves a row of windows along the westfacing wall when her nephew and his partner showed up unexpectedly they didnt appear to be interrupting anything she greeted them both warmly then sent her administrative aide a welldressed obsequious young man named peter for some coffee after a few minutes of small talk and a quick cooks tour of her workspacethree desks in an outer cubicle a cramped library and file roomwhen the coffee arrived she closed the door to her office behind them and they all sat so she began im assuming youre here to talk about parnassus wasnt that citytalk column devastating i dont see how malachi ross will be able to face his employees today to say nothing of his board well she stopped expectant bracco stepped into the breach harlen said you knew mrs ross i wonder if you could tell us a little about her before we go and interview her why would you want to do that surely she isnt any kind of a suspect fisk replied frankly were on what you might call a short leash with lieutenant glitsky this is our first real case and i think he wants us to work in from way outside not spook any important witnesses with naive questions parnassus may be part of the motive if there is one braccos tone was confident as though hed done this kind of thing a hundred times before but nancy ross west asked was she even there when markham died she would have had to be at the hospital wouldnt she shes not a suspect fisk reiterated were just interested in the personal side of parnassus if you will the players if there might be anything there well she put her cup down i really dont know malachi ross at all although of course weve met several times nancy on the other hand i know fairly well she is a lovely person very active socially i mean she also volunteers with the opera board the kidney foundation several other charities many of a medical nature west narrowed her eyes slightly i may as well tell you that politically as well shes been a friend so im afraid im not going to be a very good source of dirt were not looking for dirt bracco assured her though the idea that there might be some dirt was appealing this wasnt the venue to pursue it was she a nurse by the way west shook her head no i dont believe nancy has ever worked for a living i mean at a real job shes never needed to she comes from money but even when her husband was young to help out bracco asked west laughed when her husband was young inspector nancy was a baby shes dr rosss second wife id be surprised if shes thirtyfive a cloud crossed her brow her parents werent altogether taken with the marriage i remember hearing that the money from that source dried up they didnt like the idea of nancy being a trophy wife for an older man and they cut her off entirely i mean her money not that it mattered as it turns out malachi does very wellshe shook her head in commiserationas the entire city now knows harlen finally thought of a question does she do anything with her husband for parnassus the supervisor shook her head i dont really think so not specifically with the company but she entertains all the time and i suppose to some degree thats part of his business all the time bracco asked a nod i dont know how she does it with the small childrenshes got her twin girls i think theyre about sixbut i suppose with the nannies she collected her thoughts a moment but back to your question id guess she throws a really lavish party once a month with smaller affairscharity dostwo or three times a week bracco wasnt familiar with the lifestyle and didnt seem to understand it this would be most weeks id say so when shes in town as opposed to where well she smiled and opened her palms in front of her wherever she wants to go id suppose they have a second placereally stunning ive been there seven or eight thousand square feetright on the lake at tahoe and i know theyor she and the girlsthey christmas at aspen or park city they have their own plane i believe darrel bracco jogged through the rain with his partner got to his car and into his seat when harlen was buckling up beside him he caught his eye wow real money fisk agreed real live money their own airplane id like my own airplane how could you pay for the gas to go anywhere though yeah theres that bracco pulled out into the traffic the rain continued as though it would never end drifting in sheets before them it was nearly noon and still dark as dusk and after a bit braccos expression closed down to match it but we knew they were rich to begin with didnt we i dont see what else it gets us fisk considered that it got us a better cup of coffee than eds body shop at least that the message especially welcome coming from fisk was a good one they were finally working a righteous homicide not a variant of hit and run and the truth was that it wasnt the same at all now without any real guidance the job was to follow where their intelligence and instincts led them they were gathering random information that was all and by definition much of it would be irrelevant but some of it might be importantyou just didnt know until you knew without any discussion bracco turned west toward kaiser and ann kensings house fisk concentrating sat in a deep silence for a couple of blocks then darrel yeah what does a plane cost you think i think its one of those things where if youve got to ask you cant afford it but his partner was a ball of surprises today something had started his engine over this investigation and now he was obviously pursuing a train of thought no not that i mean just the upkeep alonethe hangar the gas monthly payments insurance i dont know i suppose it would depend on where you keep it the size of the plane all that why fisk shrugged im thinking about a million two how far it goes this wasnt a hard one for darrel if i had a million two id be retired on the beach in costa rica whered that figure come from thats what ross makes a year bracco shot a glance of utter skepticism across the seat and fisk retorted hey that was the number in the papercitytalk its got to be true but my point isnt how much money it is its whether its enough this made bracco laugh its enough trust me is it two mansions a past marriage which means alimony and probably child support a new young partygiving society wife kids in private schools servants airplanes vacations a million two though for darrel bracco son of a cop a million dollars might as well be a trillion they were both unfathomably large sums of money a lifetimes worth of money clearly though not so for fisk you ever read a book called bonfire of the vanities was that a book i think i saw the movie yeah well the movie sucked but it was a book first anyway a cool thing in the book was this guy running down the list of his expenses showing how impossible it was to get along on only a million dollars a year and this was like ten years ago he should have called me bracco said i could have helped him out the point fisk pressed on is that maybe we just did learn something we can use from aunt kathy instead of concentrating on how rich ross is it might be smarter to think how poor he is i mean face it if your expenses are greater than your income youre poor right no matter what you make they stopped at kaiser first and discovered that mrs kensing had called in sick the rain that had been falling steadily since last night had found a new life monsoonlike driven nearly horizontal by strong winds off the ocean the drops pelted both inspectors as they stood on her front stoop she answered the door wearing heavy gray socks designer jeans and a red cowlneck pullover braccos immediate impression was that she hadnt slept in a couple of days her shoulderlength blond hair was a mess without makeup of any kind she appeared drawn and gaunt still there was no hiding her attractiveness her eyes especially were deepset wide and compelling almost electric blue hed never seen eyes quite like them even after theyd introduced themselves badges out mrs kensing simply stared at them until bracco finally asked if they could come in nodding she took a step back opening the door as she withdrew im sorry she said ambiguously then waited another long moment before she brought the door closed behind them all the light was dim in the vestibule they stood dripping on the woven cloth rug in the tiny area maybe we should she said distractedly and not finishing the sentence led the way a few steps down a short hall then to the right into the kitchen overflowing onto the floor a huge load of laundry lay piled on the table skirting that she pulled out a stool the counter still held dirty dishes from the morninga milk and a juice carton two boxes of cereal some brown pear and banana slices on a cracked saucer finally she focused on them where they stood in the small humid room all right what the startling eyes flicked back and forth between the inspectors bracco pulled out his tape recorder and put it on the counter in front of her he cleared his throat and recited his name and the date his badge number the usual he hadnt rehearsed what he was going to say hadnt really considered what the womans state of mind might be before shed opened the door but now he had to begin with something soon or he sensed shed throw them both out mrs kensing tim markham and you were lovers werent you she cleared her throat we used to be but he broke it off twice why because he was guilty about his family especially he didnt want to hurt his kids but he didnt love his wife anymore so he kept coming back to me but he left you again too isnt that right bracco asked temporarily he would have come back again so why did he leave because he had to try again with them one more time he said fisk asked and when was that last week late last week and were you okay with that bracco asked with his decision how could i be i knew her eyes were hard i knew hed come back to me eventually just like he always did he loved me i didnt see why he had to put everyone through it again all the back and forth i told him he should just separate make it clean the way you did in your marriage fisk asked if she took offense she didnt show it yeah like i did as soon as i realized i loved tim and not eric i told him he had to move out i mean what was the point i wasnt going to live a lie fisk looked across at his partner and how did carla take all this his leaving her he never left her she corrected him bitterly i was always on the side but she knew about you what then well she threatened him of course said shed leave him and take all his money he wouldnt get visitation thats why he went back you mean this last time but fisk didnt wait for her to answer his partners question you know that carla and the children are dead too she went still for a beat then i saw that but i turned it all off im not interested in her she doesnt have anything to do with me she looked up at them in defiance i dont want to talk about this anymore i dont care about her fisk spoke up maybe carla didnt take him back maybe she was still mad at him suddenly she broke and raised her voice arent you listening to me it was done the wind gusted and heavy drops pounded at the kitchen window he was going to tell her everything hed done wrong in his life make a fresh start what a fucking fool but did he in fact tell her fisk asked who cares what could it matter now i never saw him again after he left me she snapped i dont know what he did and when was that bracco asked more gently the last time you saw him she slapped angrily at the counter goddamnit i dont care dont you hear me what matters is im left here she gestured despairingly around the cluttered tiny kitchen here by myself fisk asked abruptly did you know that your husband treated mr markham at portola yeah i knew that i saw him right after her gaze sharpened why is that important markham had broken up your marriage maybe he still hated him yeah but so what she shook her head wearily this all shook out two years ago its ancient history the inspectors shared a glance youre saying he wasnt still bitter fisk asked sure he was bitter he made no bones about hating tim he always she hesitated why fisk told her were trying to find out who killed him mrs kensing i know youll want to know that too her eyes narrowed what do you mean killed him he got hit by a car no maam he was killed bracco said you didnt know that fisk asked harshly didnt you read the paper this morning yeah she answered in a voice heavy with sarcasm i got my kids off to school then had the maid bring in the paper with my coffee and bonbons she hasnt gotten to the laundry or the dishes yet dismissing fisk she turned to bracco youre saying somebody ran him over on purpose bracco shook his head it wasnt the accident he said he was killed at the hospital somebody shot him up with potassium her eyes flashed with the onset of panic i dont know what youre saying fisk took a step toward her youre a nurse and you dont know about potassium of course i know that what about it with tim though with his dying its what killed him bracco replied really slowly the news seemed to register in the hospital then slowly as the thought congealed her face changed by degrees until finally it was contorted with rage that son of a bitch that miserable motherfucker she looked from one inspector to the other her rasping voice filled with conviction you can stop looking she said i know who killed him kensing was working at the judah clinic and didnt seem inclined to return calls so hardy decided that hed simply show up hoping that his unexpected appearance would help convey the air of urgency he was beginning to feel so he ventured out into the teeth of the storm and made it to the clinic in time to spend another half hour in the crowded waiting room before kensing in his white smock and stethoscope came out to see him the doctor told him he couldnt get away even for a few minutes his doctor work was more important he was swamped here as hardy could see and anyway wasnt their appointment supposed to be for tonight hardy tried to make him understand the reality they both faced but the doctor couldnt seem to accept it i dont see how its any different than it was yesterday kensing replied he made a helpless gesture with his hands everything about it is different hardy explained with a patience he didnt feel yesterday nobody thought markham was murdered so it didnt matter that you hated him now it does a lot so youve got motive means and opportunity its bad luck to have all three of these around a homicide trust me but he dismissed hardys concerns with a shake of his head we covered all this on the phone this morning didnt we he put an arm on hardys sleeve look i appreciate your concern but ive got to keep things moving here at the clinic or we wont even get to talk tonight sorry you had to come all the way down but this wont work hardy closed some space between them and lowered his voice thats what ive been trying to tell you were not going to talk tonight doctor at least not with the police i canceled the interview kensing showed a little pique whyd you do that because im your lawyer and its my job to protect you i dont need protection once they hear what ive got to say especially if i give it to them voluntarily theyll cross me off their list really and you know this because of your vast experience in criminal law is that it hardy was right in his clients face listen to me i promise youyou have my solemn wordthat they will not do that dont kid yourself like it or not you are a murder suspect they wont be looking for reasons to let you off theyll be looking for reasons to bring you in and im not going to give them a chance to do that you and i need a lot more time together a lot more like most of the weekend kensing shook his head i dont know about that ive got giants tickets for saturday ive got my kids and im taking them thats really swell hardy said but youre not taking anybody anywhere if youre in jail the point is you and i need to block some time this is serious stuff okay in the waiting room over kensings shoulder a baby began to wail kensing checked his watch frowned looked over at the crying infant all right he said gesturing toward the noise but this is serious too what i do he offered a professional smile maybe sunday though howd that be giving hardy a conspiratorial pat on the back he turned and disappeared through the door that led to the doctors offices hardy who had walked a block and a half from the parking lot felt the squish in his soaking shoes the chill in his pants damp below the knee after kensing left he sat down for a minute in one of the plastic chairs then combed his wet hair with his fingers stood up and buttoned his raincoat for the walk through the squall back to his car just checking on my investment hardy said when moses mcguire looked up in surprise from behind the shamrocks bar he was the only person in the place what investment i gave you your quarter in trade in case your memory fails you which it never does you drinking hardy hadnt had a drink in the daytime in six months but between his failure to talk with anybody at the hall freemans attitude the weather and his recent debacle with kensing he was ready to try anything to change his luck or his timing you got any sapphire behind the bar though mcguire disapproved of gin in any form he didnt have to ask hardy how he wanted it up dry chilled glass as he was pouring he asked you all right frannie okay he had pretty much raised his little sister hardys wife by himself and he still felt protective were fine i had an appointment near here that didnt work out nothing to do with frannie he sipped his martini nodded appreciatively this he said is perfect moses whose own macallan scotch neat was a permanent fixture in the bars gutter lifted his own glass clicked it against hardys and raised it to his lips that he replied is gin and dry vermouth and ice thisholding up his own glassis perfect but i accept the compliment with grace and humility why didnt you have him come to your office who your appointment i didnt know you made house calls i dont this one seemed important well to one of you at least at that truth hardy nodded ruefully then again maybe i just needed an excuse to break up the routine moses pulled up the stool he kept behind the bar i hear you he said you want to plan a road trip we leave now we could be in mexico by nightfall dont tempt me hardy lifted his drink sipped at it spoke wistfully maybe i could pull the kids out of school i wasnt thinking of bringing the offspring with us hardy noted the tone looked at the battered face across the bar you and susan okay at least were not getting divorced i dont think he drank some of his scotch but sometimes im sure its only because we made a deal that the first one to mention the d word gets the kids i hear mexicos warm this time of year its always warmer than here they both looked out the picture window where the rain continued in sheets the cypress trees that bordered the park were bent over halfway in the wind abruptly hardy stood up he pushed his unfinished martini to the edge of the bar you leaving so soon mcguire asked him you just got here hardy pointed to his drink if i finish that and i desperately want to ill never leave fortunately you dont have to no i do have to ive got work and the devils trying to give me an excuse not to do it but ive got an idea for you and susan why dont you get somebody to cover for you here and bring the kids over tonight well take em you guys go out hows that sound it could work mcguire said though it isnt mexico yeah but what is hardy laid a friendly punch on mcguires arm think about it standing in front of the grand jury after a working lunch with clarence jackman and abe glitsky marlene ash was in her element the nineteen citizens gathered before her in the police commissioners hearing room on the fifth floor of the hall of justice one floor above glitskys office and two above jackmans cared mightily for justice to be done they might appear to be a hodgepodge of humanitycertainly both genders and most of the ethnic populations in the city were represented here todaybut marlene knew that these people sitting now before her and the others like them on juries and not just grand juries all over the country were the backbone of the legal system she worked within without them the average good citizen justice would be an empty concept the social fabric would tear so she played fair with them respecting their intelligence and experience ladies and gentlemen of the grand jury she began on tuesday april timothy markham began his customary invariable morning jog when he got to twentysixth avenue here in the city he was run down by a green early model american car the driver fled the scene in his vehicle but the car accident is not what killed mr markham instead after hed been somewhat stabilized after surgery at portola hospital and as he lay helpless in his hospital bed a person or persons as yet unknown injected his body with an overdose of potassium potassium is a common medication it is readily available in emergency rooms and intensive care units but potassium can kill when administered in large doses and such a dose was given to mr markham that same night his wife carla and their three children died of gunshot wounds in their home we have convened here today to take evidence to determine the identity of the killer or killers in this series of brutal deaths all eyes were glued on her most of the members had pads on the desks in front of them ready to take notes the medical examiner has ruled that carla markhams death by gunshot is a possible suicide but this is still a matter of uncertainty lieutenant glitsky the chief of the homicide detail will be testifying here for you in a few moments he will be conducting a parallel investigation into that aspect of the case and he may decide to his satisfaction that in fact mrs markham killed her family and herself or he may arrest a suspect before you have gathered enough evidence to issue an indictment she paused and met a few eyes among her jurors well cross that bridge when we come to it in the meanwhile the city has received a bill in the amount of thirteen million dollars for services hardy wasnt exactly sure what had brought him to portola in the first place hed vaguely wanted to talk to someone in administration he thought but nobody would talk to him he hadnt made an appointmentit was becoming his theme for the day everybody was busy all the health care professionals and administrators were dealing with the fallout from the weeks horrors within the hospital itself to say nothing of the upheaval under the corporate umbrella they had no time for impromptu meetings this whole day ought to teach him to rein in his boyish enthusiasm he told himself as he squished down the hallway on his way to the lobby and out he was just steeling himself for the dash outside when he noticed a sign that directed people to various locations one of which read cafeteria realizing that if he didnt ask no one could say no he turned back and followed the arrows it was long past lunchtime and the place while not deserted wasnt crowded either hardy grabbed a muffin and a cup of coffee paid the cashier and stood waiting for his muse to speak alone at a table by a window a woman in a nurses uniform sat reading a book and he began to walk toward her closer up he pegged her as between thirty and thirtyfive nice looking light brown hair worn short medium build excuse me he said she kept her eyes on her book and held up a finger after finishing her paragraph she looked up yes can i help you welcome words but hardy didnt know what if anything he expected to discover here by talking to her but hed never know if he didnt start my name is dismas hardy im dr kensings lawyer do you mind if i sit down for a minute a flicker of distrust faded as quickly as it had appeared she lifted her shoulders dropped them and said sure but why am i in trouble hardy pulled a chair around across from her i dont think so should you be it flustered her no i mean you said youre a lawyer usually arent people in trouble when lawyers come visit them now that you mention it i suppose they are this isnt one of those times though he handed her a business card and while she looked at it he asked her name rebecca she said rebecca simms thats my daughters name we call her the beck she nodded somehow reassured and she looked down again at the card dismas is that right he nodded the good thief on calvary also the patron saint of murderers i often wonder what my parents were thinking so is dr kensing in trouble she asked hardy temporized he blew on his coffee set it down untouched in front of him the short answer is yes because of tim markham them calling it a murder hardy was thinking hed picked the right table exactly she shook her head disgustedly but that is so ridiculous murder please ridiculous in what way well im not saying it must have been an accident someone could have deliberately given him the wrong dose i suppose but we use potassium all the time in the er are you an er nurse sometimes she said we rotate a lot ive been in there my share of times and is the potassium pretty readily available sure to any medical person its right there behind the nurses station from hardys perspective this was good news if only because it gave more peoplebesides his clientaccess to the drug so in your opinion an overdose of potassium wouldnt have to be deliberate or malicious no theyre usually not in fact they happen a lot sometimes she didnt seem too worried about it i remember we had one on this saturday night near the end of last summer there were some shootings in the addition and i think a car crash or two anyway the er was a madhouse you can imagine the doctors yelling out orders right and left one of the shot guys was bleeding out his heart was failing and he needed fluids with potassium so he got one dose and before the doctor came back to him somebody had given him another one thinking it was the first so what happened did he die no the doctor recognized what was happening immediately so he shocked him then pumped him with insulin and glucose and he came out so why do you think didnt they use that on mr markham i dont know i wasnt there theyd have had to recognize the problem first right i mean in my case with the shot guy the doctor was right there ordering potassium maybe dr kensing didnt know or didnt put it together soon enough what does he say hardy showed some frustration hes been busy until it made the news he thought markham had just died from the accident people do you know just die a curt nod he knew it was coming up on the birthday of his longgone son michael with an effort he shook the clutch of the memory one of the reasons i came out here today was to get a sense of the place of general conditions here ive heard rumors that some doctors are unhappy with the administration patients are getting turned away then there was that whole baby emily thing her eyes widened with recognition that was dr kensing too wasnt it hes the one who admitted her i knew there was something i remembered when you first mentioned him that was it hardy played smart as though hed known this about kensing all along although it was the first hed heard of it did he get in a lot of trouble for that suddenly reflexively rebecca turned her head focusing over hardys shoulders to the corners of the room behind him with a little frisson of electricity he realized that his questions had somehow put her on her guard what is it he asked she exhaled heavily scanned the room again checked her watch and her book finally she came back to him you never really know with these kinds of things i mean what really happened but you wouldnt have believed the memos all the stupid she huffed another time got herself back under control anyway everybody talked all about it for weeks of course all of usthe staffeven the doctors you know and its not so common that we all agree on anythingwe all thought hed done absolutely the right thing i mean this was a baby what was he supposed to do let them leave her over in county without her mother and i take it the administration didnt like it she laughed harshly then leaned across the table and answered in a whisper i heard they actually fired him which is when he went to the newspapers excuse me the laundry list of what hardy didnt know about his client continued to grow and to astound him he and his client had to talk really but he couldnt bother about that now youre telling me that dr kensing broke the story too to the papers she nodded he never admitted it but everybody knows it was him i think its only a matter of time now before they really fire him even if they have to make up a reason not that hes alone what do you mean she made sure again that no one had come within earshot i mean most people here are scared of losing their jobs of either doing something or not doing it either way its really bad she frowned so are they going to charge dr kensing with this murder that would be awful i dont know hardy said they might because mr markham was going to fire him that could be a motive yes another one hardy was thinking but he asked youre sure it was markham who wanted to fire him sure she said he ran the whole show here who else glitsky homicide who is this what did i just say this is abe glitsky san francisco homicide whos this jack langtry abe is this really you yeah its really me jack whats going on this is really weird i just hit redial on carla markhams cell phone she called homicide before she died where are you now downstairs evidence lockup dont move im on my way langtry was waiting in his office in the bowels of the hall with him was another of his crime scene investigators sgt carol amano he had put the phone on the middle of the desk all by itself almost as though it were some kind of bomb hed already ordered complete phone records on the markham house and on this cell phone hed also called lennard faro at the lab and requested that he join them asap glitsky was down here with them pacing as he talked which was something he rarely did langtry realized that his adrenaline was way up okay but lets consider other possibilities glitsky was saying it was in her purse maybe one of our guys couldnt get to a phone and called back in here while we were doing the house no way amano wouldnt even consider it langtry too was shaking his head i agree not a chance abe you saw who we had on the scene me len carol the other guys were talking the a team nobodys taking a phone out of a purse at a homicide scene and using it to call home it just couldnt happen but assuming weve got what it looks like here she called homicide so what does it mean it would be helpful to know when glitsky said we could have that in a few hours if were lucky langtry replied but i think we can assume it was after she left the hospital and before the crowd started showing up at her place probably while she was driving home amano added glitsky processed that for a second which was before anybody knew about the potassium before we knew it was a murder maybe she knew it was a murder amano said with a muted excitement maybe she did the murder and was calling to confess then changed her mind was she at the hospital abe when he died yeah glitsky answered distractedly okay then langtry said catching glitskys expression he asked why not i dont know maybe he broke up with her again amano clearly liked the idea he was leaving her for good she went into a jealous rage glitsky was shaking his head and then luckily he got hit by a random car giving carla the opportunity to ride in the ambulance with him and then kill him with potassium at the hospital after which she went home and entertained all of her friends for six or seven hours before finally killing herself and her kids this doesnt sing for me people it doesnt even hum the two csi inspectors shared a glance do you have another theory langtry finally asked glitskys scar was tight through his lips no i dont like theories i dont know what time she made the call or why she made it or if anybody in the detail picked up she might have seen the accident for all i know amano walked over to the door and looked out down the hallway then she turned here comes faro a few seconds later the snappily dressed and diminutive forensics inspector bopped into the office said hi all around asked what was up when he heard about the cell phone he nodded thoughtfully certainly he thought it was significant but what it meant exactly he didnt want to hazard a guess like glitsky faro liked it when evidence led to a theory instead of vice versa but i do have some news hit me glitsky said well two things on the trajectorywere talking mrs markham here the head woundback to front glitsky repeated the words then asked so the gun was behind her ear and the slug went forward strout say how often hes seen that with selfinflicted wounds faro gestured ambiguously you know him better than me sir he said sometimes helpful i thought so too but the other thing she was lefthanded howd strout get to that he didnt i got it there was a collection of lefty coffee mugs at the house you know the kindbest mom in the world queen of the southpawsthat kind of thing also shed addressed some envelopes and the writing slants like a lefty but the gun was in her right hand near it faro corrected him but yeah anyway the gsrgunshot residueresults might give us a better hint if she in fact fired the thing but they wont be in for a few more days okay len thanks glitskys scowl was pronounced well thanks to all of you anything new comes up i want to hear glitsky wasnt about to join in the guessing games out loud but this latest evidence all but convinced him of what hed been tempted to believe from the start carla markhams death hadnt been a suicide at all she wouldnt have shot herself with the wrong hand and at an unusual angle she wouldnt have shot the dog or her teenage children and this meant that someone had killed her he didnt as yet know why but the call to homicide on the day of her death made it likely that shed seen or suspected the murderer of her husband glitsky had the door to his office closed he was drumming the fingers of both hands on his desk trying to stop himself from this premature conjecture he told himself that he didnt know enough yet to form any consistent theories let alone any conclusions but one consideration wouldnt go away if someone had in fact killed carla he was convinced that it was the same person that had killed her husband he had no idea of the motive for the wife but he didnt need that he already had a suspect with a strong motive for the husband and means and opportunity it was time to squeeze him kensing arrived home from work to find inspector glitsky waiting at his front door tucked in out of the fall of rain he greeted him politely but seemed a little confused i thought mr hardy had canceled this meeting glitsky shrugged in a noncommittal way sometimes lawyers dont want their clients to talk to the police usually its when those clients are guilty he told me you wanted to talk to us glitsky wasnt pushing i thought we might save each other some time thats all after a moments reflection kensing invited glitsky up into his condo without ever thinking to ask him for a warrant he lived in a twobedroom converted condominium across from alta plaza a park in the upper fillmore the unit took up the entire floor in a stately older threestory building it sported classic high ceilings exposed dark beams hardwood floors a huge bay window with three panes of watery ancient glass overlooked the park and glitsky stopped to look out of them for a moment to comment on the rain a few minutes later after hed boiled some water for tea for the lieutenant the doorbell rang again it turned out to be the inspector hed spoken with outside of the markham housebraccoand another man who introduced himself as fisk he let them both in too and asked if they would like something to drink glitsky had brought a portable video camera to go with the small tape recorder that he set on the kitchen table when the audio tape was rolling he told kensing again for the recordas hed mentioned on the stoopthat he understood from talking to mr hardy that the doctor wanted to get the police interview out of the way you can of course decline to talk he continued in a friendly manner or postpone the meeting until mr hardy is available but we know how busy you are we all are to tell the truth as i said downstairs we just thought it might be easier to get this done now early in the process kensing nodded thats what i told mr hardy i dont have anything to hide but the lowkey courteous lieutenant wanted to nail it down and added youre sure you wouldnt prefer to have mr hardy here no its fine i think hes being a little overprotective anyway it doesnt matter him being here or not isnt going to affect what i say i dont mind thank you glitsky said with great sincerity he knew that he was getting kensing to talk without his attorney being present and that this was legally proper the right to remain silent belongs to the suspect not to his lawyer kensing could remain silent if he so chose but equally he could decide to talk we appreciate it very much he seated kensing in front of the camera turned it on and began all right then doctor three two one this is lieutenant abraham glitsky sfpd badge number one one four four he continued the usual litany identifying the case number his witness where they were who else was present finally glitsky cast a quick glance at his two acolytes he had a yellow pad out on the table in front of him and he consulted it briefly then got down to it dr kensing he began did you sign mr markhams death certificate kensing adopted a rueful expression he could see what was coming yes i did although in a situation like this one my signature is provisional provisional what does that mean it means in lieu of an autopsy it can be overridden as it was in this case by the medical examiner with no sign of emotion he spelled it out often especially when a patient has been hospitalized the cause of death is apparent and theres no particular call for an autopsy although mr hardy told me that hitandrun homicides are always autopsied hes right but you didnt know that before he told you no and mr markhams cause of death was apparent to you was it yes at the time hed been hit by a car and sustained major internal injuries with massive bleeding it was a little surprising that he even made it to intensive care so you did not expect an autopsy to be performed i never thought about it all right doctor are you familiar with the symptoms of potassium overdose yes of course basically in laymans terms your heart stops beating effectively and your treatment he shrugged if we know its potassium we inject glucose and insulin then defibrillationshockwith cpr and there was no way you could have recognized the true cause of mr markhams problem which was the potassium no i dont see how okay glitsky consulted his notes seemed to be gathering himself for another salvo now doctor you knew mr markham well isnt that true i knew him for a long time he was my boss how well i knew him is another question yet its the one i asked isnt it true that he and your wife had a relationship that contributed to the breakup of your marriage kensing swallowed but his mouth was dry as sand he began to think that agreeing to this interview might have been a serious mistake fortyfive minutes later they finally finished with the personal stuff glitsky didnt even pause a moment before moving on to a rather sharp grilling about kensings role in the baby emily matter the parnassus response and mr markham fired you not really he did warn me though that there would be serious repercussions if he found out that id been the leak to the press and were you kensing tried to smile but it came out crooked id rather not say if thats all right glitsky took that as a yes and decided he didnt need the information and where did that discussion with mr markham take place he called me to his office we talked there and did he subsequently discover that you had been the leak i dont think so i never heard that he did another weak and harmful attempt at levity he never fired me so i guess not huh glitsky inexorable moved on kensing had just admitted that besides baby emily there had been a few other issues on which he and parnassus hadnt agreed kensing volunteered that he often prescribed drugs that were not on the formulary in other words glitsky clarified drugs the company didnt approve it wasnt that so much kensing explained the drugs i prescribed were fine in fact they were better kensing drew a paper towel already damp with sweat across his forehead the companys policy is that we physicians prescribe drugs from the formulary thats all and you made it a habit not to use this list not a habit when i thought it was appropriate he felt he needed to explain the generics are not always exactly the same chemically as the proprietary so theyre not always as effective or theyll have other problems like what any number of things youll have to take it twice as often or it might have undesirable side effects like indigestion so in some cases or when id had a bad experience with a certain generic on the formulary id go with the proprietary and parnassus has a problem with this he shrugged it costs them money could you explain that well the way it works at parnassus is that most patients have the same copay i think its ten dollars no matter what the drug costs so if a proprietary costs thirty dollars and the formularys generic costs ten the company loses twenty dollars for every proprietary prescription that it fills and you would prescribe these proprietary drugs regularly when it was appropriate yes my job is to save lives not the companys money and did you have more words with mr markham about this practice by now kensings hands were visibly shaking he took them off the table put them into his lap for the past grueling hour or so he wished that hed listened to his lawyer and taken his advice not to talk to these men but having started the interview he didnt know how to go about trying to stop it finally he tried if you dont mind id like to be excused for a moment he said but glitsky wasnt inclined to let him go to the bathroom even if only to gather himself in a bit he said crisply then repeated his question did you have words with mr markham on this drug issue no i did not we did not speak since when about two years ago two years ago and yet the baby emily affair was in the past few months and you said you spoke to him then kensing wiped his whole face with the paper towel i thought you meant about this prescription issue when we talked about that when the police finally packed up their equipment and left kensing sat shaking on his living room couch for a long while eventually he decided hed better call hardy see about some damage control outside it had nearly come to night and the rain continued to pour down his front window hardy was still at his office trying to catch up on his other clients work kensing then told him what had happened that the interview had been really really unpleasant a mistake after all i think they must really believe i had something to do with this he concluded there was a long silence and when it ended kensing was completely unprepared for hardys fury oh you think so doc the lieutenant in charge of homicide interrogates you for two hours about a murder thats on the front pages every day that might be connected to a brutal murder of a whole family and youve got motive means and opportunity and you think maybe just maybe they might think youre a righteous suspect you studied anatomy didnt you doc does everybody else have their head up their ass or is it just you kensing just sat there looking at the receiver in his hand he felt a rush of blood to his head and then physically sick he thought he might throw up his knuckles were white on the phone his throat was a barren desert constricted after a few more seconds unable to get a word out he hung up when hardy called kensing back twenty minutes later to apologize for his outburst he didnt find himself fired as hed half expected instead his client apologized back to him ending with his observation that glitsky might really think i killed tim about time he got that message hardy thought but he only said itd be smart to assume that but he had called his client back for another reason besides the apology if he was still defending the good doctor he had some pertinent questions to ask him eric i went by portola today and talked to some nurses there what do you think are the odds that the overdose was accidental basically in this case zero why hardy ran down rebecca simmss theory about the occasional inadvertent overdose when hed finished kensing repeated what hed said before no it wasnt that how do you know i was there markham wasnt even on potassium he was stable relatively anyway so hardy asked simply whats that leave who else had access to him carla i suppose technically maybe brendan driscoll earlier ross a couple of other doctors the nurses how many nurses youd have to check the records i dont know theres usually two sometimes three i think there were two the enormity of it seemed to hit him for the first time youre saying one of those people killed him arent you thats what it looks like eric he refrained from adding either one of them or you jesus kensing said weakly so what do we do now hardy hesitated for just an instant trace awkwardness remained from the earlier outburst but he went ahead this may seem a little prosaic after what youve been through tonight eric but before things go any further weve got to talk about my fees cant you just bill my insurance neither man laughed hardy waited out a reasonable silence then said you might want to get where you can be comfortable this is going to take a while glitsky wanted to debrief the car police after the kensing interrogation at his condo so although it was late he drove back downtown now he was back at his desk waiting for fisk and bracco so they could talk about what if anything theyd learned how they were going to proceed on this investigation outside his door five of his other inspectors were hanging around catching up on their paperwork someone had brought in a pizza the smell of which was driving glitsky crazy since he was supposed to go light on the food groups that used to be his favorites which included cheese and grease what was keeping those guys hed thought they were right behind him finally he heard some laughter out in the detail and got up to check it out he thought it entirely possible that somebody had krazy glued fisk to his chair glitsky gave up the good fight and grabbed a slice of pizza from marcel laniers desk and put half of it in his mouth before he could change his mind when he had swallowed enough of it so that he could talk he asked what was so funny lanier was a veteran of the detail and he leaned back in his chair with his feet crossed on his desk his hands were linked behind his head just the das office sent up another crazy today and i finally figured out a way to help him without sending him to the fbi glitsky knew that a regular feature of life in the city was the abundance of bona fide lunaticsfolks who generally lived on the streets and heard voices thought they were possessed communicated with aliens occasionally one of these people would take their concerns to the public defenders office which would in turn direct him to the police station downstairs in the hall there the desk would nod sympathetically and forward him to the das office which always sent him to homicide most of the time homicide sent him over to the fbi where god knew what happened to him but today i had this great idea marcel was saying and told this poor gentleman what he had to do was braid together a string of paper clipsi gave him a whole box it took him like an houruntil it reached from his head to his feet then he had to attach it to his hair and let the other end drag on the floor and that would stop the voices and why would it do that marcel although glitsky wasnt sure he wanted to hear the answer because then hed be grounded he held up his right hand laughing again with the other inspectors i swear to god abe he walked out of here a cured man youre a miracle worker marcel thats a beautiful story can i have another slice of pizza glitsky turned to go back to his office but stopped as bracco appeared in the details doorway one of the guys behind him sang out car fiftyfour where are you to the enjoyment of the other inspectors glitsky made a face of disapproval pointed at his new young inspector and then to his office when bracco was inside standing atease as he did glitsky waited at the door another minute you guys take the scenic route or what wheres harlen hes uh hes not here glitsky closed the door behind him i got that far on my own darrel the question was where he is not where hes not i dont know exactly sir he had an appointment he had an appointment yes sir one of his aunts fundraising glitsky interrupted him were you under the impression that you had an appointment here with me werent my last words to you something very much like see you back at the hall did you think i meant like tomorrow morning no sir he said he had to go and hed already put in his hours for the day sir glitskys scowl deepened for an instant and then suddenly he found himself chuckling his hours for the day i love that what planets that boy from all right sit down darrel if you havent got your hours quota filled up yet ill deal with harlen tomorrow lord after bracco was seated he pushed his own chair back from his desk rested his hands over his belly and put his feet up so whats your take on dr kensing bracco sat the same way he stood with a ramrodstraight back using only the front half of the chairs seat he kept his hands entwined on his lap i guess hes got motive to burnand who else has any reason to kill markhambut without any hard evidence no jury would convict him i dont think i agree i think he sounded guilty if that means anything bracco opined i think he thought he was smarter than us and could direct the way it would go tonight glitsky allowed the trace of a smile i flatter myself i may have disappointed him so what do we do for the moment id be interested in a minutebyminute account of how dr kensing spent his day last tuesday and i mean from when he woke up you think its him glitsky nodded id like more physical evidence but even without it he was there he hated and maybe feared markham he had every opportunity sometimes thats all we get bracco seemed to be wrestling with something finally he came out with it if he did kill markham are you thinking he also killed the wife im deeply skeptical of the notion that she killed herself lets put it that way he told bracco about the cell phone in her purse with its call to homicide the backtofront trajectory of the slug the wronghandedness with the gun she called homicide on her cell phone when was that six oclock langtry had left the message on glitskys voice mail information might be slow in coming but it was showing up and thats what counted so while everybody was at her house yep and nobody was here in homicide she didnt leave a message six oclock was about when kensing got there wasnt it glitsky nodded from what i can tell pretty close a silence descended again bracco hesitated considering whether to talk again he decided he must you know we talked to kensings wife today and glitsky raised his eyebrows when was that and why well remember you said youd rather we didnt interview certain witnesses we didnt want to get in your way so we stayed around the edges we went to see harlens aunt then ann kensing the lieutenant brought his hands up and rubbed them over his eyes then he met braccos eyes over the desk i shouldnt have given you the impression that i didnt want you to talk to people darrel you can talk to anybody you want this is your case yes sir thank you but i want you to report to me every day before you go out after you get back in yes sir but if i may you may you dont have to ask that what are we still going on the assumption that the original hit and run was an accident harlen still wants to look for cars i mean somebody hit him maybe it was on purpose glitskys gaze was level his voice reasoned and calm at this point id be surprised if it wasnt an accident but i wouldnt have predicted markhams family would get shot either why you got some kind of lead on the car no sir i just wanted to be clear on whether we should drop it entirely or not if that moment comes darrel it will be clear to you until it is keep your options open now can we go back to what you were going to say about mrs kensing bracco took a second or two dredging it up and finally he spoke with a kind of reluctance well she sort of said she thought he admitted it but harlen and i didnt think she really meant that she was very upset pretty unaware of what she was saying glitsky stopped chewing his pizza and took a long beat she said who admitted what kensing killed markham she said he told her that yeah but really i dont thinkyou had to have been there she was just screaming crazy upset glitsky pulled at his ear doubting what hed just heard wanting to be absolutely sure he was getting it right are you telling me that ann kensing told you that her husband said he killed mr markham he said this to her face yes sir thats what she said but and youve not gotten around to telling me this before now you were already set up with the camera and ready to go sir and if you remember we didnt get any time alone together before you started so we thought wed wait until we glitsky seemed to be fighting for control didnt this strike either of you as important information bracco shifted uncomfortably well my understanding was we werent supposed to give much credit to hearsay which was what it was really at least we thought fingers templed at his lips glitsky lowered his voice to keep himself from raising it to a scream no darrel actually that would be an eyewitness testimony to a confession which is almost as good as admissible evidence gets did you by any chance have a tape running sure enough on the tape ann kensing came across as hysterical even raving the tirade was laced with obscenity with crying jags and breakdowns with a screaming keening and insane laughter but there was no question about what shed heard what it meant shed told bracco and fisk that the only reason she hadnt gone to the police the day before is because she believed the hitandrun accident had killed tim markham as soon as she realized hed been murdered and how hed been murdered listen to me listen to me im telling you he told me hed pumped him full of shit thats exactly what he said yeah full of shit those words which means he killed him didnt he it couldnt mean anything else i mean nobody else knew then did they not before the autopsy oh you bastard eric you miserable miserable glitsky heard it all out then told bracco to take the tape directly to the das office for transcription somebody would still be there and if they werent call somebody at home and get them down here working on it when bracco had gone glitsky pulled an arrest warrant form out of his desk and started to fill it out but after the first few lines his hands stopped as though of their own accord this was new and unambiguous evidencetrueand probably strong enough by itself to arrest eric kensing but given the overwhelming multiple motives and all the political repercussions of the parnassus question glitsky thought the better part of valor would be to hold his horses until the morning and go to jackman to make the final call the only remaining question in his mind was whether he should include carlas nameand the kidson the warrant when hardy dragged himself through the front door of his dark and quiet house at he wondered if hed have the energy left to make it up the stairs to his bedroom maybe he should just let himself collapse on the couch here in the living room there was still a glow from the embers in the fireplace he put down his briefcase hit the wall switch for the dim overheads then shrugged himself out of his raincoat and suit coat and crossed the room on the mantel frannies newsincethefire collection of glass elephants caravanned around several potted cacti hed gotten into the habit of rearranging them almost every dayit was a chess game without rules or a board that served as some kind of connection between him and his wife nonverbal somehow positive and every little bit helped between the kids her school and his work he sometimes thought they almost needed to make an appointment to say hello without their formal date nights they would lose track of each other completely so he made a few moves with the elephants the embers collapsed in a small shower of sparks hardy put an arm up against the mantel rested his head on it after a minute he found himself on the ottoman his elbows on his knees staring blankly into the last of the glow i thought i heard the door frannie was wrapped in a white turkish towel bathrobe theyd bought in napa on their last getaway weekend almost a year before she came across to where he made a space for her squeezed in next to him rubbed her hand over his back what are you doing up he asked moses and susan only left a few minutes ago she said i was awake moses and susan what were they doing here and colleen and holly evidently you told him wed babysit for them tonight so they could go out it was half a question which was a nice thing for them but next time you might want to let me know especially if youre not going to be here he hung his head shook it wearily what can i say im an idiot im sorry sorrys good her hand kept moving across his back she wasnt mad though perhaps would prefer if he could remember commitments hed made that involved her but its all right she continued it went fine it was lucky i was home thats all abe called by the way and some woman named rebecca who said it might be important earlier in the day he might have felt some spark of interest at the moment it only felt like more work shes a nurse at portola i talked with today this new case he was still furious that glitsky had gone behind his back to interview his client he tried to keep the anger out of his voice what did abe want he said youd know hardy gave it a second he lied did he want to get into a long explanation but her hand felt good on him they were together he leaned slightly into her he took a statement from my client after i told him not to full court press guns blazing maybe he found out my guy didnt do it and wants to say hes sorry but i doubt it he must think your client did something this was always an issue since hardy had begun working as a defense attorney she remained uncomfortable with the fact that her husband consorted not only with people accused of crimes but often with those who had actually committed them when the charge was something like a dui or some kind of thievery or fraud it wasnt so bad but when it was murder frannie tended to worry on the not unreasonable theory that anyone who had killed once might get angry with somebody elsesay their attorneyand do it again so did your client do it after all he says not hardy said simply but who doesnt and you believe him always he faced her my problem is abe ive got no idea what hes doing thats probably what he called about to explain im sure not hardy thought he glanced at his watch im tempted to call him right now and wake up his sorry ass he sighed wearily what was the other call rebecca the nurse she said it might be important he could see that frannie hated to admit it againshed already done her duty by telling him once clearly she hoped hed forget but no hardy didnt forget much about his workonly babysitting deals hed made with relatives it was frannies turn to sigh she said no matter what time it was i guess that would include now huh i thought you might want to come to bed sometime ill try to keep it short he felt something go out of her i left her number by the phone she said standing up have you had anything at all to eat he shook his head my clients finally started to figure out hes in trouble but it was all i could do to get him to talk to me on the phone it was originally supposed to be his night for his kids he thought the thing with glitsky was going to take like a half hour i asked him when he thought we could get a few minutes maybe talk about some things so i didnt have to find them all out from third parties so he says he doesnt knowhes got his kids this weekend too he works a million hours a day but i had him with me on the phone there wasnt going to be any other time so i told him to call his exwife change his plans tell her not tonight we had to talk frannie was just looking down at him shed crossed her arms over her chest her body language expressing it alldisappointment disapproval sadness theres leftover spaghetti in the refrigerator she said i dont know if its anything rebecca simms said thats all right hardy said if its keeping you up its probably worth talking about he sat at his dining room table his yellow legal pad in front of him the portable phone at his ear hed poured himself a glass of orange juice and drank half of it off in a gulp did you remember something about dr kensing no not exactly that not that at all really hardy waited ive been thinking about how i should say this since i dont really know anything specific not for sure i just went back on the floor after we talked and i guess the whole discussion we hadyou know the general conditions here sure i remember the line hummed empty for another few seconds then rebecca blurted it out the thing is everybody on the staff knows something is really wrong here the nurses i mean probably some of the doctors too but nobody really talks about it its more a feeling like a ghost is hovering over the place or something hardy closed his heavy eyes she sounded like she meant it literally terrific he thought the woman he picked at random in the hospital cafeteria although shed seemed like an intelligent person by the light of day was in fact a nutcase and now she had his home phone number frannie was righthe shouldnt have it on his business card well hardy was ready to end the conversation i dont know if a feeling no no she cut him off thats not it itswhat im saying is that people are dying here hardy had picked up his juice glass and now he put it down his fatigue was suddenly gone what do you mean people patients people who shouldnt die what kind of patients mostly old i think mostly in the icu but youre not sure no not a hundred percent he could hear the exasperation in her voice thats what i said at the beginning im not sure okay he said hoping to keep her moving along this trail thats all right im interested but nobodys really sure of anything or saying if they are right but im more interested in general conditions there anyway it doesnt have to be specificthe low morale and so on well all of thats true too the tight money the job insecurity all that but really when we were talking i couldnt put my finger on exactly what it was until tonight when i got home and it hit me what did though this was pulling teeth but they seemed to be loosening she paused a moment it sounds stupid to even say can you try i wont think its stupid no matter what promise a longer pause well she said if people keep dying when they shouldnt hardy finished for her maybe somebodys killing them yes the relief in her voice was palpable thats what i was trying to get at thats what it is do you have any idea who it might be no well maybe i dont know as i said i dont even know if its true but the first one i heard about was maybe a year ago a man had had a stroke but it was one of those situations you know where the family was hoping hed recover the prognosis was okay if he came out of his coma and they didnt want to pull the plug so they were waiting everybody thought hed be long term but then two days into it he suddenly died okay hardy said but doesnt that happen sometimes sure it doesnt necessarily mean somebody killed him no of course not she went silent again for a long beat if it was that one man everybody would have probably forgotten about it by now but he was something like the third patient to die in as many months so one of the icu nurses mentioned it in the nurses lounge theres this one weird little guy who works up there a nurse actually rajan bhutan is his name he was on duty for all of them somebody thinks he might be killing patients no not really i dont even know why i mentioned that i mean nobody thought about it at the time but thenit kept happening it kept happening hardy repeated how often i dont know i really dont know but often enough he heard her breathe out heavily the load off but hardy put another one right on do you know if anyones gone to the police about this about this man rajan no i dont know if someone had wouldnt we have heard youd think so and she chopped off the thought and hardy jumped on it what nothing a pause really nothing rebecca please you were going to say something the decision took a while welllets just say that it would be hard to keep working if anybody went to the police or the newspaper or anything i mean look at dr kensing and baby emily imagine if it got out that portola was killing its patients theres a culture there thatsshe sought the wordselfprotective i guess most cultures are he said but i dont know if i can believe it about this youre saying the administration wouldnt want to know if one of their staff is killing patients oh theyd want to know all right they just wouldnt want anybody else to know its like bad doctors whats like bad doctors a little laugh well basically there are none what does that mean it means every doctor on the staff is great until theyre transferred to say illinois they get great references maybe even a raise and moving expenses why because there are no bad doctors and no whistleblowers this was a sobering statement and rebecca simms reacted to it her voice went hollow nearly inaudible and im not being one now mr hardy ive got three children and my husband and they all need me to keep this job i dont know anything for certain i just thought it might help you to know the general conditions as you called them we know mr markham was killed dont we maybe that changes something maybe somebody could go to the police i dont think thats going to happen i mean what would they say theyd say what you just said to me but its all so nebulous there isnt anytheres no real proof there would be bodies hardy refuted her in his calmest voice they could autopsy the bodies havent they done postmortems anyway at least on one or two of them i dont know i dont think the families usually she trailed off repeated that she just didnt know anyway youre not part of this i mean here at the hospital maybe you can do something hardy realized that this was as good as it was going to get at least for tonight maybe i can he said ill try anyway he thanked rebecca for the call you were right it was important and i dont think theres really any reason for you to be afraid ill keep you out of whatever i do you were brave to call me he heard the gratitude in her voice thank you she said youre a good man im sorry it was so late when he hung up he remained at the table unmoving for a long while he hadnt been able to keep the phone call very short after all and no doubt frannie was by now asleep even if she wasnt the mood would have passed had already passed by the time she went upstairs rebecca simms had called him a good man but he wasnt feeling much like one at the moment eventually he finished his juice got up and took the glass into the kitchen where he rinsed it in the sink he was drying it when he heard a recognizable something behind him he turned to see his son one foot resting on the other one squinting at him in the doorway hey bud he said quietly whatcha doin vincent wasnt quite a teenager yet but most of the little boy in him was recently gone now his hair was buzzed short and his ears stuck out while the frame that had tended to a round softness had become lanky nearly skinny i couldnt get to sleep hardy came over bent down to him you havent been asleep yet all night the boy sat on his knee threw an arm around his neck no im having bad dreams what about where you keep disappearing were all in this forest and youre just going off for a minute to do something and then we wait and wait until mom says shes going to go looking for you but we beg her not to go because then she wont come back either but then she goes and the beck and i are left there and we start calling after her which is when i wake up hardy didnt have to use much imagination to come up with the underpinnings of this scenario although vincent certainly wasnt using it as a guilt trip he hoped he wasnt that sophisticated yet if it was his sister hardy wouldnt have been so sure he pulled him closer which at this time of night his son would still accept well im here he said comfortingly and if you woke up that means you were asleep doesnt it which means you could get to sleep after all couldnt you the lawyer arguing making his point i guess so vincent said come on ill tuck you back in but vincents bed in the room behind the kitchen hadnt been slept in at all he pointed to the back of the house hardys old office im in the becks room mom said it was okay they got to the connecting door and hardy noted the heap of blankets next to his daughters bed why are you in here hardy thinking it was no wonder his son wasnt sleeping soundly on the hardwood floor you know the beck she gets scared vincent whispered hardy knew fanned by her schools various awareness programs rebeccas profound and random fearsabout death teen suicide stranger abduction aids drug addiction and so many morehad reached crisis proportions about a year before i thought wed worked most of those out whats she still afraid of just the dark mostly and being alone sometimes interpreting his fathers heavy sigh vincent hastened to add protecting her its not every night shes way better than she was good i thought so do you have a futon or anything to lay on under those blankets no i sleep good just on the floor i see that hardy said except for the bad dreams and being awake at twelve thirty but hardy spoke in a conspiratorial not critical tone the two guys in the house had their own relationshipthey had to stick together lets get you something though okay so they grabbed cushions from the chairs in vincents room and put them on the floor as he got settled hardy pulled the blankets over him you could probably get in your own bed now and the beck wouldnt notice but he shook his head happy to be important thats okay she needs me here sometimes girls do you know dad hardy rubbed his hand over his sons buzz cut vincent wasnt meaning to twist the knife in his hearthe was honing his little man chops which hopefully someday he would put to better use than his father did i know hardy said his hand rubbed the bristly head again are we still not kissing each other good night this nightly ritual had ended only a couple of months before just after christmas but occasionally when vincents guard was down or nobody else in the family was around hed forget that it wasnt cool to kiss dad anymore tonight hardy got lucky and figuring it was going to have to be one of the very last times held onto the hug an extra millisecond okay get some sleep vin i will now thanks dad youre welcome want to hear a joke hardy halfway to his feet summoned his last unit of patience one he said what do you get when you turn an elephant into a cat i dont know no youve got to try okay im trying watch my eyes are closed he silently counted to three okay i give up what you really dont know an elephant into a cat think vin he stood up a cat vincent said you turn an elephant into a cat you get a cat get it good one hardy said you ought to tell it to uncle abe hed love it for reasons that eluded him he stalked the house front to back several times rearranged the elephants yet again then he sat for a while in the living room until he was fairly certain that vincent had dozed off he came all the way into the becks room again leaning down over the cushions and then the bed to make out the dim outlines of his childrens faces calm and peaceful now in sleep he eventually finally made it up to the master bedroom there he doublechecked the alarm to find that it was stillagainset for he would have to issue a home edict making his alarm clock off limits except for him and frannie he moved it ahead two hours in bed with his wife breathing regularly beside him he wondered briefly about all the subliminal communication going on in his house among his family he and frannie with the elephants the becks now unspoken but still clearly upsetting fears vincents last joke an obvious attempt to keep his father in the room another few seconds although he would never simply ask the dynamic suddenly seemed to have shifted and hardy at least felt adrift moving among the rest of them with a kind of gravitational connection but nothing really solid holding them together he lay awake now echoes of his son unable to sleep despite his exhaustion his memory had dredged up a contradiction that now gnawed at him earlier in the day rebecca simms had derided the idea that someone had killed tim markham in the hospital it was ridiculous shed said it must have been an accident or hed simply just died which shed reminded him people do but by tonight such deathsunexplained possible homicideshad become common a regular feature during the past year or more at portola he wanted to call her back and clarify her positionmaybe hed broken through the culture barrier at the hospital where criticism wasnt tolerated and then forced her to consider the unthinkable with markham and it had awakened other ghosts but the facts of the deaths aloneif they were facts if they could be provenwere staggering in their implications and not just for his client although kensing was going to be in the middle of whatever transpired for hardy it would mean more hours greater commitment escalated involvement less time with his wife less connection with his children less interest in the daily rhythms of his home it also meant that he was truly putting himself in harms way if someone whether it was this rajan bhutan or someone else at portola had in fact killed again and again and if hardy was going to be involved in exposing those crimes then he was going to be in that persons sights he turned again onto his side and might even have drifted off into a semblance of a dream state where he was swimming in turbulent waters with some of picos sharks circling snapping at him closing in then somethingsome settling of his house a random noise outsidesent a surge of adrenaline through him and he threw his covers off and sat bolt upright in bed his breath came in ragged surges it woke frannie up dismas are you all right what time is it im okay im okay but he really wasnt that largely unacknowledged yet pervasive fear that rebecca simms had described at portola seemed to be stalking him as well even the familiar darkness in his own bedroom felt somehow sinister as though something terrible lurked hidden just at the edge of it he tried to laugh off the imaginings for what he told himself they wereirrational terrors in the wake of a nightmare but they held their grip finally feeling foolish he switched on his bedlight for a moment nothing of course nothing still it took a long while before his breathing became normal eventually he let himself back down and pulled the covers over him after a minute he turned and settled spoon fashion against his wife before his brain could start running again sleep mercifully claimed him kensing finished his morning rounds at portolas icu and walked out to the nurses station waiting for him there was the tall and thin figure of portolas administrator michael andreotti who wanted a private word with him they walked silently together down one long hallway then took the elevator to the ground floor where andreotti led the way into an empty conference room next to his own office in the admin wing and then closed the door behind them by this time kensing had a good idea of what was coming but he asked anyway so whats this about there was no love lost between the two men and the administrator wasted no time on niceties im afraid that the board has decided to place you on leave for the time being i dont think so they cant do that ive got a contract andreotti more or less expected this response he had the paperwork on him and he handed over the letter its not my decision doctor as i said the board has decided kensing snorted derisively the board you mean ross finally seeing his chance andreotti felt no need to respond whats his excuse this time its clearly explained in the letter but there seem to be too many questions involving you related to mr markhams death thats bullshit i didnt have anything to do with that andreottis mouth turned down at kensings unfortunate use of profanity thats not the boards point there is the appearance andreotti was in bureaucrat mode he might as well have been a mannequin he was only there to deliver the letter and the message and to see that the boards will was implemented what appearance theres no appearance andreotti spread his hands its really out of my control doctor if you want to appeal the decision i suggest you call dr ross in the meantime youre not to practice either here or at the clinic what about my patients ive got to see them weve scheduled other physicians to cover your caseload starting when immediately im afraid youre afraid i bet you are kensings temper flared for an instant you ought to be andreotti backed up a step are you threatening me kensing was tempted to run with it put some real fear into this stooge but starting with glitskys visit last night he was beginning to get a sense of how bad things could really get with this murder investigation this suspicion over him some reserve of selfprotectiveness kicked in this is wrong was all he said glancing down at the papers in his hand he turned on his heel and walked out it wasnt yet in the morning the storm had finally blown over the sky was washed clean deep blue and cloudless kensing was back at his home in the living room of his condominium he moved forward and forced open one of the windows letting in some fresh air then he walked back to his kitchen where glitsky had skewered him last night the lieutenants teacup was still in the sink it was one of a set hed inherited from his parents after his dad had died and now he abstractedly turned on the water to wash it then lifted the dainty thing carefully there was a window over the sink as well and kensing simply stopped all movement suddenly staring out over the western edge of the city seeing none of it the cup exploded in his hand shattering from the force of his grip he looked down in a cold distracted fury the blood where the shards had cut him ran over his hand and pooled in the white porcelain saucer amid the broken fragments in the bottom of the sink jeff elliot had his home number from the baby emily days and called him twenty minutes later hed been hounding parnassus for stories lately and hed heard the news about the administrative leave this morning probably not too long after kensing had gotten it himself elliot offered to let him tell his side to a sympathetic reporter who was covering the whole story soup to nuts he could come right by if kensing could spare an hour or so when he arrived elliot wheeled himself into the kitchen hed been here before during baby emily and knew his way around after he sat his first comment was about the several bandaids on kensings hand i was trying to slash my wrists in despair i guess i aimed wrong the doctor laughed perfunctorily and offered an explanation dont pick up a butcher knife by the blade youd think id have learned that by now somewhere along the way deftly he changed the subject hey i loved your article on ross by the way you captured him perfectly elliot nodded in acknowledgment what motivated that guy to become a doctor in the first place ill never know he seems to care about patients like the lumber companies care about the rain forests but then he got down to business so they finally laid you off eventually they got around to personalities at parnassus the players elliot said hed been talking a lot with tim markhams executive assistant a bitter apparently soontobejobless young man named brendan driscoll sure i know brendan everybody knows brendan apparently he knows you too you had heated words in the hospital kensing shrugged he wouldnt leave the icu when markham was there i had to kick him out he wasnt very happy about it why was he even there if hes just a secretary bite your tongue jeff brendans an executive assistant and dont you forget it so whats his story whys he so down on you it must be a virus thats going around im surprised you havent caught it but the real answer is that brendans one of those hyperefficient secretaries thats all his job is his whole life hed been with markham since before he came on with parnassus anyway he scheduled every aspect of markhams life including ann although lets leave that off the record your wife ann he nodded shenow she really doesnt like him but brendans one of those people who identifies so completely with their boss that they really come to believe they can do no wrong themselves id take him and anything he says with a grain of salt well i did for my purposes but he could hurt you he wants everybody to know how close markham was to firing you how you were true enemies well hes halfright there kensing replied we didnt get along but he wasnt going to fire me in fact if anything he was on my side he knew what hed done to me with ann if he fires me whats it going to look like id sue him and the company for a billion dollars and id win and he knew it so what were all the reprimand letters about a shrug markham covering his ass with the board thats all hes trying to keep costs down get those uppity doctors like me in line but they just wont listen especially me im afraid ive got a bad attitude im not a team player but tim couldnt touch me but thats changed now with ross at the helm kensings expression grew more serious ross is a big problem in fact i should tell my lawyer theres a good argument to be made that killing markham was the worst thing i could do if i wanted to keep my job the truth is that markham was the only thing that stood between me and ross now hes gone if i listen real carefully i can even now hear the ice beginning to crack under me there was the faint sound of a key turning in a lock and a door slammed behind them kensing was halfway to standing up when they heard a womans voice echoing out of the hallway somebody could sure use a good fuck about now oh a midthirties modigliani woman with frizzy hair was standing in the entrance to the kitchen seeing elliot at the table she brought her hand to her mouth in a cliche of surprise oh shit she turned to kensing with a what can you do look and threw her hands up theatrically well this might be a good time for introductions kensing was up now and moving toward the woman judith this is jeff elliot from the chronicle jeff meet judith cohn sorry she said to the room ill just sink through the floor now ill get over it elliot said occasionally i could use one myself it turned out that cohn wasnt rosss biggest fan either that son of a bitch he cant just lay you off she said fuming you shouldve just stayed there working kensing was standing by the sink again and he shook his head andreotti had a call in to security they showed every inclination to escort me out if i didnt want to go alone cohn stood up in the kitchen walked to its entrance slapped the wall and turned back to face the men those fucking idiots they cant elliot suddenly snapped his fingers and interrupted her judith cohn youre the judith cohn she stopped her eyes glaring in anger and caution i must be i guess is there another one but elliot didnt shrink as a reporter he was used to asking questions that made people uncomfortable youre judith cohn from the lopez case thats me she answered in cold fury infamously bad diagnostician perhaps child killer kensing came forward judith he said with sympathy come on suddenly the spunk seemed to go out of her she came back to the kitchen table pulled out a chair and sat on it thats not going to go away is it and i guess youre right maybe it shouldnt it wasnt you kensing said it wasnt your fault whoa up elliot said wait a minute he was leaning back in his wheelchair focusing on first one of the doctors then the other finally he settled on cohn look im sorry your name just clicked i wasnt trying to be accusatory cohns face was hard and bitter but the name clicks doesnt it it wasnt that long ago elliot said apologetically im a newspaperman i remember names he scratched at his beard and the kids name was ramiro right were not opening this can of worms again jeff the topics not on the table but cohn raised her hand to stop him its all right eric its past now not so long past markham sure wasnt over it he is now cohn obviously took some comfort in the thought actually this might be a good time to tell somebody the facts she turned to elliot you know the basic story right this kid goes to urgent care with his mom hes got a fever sore throat funkylooking cut on his lip elliot nodded recalling some other doc had seen him a couple of days before and told him he had a virus kensing spoke up right so this night judith is at the clinic swamped overwhelmed really she sees ramiro and sends him home with some amoxicillin and tylenol and two days later elliot concluded hes in the icu with the flesheating disease kensing nodded necrotizing fasciitis elliot remembered it all clearly now the flesheating disease was always news and when there was a local angle it tended to get everybody worked up so hed heard of it and had even heard the rumors about judith cohnsamong many othersalleged part in the tragedy the official story didnt include her by name however and elliots own followup inquiries at the hospital were met with what hed come to expectthe typically evasive parnassus administrative fandango that left all doctors infallible all administrative decisions without flaw hed never gone to press because hed never felt he had it exactly right but cohn was telling him now in a voice heavy with regret theyre right i should have recognized it kensing shrugged maybe the first doc who saw him could have too but neither of your diagnoses are what killed him what do you mean eric elliot asked i mean that at every step in the treatment parnassus took too long deciding what they could afford to do to save him ramiro didnt have the right insurance there was a glitch on one of the forms in his file was this test covered was the oxygen covered who was going to pay he angrily shook his head long story short they were counting pennies all the way and it compromised his care fatally cohns eyes had gone glassy the memory still painful to her elliot asked her gently you didnt treat him at all after his initial visit to the clinic no i never saw him again except at his funeral kensing took it up but did that stop markham from singling her out within the physicians group as the primary point of failed care thats the impression i got elliot admitted but nobody would go on the record everybody got that impression kensing said of course what it really was was markham looking for a scapegoat he himself had been the point man for the lame explanations of what we were not doing and why judith was his way to take the heat off him fortunately the physicians group went to bat for her at least enough so i wouldnt lose my job she added with real bitterness the only consolation is that i saw luzthe motherat the funeral she seemed to understand she didnt blame me she blamed markham markham elliot asked how did she know markham even existed cohn obviously thought it was a good question you remember that puff piece they did on him in san francisco magazine it was lying out everywhere in the system that that poor woman went with her sick boy markhams happy face and how he cared so deeply for his patients she still had the cover with her at the funeral she showed me and you want to know the supreme irony there kensing asked it wasnt markham either in fact theyd all been rosss decisions ross is the chief medical director he makes those calls the truth is that ross lost that kid singlehandedly and nobody seems to have a clue a silence settled after a minute elliot spoke do you live here judith she stays over sometimes kensing answered quickly then added why i was wondering if she was here last tuesday morning it was judiths turn to ask why elliot felt he had to tell them that in talking with the hospital staff checking the records he had discovered that eric had been well over an hour late for work on the morning markham had been hit kensing closed his eyes squeezed his temples with one hand looked across at elliot i dont even remember that was i and what would it mean if i was it would mean you didnt have an alibi for the time of the hitandrun accident elliot turned to judith and you could corroborate the time he left for work thats the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard she said now someone thinks eric drove the hitandrun car too no one necessarily thinks it elliot said ive just heard the question thats all what idiots judith said well idiots or no elliot said you ought to appreciate what other people might be saying i think im getting a feel for it eric answered wearily tuesday night i was here judith said does that help yeah kensing said but that was midnight he turned to jeff i stopped by the markhams judith was asleep when i got home cohn gave the subject a minutes more reflection then shook her head come on youre in the hospital working your normal job which means youre not some criminal youre a regular person with a decent career suddenly an accident victim comes in and theres a good chance hes going to die now it turns out that you know this person not only that but hes somebody you hate enough to want to kill to kill and just like that hes delivered to you and you decide on the spur of the moment to take this tremendous and probably unnecessary risk and make sure he dies where they might be able to trace it back to you judith sat straight up dripping ridicule please except that from what i hear thats essentially what happened elliot said soberly hardys morning had been awful hed slept fitfully with rebecca simmss news percolating somewhere in his unconscious unknown dead people featured in several halfremembered dreams and he was up and out of bed before after the kids were off at school damned if hed call glitsky for the company hed walked briskly alone for an hour to the beach and back but he hadnt warmed up first so the exercise had left him feeling tight and old one of freemans clients had parked in his space under the building and by the time he went to get his car back from where hed parked it on the street hed gotten a ticket finally just before lunchtime after a morning of reviewing bills and other mail hed ignored for the past week and before he left the office to go to the chronicle building he placed a call to homicide when he was fairly sure the lieutenant would be at lunch and sure enoughhis first stroke of luck the whole dayglitsky had been out now he sat on a low filing cabinet in the cubicle that was elliots office on the ground floor of the chronicle building his frustration with kensing surfaced in an overformal tone i confess to being somewhat surprised to learn at this late date that he has a girlfriend we talked last night on the phone for hours i asked him to tell me everything important about his life he could think of and he never mentioned her judith elliot said really pretty but maybe its not an important relationship maybe its one of those modern things where they just have incredible sex every couple of hours but otherwise dont even like each other wouldnt that be horrible awful hardy remained somewhat distracted do you know when they got together no why because itd be nice to know if she was in the picture before he and ann separated maybe his wife leaving didnt break his heart after all you should ask him i will but itd be swell if he volunteered some of this stuff i didnt even know he was the leak on baby emily was he jeffs open face was the picture of innocence but hardy hadnt stopped by the chronicle to talk about his client he wanted to know if elliot had heard any rumors about a rash of unexplained and unexpected deaths at portola no but the thought of it of the story in it lit up the reporters eyes how big a rash i dont really know my source wasnt sure of the details or really even of the bare facts but she seemed pretty levelheaded and she was definitely scared so what did she say hardy gave him a fairly accurate recounting of his talk with rebecca simms about halfway through elliot pulled a pad around and began taking a few notes when hardy had finished elliot said hed like to talk to her i can ask her hardy replied but i got the feeling that even talking to me made her nervous evidently the administration at portola likes to keep a tight lid on their internal affairs people who talk become unemployed pretty quick okay so help me where do i look they both came up with it at the same time kensing jeff closed the door to his cubicle and put on the speakerphone kensing told him that yes judith was still there but shed worked the night shift at the clinic and had gone in to bed he was just hanging out he said windows open reading a book it was the first one hed read in maybe a year max byrds grant fantastic the best first sentence he could remember reading anywhere start with his horrible mother isnt that great elliot agreed that it was a fine line but hed called because dismas hardy was here with him in his office and they wanted to ask him about something when hardy had finished with rebecca simmss story of unexplained deaths at portola kensing was silent long enough for elliot to ask him if he was still there yeah im thinking then i cant say the idea hasnt crossed my mind but people are always dying in the icu i mean they dont get in there until theyre critical to begin with so what youre asking i take it is whether people died who shouldnt have died right are we off the record here jeff i dont need any more bad press right now okay sure jeff wasnt crazy about agreeing but under the circumstances there was nothing else he could do while were being formal and hardy no longer had any intention of being anything but formal in his relations with this client this conversation isnt privileged either just so you know all right so what are you suggesting some kind of rampant malpractice or something more serious im not suggesting anything hardy said im asking if anything has struck you well id be surprised if weve filed many eightohfives ill go that far what are those hardy asked reports to the state medical board when a doctor screws up seriously enough for the administration to suspend his clinical privileges for more than thirty days then the hospitals supposed to file an eightohfive with the state theyre also supposed to forward it to the national practitioner data bank which is federaland never goes away you get listed in the data bank your career is toast so why dont these things get turned in hardy asked youre a lawyer and youre asking me that youre a doctor and some hospital writes you up what do you do you sue the bastards of course youre a patient who finds out your hospital hired a bad doc you sue the hospital everybody sues everybody elliot couldnt resist i always assumed you lawyers loved that part he said to hardy but hardy was hearing something else altogether are you telling me eric that portolas got these doctors and knows it and theyre not filing these reports let me answer that by saying that we have people on the staff whom i would not personally choose as my own physician so what really happens when some doctor messes up hardy asked couple of things first you notice i mentioned the magic thirtyday suspension from clinical privileges so instead you get grounded for twentynine days ergo no eightohfive right youre within the guidelines and no national database are there any portola doctors on this database jeff was always chasing the story how can i find out you cant kensings voice was firm the public cant get access to it for obvious reasons although prospective employers can in any event theres another way reporting doesnt happen its probably more common and whats that hardy asked well the eightohfives are based on peer reviews other doctors elliot said right and theres some feeling among doctors especially now at portola that were all in this shit storm together so we better protect one another if one of our colleagues isnt making the right medical decisions okay you go have an informal discussion mention the standard of care we all strive for but were all under this intense financial pressure were all working too hard all the time the bottom line is were not ratting one another out never hardy asked maybe with some egregious lapseim talking inexcusably gross fatal errorand maybe even more than one but anything less youre not going to get a peer review at portola that recommends an eightohfive most hospitals in the country id bet its close to the same story in the cubicle elliot and hardy looked at each other what about other causes of death hardy asked maybe intentional deaths this gave kensing pause what do you mean intentional maybe pulling the plug early something like that hardy considered then added maybe something like this potassium youre talking murder arent you no answer was called for do i think thats been going on at portola do you hardy asked only in my most paranoid moments elliot jumped in do you have many of those eric kensing sighed audibly there was another patient in the icu at the same time as markham did you both know that i thought there were several hardy said thats true what i meant was that there was another patient who died who was that hardys every instinct knew that he was on to something and that this was part of it his name was james lector seventyone never smoked hed developed some complications after openheart surgery and we had him on life support for a couple of weeks but he was off that and responding to treatment his vital signs had been improving i was thinking of moving him out in a few days and he died hardy said just like that no reason i could see juststopped i would never reveal a source elliot said id take your name to my grave hardy ignored him so besides this man lector he asked how many would you estimate deaths you couldnt explain actually i started keeping track last november this little logbook i have they waited he continued i thought id go back and see if there was a pattern maybe something to get them off my back elliot asked him why he started keeping track i dont know exactly i guess now that you ask i wanted my own ammunition for when they finally got around to firing me i didnt think anybody was killing patients on purpose but we were losing patients we shouldnt havelike the lopez boy jeff so if fiscal policies were affecting medical care i wanted to come back at them with that i more or less just thought the place was going to shit and i wanted some record of specifics this time the silence hung for a while finally hardy asked how many eric not including tuesday kensing said eleven whatever the special at lou the greeks would turn out to be today hardy didnt have a taste for it he was hoping he could just stick his head through the door and survey the room to see if it contained wes farrell but no such luck smack in the middle of the lunch hour the place was wall to wall three deep ordering drinks the law continued to be thirstmaking work hardy noted he pushed himself into the crowd got through the crush by the bar and made a quick tour of the room exchanging the occasional pleasantry with a familiar face but mostly moving if farrell wasnt here he didnt want to be either not least because he didnt want to run into glitsky he was still pissed off hardys call to farrells parttime secretary had luckily caught her at her desk and shed told him her boss was scheduled to be in court all day she wasnt sure if it was muni superior or federal but shed guess muni which meant the hall of justice so hardys hunch was lunch at the greeks and it turned out he was right wes had scored a back booth invisible from the front door he shared it with a large nearly full pitcher of beer and a couple of guys who in jeans and work shirts were not dressed to impress any judge hardy had ever heard of sliding in next to farrell hardy asked how he was doing so good i ought to be twins wes introduced everybody around the table it turned out that his two companionsjason and jakewere father and son which hardy had guessed as soon as hed sat down the boy jake maybe twenty years old was farrells client they were celebrating hence the beer because jakes arresting officer hadnt shown up at his preliminary hearing this morning since he was the states chief witness the prosecution had dismissed all charges hardy had better manners than to ask what those had been so they both insisted wes was a hero hes always been one of mine hardy agreed in fact thats why im here now he turned to wes something importants come up can i steal you away for a few minutes you guys mind just so long as he left the beer everything was cool they worked their way to the side doorless crowd to get throughand out into the alley where now just past noon cans of garbage basked baked and from the smell ripened in warm sunshine farrell blinked in the brightness took a deep breath and frowned i think somebody must have died near here whats up hardy was ready reaching for his inside coat pocket as they walked up toward bryant and some good air ive got a list of names here and i was curious if any of them looked familiar to you farrell took the piece of paper glanced down at it whats this about your favorite hospital a quick look up then back at the list hardy saw his eyes narrow he stopped and came up again okay i give up anybody you know one of em marjorie loring shes one of your clients with the parnassus lawsuit youre filing isnt she not exactly her kids are shes dead herself i know sos everybody else on that list did they do a postmortem on her theyd stopped in some shade in front of the bail bondsmans office at the entrance to lous farrell squinted into some middle distance trying to remember then he shook his head they always do but they probably didnt spend much time on it they knew what she died of and what was that the big c she was another one of those whoops cases as in whoops we should have really got around to looking at that a little bit sooner but when she died was it before her kids expected her to go they didnt know how long it would be exactly but he pursed his lips a muscle worked in his jawline hardy let him dredge it up although it was yeah pretty quick if i recall one of those youve got maybe three months unless it turns out to be three days three days no no figure of speech one of my few flaws i exaggerate i think it was like a week two weeks something like that and it was supposed to be three months farrell shook his head but you know how that works diz it was three months outside maybe as much as six the reality turned out to be less it happens all the time it might even have been a blessing hardy could accept that on its face but not if somebody hurried the process along do you think mrs lorings family would agree to ask for an exhumation even with the preamble the question shocked him what for a full autopsy why you think somebody killed her i think its possible suddenly farrells gaze focused down tightly a few years older than hardy a little softer in the middle wes usually affected an air of casual befuddlement some might even have read this as incompetence but hardy knew he was nobodys fool a couple of years before hed electrified the citys legal community with his defense of another lawyer a personal friend accused of murdering his wife the case was considered unwinnable even by such an eminence as david freeman but farrell had gotten his client off with a clean acquittal now he was giving hardy his complete attention what about the other ten people on your list same thing hardy didnt want to exaggerate lets say there are similar questions i want to talk to my client before we go any further of course but after i do he let it hang farrell backed into the last wedge of shade last time we talked you didnt have a client he said ive got one now you know eric kensing and you want to call him before i talk to the lorings because because for some of these names hardy indicated the list he was on duty in the hospital when they died before we exhume mrs loring and find out she didnt die of cancer id be happier knowing dr kensing wasnt on the floor taking her pulse at the time farrell admitted that that would be bad luck so they havent arrested him yet i gather at least not as of a half hour ago but things could change even as we speak farrell narrowed his eyes youre talking abe hardy nodded spoke curtly he seems a little fixated abes not dumb no hes not but he took kensings statement last night then left no arrest i guess what im trying to do is buy my client some time abe might get carried away in his enthusiasm if kensing gets arrested or indicted hes never going to work again and ive got friends who think hes a hero wes chuckled jerked a thumb toward lous those two yahoos at the booth in there think im a hero that doesnt mean anything then did your boy do it early on he said not hardy left it at that farrells eyes shifted from side to side this turn in the conversationthe objective fact of the guilt or innocence of a clientthreatened to breach a largely unspoken rule among defense attorneys but suddenly hardy knew why farrell had brought it up the friend of his for whom hed won such a stunning acquittal in whose innocence wes had believed with his whole heart turned out to have been guilty after all if you want to be sure he said youd damn well better find somebody else who did it hardy cracked a tiny smile okay then thats who im looking for but my first line of defense is to find out if these portola patients who are dying before they should are any part of this markham thing how do you propose to do that farrells expression reflected his deep skepticism certainly marjorie loring couldnt he stopped softened his look maybe i just dont get it he offered lets pretend her kids let us dig her up in the first place which is a wild assumption by the way so strout agrees to do an autopsy also not a sure thing so then they find say that potassium killed her how in the world does that help your client well right off if he wasnt there farrell waved that off okay he wasnt there when lincoln was shot either but it doesnt mean squat about markham and then what if it wasnt potassium hardy had admitted these problems to himself and had gotten to a marginally satisfying answer if some other patient at portola unconnected to markham is another murderespecially if kensing wasnt around when it happenedit might make somebody like glitsky think hes missing something he might want to fill in more blanks before they arrest kensing at this point its mostly delay frankly but im out of other great ideas well delays always a fine tactic if it works farrell clearly still wasnt convinced but if your man thought these were questionable deaths why didnt he ask for full autopsies originally i asked him the same question thats cause youre a smart fellow and whatd he say basically that all the deaths were expected anyway and from expected reasons it wasnt like these were people in the prime of health who suddenly died they were dying people who died just a little early the hospital ran postmortems sure enough they were all dead hardy shrugged essentially he put it down to just a general degradation in care at portola he moved closer and whispered conspiratorially but listen up wes the point is that if anybody at portola killed marjorie loring you win no matter what and thats because he stopped because he suddenly understood he could bring a slam dunk lawsuit on behalf of marjorie lorings children there would be no need to prove general negligence or some other malpractice issue he could begin billing immediately again if marjorie loring didnt die of natural causes but was a homicide committed in the hospital wes stood to make a pile in a very short time by doing comparatively very little ill talk to her kids he said see what we can do treya looked up from her desk to the wall clock she broke a genuine smile and rose from the chair dismas hardy esquire three oclock right on the button clarence is expecting you hell be right with you but hes got someone in with him for just another minute are you coming from upstairs she asked meaning glitskys detail no so you havent talked to abe not yet frannie told me he called last night but i got home late he really wants to talk to you and i him of course maybe you could make us an appointment isnt he coming down for this one i know clarence asked him this didnt strike hardy as good news but he covered his reaction with a smile good maybe we can chat afterwards he sat and waited aware of his nerves and his stillsmoldering anger hed spent countless hours here in the das officefrom back when hed been a young assistant da himself through his recent trials as a defense attorney in well over ninety percent of those hours thered been conflict between himself and the person on the other side of that door since jackmans appointment as da that had changed now in a few minutes he knew he was about to go back where he belonged on the defense side it was perhaps going to be a subtle shift and hopefully cordial but a real one nonetheless jackmans door opened marlene ash was inside now that he thought of it he should have expected that jackman would have asked her too she was after all going to prosecute parnassus and in all likelihood his client diz how you doin jackman boomed come on in come on in sorry were running a little late he came through the door smiling and smiling if you and marlene arent finished he began giving them every chance i dont mean to rush you im sure treya and i can find some way to pass a few more pleasant minutes jackman smiled back at him everybody was still friends marlene thought she might want to stay a while if you dont mind there were a couple of things she wanted to run by you did treya tell you ive asked abe to stop by and here he is glitsky and hardy sat on either end of the couchneither words nor eye contact between them marlene still sat in her chair jackman pulled another one up a nice little circle of friends around the coffee table hardy got right down to it i understand that in the wake of mr markham becoming a potential murder victim youve decided to convene a grand jury i hear that they are investigating not just markhams death but the whole parnassus business situation in fact i think it was even my idea originally before anybody died i just wanted you all to know that i really dont expect any huge public display to recognize my contribution here although a tasteful bust in the lobby downstairs or a small commemorative plaque in the corner at lous might be nice glitskys scar was an unbroken line through his lips the man could talk the ears off a water jug sitting back hardy extended an arm out along the top of the couch affecting a relaxed pose that he didnt feel as my friend abe points out im a believer in communicating he directed a pointed glance at glitsky then came forward on the couch i understand what some of you would like to happen next i talked to dr kensing about an hour ago he told me that his wife now claims he admitted killing markham hardy finally faced abe i figure thats what you must have called me about to give me a headsup that you were bringing him in glitsky said nothing hardy continued but of course since you interviewed my client despite my explicit request that you not do so perhaps you were prepared to dispense with a courtesy call too a muscle worked in glitskys jaw the scar stood out in clear relief he went on i think the only reason hes not already in jail is because you decided to wait until clarence was ready to sign the warrant the expressions around the room told hardy that hed pegged it exactly but thats not why im here he said im here to keep my client out of jail glitsky snorted good luck im not going to need luck if all youve got is the wifes story you dont have any case thatll fly in front of a jury you must know that marlene took this moment to get on the boards according to abe weve got plenty to go with dismas if the mans killed five people he shouldnt be on the streets marlene please lets not insult each others intelligence dr kensing had no motive in the world to harm the family that you know glitsky said again hardy turned directly to face him am i to assume that means that you have discovered one jackman cleared his throat and answered for glitsky we assume diz that the murders of markham and his family are related i think you would agree with that as a working hypothesis wouldnt you but thats really not germane dr kensing has plenty of motive for markham plus means and opportunity but no evidence clarence no real evidence its mostly some motive dont shit a shitter diz marlene said first we dont have some motive weve got a ton of motive and nobody else has any second we know when markham was killed and dr kensing was right there moreover she went on calmly markham got killed by drugs administered through an iv and your client is not exactly a janitor hes got access so weve got motive means and opportunity and not the slightest doubt about these facts hardy repeated his mantra but no physical evidence no direct evidence nobody saw him do it and no physical evidence shows he did it you can prove that maybe he did it but maybe he didnt and that i need hardly remind you is reasonable doubt his wife says he admitted it glitsky growled thats evidence kensing told her he pumped him full of shit a day before the autopsy before anybody knew he was murdered oh you didnt catch that detail yet glitsky cleared his throat i called you last night i thought maybe we could talk about that maybe you didnt get the message i told you not to interview my client hardy shot back maybe you didnt get my message hardy fought to control his temper this wasnt the way to get what he wanted he turned to ash so his wife who hates him says he killed her lover thats it youll never convict on that but ash remained calm i believe with the rest of the evidence that in fact i might dismas might is not particularly strong marlene you want to help us do better is that it glitskys tone was glacial as a matter of fact i have a suggestion that might have that effect hardy said i wont pretend that dr kensing isnt my main concern i know youre about to arrest him hell maybe youve already got your warrant hardy waited but no one admitted that which meant maybe it wasnt too late he sucked in a breath it was party time im going to do a little preamble he began surprise hardy ignored glitsky made his pitch directly to jackman look lets say you bring in kensing and charge him with murder abe could arrest him today ill even grant you that the wifes statement would almost certainly get you an indictment if you put her before the grand jury in either case youd have to give me discovery of course discovery included everything about the prosecutionphysical evidence exhibits testimony police reports and so on the defense had the absolute right to the prosecutions case this was law a but hardy didnt think it was a bad idea to remind everybody that one way or the other he was going to see all the evidence they had anyway it was automatic but you havent arrested him yet he continued or brought him before the grand jury so hes not been charged and therefore theres no compulsion for you to share anything with me yet is the preamble over glitsky asked hardy didnt even acknowledge the interruption he kept his eyes on jackman what i propose is a horse trade he pressed ahead quickly what you really want is parnassus clarence you know it i know it everybody here knows it you want to find out where the rot is and cut it out but youve got to be careful you dont cut it so badly that you kill it if parnassus goes belly up the people wholl take the biggest hit by far are the city employees now this would be legitimate bad news for a lot of good people but its the worst possible political scenario for you clarence if you want to keep this job and continue the good work youve started jackmans mouth turned down slightly in distaste hardy didnt think it was only over his brownnosing hed hit a nerve as he hoped he would all right so how does your client fit in jackman asked he fits because everythings mellow over at parnassus only so long as youre looking for whoever killed their ceo theyre all expecting you to do that so the corporate types wont see your people showing up and go rushing out to shred their files and whatever other obstructions theyll come up with but once you arrest kensing youve got no pretext he stopped to let the notion sink in but marlene didnt have to wait with all respect diz thats bullshit the grand jury can look anywhere they want anytime they want its got nothing to do with your client im not arguing with that marlene you can arrest him and continue to investigate at parnassus you have every right still he went back to jackman heres the citys health care provider already reeling from near bankruptcy terrible cash flow problems subzero morale and now the loss of its chief executive if word gets out that youre trying to shut the place down thats not our intention marlene said but hardy shook his head it doesnt matter if you arrest kensing and then continue poking around thats what its going to look like which means the shits going to hit the fan you all know this town everything gets exaggerated everythings an issue whats going to happen when it looks like lots of city workers arent going to have medical care it will not be pretty all this was well and good and possibly true but glitsky wasnt buying it at all and the way we avoid this potential catastrophe is we dont arrest your client only until the grand jury can do its job say thirty days thirty days glitsky was apoplectic are you out of your mind if he killed markham and my evidence says he did he likely killed his whole family too i dont care if it brings down the whole federal government the man belongs in jail hardy turned to ash the case sucks marlene you arrest him and you know whats going to happen parnassus goes in the toilet and after it does if kensing beats the case at trial you guys all go with it but with all the arguing jackman still hadnt lost the thread you mentioned trading diz youre asking us to give you thirty days and your discovery hardy added glitsky threw up his hands and stood up how bout a chauffeur too maybe some massage therapy hardy kept ignoring him the das face was lost in concentration all right for purposes of this discussion and your discovery not a chance no way we do this clarence ill go bring him in on a nowarrant before that happens jackman filled his large chest with air he had glitsky by an inch or two and thirty pounds and all of it was never more visible than it was now when it was clearly so tightly controlled his voice when it came was a deep bassoon of authority that you will not do lieutenant he took another slow breath then continued in a conversational tone youve had ample time before this to arrest dr kensing without a warrant abe but youre the one who brought me into this decision loop and now its mine to make i hope thats abundantly clear glitsky couldnt find his voice he stared around the room in open disbelief if not downright hostility jackman ignored him and turned to hardy thirty days and discovery in return for what in return for his testimony in front of the grand jury the sense of anticlimax was palpable glitsky was shaking his head in bewilderment that hardy had wasted all of their time and effort for so little marlenes face reflected a similar reaction even jackman folded his arms over his chest and cocked his head to one side but his eyes at least still probed hardy felt the topic wasnt closed look clarence as it stands now when you get kensing in front of the grand jury im going to tell him to take the fifth youll be lucky if you get his name this way youve got marlene here he turned to her imagine this youve got your primary murder suspect answering any question you might have without his lawyer there its a prosecutors dream but she was unconvinced its not my dream diz youll just have more time to give him a story which hell stick to she looked to her boss this wont work sir hes not offering anything really but i am marlene think about this im offering an insiders look inside parnassus exactly what you all need we can get that anyway diz where from who everybody else who works there is going to be covering for themselves or their employer even the other doctors thats not true the grand jury will protect them no matter what they say in there thats exactly what its for dismas so people can talk freely its what its designed to do right marlene but it doesnt always work that way you wont find too many doctors who are going to want to help you in your efforts to cut off the source of their paychecks but even if all you want is to go after my client on markham youve got him all to yourself for as long as you want no relevance issues no inadmissibility no defense objections total open season marlenes stare was unyielding glitsky had moved over to the doorsill and was leaning against it a sullen statue what if he kills again he asked his own wife for example id feel pretty bad if she died wouldnt you jackman broke in between them it seems to me hes had ample opportunity to kill his wife if he wanted to abe but now with her statement hes got a better reason to so we protect her jackman said or move her or both and it seems to me that dismas has a point if only out of selfpreservation kensing isnt going to do anything while he knows that he is our chief suspect in another murder hardy knew that in some ways jackmans inexperience was showing murderers rarely acted rationally but he thought cynically thats what politics was about the inexperienced taking control hed take some selfserving selfdeception if it kept his client out of jail jackman turned again to glitsky marlene and i were talking about these very issues before dismas got here abe we agreed then that the parnassus investigation will take on a very different cast as soon as we make an arrest on markham and we were trying to strategize to address the problem it seems to me now that dizs solution might have merit glitskys scar was a tight thick rope down through his lips the mans a murderer clarence jackman wasnt going to fight about it if anything he was judicious and calm nodding patiently he may be of course but as weve said here i really dont believe hes a danger to the community now i dont want to close the door to revisiting that assessment daily if need be but in the meanwhilehe turned to hardyim inclined diz to accept your assessment on parnassus i dont want them spooked i dont the concession speech was interrupted by the door slamminghardbehind glitsky as he stormed out beyond his clients freedom and the prosecutions discovery hardy had originally intended to make yet another request to the da it was normally supposed to be jackmans call and by asking his permission hardy might continue to succeed in his little charade that cooperation was in fact his middle name but glitskys abrupt withdrawal had cast a pall over those whod stayed and he decided that to ask for more would be pushing things but the other item of business remained and the more he thought about it the less it seemed to matter if he asked jackmans permission first he needed an answer and needed it now his client was still in big trouble and he wasnt really going behind anybodys back by asking john strout if the medical examiner found anything as a result of hardys request he would report it to glitsky and jackman anyway hardy wasnt hiding anythinghis motives or his actions or so he told himself he walked out the back door of the hall along the covered outdoor corridor that led to the jail on the left and the morgue on the right the air smelled faintly of salt water but he also caught the scent of flowers from the huge commercial market around the corner he was feeling as though hed accomplished quite a bit during the day when he was done with strout hed try to remember to buy a bouquet for his wife even his daughter it was friday evening the weekend loomed long and inviting and maybe he and his family could fashion some quality time together if they worked at it it turned out that strout was cutting up someone in the cold room at the moment but the receptionist told hardy he shouldnt be too long did he want to wait he told her he thought he would the medical examiners regular officeas opposed to the morguewas a veritable museum of ancient and modern weapons and instruments of torture always an interesting place to visit the room made no concession to safety all of strouts bizarre stuff was out in the open to admire and hold and if you were foolhardy enough to try out if one of his cityworker assistants ever became disgruntled hardy thought he could have a field day going postal herestab a few folks with switchblades or bowie knives blow up others with hand grenades shoot up the rest with any number of automatic weapons from the arsenal hardy sat on the bench at the garrotered silk kerchief and allconsidering his victory upstairs and pondering both the wisdom and the odds for success of his next move the important thing he reminded himself again was to keep his client out of jail he knew that between glitskys constant press marlenes handling of the grand jury and kensings difficult and unpredictable behavior the thirty days jackman had promised him could evaporate like the morning fog hardy had to have something more in spite of the risk that what he was about to suggest might in fact strengthen the case against his client he realized that it came down to a gamble and this made him uncomfortable but he didnt feel he had a choice the noose was tightening around his clients neck his guts told him that it was worth the risk but if he was wrong you want i can get that snot rag around your throat and tighten it down just a little bit im told its quite effective for the libido strout was referring to the garrote and even more grimly to erotic asphyxia the heightened orgasm which occurred during hanging and some other forms of strangulation seems to be all the rage these past few years tho my own feelin is that it just plain aint worth the trouble but maybe im wrong lots of folks seem to give it a try anyway how yall doing the two men made small talk for a couple of minutes while strout shuffled his messages after hed gotten behind his desk and hardy had moved to a different chair they got down to it when hardy finished strout scratched around his neck let me get this straight he said at last youre comin in here as a private citizen askin me to autopsy another portola patient who died the same day as mr markham if you havent already done it whats the subjects name james lector strout shook his head nope havent done it but they do an automatic pm at the hospital you know that and they never miss anything do they this was a good point and strout acknowledged it with a small wave how close was the time of death to markhams within a few minutes actually if i take a look what exactly would i be lookin for that i dont know strout took off his hornrims blew on them put them back on the medical examiner had a mobile elastic face and it seemed to stretch in several directions at once maybe i dont see what youre gettin at if youre sayin glitsky thinks your client killed mr markham then hows it sposed to help your client if another body turns up with potassium in it on the same day it wont hardy agreed im hoping its not potassium what he did hope was that james lector was unexplained death number twelve it wouldnt clear kensing but it might take some of the onus off his client for markhams death either way he continued isnt it better if we know for sure what lector died of always strout agreed he thought another moment and why would i want to order this autopsy again hardy shrugged you decided that lector was a suspicious death dying as he did within minutes of another homicide in the same room at the same hospital the medical examiners head bobbed up and down once or twice he pulled a hand grenade that he used as a paperweight over and spun it thoughtfully a few times on his blotter hardy watched the deadly sphere spin and tried not to think about what might happen if the pin came out by mistake finally strout put his hand on the grenade stopping it midspin his eyes skewered hardy over his glasses youre leavin somethin out he said not on purpose really if im doin thiswhich im not promisin yet mind youthen i want to know what youre lookin for and why hardy spread his hands hiding nothing i think theres some small but real chance that james lector is the latest in a series of homicides at portola this made strout sit up and hardy went on so lectors death may or may not have been natural and may or may not have been related to tim markhams he concluded but certainly if lector was murdered and died from a different drug than markham then theres a lot more going on at portola than meets the eye at this stage but again it wouldnt do much for your client maybe not john but i need to find some evidence of other foul play where i can make an argument that my client wasnt involved and dont tell mei realize that doesnt prove he didnt kill markham at least its somewhere to start and i need something strout was considering it all very carefully you got the lector familys permission he asked whens the funeral scheduled no and i dont know if you ordered an autopsy we wouldnt need the family to this wasnt flying and he stopped talking what i believe i mentioned that theres already been a pm if they got a cause of death theyre happy with and i say i want another look at the body its goin to ruffle feathers both at the hospital and with the family specially if like the funerals tomorrow or say this mornin and we got to dig him back up but something about the idea obviously had caught strouts interest if somebody was getting away with multiple homicides in a san francisco hospital it was his business to know about it what im sayin is o course we could do it without anybodys permission if i got a good enough reason which im not sure i do but any way we do it itd be cleaner if we asked nice and got an okay from the family ill talk to them hardy said then ill make a gentlemens deal with you diz if it gets so it doesnt make anybody too unhappy well do this but if the family makes a stink youre gonna have to go to court and convince a judge to sign an order im not gonna do it on my own hardy figured this was as good as it was going to get he didnt hesitate for an instant done he said youll be glad you did this john ten to one youre going to find something strouts expression grew shrewd ten to one eh how much you puttin up hardy gave it some thought ill go a yard he said a hundred bucks you lose and youll owe me a grand thats it youre on strout stuck out his hand and hardy hesitated one last second then took it it was friday afternoon the best time to do it joanne announced his appointment in her pleasant professional voice she of course knew all about it having typed the termination papers but she would do nothing to give it away also present kittycorner from his desk at the small conference table was costanza eu cozzie for short the human resources director at parnassus this was going to be had to be strictly by the book malachi ross behind his desk when driscoll came in didnt get up brendan he didnt bother with much of a welcoming smile have a seat driscoll was within a spit either way of forty meticulously groomed he sported a carefully trimmed mustache in an unusually attractive somehow asymmetrical face with his powerful physique and his short dark hair dyed a discrete blond at the tips he could have been sent from central casting to play a young slightly sinister ceo in any daytime soap opera from his carriage no one would surmise he was a mere secretary oras markham had always called himan executive assistant today he wore a muted blue tie and a black pinstriped business suit and he wasnt a step inside rosss door when he cast a quick eye at cozzie and knew what was up he didnt take the proffered seat instead he approached it and put his hands on the backrest i was hoping id have the opportunity to clean up tims files before we got to this he said though of course i understand but ill do what i can in the next two weeks ross made an elaborate expression of disappointment i dont think that will be necessary brendan ive decided and the board has agreed that you wont be required to stay on after today he had the thick envelope on the desk in front of him and he picked it up weve included a check in lieu of your two weeks notice and on top of that what i think youll find to be a very reasonable severance due to your long tenure with the company as well as mr markhams high regard for your services the board has approved seven months of your full salary and five more months at half as well as of course your fully vested pension and letters of recommendation from myself and several other members of the board youll also have the option to remain enrolled in the employee health plan driscoll stood rooted his mixed emotions playing on his face eventually he nodded and swallowed accepting the fait accompli thank you doctor thats very generous i assume youll be wanting my keys and parking pass and so on even as he said it he had his wallet out then reached into his pockets after hed placed all the required items on rosss desk he stood at attention in front of it for another long moment finally he cleared his throat i kept his calendar mostly on the computer at my desk although theres an incomplete hard copy in my top right drawer i havent gotten around to calling all of his appointments yet theres also some unsent correspondence and i believe a few internal memos if youd like to send someone back with me id be happy to print out but ross threw a glance prompting cozzie to speak up that wont be necessary brendan well be going through all that material in the coming weeks standard procedure is wed prefer to have you escorted from the building directly when you leave this meeting she smiled with all the warmth of a cobra we understand that this can be a little disconcerting but im sure you understand that its nothing personal some people she let it hang then shook her head and continued the contents of the closet by your desk including your sweater and other personal goods are boxed up just outside security will help you with them some of the starch had gone out of driscolls bearing he turned back to ross what are you going to do about mr markhams personal files he left very specific instructions that i shouldwell of what i should do if well take care of them ross said reassuringly dont you worry as you know mr markham left descriptions of his projects and detailed instructions for the board against just such a tragic event as this ross rose halfway out of his chair and smiled perfunctorily i did want to thank you again for your loyalty and discretion and now for your cooperation it was a dismissal and at rosss invisible sign cozzie was on her feet coming around the table with a line of inane chatter guiding the clearly shellshocked driscoll back toward the door youve got a beautiful day to start your new life i must say that look at that blue out the windows i dont remember the last time ive seen the sky so clear and to think after the storm the last few days firing brendan driscoll that officious little mouse had been the first albeit tiny ray of sunshine in his life since markhams death no sooner had cozzie left his office than he rose from his desk went over to the wet bar and poured himself a viscous shot of frozen vodka from the bottle of skyy he kept in his freezer the no doubt heartwrenching departure scene with driscoll in his reception area played itself out in about ten minutes while he savored his drink joanne buzzed him to say it was over driscoll was out of the building ross strode from his office made some lame joke to joanne and turned right down the carpeted hallway floortoceiling glass on his left made him feel almost as if he were walking in the airthe bay sparkled below him while the bay bridge already jammed up with traffic seemed close enough to touch sitting at driscolls former desk out in markhams reception area now he experienced a strange and momentary sense of dislocation in a couple of weeks he realized joanne would be sitting out here and he would have moved to the gorgeous suite behind him it was the very pinnacle of the greasy pole hed been climbing for what seemed all of his adult life at every step hed done what he had to do to get here there was no questionas the board had affirmedthat he was the best equipped to handle the job and now with markhams micromeddling and needless hypocrisy a thing of the past he believed he could turn the business side around in a matter of months if only he could keep the company afloat until then he thought it was eminently doable he had ideas sending the city that million bill for its past outpatient copays had been one of them although admittedly merely a stopgap measure short term he had the city over a barrel and long term his plans would stop the bleeding and get parnassus back to financial health while he waited for the screen to come up on the computer he pulled out the drawers of driscolls desk one by one and nodded in satisfaction theyd done a good job cleaning them all out he fully expected to find the hard files behind the locked door of markhams old office ross intended to come in over the weekend and review every page of that material but in the meantime he had an hour before close of business and another hour after that before his dinner appointment and he wanted to make sure that driscolls computer contained nothing of an embarrassing nature long ago before cash had been such a problem ross had purchased a stateoftheart computer system that he still considered one of his most astute investments the customized business program hed ordered allowed unlimited access to all files for certain employees such as cozzie and himself who were given what they called operator privileges this allowed rosss human resources department to keep tabs on nearly everything that went on the systems security programs could count actual keystrokes per hour so the department could know which secretaries were underutilized or more typically just plain lazy likewise if an employee spent too much time on the internet or wrote a screenplay or love letter on the companys time cozzie would know about it by the end of the week when the reports came out she would then review these reports with ross and together they would decide which person they would discipline for everyone was guilty of something it was ross believed a beautiful thingmake laws governing all behavior then enforce them selectively against people you dont like only brendan driscoll perhaps the worst offender in the company had managed to thwart the system he wrote love letters short stories and poetry on his computer he visited porn sites on the internet when markham was traveling he would sometimes talk to his friends on the telephone for half the day for of course the phones were integrated to the computer system as well but driscoll got away with it all because markham wouldnt let him go but now ross sat at his terminal driscoll had a password for his personal files but ross had his own operator privilege password and it trumped driscolls he typed in his own initials and password a secondary directory came up and ross involuntarily unconsciously broke a tight smile the mandarin oriental hotel one of the crown jewels of san francisco presented a look and feel of restrained opulence that malachi ross found appealing it was also within easy walking distance of his office and taking the leisurely stroll on this glorious evening was even more pleasurable than usual after the grueling few days hed just spentnot only in the immediate wash of markhams death but dealing with fallout from the citytalk broadsidehed take any comfort he could wherever he could get it there had been some comfort back at parnassusmore on eric kensing in driscolls computer files than he would have thought possible there was correspondence about his wife ann markhams responses to what appeared to be intimations of a kind of at least emotional blackmail that kensing had used to keep his job memos to file references to cash payoffs private reprimands ultimatums amazing hed printed it all out and told joanne to deliver it to the district attorney by messenger he printed out a few other files as well these he put in his own briefcase then deleted the originals from the computer nancy and the girls were up at lake tahoe for the weekend hed told her she ought to have their pilot darren fly them on up without him hed been working around the clock all week as it was and in all likelihood that schedule would continue through the weekend and for the foreseeable future hed told her on wednesday night they were in their bedroom getting ready to go out to dinner the door was open to the hallway they could hear the girls just outside playing with bette their nanny nancy gave him a quick pout she would miss him terribly especially that way glancing at the open door the voices twenty feet away she unzipped her skirt and stepping out of it dropped it to the floor turning her back to him she leaned over and rested her elbows on the antique italian writing desk by the end of their bed over her shoulder she smiled in that i dare you weve got maybe two minutes way she had and whispered urgently it would be easier to go if you gave me something to remember you by good evening dr ross and welcome again to silks you look like youre enjoying a particularly pleasant memory he snapped out of his reverie smiled perfunctorily hello victor nice to be here again right this way the maître d intoned your guest has already been here for a few minutes his guest was ron medras a very well put together athletic midforties senior vice president with biosynth which until about eight years ago had been a small drug manufacturing firm it had carved out a nice survivable niche producing generic mostly overthecounter knockoffs of aspirin tylenol babys cold and flu formula and antiinflammatories at about that time caught up in the feeding frenzy for megaearnings and exploding stock prices that were overtaking the silicon valley medras and several other likeminded executives at biosynth decided that threebedroom homes in mountain view or gilroy were all well and good but sixbedroom mansions in atherton or los altos hills all in all were better biosynth knew it could easily produce equivalent or nearequivalent product of the stuff that was making billions and billions of dollars for merck bristolmyers squibb pfizer what it didnt have was marketing aggressive marketing to big clientshospitals and hmos instead it merely worked the chain drugstores that comprised the bulk of its sales that would change tonight medras was on a typical sales call ross was not his biggest client by a long shot but he remained an important one this was because there was often resistance when a new drug of any kind came on the market and ross had been willing over and over again to list biosynths new products on the parnassus formulary nearly as soon as they were in production this often had a snowball effect san francisco wasnt a huge market but it had very high visibility that made it plenty big enough for biosynths purposes when medras went to companies ten or twenty times the size of parnassus hed be able to say to them this stuff is so good the main health care provider in san francisco has listed it on its formulary and either impressed or reassured the other medical directors would buy a couple of preprandial drinks accompanied ten or fifteen minutes of expressions of regret and sympathy from both men over the loss of tim markham remembrances of good moments with him praise for his vision leadership personality but in this phenomenal setting with an hors doeuvres plate of perhaps the best sashimi in the western hemisphere it was difficult to sustain a somber mood by the time the wine steward offered medras a tasting sip from the bottle of latour that theyd ordered to go with their asian lamb chops theyd moved along to more enjoyable topics they passed a pleasant hour discussing their golf games new toys medras had just leased a new saratoga aircraft investment tips and opportunities ross had developed a taste for hazelnut in the form of frangelico liqueur and he was enjoying his second snifter with his coffee when medras finally got around to what theyd both come to talk about biosynth had been developing a new product for the past year or so top secret up until now it had been waiting for fda approval and medras had it on good authority that the good word would be coming down in the next month or so the company had gotten ahold of a process that enabled them to make insulin at onefifth of what it now cost to produce ross put down his snifter are you talking onefifth as in twenty percent medras nodded avarice lighting his eyes and we would pass the savings along directly to you ross quickly did the math in his head a dollar a dose copays would cover that by themselves it would move the whole item from the red to the black yes we believe it would although of course there are some issues there always are but ross knew that if a company such as parnassus came onboard in a big way many of these problems could be mitigated complaints about possible rare side effects for example might not be forwarded to the government and if the new insulin made it to his formulary its credibility could be nearly instantaneous i wanted to let you know about this medras went on because the sales force will be calling on your medical staff over the next couple of weeks wed like to have enough samples out there with enough history so that when we go on sale for real people feel comfortable with the product doctors and patients alike this is really an incredible breakthrough malachi it could really make a difference ross believed him although he didnt have to the fda would make sure and if somehow it failed anyway ross didnt consider it his job to be the fdas watchdog he had his own mission which was demonstrating that good medicine and profit were not incompatible the relationships that he and other likeminded medical executives forged with biosynth and other similar companies were helping to make universal health care a reality lowercost insulin was but one example of hundreds someone had to ram it down peoples throats if need be there really was no other way and simply no such thing as a free lunch reassured that his new product would appear on the parnassus formulary as soon as the fda approved it medras paid the bill finished his own coffee and said goodbye after hed gone ross stayed at the table to finish his frangelico the room was coming alive now with welldressed couples and foursomes and he sat back for a last moment to enjoy this perk of his position then he reached down by his right foot and picked up the thin leather briefcase that medras had left for him he pushed his chair back a few inches enough so that he could open the briefcase on his lap inside were three wrapped bundles of hundreddollar bills a credit cardstyle room key and a page of biosynth letterhead on which medras had written a room number five minutes later and fortytwo floors above the city ross carried the briefcase with him as he exited the elevator and crossed the enclosed glass walkway that joined the two towers of the mandarin oriental it was full dark now and the city lights glittered far below him he always stopped here enjoying the sense of vertigo of floating above it all when he got to his door he inserted the card knocked and pushed the door open mr ross a voice sweet as music cultured and mellifluous naked she appeared from the bedroom around the corner a young and very pretty japanese woman rosss eyes fastened on a small tattoo of a dagger over her right breast it pointed straight down and ended with its tip at her nipple which was pierced by a tiny gold ring hello she said with a respectful bow i am kumiko come let me help you with your clothes something weird was happening with the weather againthe night had become nearly balmy bracco and fisk were parked in the street in front of glitskys bracco was behind the wheel his window was down and he rested his elbow on it he was chewing a toothpick that hed picked up from the counter at the sandwich shop on clement where theyd bought their reubens and dr peppers fisk had his window down too and fidgeted in his seat he slurped the last of his drink hes not coming this is stupid bracco turned his head you dont have to stay ill just tell him you had someplace to go you can take the car ill get home somehow youve got a family harlen so does he hell understand he didnt seem all that understanding this morning this was true glitsky had come to harlens desk first thing and loudly offered to transfer him to any other department immediately if he didnt want to be in homicide anymore homicide inspectors didnt cut out early did inspector fisk understand although now fisk thought it wasnt early it was nine damn oclock hes not expecting us darrel i dont care what he told you he left work early and pissed off and now hes out for the night maybe the weekend so go darrel took the keys from the ignition and flipped them into his partners lap but im staying fisk slammed his hand on the outside of the door i cant go alone is my point if we both go okay we say we tried but if its just me and youre still here bracco still had a lot of his dr pepper left and he put the straw to his mouth when he took it out he swallowed and said he told me to report every day in person yeah well hes not here if you havent noticed he wasnt in the detail when we checked in he doesnt expect you to hunt him down to report he obviously forgot all about us a shrug maybe but fisk continued to rave what if he died then what would you go report at his gravesite theres exceptions to things you know this is the first day harlen you dont make exceptions on the first day youre doing something that makes them the rule he looked up in his rearview mirror saw some headlights turn into the street here comes somebody fisk turned all the way around in his seat its not him five bucks says it is youre on furious at what he had taken to be jackmans and ashs usurpation of his arrest prerogative as well as hardys scheming lawyer games at his expense glitsky hadnt been in the mood for any more work today they could all go to hell by the time he got home hed decided to take the whole weekend off as well he pitched his beeper and cell phone into the dresser next to his bed then saw orels note reminding him that he and raney had both left directly after school with their snowboard club for one last chance to maim themselves before the summer so no kids for the weekend he really was taking it off when treya got home he asked her if she was up for a night on the town he didnt have to ask twice they went to a moroccan place on balboa where they sat on the floor and ate with their fingers washing everything down with sweet hot tea that the waiter poured from the height of his waist down to the cups on the floor never spilling a drop good theater the night was so beautiful that they decided to walk to ocean beach on the way back something about their hips remaining in contact made them decide to head back home a free spot at the curb just four driveways from their place had them both thinking it was their lucky night all the stars aligning to give them some privacy and peace glitskys arm was over treyas shoulder hers around his waist dont look now treya said two men had just stepped out of their car and were walking toward them she whispered lets hope theyre punks thinking about mugging us we can kill them quick and get inside theyre punks all right glitsky answered sotto voce then a little louder gentlemen out for an evening stroll you said to report every day sir bracco explained if this isnt a good time fisk made it clear he didnt think it was either no this is a great time harlen a great time treya agreed nodding at fisk a terrific time glitsky touched her arm i dont believe either of you know my wife treya inspectors fisk and bracco enchante she said in a passable french accent her smile possibly appeared sincere ive heard so much about you both on the one hand glitsky was marginally happy that darrel bracco took him so literally on the other he didnt want his men getting into the habit of dropping by his place but now it was a done deal his romantic night with his wife continued as she sat next to him on the couch bracco and fisk were on chairs theyd carried from the small small kitchen this is parnassus then she asked sweetly does anybody mind if i stay there were no objections bracco had placed his little notepad out on the coffee table in front of him he regularly checked his notes we began at the hospital first thing did you know kensing was late for work tuesday morning an hour late no glitsky said i dont know anything about what kensing did that day but why do you think thats worth mentioning if he was the car fisk replied where was he at the time of the accident the original accident glitsky asked with markham are you still considering that part of the murder treya asked i thought once they found the potassium you pretty much ruled that out actually glitsky had given it short shrift from the outset and still did but he realized that these guys had a bias and didnt want to dampen their newfound enthusiasm were keeping an open mind on all theories at this point he told her in their secret code he came back to the inspectors so did you ask kensing where hed been no sir bracco replied we havent talked to him again ourselves but last night he never mentioned it when you were questioning him it seems like it might have crossed his mind he told people that morning that hed had car trouble cars again glitsky nodded noncommittal but privately convinced that they could bark under this tree forever and it wouldnt get them a thing how about after markham got to the er what was it like there busy what bracco was ready with his answer actually it was a pretty slow morning they had a kid who needed stitches in his head and a lady whod fallen down and broken her hip but they had already been brought into the back when the ambulance pulled up the back glitsky asked yeah theres a waiting area when you first come in then when they see you they take you back to this big open room with lots of portable beds and a medical stationwhere the nurses and doctors hang out in the middle thats where they brought markham as soon as he got there then into surgery which is down the hall a ways theres a halfdozen surgery rooms on that floor fisk added every one of them has a supply of potassium and other emergency drugs theres also potassium at the station near the portable beds okay this was nice but glitsky had already deduced that there must have been some potassium around someplace as before these two inspectors had no doubt gathered a lot of information their problem was in recognizing which of it was useful if he wanted to get it he realized hed have to ask the right questions when they let markham in was his wife with him they looked at each other as if for confirmation yeah outside and then while they prepped the operating room for surgery maybe ten minutes then what when he went to the operating room another shared look and bracco answered she was in the waiting room when he got out then she moved up to icus waiting room okay glitsky said but was she alone by the central nurses station by the portable beds at any time is what im getting at there was no way he realized that they would have pursued that question so he went right to another how was she taking it did anybody say fisk took the lead i talked to both of the nurses that had been there how many are on the shift usually glitsky interrupted two at night which is ten to six then four during the day so there were four on duty where were the other two bracco came to his partners rescue with the other two patients sir because one of the er docs had been late that day they were short a doc at the start of the shift theyd prepped one of the other ors for the hip and one nurse was waiting for the surgeon with the lady there the other one stayed with the kid and his mom and the doc sewing his head okay glitsky thought he had the picture finally two doctors four nurses three patients two visitors he turned to fisk so you talked to markhams nurses about how the wife seemed male or female by the way the nurses both women fisk replied and yes sir i asked them both how she was glitsky was still waiting treya read her husbands impatience and asked nicely and how was that inspector distraught fisk answered very upset almost unable to talk they both said that yes sir they agreed completely crying yes sir i asked that specifically she was crying quietly on and off glitsky fell silent bracco had been listening intently to this exchange and consulting his notes decided to put in his own two cents worth i talked to one of the nurses too sir a debra muller she walked with mrs markham when they were bringing markham into the or and then back to the waiting room where shemullerspent a few minutes holding her hand anyway muller the word she used was shellshocked mrs markham kept repeating things like they cant let him die they wont let him die will they glitsky was thinking a couple of things first that of course mrs markham could have been a good actress but this didnt sound like a woman who was planning to kill her husband in the next couple of hours second if nurse muller had accompanied her from the portable bed area to the surgery and back then she hadnt been alone to pick up a vial of potassium from the medical station in the center of the room but he wanted to be sure on that score so she didnt wait in the portable bed area no sir outside in the waiting room and then upstairs by the icu all right glitsky said lets move along how long was markham in the or fisk cast a grateful eye over to bracco whod taken not only good notes but some of the right ones a little under two hours darrel said then volunteered some more and by the time hed come out and gotten admitted to the icu some of the parnassus executive staff were there malachi ross the medical director also markhams secretary a guy named brendan driscoll who evidently got in a bit of a discussion with dr kensing about what access to his boss markham he was unconscious right did he ever regain consciousness no sir then why did he want to see him this driscoll nobody seems to know braccos disappointment over his failure to find out was apparent but he did get in though glitsky leaned forward driscoll was in the icu for how long again bracco answered nobody knows for sure but when kensing found him in there youre telling me he was alone yes sir evidently and when kensing found him in there he went batshit and kicked his ass out glitsky replied with an exaggerated calm i dont believe to go batshit is a legitimate verb darrel youre saying kensing and driscoll had an argument short but fairly violent kensing physically threw him out of the icu of the hospital no just the unit intensive care but driscoll was still around when markham died people remember him yep he lost it entirely just sobbing like a baby okay and what was your source for this later stuff did the or nurses come up no fisk replied theres another nurses station outside the icu ive got the names bracco added there are at least twelve regular icu nurses three shifts two a shift but they run two weeks on then two off its pretty intense evidently hence the name treya commented dryly glitsky squeezed her hand he went on but youre telling me that even with all that help sometimes the icu is empty right except for the patients right bracco was off his notes and on memory again everybodys on monitors for heartbeat and blood pressure and kidney function and who knows what else the doctors and nurses go in regularly but its not like theres a nurse there in the station all day theyve got other jobskeeping up supplies paperwork taking breaks glitsky considered that can they see anyone who goes in or comes out of the icu from their station sure if theyre at it its right there so who came in and went out bracco turned a page or two of his notepad and read besides kensing two other doctors cohn and waltrip then both nursesive got their names somewhere back thats all right go ahead then driscoll ross three members of the family of another patient in there they were there for morning visiting hours i could get their names maybe later darrel if we need them what time did markham die did you get that again bracco was ready twelve fortyfive give or take so markham was in the icu maybe four hours thats about right maybe a little less another thought occurred ross went in too why was that i dont know bracco said but hes a doctor you know fisk added hes got the run of the place he was in there with kensing right after they got him up from or after a moment of silence glitsky finally nodded okay that it bracco flipped a page or two then lifted his head and looked across at glitsky and treya he brought his head back up and nodded for today sir then he added im sorry we interrupted your night for you dont be silly treya said quickly standing up then wagged a finger at them joking just dont do it again glitsky took her lead and was on his feet working lates part of the job he had meant it sincerely as a simple statement of fact but as soon as the words were out he realized from fisks expression he took it as another glitsky reminder of his failings as a cop which wasnt fair these two inexperienced inspectors had finally done some investigative work theyd stayed late to make their report to him they were trying hard they had worked a long day glitsky knew that a kind word to them wouldnt kill him he tried to put some enthusiasm into his voice thats a good days work guys really keep at it he said one thing though tomorrow morning make sure you get your tapes into transcription asap i want to get all this into the record the two men froze threw a concerned glance at each other glitsky read it right you did tape all these interviews didnt you hardy remembered to buy the flowers beautiful bouquets too both of them baby pink roses for his daughter the spring extravaganza for his wife they were next to him on the passenger seat of his car even as he drove around looking for a parking place in his neighborhood he didnt think there was much chance that frannie and the beck would appreciate them much just now since they were probably both asleep it was ten minutes until midnight hed left strouts office in high spirits the warm night the fragrant air a true sense of accomplishment hed cut a great deal for his client with jackman convinced the medical examiner to autopsy james lector as soon as he cleared the way for it with his family he called frannie on his cell phone and told her he didnt think that would take more than an hour and then hed be home maybe on the way he could also pick up some fresh salmon and theyd have the first barbecue of the season and back at his office the good luck had held lectors death notice was in yesterdays chronicle and it named the next of kin who were listed in the phone book hardy called the eldest son clark reached him at his home on arguello halfway out to hardys own he made an appointment for when he got there perhaps most astoundingly he only had one message on his answering machinepico with the sad news that francis the shark finally hadnt made it he just thought hardy would want to know but even picos disappointing news couldnt bring him down in fact he was half tempted to call him back at the steinhart and invite him and his family over at the last minute for the salmon barbecue cheer them all right up then he remembered that hed done pretty much the same thing with moses and susan the night before and he reconsidered maybe it should just be his family together for tonight but after the first half hour with clark and patti lector and jamess widow ellen he called frannie again and told her he was sorry but it might be a while the lectors were not in favor of an autopsy it was going to be a long hard sell hed try to get home as soon as he could but she might want to go ahead with the kids and not wait on him for dinner there was no anger not even real disappointment in her voice when shed told him it was all right the only thing he thought he discerned was a bone weariness and in some ways that bothered him more than if shed thrown a fit he finally found a parking spot three long blocks from his house bedraggled bouquets in hand he undid the latch on his picket fence closed it back behind him then in five steps crossed the walk that bisected his tiny front lawn at long last hed succeeded in getting the lectors permission but only after tomorrows service which would not end with mr lectors body in the ground at the familys burial plot in colma but rather on john strouts metal table at the morgue dragging himself up his front steps he vowed that he had had enough of this getting home at all hours he had to change something not just for himself but for his children his wife his marriage of course no light shone anywhere he let himself in quietly although the wood had swollen with the warm weather and he had to push the door to get it closed tomorrow he thought hed fix thatplane it true working with wood was something hed once been good at even passionate about then maybe hed do some more household chores spring cleaning they could open all the windows and let the air blow out the last of the winters must maybe put on some old beach boys or the eagles and turn it up loud get that peaceful easy feelin going while they all worked together putting the house into summertime shape unplug all the telephones flicking on the hall light he stepped into the living room and dropped the flowers into his reading chair frannies note was under one of the elephants on his mantel just where she knew hed see it when he got in dismas decided to take the kids to monterey for the weekend back late sunday afternoon fran no dear no love not even frannie he crumpled the note in one hand leaned against the mantel with the other his head dropped as though hed been struck by the next morning hardy was on the road he didnt know in which of the dozens if not hundreds of hotels and motels theyd be staying but if frannie and the kids were in monterey he considered it a dead lock that theyd hit the aquarium first the place wouldnt open for another fifteen minutes but already a long line of visitors stretched up the hill from the entrance he started there got to the end then found a low wall across the street on which he could sit keeping an eye on the line as it grew while he waited hed seen no coastal fog as hed driven down highway and there was no sign of any now normally monterey was as fogbound as san francisco but clearly it was going to be a postcard daysoon he wouldnt even need the light jacket he was wearing they came around the corner two blocks uphill the kids were in the midst of some of their typical goofinesseven from this distance vincents giggle carried down to him then rebeccas scream as she lunged back at him frannie walked a few steps behind them head down tolerant or uninvolved her hands shoved into the pockets of a stanford sweatshirt she was in shorts and running shoes and with her long red hair down and loose she could have easily passed for the other kids older sister maybe eighteen or twenty years old hardy stood up by his low wall continuing to watch their approach the kids were playing like puppies poking at each other tickling and laughing this silliness often if not always drove hardy crazy at home especially in the past few months suddenly at this remove he could view it a little more objectively his children were doing exactly what they were supposed to be doing they were good kids suddenly on a surprise vacation and they were having a great appropriate carefree and healthy time with each other what hardy wondered was his problem that he couldnt enjoy them more now rebecca had her arm around vincents shoulderthey were almost exactly the same height suddenly frannie skipped a couple of quick steps downhill and caught up with them with a joyous yell a tickling goose under each of their ribs gotcha more screams more laughing the kids turning back on their mother now darting in and out of her reach while she parried and thrusted to keep them away hardy almost couldnt imagine the level of pure fun they all seemed to be having he started crossing the street as vincent broke away after his latest raid theyd now come down to about a block from hardy and his son stopped and stared down at him after a beat the recognition became certain and he screamed in what seemed complete abandonment and happiness dad five seconds later he plowed into hardy at full speed arms and legs all around him then a real hug before hardy put him down i didnt think you were coming mom said you were too busy i decided not to be rebecca too ran down and threw her arms around him im so glad youre here daddy its such a perfect day isnt it i cant believe how beautiful it is here i am so happy me too hardy held her for a moment then raised a hand sheepishly greeting his wife hi she had her arms crossed hi rebecca who never missed a thing asked are you guys mad at each other youre not getting divorced are you never hardy said still holding his daughter even if we were mad we wouldnt get divorced youre sure jeez beck vincent didnt have much patience for his sisters paranoia how many times they got to tell you theyre not getting divorced he whirled on his parents right right hardy said frannie still hadnt ventured a word on the subject but suddenly the expression of frustrated bemusement that shed been holding shifted and she walked the remaining few steps to where hardy stood with his arms around the beck i love your father very much she said planting a kiss on his cheek and we will never get divorced ever she gave him a long look although someday i might have to kill him his daughters jaw dropped her eyes wide in terror mom joke beck joke for his parents benefit vincent rolled his own eyes at his sisters stupidity like shes really going to kill dad suddenly then seeing an opening he poked at her with a finger again immediately with a squeal of delight she spun out from hardys embrace after him down the hill leaving hardy and frannie standing there do you want me here he asked of course although i wish it didnt have to take kidnapping your children to get your attention i wish that too but i guess sometimes it does i dont think youre hardwired for that maybe you could work on it thats what im doing believe it or not im trying even as we speak he added then he shook his head im sorry she put an arm around his waist started walking down the hill ill get over it bracco lived in three converted rooms over a standalone garage behind his fathers house out in the sunset district on pacheco street hed been pulling long hours this past week so this morning he slept in after an hour on free weights hed done some jogging and eaten five bananas with most of a box of wheaties now showered and dressed darrel sat with his father at a wooden table by an open window in the kitchen the back of the house had a southern exposure and sunlight washed half the table from time to time a wisp of breeze would ruffle the lace curtains at the window angelo bracco had once looked a lot like his son and there was still a resemblance in the face but hed lost his wife six years beforeshed cooked him healthy meals and also kept him interested in looking good after she was gone he went back to meat and potatoes then he started driving for the mayor sitting all day in these past few years hed bulked up to where his fivefoot nineinch frame carried around two hundred and twenty pounds this morning he was wearing a formfitting tshirt after theyd had their first sips of coffee darrel decided to say something you know you wanted you could use my weights sometimes theyre just sitting out there his father chose not to answer directly i saw you go out this morning how fard you run a shrug i dont know five miles maybe it was a good day for it couldnt resist huh feel the burn is that what they say angelo sipped his coffee if i ran five miles id drop dead you probably would but you dont start there you work up to it he saw that his son meant well and nodded in acceptance well maybe i will id walk with you if you wanted you got to start doing something dad lose a little of that he pointed at the belly they say walking is as good as running for what you believe that darrel had to break a smile no but its a start but the weightsi mean theres lots of things nowadays you could join a club even this brought an outright laugh maybe ill walk okay really ill think about it but a club is out okay if im going to be in that much pain i dont want anybody else to see it he sat up straighter in his chair sucked his gut in marginally then let it back out so is that why you knocked at my door to preach me the benefits of working out no darrel said soberly i just happen to notice my old mans put on some weight and its probably not doing him a whole lot of good thats all maybe id like him to stay around a while longer okay okay so what i came over for is harlen what about him well here it is saturday and were both scheduled off which ive got no problem with if nothings happening except now were in the middle of this homicide and weve got witnesses to interview if were going to get anywhere which it seems like we might if we keep at it but hes got his family and its saturdayi only just now talked to him so whats your problem my problem is were partners and i dont want to cut him out but i want to go talk to some people so call him again tell him what youre going to do and go do it that simple huh his father nodded it usually is todays date is april saturday the time now is twelve twenty hours this is inspector sergeant darrel bracco star number one six eight nine i am currently at a residence at lake boulevard with me is mrs jamie rath dob this interview is pursuant to an investigation of case number q mrs rath how well did you know carla markham a she was my best friend ive known her since our girls were in kindergarten together q and when was the last time you saw her a last tuesday i went to her house when i heard what happened to tim q how late were you there a i left around nine thirty quarter to ten q and who outside of the markham family was still there when you left a dr kensing was still in the living room but the rest of us left in kind of a knot q did you know dr kensing before that night a i knew of him but we hadnt met i know carla seemed surprised when he arrived q why was that a wellit was just awkward he and mr markham didnt get along and then him being the doctor that day of course this is before i knew that dr kensing had killed tim q i dont think we know yet that he killed mr markham a well i do and i think he almost expected carla to thank him for getting rid of him except what dr kensing didnt know is that theyd patched it up q youre saying that prior to his death mr and mrs markham hadnt been getting along is that it a thats fair to say but then just this last weekend carla told me that they patched things up tim bared his poor little psychetold her all about his affairs his job problems the incredible stress the creep so she was hopeful again thats where they were on tuesday and its why she couldnt believe he was gone so suddenly it was like whiplash q did she appear depressed to you any suggestion she might commit suicide a no way ive known carla for nine years inspector for the last two of those shes been getting used to the idea of living without tim why because she was going to leave him someday anyway she knew that q but you just said theyd patched things up a this time but who knew for how long tim would fail again eventuallythats just who he wasand shed wind up leaving him she knew that im sure deep down so it might have filled her with disappointment that he died or even broken her heart at some level but there had to be some relief there too and no way in the world would she kill herself over it kensing walked up the six steps and pushed at the button next to the door of his old house on anza street he still thought of it as his house and it made him sick to see how far ann had let the place go the once bright and appealing yellow paint had faded to a jaundiced pallor and was peeling everywhere the white trim had gone gray the shutter by the window nearest him hung at a cockeyed angle the window boxes themselves had somehow misplaced even their dirt to say nothing of the flowers hed labored to establish in them back when he and ann were good theyd always kept the house up even with all the hours they spent at their jobs theyd found the time now he looked down and saw that the corners of the stoop had collected six months worth of debrisflattened soda cans old newspapers and advertising supplements still soaked from the recent storm candy wrappers and enough dirt he thought to make a start of refilling the window boxes where was ann dammit if she was still asleep he was going to have to do something although what that might be he didnt know she should be awake at least to feed the kids he pushed at the bell again figured it must have stopped working so he knocked hard three more times with his fist shaking the door he was turning to leave when he heard her voice who is it its eric ann open up didnt you get my call she asked i called two hours ago hi dad his nineyearold yelled from inside terry you be quiet hi ter hi girls you there he heard sounds from both of them amber and caitlin stop that his wife yelled at the girls then talked again through the door i left a message telling you not to come this was one of anns favorite tricks although she knew that eric had a cell phone and beeper shed only call at his condo and leave a message he wouldnt get then she could be mad at him for being unreachable well i never got it did you try the cell i didnt think of it i thought youd be home well it was a nice morning i went out for breakfast with your girlfriend i suppose he didnt feel the need to answer that instead he tried the knob come on ann you want to open the door i dont think so no well thats going to make it a little tough for me to take the kids out to the ball game isnt it his schedule allowed him only rare visits with his children during the week so he made it a point to take them on weekends ann burdened by her life as well had always before been happy to pass them off to him until now ann whats this about you cant see them he kept his voice under control you want to open the door and we can talk about it theres nothing to talk about you go away or i swear to god eric ill call the police ann lets not do this in front of the kids just open up no youre not coming in im not letting a murderer take my children the crying started it sounded like amber the middle one first but the others immediately took the cue from her anns voice shrill and loud cut through them all though stop that shut up all of you stop it right now ann kensing pleaded through the door mom his son terry hysterical im going out with dad you cant stop me oh yes i can something slammed into the door god ann what are you more sounds of manhandling then terry get upstairs you hear me you girls too kensing grabbed the doorknob shook it with both hands ann let me in now open up she was herding all of them upstairs to their rooms he stood for another moment on the stoop then ran down the steps and up the overgrown driveway on the side of the house the back door was locked too but unlike the front it had six small glass panes in its upper panel kensing wished it was the usual cold day and he had a jacket he could wrap around his hand but all he wore was a collared golf shirt still he had his fist clenched he had to do it padding or not but then he remembered the man last year whod died after slashing his arteries trying to do the same thingbled out in six minutes the instants hesitation gave him time for another flash of insight that stopped him cold he was already a murder suspect even if he had every reason in the world hed better not break into his wifes house but the kidsann had lost control and though shed never hit any of them before she might be capable of anything right now he pulled out his cell phone and punched then ran back up front the dispatcher answered and he gave the address and briefly described the situation im outside now i need some help immediately back up on the stoop he heard ann upstairs still screaming at the kids a door slammed up there finally he heard her footsteps on the stairs inside coming down now she was at the door eric she said eric are you still there he didnt say anything he was pressed against the wall scrunched down under the sill of the stoop he knew she wouldnt be able to see him even if she leaned out the front windows his heart thrummed in his ears in the distance he heard the wail of a siren then he heard the lock tumble saw the doorknob begin to move he grabbed and gave it a quick turn then hit the door with his shoulder ann screamed as the force of it threw her backward but she didnt go down instead she gathered herself and charged at him get out of here get out of my house he held her arms but she kept kicking at himat his legs his groin she connected and knocked the wind out of him his grip went slack for a second she ripped a hand free and swiped it across his face he felt the hot flush of the impact and knew shed scratched him raising his hand he pulled it away and saw blood jesus he said daddy mommy from up the stairs dont ann screamed stay up there she never turned around though and came again at him she kept coming driving him back to the door then out it onto the stoop she kicked again at his groin barely missing but the kick spun him to one side now she charged full force her fingernails out for his face blocking her hands he stepped back defensively her forward motion carried her by him her foot landed on one of the wet newspapers which slipped out from under her with another yell of anguish she fell her head hit the concrete as her momentum carried her forward she rolled down the steps all the way to the sidewalk where she lay still the children flashed by kensing and down the steps they had just gotten to her kneeling and keening around her when a police car its siren blaring pulled up and skidded to a stop two patrolmen came out with their weapons drawn and leveled at kensing dont make a move put your hands up glitsky and treya had gotten out of bed late got a sense of the incredible day outside and decided on the spur of the moment to drive up to dillons beach about forty miles north of the city on the way up they detoured over to hog island for an hour or so and ate oysters every way they could think ofraw grilled on the barby with three different sauces breaded and deep fried with tartar sauce fortified even sated and happy they took the long way north along the oceanswitchback onelane roads that wound through the dairy farms the redwood and eucalyptus groves the timeless and seemingly forgotten settlements of western marin county it was truly a different world here than anywhere else in the greater bay area all the more magical because of its proximity to the kitschy tourist mecca of sausalito the tony crowded anthill of yuppies that was mill valley on this side of tamalpais clapboard main streets with a half dozen centuryold buildings called themselves towns the single sign of life would be twenty harleys parked outside the only saloonthere was always a saloon along the road they passed handmade signs nailed to ancient oaks advertising live chickens pigs sheep fresh eggs and milk every few miles most of it looked slightly gone to seed and glitsky had been up here many times when with the nearconstant yearround fog and wind it had seemed almost uninhabitable a true wasteland today in the warm sunlightit would hit eighty degrees at the beach before they headed back homethe ramshackle and rundown landscape suddenly struck him as deliberate lots of hippies from the sixties and dropand burnouts from the seventies and eighties had settled out here and they didnt want it to change they didnt want new cars and fauxmansions but a slower pace tolerant neighbors privacy most of the time glitsky scoffed at that lifestylethose people didnt have a clue they werent living in the real world but today at the beach he was watching what he would have normally called a cliche of an aging hippy a man about his own age early fifties was weaving some spring flowers into his little girls hair glitsky found himself almost envying him the simplicity of this life the woman with himthe girls motherwas another cliche her hair fell loose halfway down her back she had let it go gray she fingerpicked an acoustic guitar and would sing snippets of joni mitchell as the words occurred to her it was possible glitsky the cop thought that they were both stoned but possibly not possibly they were blissed out on the day very much like he and treya a chocolate chip cookie for your thoughts she sat next to him blocking the sun from his face he was stretched out on his side on their blanket in the warm sand cookie first he popped it whole into his mouth and chewed it up thank you now thoughts she said that was the deal you dont want to hear my thoughts theyre scary youre having scary thoughts here i like it here im almost completely happy thats scary comfort and happiness are scary they dont last you dont want to get used to them no god forbid that she reached a hand out and rubbed it over his arm forgetting of course that you and i have had a pretty decent run together these past few months he put a hand over hers i havent forgotten that for a second i didnt mean us good because im planning on making this last a while a while would be good id vote for that at least say another nineteen years whats ninet glitsky stopped and squinted a question up at her nineteen years she spoke with an undertone of grave concern with an age difference of nineteen years between them the question of whether they should have their own child someday had nearly split them up before theyd gotten engaged glitsky had already done what he called the kid thing three times he was finished with all that hed informed her it was one of the hardest things shed ever done but treya told him if that were the case they had to stop seeing each other she wasnt going to use the issue in a power play to get or keep him if parenthood wasnt something he wanted to go through again she understood completely he was still a fine man and she loved him but she knew who she was what she wanted for some time glitsky had lived with her decision and his own then one day he woke up and realized that he had changed his mind her presence in his life was more important than anything else he could not lose hernothing could make that happen but now that oncedistant someday had arrived and treya was biting her lip with the tension of whether or not her husband would accept the reality i dont think children have as good a chance if theyre raised in a home where the parents arent comfortable and happy so i think we really ought to keep that going at least until the babys out of the house and on its own dont you trying to smile she gripped his hand tightly in both of hers and met his eyes i was going to tell you last night when we got home but then your inspectors were there and by the time they left it was so late her tremulous voice wound down to a stop he stared back at her for a long beat his expression softening by degrees into something akin to wonder why do you think it took us so long he brought her hands to his mouth and kissed them it sure wasnt for lack of trying four hours later glitsky was sitting on his kitchen counter trying to maintain a professional tone when he felt like screaming he was talking on the wall phone to one of the deputy sheriffs from san francisco general hospital the deputy had called homicide about this lady whod been arrested and brought to the hospital earlier in the day with a broken ankle and a concussion she couldnt seem to stop talking about her husband being the murderer in the family so why was she the one who was in jail the deputy figured that if anything about this woman involved murder he ought to bring it to somebodys attention but when hed called homicide nobody had any idea what he was talking about so they gave him glitskys home number what do you mean they arrested her they didnt arrest him the husband no sir not that i can tell they didnt bring him here but maybe he wasnt hurt when healthy people got arrested in the city they went to the jail behind the hall of justice if they needed medical care of any kind sfgh had a guarded lockup wing and thats where her arresting officers had taken ann kensing in ten minutes glitsky had tracked down the home numbers for both of these guys and one of themofficer rick pagehad the bad luck to answer the phone even over the wire and without benefit of his terrible face glitskys tone of voice rank and position conspired to reduce the young cop to a state of panic he ran his words together staccato fashion repeating half of what he was trying to say it was it was a nineoneone dd domestic disturbance when we got there we got there and the woman was on the ground surrounded by her kids her children and the man well he he was bleeding from his face pretty bad where she cut cut him cut him with what a knife no fingernails scratched i meant scratched him not cut on his face he was up some outside stairs when we got to the scene me and jerrymy partnerwe pulled up and both drew down on him on him yes sir but then you arrested her even though she was the one more badly hurt is that right how did that happen glitskys anger and frustration were still fresh but he had calmed enough to realize that he wasnt getting what he needed from officer page he toned his voice down a notch or two you can slow down a little officer just tell me what happened yes sir first hesthe guy kensingwe checked back with the dispatcher when he told us and it was true hes the one who called in the nineoneone he was locked out of his house and was worried his wife was going to hurt his kids he said he needed help ill bet glitsky was thinking that ann kensing was smart to lock him out but you got there and what well the first thing she was on the ground on the sidewalk at the bottom of the stoop there were steps you know going up to the house the husband was still at the top just standing there three kids were down with her screaming bloody murder we didnt knowit could have gone any way from that situation sir so we both pulled our pieces and approached the suspect who at that time we thought was the guy and how was he cooperative scared he wanted to go and see how his wife was but we had him freeze he had his hands up and didnt move a muscle which was good from what we see so far were taking him downtown at that point okay glitsky said what changed that after a short hesitation page started again the main thing was i talked to him the first thing he said i mean hes reaching for the sky and bleeding like a pig out of his face and the first thing he does is thank me for getting there so fast he thanked you yes sir which makes it like the first time ive ever had that in a dd you know what im saying glitsky did know usually by the time the police got involved in a domestic dispute the gentler social amenities especially extended to the cops coming to break up the fight werent in the equation anymore go on anyway so jerry was with the wife trying to get the kids to calm down he the guy kensing asked if he could sit down on the step and i said no way turn around the normal drill and go to cuff him at which point one of the kids the boy he starts coming up the stairs and hes going what are you doin to my dad leave my dad alone it wasnt him it was mom the kids saying that yeah and kensings cool hes going its all right terry the kid he doesnt know what happened meaning me you know but im not letting the kid get near him this of course was standard procedure because irate parentsespecially fatherswho see jail time in their immediate future have been known to take their own children hostage in an effort to avoid it so i get in front of him and call for jerry whos gone back to the unit to put in a call for the paramedics by this time the wifes sitting up holding the two girls theres some citizensneighborscoming out to look time to put up my piece which i do okay okay so its all slowing down kensings cuffed and he asks can he turn around slow and i let him and he tells his kid just stay put dont worry its all going to work out he tells me calm as can be that hes a doctor he can help his wife but im getting a funny feeling right about now anyway about what about its mostly always the guy you know sir doing damage i know but this guy hes almost relaxed nowhere near the usual rage he says she just slipped and im goin sure she did but he says look and nods down to this mark on the landing where its pretty obvious at least somebody slipped a wet newspaper and the kid goes its true i saw her she just slipped he didnt touch her so im thinking shit now what i mean we get to a dd and somebodys going downtown right i mean usually the guy but no way are we leaving without one of them its a real drag coming back two hours after everything was patched up fine with the lovebirds except then one of them shoots the other one you know what i mean i hear you glitsky said but what am i going to do i walk kensing down the steps and put him in the back of the unit locked up and this time one of the neighbors comes upi got her id and everything if you want to talk to herand she tells me the same thing she saw it allkensing was completely defensive never hit her she scratched him came at him again and slipped page took a breath so jerry and i have a little powwow and break up the two daughters and ask them about itsame story its the wife all the way and by this time the ambulance is here the wifes groggy and cant walk on one foot plus shes going to need stitches in her head so jerry and i decide she goes the guy stays home in the course of the long telling pages voice had grown in confidence now he spoke matteroffactly i dont know what else we could have done lieutenant four witnesses pegged the wife the guy didnt do anything wrong glitsky was tempted to ask page if he realized that the man he hadnt arrested was the prime suspect in a homicide investigation but why would the officer know that and what point would it serve and now for a while at least ann kensing was safe unhappy and hurt but safe hed take that so hes at her house now with the kids i dont know sir he might be at his home address which ive got would you like to have that ive got it glitsky replied maybe ill go have a word with him sorry about not letting you in lieutenant but ive got my children in here theyve seen enough cops for the day one of ems already asleep and the rest of us are watching videos its been a long day i just wanted to ask you a couple of questions it wont take fifteen minutes fifteen minutes it wont take any time if i dont let you in it seemed to me we went over everything already the other night and according to my lawyer i shouldnt have talked to you then that was before today before the fight with your wife we didnt have a fight fighting takes two people she attacked me why were you over there in the first place it was my day for the kids i had giants tickets pretty simple look this really isnt a good time all right now im being a father to my children who are traumatized and exhausted enough kensing shifted to his other foot let out a heavy breath look i dont want to seem like a hardass lieutenant but unless you have a warrant to come in here good night in his noe street railroadstyle duplex apartment brendan driscoll worked at his computer in the tiny room behind the kitchen all the way at the back in spite of the beautiful day hed remained in the shaded musty airless cubicle completely engrossed in his work since an hour after hed woken up at in the morning with the worst hangover of his adult life now nearly twelve hours later he stretched rubbed his hands over his face and pushed his chair back away from the terminal in a minute he was in the kitchen popping four more aspirin and pouring himself an iced tea when roger appeared in the doorway it moves roger said brendan looked over at him barely hows the head the head is awful the head may never recover the rest isnt really that great either whats in a long island iced tea anyway and how many of them did i have roger shrugged then shook his head you told me to stop counting remember but i know that was after the third one when i mentioned it might be smarter to stop i should have listened to you this is always the case so roger inquired with all the hours youve spent atoning for your sins in your cave today is your penance served it isnt penance im seeking brendan said its revenge he went over and pulled up a chair at the kitchen table i just feel so betrayed roger sat down with him i know i dont blame you thats my problem i dont know who to blame he sighed deeply i mean do i blame kensing or his stupid wife for making tim feel like he had to jog every day thats what created the opportunity in the first place well the jogging didnt kill him brendan i know but if he hadnt gone out he wouldnt have been hit and he wouldnt have been at the hospital weve been through all this already they had ad nauseam brendan realized he sighed then squeezed his temples wincing from the hangover pain youre right youre right it staggers me though that ross thought he could buy me off and purge my files could he really think that i couldnt see this coming that i wouldnt be prepared jackman was as good as his word and on monday morning hardy had two more binders of discovery on the markham case ready for him when he got to his office he got himself a cup of coffee settled down at his desk and opened the first folder someone had obviously lit a fire under the transcribers because already several interviews had been typed up including glitskys with kensing with anita tong the housekeeper braccos with ann kensing he flipped pages quickly nothing was tabbed yetthat would be one of his more tedious jobsbut he was satisfied to see much of what hed hoped and expected the original incident report at the hit and run the hospital pm performed immediately after markhams death strouts autopsy findings and official death certificate the first cut of the crime scene analysis of markhams home hed been at it for over an hour unaware of the passing of time his hand automatically went to his coffee mug and he brought it to his lips the coffee had gone cold suddenly he sat up straight with almost a physical jolt he raised his eyes from his binder almost surprised to see the familiar trappings of his own office for a while there with the taste of the bitter dregs of coffee on his tongue caught up in the analysis of evidence he was a da again putting on this case rather than defending it the feeling was unexpected and somehow unsettling he got up shaking his head in front of his desk he threw a round of darts then walked over to the window and looked down at sutter street outside san francisco wore its usual workday face after the glitzy and gaudy weekendstreet debris kicked up by a good breeze off the bay an obscure sun fitfully breaching the cloud cover he realized that it wasnt just the mnemonic tug of the coffee the truth was that he was in prosecutor mode to prove his clients innocence it inexorably followed he must show that someone else had killed tim markham and presumably his whole family as well that left him only one mandatefind that person and the evidence to convict it was ironic he knew that hed ever become a defense attorney in the first place he wasnt drawn by nature to stand up for the accused on the justice versus mercy continuum he always came down for justice after hed gotten out of the marines and vietnam he walked a beat as a cop for a few years then hed gone to law school thinking hed make a career taking bad people to trial and putting them behind barsthat had been his whole orientation in work and in life if a previous da hadnt fired him over office politics he had little doubt hed still be down at the hall working with marlene and for jackman and though by now hed been on the defense side long enough that he had grown used to it part of him still longed for the purity of prosecution the law as david freeman was fond of saying was a complicated and beautiful thing and hardy thought never more so than in this while a notguilty verdict did not always mean your client was factually innocent of committing the crime for which he or she had been charged on the other hand a guilty verdict meant that he or she was when hardy the defense attorney got a client off with a good argument or some legal legerdemain there was of course some satisfaction that hed done his job earned his pay but only rarely did it compare to the soulaffirming righteousness he had sometimes felt when hed convicted a truly evil miscreant and removed him or her from society he sat back down and took another sip of the cold coffee his eyes went back down to his binder here were interviews with several nurses at portola a quick perusal told him that bracco and fisk had done some basic footwork which might save him some time he noticed though that they didnt seem to have identified anyone who had been present at or about the time markham had died he flipped more pages but found no sign of this essential and fundamental information he looked up again staring angrily at nothing into the space in front of him his jaw was tight his eyes hard jackman was keeping his end of their bargain he had sent him the discovery folders all right but they obviously werent complete hardy didnt think this was an accident but he didnt see jackmans hand at work withholding his evidence he saw glitskys bracco and fisk had gotten into the office late in the day because over braccos objections fisk insisted that they keep trying to find some kind of lead on the car so first theyd gone door to door in the neighborhood again catching a few people who hadnt been home a week ago although coming away with about the same results no one had seen the accident or noticed the car speeding away nextfisk was at the wheel todayhed driven bracco crazy by making the rounds of his old hitandrun connections several body shops on lombard van ness in the mission hed put them on notice last week now he was following up one of them actually had a late sixties green corvair in the shop brought in late yesterday afternoon damage to the right front bumper and the hood the owner claimed his brake had released itself on one of the citys famous hills and he hadnt remembered to curb his wheels the car had rolled twenty feet or so and hit a tree a branch of which had then fallen on the hood the owner of the shop jim otis had been planning to call hit and run sometime today and certainly before he did any repair work on the vehicle but a quick spray with luminol pretty much eliminated the car from contention luminol was a nearly foolproof agent for revealing the presence of bloodeven trace amounts even after a washingand there was none on the corvair still fisk dutifully took down the owners name and address before this was over he vowed hed find out if he had an alibi for last tuesday morning now after lunch and under glitskys direction they were finally on their way back to portola for more interviews the lieutenant had reviewed their work from friday and now wanted to know about the two other doctors whod been in the icu last tuesday he also wanted the exact chronologies of people coming and going as far as the nurses at the icu station could remember but it wasnt turning out to be as simple as theyd hoped different icu nurses had come on duty with the new week of the two that had been on duty when markham and lector had died rajan bhutan had transferred to labor and delivery and was in the midst of a traumatic childbirth connie rowe assigned to general floor duty was out at lunch asking fisk if hed mind holding the fort for a few minutes while he took care of some business bracco left his partner to wait for her and went back upstairs when he got back to the icu nurses station he introduced himself for a second time to the female nurse sitting at the console when he asked she explained that her shift partner was in with one of the doctors while he made his rounds theyd both be back out shortly if he needed to talk to either of them but after making sure that the doctor was neither cohn nor waltrip whom he did want to speak to bracco told her that what he really needed was a few minutes at a quiet spotwould she mind if he went to sit in the waiting room just down the hallway there a middleaged couple sat miserably holding hands and whispering on one of the couches bracco took the upholstered chair near the hallway where he could see both the entrance to the icu and the nurses station sure enough the other nurse emerged with her doctor in a couple of minutes after a brief conversation in the middle of the hallway the doctor left the nurse and turned to come this way while the nurse returned to the station with her partner standing up as the doctor entered the waiting room bracco went back into the hallway one of the nurseshe didnt know which onestill sat at the console facing away from him working at a computer terminal the other was nowhere to be seen he crossed the hall and in ten steps was at the door to the icu a wiredglass pane afforded a clear view inside the room he saw nothing but beds a last look at the typing nurse a glance toward the waiting roomno one was visible in an instant he was inside he checked his watch and moved forcing himself to an almost leisurely pace he walked the periphery marked by the beds stopping while he counted to fivethe most he could bearat each one the entire circuit took him fortyeight seconds again he checked the doors central windowpane then he pushed at it was back in the hall and let it close behind him at the nurses station he cleared his throat and the same woman hed originally spoken to turned from her work at the computer did your partner come back out yet i notice that a doctor just came into the waiting room i was wondering if shed come out with him the nurse smiled at him i think she may have just run to the bathroom for a minute she ought to be right back she too glanced down the hall to where the doctor had gone when she does it might be a good time for those questions you said you had for us thats what i was just working on back there he motioned to the waiting room as it turns out i dont think im going to need them after all but thanks for your time sorry to have bothered you no problem she said anytime downstairs bracco learned that connie rowe had returned from lunch and that she and inspector fisk had gone back to the cafeteria where they could talk without too much interruption by the time he sat down with them fisk had started they sat kittycorner to one another and the tiny tape recorder was on the table between them praying that fisk had remembered to turn it on bracco pulled up his chair q you know inspector bracco from last week ms rowe was just telling me about her partner rajan is it a rajan bhutan q what about him a well as i was telling inspector fisk its nothing really specific the way the shifts break i only wind up working with him in the icu about ten times a year but it seems as though every time hes on something bad happens q do you mean somebody dies a no not just that people are always dying there because theyre usually critical when they come in but i havent worked a shift with rajan without incident in at least the last year i dont mean to speak badly of him butits just really creepy hes really creepy just skulking around never talking to anybody really q do you think he had anything to do with mr markhams death a i dont know about that thats such a strong accusation but then when you all came in on friday and started asking us questions and you notice he barely said a word didnt it seem that way to you and he knows how the shifts work as well as anybody and what happened that day who was there q ms rowe excuse me for butting in but when inspector fisk asked you if you meant that people died in the icu when rajan was on you said not just that isnt that right what did you mean by that not just what a not just dying q but that too a yes but as i say a week doesnt go by without that but thingssupplies i meanthey go missing and he hovers do you know what im saying he lurks and he hovers youll be coming around a corner and hell suddenly just be there standing there its very creepy nobody can stand him q was he there last tuesday in the icu when mr markham died is that what youre saying a we were both in there for both the code blues i know that before that i was at the desk q were you at the computer a i think so its a little jumbled now but i think i was placing some orders but i dont know where he was q ms rowe when you got the signalthe code blue is itand you went into the icu was he already there a yes by mr lector the other man that died q was there anybody else in the room a just dr kensing q and where was he a with rajan by mr lector he was the first code blue q in other words they were not by mr markham a no his monitor went off a few seconds later at one oclock hardy picked up the phone on his desk and heard the drawl of the medical examiner yall owe me a thousand dollars i assumed you were in some kind of hurry seein as you had the body delivered straight from the wake so i worked all day yesterday sunday an brought in my best lab person then a couple of hours this morning mr lector died because his heart stopped beatin and nothin more no potassium nothin diz i ran all the scans down to the c level there wasnt so much as a wayward aspirin he shouldnta had in him that wasnt exactly what id hoped i know that you made it clear enough but look at the bright side no matter what your client didnt kill mr lector this brought a dry chuckle thanks john that eases my mind considerably youre welcome and diz yo while i do love my work there dont seem to be no shortage this here is your wildgoose allotment for the year rajan bhutan spoke through his hangdog face with the clipped singsong formality of the subcontinents accent the woman is an idiot he said with resignation in his tone he was alone in the nurses lounge with bracco and fisk ive had nothing but trouble from her from when she began here because she is lazy and prejudiced against me and now you tell me she accuses me of killing these gentlemen this is really intolerable i will have to speak with her and perhaps with the administration in his inexperience fisk had mentioned that theyd talked to ms rowe and his name had come up now of course bhutan was angry with rowe and wanted to talk about her failings as a nurse and human being rather than what he had done last tuesday night and naturally bhutan also figured that these same police would repeat everything that he said to his coworkers it wasnt the best way to approach an interview it wasnt even the second best way bracco had taken over the lead in the questioning trying to get back on point are you telling us you were not in the room when the monitors for markham went off yes for him i had rushed in for mr lector who was first and where were you just before then a disgusted look settled on his features you may believe this or not but even dr ross must have seen me as he came out of the waiting room when the first monitor called i was with one of the gurneys in the hall right away there i believe there were two or three of them backed up this is intolerable he repeated so let me get this straight bracco prodded youre telling us that when the code blue went off for mr lector there wasnt anybody in the icu except that it wasnt yet a code blue dr kensing had just gone in again before then when i got to mr lectors bedside he had me call it up and then you were all working on mr lector when mr markhams monitors started to do whatever they do they screech continually but yes nobody had just gone near him not that i saw no hardy and freeman were walking uphill on sutter street the sun had never quite cut through the cloud cover and now the fitful breeze of the morning had freshened into steady wind as well it wasnt all in all a great day for a stroll but freeman had told hardy that he could only take some time to talk if they could combine it with a shopping trip to freemans cigar supplier he was almost out of themmeaning hardy supposed that he was down to his last dozen or so but what else could he do the problem is i dont really have anybody else hardy was saying carlathe jealous wifemight have been a good bet but she went dead on me freeman clucked that is inconvenient and then i really thought i had something with the other guy whod died at the same time as markhamlector but strout says no so now im wondering if i should even have wes farrell bother to try to get permission for lorings autopsy who was there freeman got the door to the nob hill cigar and held it open for hardy immediately they were both gripped in the thick humid fragrant embrace of one of the citys most anachronistic destinations freeman observing the ritual he performed every time he bought his cigars in bulk didnt so much as glance at the display downstairs but led the way upstairs hardy tagged along it was pretty much a victorian mens club and while of course women were legally permitted in a dozen or more visits hardy had never seen one here after a few minutes of cigar chitchat with martin their host they found their way to a couple of leather easy chairs with their complimentary snifters of cognacnot for sale not even legally consumable on the premises but always offered nonetheless martin reappeared in a moment offered and lit their cohibas then retired back downstairs to fill freemans order another important element of davids own individualistic ritual was to savor only and not talk until the first ash was ready to fall sometimes this could take ten minutes but hardy found that today although hed come specifically to pick the old mans brain he was happy to sit and reflect the rest of the weekend in monterey had been sublime hardy had always responded to the magic of things nautical and the aquarium seemed to restore something in his soul in his connection to his children his wife suddenly he was more than what he did for a living all the flotsam and jetsam of who he was got stirred shaken it woke him up in the afternoon he bought some swim trunks and theyd gone to the beach explored the tide pools screamed with joy and madness at the freezing water theyd eaten splendidly at the old house walked out on the wharf by moonlight and fed the seals back at their hotel they had managed to upgrade the single room frannie and the kids had stayed in the night before to a suite and with the children sleeping soundly behind the connecting door and a little privacy theyd made love twicenight and morning like newlyweds up here in the smoking room freeman tapped his ash so who was there he asked i believe thats where we were of course he was right hardy rarely even marveled at it anymore but he still had the same answer as last time which was a question of his own where david at the hospital youve told me you need people with a motive to have killed markham but you dont know of anyone else except your client so all right lets assume for the moment that its not him although that continues to make me uncomfortable as hell except still what you need even beyond motive is presence by which i mean that whoever it was had to be there and that brings us back around full circle ill give you a dollar if you can diagram that last sentence for me freeman briefly attempted to glare but the charade didnt hold so he sipped some cognac and sucked on his cigar occasionally he said the gift of wisdom arrives untidily packed when hardy got back to the office it was after four oclock the alcohol had slowed him down while the nicotine had jolted him up he went to his windows and flung them both wide open then got himself a large glass of water and sat down behind his desk in his absence he had had three phone calls the first was from jeff elliot who wanted to know what if any progress hardy had made on the kensing front he was working on another parnassus column and maybe they had some mutually beneficial information they could share in the second message wes farrell was calling to let him know that hed finally persuaded the lorings to let authorities dig up their mother now he was meeting some pretty strong resistance from strout with whom he thought hardy had already cleared it what was going on the third call at last was from his client whom hed been trying to reach all day he called him back first and kensing started off by telling hardy that he still had the kids after the fight with his wife wait a minute eric back up what fight with your wife he explained what had happened in some detail following up with glitskys unexpected visit to his house last night i got the impression he thinks i went over there to hurt her maybe worse hardy remembered glitskys prediction that kensing would do just that but you didnt talk to him again please say you didnt no i didnt let him in but i thought id make myself scarce today probably a good idea whatd you do after hed dropped the kids at their school kensing decided to really take the day off think a little get some kind of plan hed walked across the golden gate bridge and back driven downtown and eaten dim sum in chinatown taken in a movie then gone back for the kids at school hed also just talked to ann she was out of jail and wanted the kids to return to her house but he didnt feel good about that what did hardy think do you think shes a danger to them before saturday i would have said no but ive never seen her like that and weve had our share of fights believe me but nothing physical youre sure this was always a critical point to make it would be very bad if the grand jury discovered that kensing had ever used any kind of violence on his wife better to know now you never hit her eric not even one time id remember i never hit her although shes hit me a few times hardy didnt much like that either but for kensings purposes it was better than if hed hit her okay then exactly what happened saturday i guess she must have finally convinced herself that i killed tim thats what id concluded too would you like me to talk to her do you think shed talk to me he heard the relief in kensings voice thatd be great either one it wasnt really the answer to his question but it was clearly permission hardy felt free to move on eric can you tell me who was at the hospital with you last tuesday where you mean in the icu anywhere near it really sure i think so me obviously the nurses he continued with the litany which was more substantial than hardy had realized that in turn gave him some hope although it might also mean a lot of work he hadnt even heard of all of the players yet and this struck him as unconscionable a new wave of anger at glitsky swept over him what the hell was he doing maybe he had concluded that jackmans deal with hardy wasnt his deal too but in fact it was jackmans deal meant next to nothing without glitskys cooperation the thought passed though the anger did not but hardy was taking notes through it all in addition to carla kensing told him there had been malachi ross markhams assistant brendan driscoll whom kensing seemed to dislike a couple of nurses and two other doctors including judith cohn hardy found himself wondering again how long erics relationship with cohn had been going on he would have to try and talk to her but first after hed hung up with kensing there was ann she answered her telephone yes of course shed talk to him she said anytime he wanted she wanted her children back it turned out that her house was on his way home he could be there in twenty minutes on crutches and with a cast on her foot ann kensing led hardy into the messy living room throwing some dirty kids clothes to the floor from the couch she motioned for him to sit on it and then took her spot at the opposite end now shed heard his opening and he could see her wrestling with what to do with it youre his lawyer mr hardy what else are you going to say i could say a whole lot of things mrs kensing i could say okay he did it but nobodys ever going to be able to prove it i could say he did it but it was a medical mistake that was unintentional i could even say he did it but he had a good reasonseeing mr markham lying there under his power rendered him temporarily insane legally insane dont laugh juries have bought worse stories but what im here to tell you is that he says he didnt do it at all ive been a lawyer for a long time believe me ive had clients lie to me more than once im used to it but the evidence just doesnt prove that your husband did a thing he told me he did it he even told me how before anybody else knew how about that hardy nodded thoughtfully he told me about that too he was mad at you insulted that you could even think he could have killed anybody so he got sarcastic he said he pumped him full of shit yes he did but listen hes a doctor if hes riffing off the top of his head just trying to get you going drugs in the iv is the obvious choice right but he didnt wait for her answer he wanted to keep her from getting wound up by arguing kensing had warned him that when her emotions got her in their grip she let them carry her where they wouldand in her grief over markham and general rage at the situation she wasnt likely to be completely rational now he leaned in toward her what i wanted to talk to you about is how quickly we can get your children back to you as he suspected it might this calmed her slightlyeven she understood it wouldnt serve her well to fly off at him a hand went to her lips as she visibly gathered herself i asked eric if he could bring them back today he didnt want to do that hardy nodded all understanding he talked to me about that i asked him to put himself in your shoes suppose you were perhaps actually thinking that hed killed somebody if that were the case wouldnt he have fought you to keep you from taking them he sat back into the couch affecting a nonchalance he didnt feel if you want my take on this the problem is that youre both excellent parents you both have the same instinct which is to protect your children this is a good thing wouldnt you agree yes i think so her eyes rimmed with exhaustion now shimmered with tears one drop spilled over onto her cheek and she wiped it away with a weary automatic swipe hardy had the feeling shed been doing that so much lately that she didnt even notice anymore hes never hurt them i dont really think he would but then after last week when i thought she shook her head when you thought he killed tim markham she nodded mrs kensing do you really think that in your heart she chewed at her lower lip he could have yes he did hate tim he hated tim i keep hearing that did he hate him more than he did two years ago no i dont think so then less maybe i thought hed gotten used to it okay when he hated him the most did he talk about killing him then was he that mad no no eric wasnt like that hed never she stopped now and looked straight at him suddenly defensive he told me he did yes he did he said those words thats true what was i supposed to think when did he say all this mrs kensing wasnt it last tuesday right after youd heard that mr markham had died right after you accused eric of killing him she didnt reply he kept up the press he told me you were in agony youd just found out that the man you loved was gone you were lashing out at the world at the injustice of that lashing out at him because maybe you felt he was safe isnt that the way it was hed never get another chance in court in front of a jury shed have her story down pat shed have been coached over and over again by the prosecution shed never embarrass herself by admitting that she might have misunderstood or exaggerated indeed by that time any doubt would have long since vanished even by now she had already invested a great deal in erics confession hardy hoped he could lead her to a path by which she could withdraw if not with her dignity intact then at least with some grace but she couldnt let it go easily she was pressing her fingers so hard against her mouth that her knuckles were white her eyes were closed in concentration in recollection i was just solost and hurt i wanted to hurt him too you mean eric so you accused him of killing tim knowing it would hurt him too yes suddenly she opened her eyes released a pentup breath yes and he said absolutely absolutely she repeated and you took that to mean that he admitted the truth of what you were accusing him of killing tim yes i suppose so but looking back on it is that what it sounds like to you now is that really what he meant do you think that hed actually done it or were you both just snapping at each other in the tension of the moment hardy lowered his voice to the level of intimacy mrs kensing let me ask you to think about something else after you left the hospital that day and came back here to your life you had a day or so to get used to this tragedy isnt that right before the police came to talk to you what else could i do it was the middle of the week the kids had school it was just me and them sure i understand but during that time before youd heard about the potassium you had quite a bit of time during which you say you believed eric had killed tim and yet you made no attempt to go to the police yourself the question surprised her and she hesitated for a moment perhaps wondering about the why of her answer no i didnt know why do you think not if you dont mind because i thoughti mean i guess i believedid heard tim died from the accident and you believed that for two days even after eric had apparently told you hed killed him mrs kensing did you get any sleep in those two days shaking her head no she began to sob quietly but hardy had to go on so when you heard tim had been killed on purpose that it hadnt been the accident what went through your mind i dont know when i heard about itit was so unreal almost as though hed died again a second time and thats when you remembered what eric had said the first time yes but in spite of erics apparent confession you never really seriously considered that tim had died of anything but the hitandrun accident but he said but you didnt believe him at the time did you you didnt believe him because you knew he didnt mean it literally as a statement of fact he said it to hurt you didnt he it was a sarcastic and hurtful way to call you stupid wasnt it that youd asked such a question she looked at him in a kind of panic forcing him to backpedal slightly im not trying to put words in your mouth mrs kensing im just trying to find out what really happened what you recall now today hardy waited through the lengthy silence i mean she said if tim had been killed that changed everything didnt it i agree it changed that it was no longer an accident he let her live with it for another long moment mrs kensing ann im not going to lie to you your testimony here is critical and as you said when i first got here im erics lawyer ive got a vested interest in keeping him out of jail he waited again until she met his eyes if in your heart you believe that eric killed tim and meant it when he said he did im not even going to try to talk you out of it you know what you know but eric is among the things that you know best for better or worse isnt that right and hes been a good father as you admit a good doctor maybe even by your own estimation a good man she was nodding fighting back more tears i always thought he was he is and finally the nub of it do you really believe he could have killed tim that he actually did that because if he didnt mrs kensing somebody else did and thats the person id like to find whoever it might be and to do that im going to need your help the real problem with the reunion between eric and ann kensing was that hardy didnt know that glitsky had assigned an officer to protect mrs kensing from her husband should he come back to try and kill her again when hardy had rung the bell and been admitted to mrs kensings house an hour before this officer hadnt molested hardy in any way although he had placed a call to glitsky informing him of the circumstances so at glitsky knocked at the door himself ann kensing got up and thinking it was her husband with her children she opened it hardy who had remained seated in the living room jumped up when he heard the voice but it was too lateglitskys foot was already across the threshold holding up his badge he had asked if he could come in and ann had seen no reason not to let him hardy fiercely protective and fuming stopped when he got to the hallway what the hell are you doing here are you following me then to ann you can ask him to leave he doesnt have a warrant but glitsky had already won that round she let me in i dont need a warrant so whats your point hardy asked taking another step toward him just general harassment this time just kick all the rules out glitsky ignored him and spoke to ann i thought you might want some moral support before your husband and this mr hardy doubleteam you has he theatened you in any way no she looked back and forth at the two angry men well just hardy held out a hand interrupting ann please just what mrs kensing are you saying he has threatened you no but he told me some rights that maybe now glitsky interrupted is he your lawyer too god forbid you havent let him talk you into that no hes by now the voices had pitched up hardy couldnt resist finishing her thought which wouldhe was suregive him the next round there never was any confession you didnt take the trouble to get the context of my clients statements glitsky stood stock still rocked by the blow although hed expected something very much like it the confirmation of the news was a haymaker his scar flared his eyes blazed it took a moment for him to get his senses back all right he said finally softly but both of you are now going to hear me out and in the most reasonable tone he could muster he proceeded to give her an earful of angry cop like ms kensing you said that your husband confessed to murder thats part of the record in this case if you go changing your story under oath someone could decide youre committing perjury you might get in very big trouble yourself do you understand that like isnt it obvious to you that mr hardy here is using your own children as bargaining chips so that youll help him get his client off could it be any more transparent like of course your husband isnt pressing charges against you about what happened saturday hes lucky he didnt have them brought against himself but please be clear on this he doesnt decide what charges get filed the da does try to understand that what hes really doing is trading your possible misdemeanor charge against his own murder rap like you dont have to make this kind of deal we can in all likelihood have a judge sign a troa temporary restraining orderand get your children back with you finally hardy had had enough glitsky was overdoing it besides it was in his own best interests to rise to her defense actually the lieutenants a little off base theres no judge in the world who would grant a tro on whats going on here he turned to mrs kensing unless it must be said he issued it against you youre the one with charges pending here not your husband back at glitsky his voice hardened and you know the womans got every right in the world to talk to me lieutenant we need to know exactly what dr kensing said and if perhaps your inspectors were too eager mrs kensing got it wrong the first time and realizing that would like to get back on some kind of cordial footing with her exhusband so that they can cooperate as they always have before on raising their children i dont see how you can have any kind of problem with that glitskys scar seemed to glow red in the dusky light you dont you dont consider what youre doing tampering with this witness absolutely not you deny that youre bringing undue influence to bear hardy bit back his initial response which prominently featured the vulgarity glitsky so despised instead he turned again to mrs kensing am i forcing you to do anything hes not lieutenant glitsky believed that like he believed in the easter bunny he wanted to pull hardy into another room where they could duke out some of their continued differences outside of the presence of this woman but if he suggested that he knew it would come across as though he were trying to hide something from her and he couldnt have that either there was no other good option so he went right ahead with what he had to say well ill tell you what counselor id call this tampering id call it undue influence if not outright coercion jackman cut you a sweet deal okay but thats not carte blanche to sabotage any case we might be building i think hes going to find you went way over the line with this to say nothing of this autopsy charade im learning about with strout and now he tells me youve got wes farrell on your team too trying to pull the same crap wes isnt on any team of mine lieutenant hes got his own client and his own problems yeah which includes somebody else who died at portola hospital just surfacing at this moment you expect me to believe that its just a coincidence is it i dont expect youd believe anything i said but im not trying to obstruct this case im trying to see it for what it is and solve it glitsky just about spit it out yeah well thats my job hardy shot it back at him then do it i just tried and jackman stopped me he did you a favor glitsky snorted scornfully youre telling me i got the wrong man then how come every time i turn around youre playing some legal game covering his rear endcutting your deal with jackman muddying the waters with strout talking to my witness here you know what that makes me think youve got something to hide that all youre doing is trying to get your client off and be damned with the law and be damned with the truth thats not who i am and you know it yeah well if the shoe fits glitsky turned to ann kensing youre making a mistake here he told her if you want to change your mind again after youve calmed down youve got my number hardy was in a true high rage now and he wheeled on them both his voice laden with disdain if you do make him promise he wont charge you with perjury glitsky glared at him you think thats funny no hardy snapped i dont think its funny at all while the kensing children got used to their mother again the cast on her foot the bandage on the back of her head their father stayed away from her he called out for a pizza delivery and spent the best part of the next half hour picking up around the househe collected and started two loads of laundry put every dish and utensil he could find into the dishwasher ran a sponge mop over the kitchen floor hardy called frannie to tell her he would be a little late yes sorry he knew but he was still shooting to be in time for dinner which theyd rescheduled over the past weekend for instead of or to better accommodate hardys workday he also took an extra minute and described a bit of his terrible fight with glitsky he needed to talk to her he needed her and he would definitely be home by she could set the clock by it hardy went to the bathroom to throw some water on his face hoping it would counteract some of the nausea he was feeling the residue of his argument with glitsky he felt as though hed swallowed a rock when he returned the children were devouring pizza in the kitchen a video of some action flick on and purposely turned up loud in the living room ann and eric had taken their respective neutral corners and now they sat in silence not even facing each other waiting for hardy he started to go back to his old spot on the couch with ann but decided that this might have the appearance that he was taking sides so he stayed on his feet and stood by the trashand ashfilled fireplace both of you are doing the right thing he began i know its hard he looked from one of them to the other both obviously still seethed he kept on ive been involved with this case for going on a week now and theres far too much i dont know we need to talk together about it who might have killed mr markham ann took it as an opening and she wasted no time getting to the crux all right ive heard your lawyer tell me you didnt do it eric heres another chance for you why dont you tell me yourself he turned his head to face her then shook it in disgust and weariness and brought a flat dead glance back to her and answered her with no inflection at all fuck you there she exploded to hardy see thats him thats who he really is kensing came right at her up out of his chair his voice a rasping whisper so the children wouldnt hear you dont have a clue who i am anymore im just so tired of your shit did i kill tim for christs sake fuck that and fuck you again eric hardy began but now his client turned on him i dont have to listen to this all over again do i it wont work with her you can see for yourselfshes an irrational menace im out of here and im taking the kids with me dont you touch them again she might use crutches for her sprained ankle but ann could move quickly enough without them when she had to she was at the entrance into the hallway blocking kensings way before hed gone three steps hardy moved too as fast as he could getting himself between them for an instant he thought he and his client were going to mix it up get out of my way diz not happening hardy said you going to make me dont you make me see ann was saying this was saturday this is what he did then i didnt do anything on saturday he pointed at her over hardys shoulder you want to talk about the problem here you want to talk danger to the kids you want to talk unstable then he took it directly to her you really think ive got it in me to kill somebody give me a break ann my whole life is keeping people alive but you lock me out raving about maybe im here to kill my own children thats real craziness thats scary fucking lunacy hardy had to find a wedge to get in or this was over before it started speaking of scared she was scared eric shes got no call to be scared of me ive never done anything to hurt her if she doesnt know that he shifted his focus from hardy to her his own anguish now evident in his voice what were you thinking ann whats the matter with you finally a plea would i ever hurt a kid one of my kids how could i ever do that ann was almost pantingtaking quick deep breaths when the police told me i justi was afraidi didnt hardy thought she would break again into sobs but she got hold of herself this time i didnt know what to think eric cant you understand that i loved tim and he was dead i hadnt slept in two days i was so scared of me how could you be scared of me now she pleaded for understanding from him i was just scared okay of everything her voice was small i didnt want to make another mistake and then of course i did it was the closest thing to an apology kensing was going to get hardy recognized that and took the moment why dont we sit back down did ross go in hardy asked it must have been minutes before the monitors went off he might have he could have i just dont know where were you then anns anger hadnt entirely passed i thought you were on the floor its not that big how could you not know kensing kept any defensiveness out of his reply directed as much to hardy as to ann we had three patients in the hall one of them was having problems coming out of the anesthesia so rajanhes one of the nurseshe and i were checking vitals pretty closely during those minutes anybody could have walked behind meim sure some people didand i might not have noticed an hour before brendan driscoll had just walked all the way in how did that happen hardy asked kensing shrugged nobody stopped him youd have to know him he carries himself with a lot of authority if any of the nurses would have said anything he would have just said its all right i belong here and they probably would have accepted it i hate the little bastard ann added he actually believed he could order tim around did he hardy asked order him around he tried especially when it came to his time scheduling and how did tim feel about that he couldnt live without him eric put in unable to keep some fresh venom out of his voice brendan did about half his work wrong ann kensing wasnt going to let eric slander tim tim thought big brendan was good with details but brendan didnt do tims work he took orders eric snorted in disagreement theres no question who was the leader so there was friction between them major eric said youve got to know brendan to appreciate him the little engine that could hardy came back to ann what else did they fight about besides you she hesitated i think some of tims financial decisions tim was more of a risk taker with parnassuss money hardys main interest was the murder but if he could uncover some business dirt that might be helpful to jackman hed be glad to have it well i dont know exactly the last couple of years theyve had to run pretty leanand then there were some personnel problems me for example ann shrugged it was the truth well yes among others kensing amplified brendan wanted tim to fire me straight out starting three or four years ago make an example of me why what had you done general attitude i think more than anything lack of respect i kind of took the lead in standing up for the patients over money ann jumped in to qualify that tim would say in resisting the company hardy cut off the potential argument so how did the secretary get involved in all this he had no real power did he how did rasputin get in eric asked he had no real power either the dynamic was still eluding hardy but the guys just a secretary right for the first time ann and eric shared the same reactiona shared joke mr driscoll eric explained was an executive assistant never ever ever a secretary and i hope thats clear ann added a wan smile flickering as to how he got where he did eric kept it on point as anns mentioned he was the detail guy well you take care of enough details pretty soon it looks like you run the shop ann started to say something perhaps defend markham again but eric held out his hand stopping her look this is what happens you get called to the office of the ceo youre uptight to begin with so youre waiting outside markhams office by brendans desk and his attitude tells you that whatever trouble you might have thought you were in in fact its worse then while you wait and wait and you do brendan the very welldressed and extremely formal executive assistant basically explains the ground rules mr markham doesnt like personal confrontation he prefers to keep meetings short within a week he tells you youll receive a written precis of the main points covered and actions you discussed that would be taken you should then sign this letter to acknowledge its contents and return it to the office the point got made the guy had developed this just unbelievable array of rules and protocol all designed to insulate and protect his boss i mean hed write in unsigned postscripts at the bottom of letters and youd think they were from tim suddenly hearing the specifics hardy understood completely david freemans receptionist phyllis was a lesser version of brendan driscoll hardy had been humorously pressing freeman to fire her for about five years but the old man wouldnt hear of it saying hed never get his work done without her and perhaps he believed it but hardy had on several occasions seen phyllis restrict access to freeman so thoroughlyand with such sincere compassion and sympathythat associates she didnt like had finally quit the firm over it thinking all the while it had been freeman whod been stiffing them and tim was okay with this hardy asked actually no ann said when he finally started seeing the extent of it i think it was one of those things that started small you know then over time got out of hand enough to get driscoll fired hardy asked ann hesitated she brushed some hair back away from her forehead the truth is that tim felt he was having some kind of midlife breakdown the business was falling apart around him then his marriage his kids all that thats why he went back to carla to see if he could save something hed worked years to build but its also why he couldnt fire brendan though he knew he should but he couldnt while everything else in his life was in such upheaval he depended on him too completely hardy didnt know how much of it was true how much was a function of markhams rationalizations to his mistress so that he could appear sensitive and caring one thing was sure thoughann believed it did tim talk to him hardy asked give him any kind of warning sure brendan knew i think that tim had made up his mind to let him go it was just a question of the timing tim couldnt hide that from him if he wanted to i dont think if thats what youre asking and suddenly hardy was thinking that driscoll was at least some kind of suspect how did he feel about carla you mean would he kill her and the kids what for thats my question she was still thinking about her answer when kensing had one if he felt that tim was personally dumping him i could see him wanting to wipe out any trace of him the whole family but this was san francisco hardy had to ask the question and youre convinced ann that tim was completely straight sexually he and brendan didnt have something else going on tim wasnt gay ann said dismissing the idea out of hand promise which hardy knew did not make it a certainty by any means eric spoke up again but if brendan kills tim hes unemployed but hes not fired is he hes the loyal and hardworking executive assistant up until the very end he gets another job in fifteen minutes another thought occurred to hardy another tack when you threw him out of the icu where did he go i dont know off the floor anyway there must have been very little pleasure in the original situation but kensing relished something about the memory of it he didnt seem to believe that i could do that to him order him out of there he found out and youre sure he didnt return before the code blue i dont think he did i cant say for sure i told you i was busy out in the hall but he was definitely still in the hospital at least oh yeah after tim died he sighed again he didnt take it well it was pathetic in fact embarrassing hardy checked his watch he had fortyfive minutes before he needed to be home and he didnt want to start something he couldnt finish but putting these two together was turning out very well and annas markhams loverhad access to parts of his psyche that would be unknown to anyone else let me ask you ann he began what was in those original memos to ross that made tim so mad let me guess kensing said sinustop ann nodded thats it she looked at hardy have you heard of it its a new hay fever pill isnt it hardy had a vague memory but there was some problem with it not for most people kensing said some people though developed the unfortunate side effect of death this was after the reps dumped thousands of samples on us and the directive came down from the corporate office from dr ross ann interrupted he made those decisions not tim if you say so kensings look told hardy he wasnt buying that anyway he continued this stuff was so inexpensive and miraculous that we were strongly urged to prescribe it to all of our patients with any and all allergy symptoms you know about samples not enough hardy replied tell me well any new drug comes out their reps go out and try to get doctors to give them to patients for free the idea of course is brandname recognition the stuff works its on the formulary we prescribe it bingo a wonder drug is born but the sample campaign for sinustop was just unbelievable nationwide they must have given away a billion pills and this was unusual kensing nodded soberly the numbers were unusual yes so what was the problem between markham and ross hardy asked ann looked over at eric then back to hardy tim heard about the first death and got a bad gut feeling he asked ross to call back all the samples and take it off the formulary until they could check it out further but he didnt ann shook her head worse than that really he and tim had had these fights before but ross was really superinvested in this one he tells tim hes the medical director he knows this stuff tim just runs the business side why doesnt he stick to that and keep his nose out of the medicine which he doesnt know anything about so they went at it kensing seemed jolted out of his silence wait a minute wait a minute youre not saying tim was the good guy here i hope she faced him with an angry and pitiless look whats he supposed to do eric tell me that hardy didnt want to let any more friction develop kensing had enough reasons to hate markham on his ownhe wasnt going to change his mind because maybe tim had been a better ceo than hed thought so how long had tim and ross been together they were two of the founders she shrugged you could look it up and recently theyd had more than one of these sinustoptype fights she frowned a few tim thought rosss decisions werent good medicine he believed we had to keep delivering a good product product eric said snorting i like that hardy ignored the interruption but then with sinustop things got worse what finally happened well ross got his way they didnt pull the samples kensing supplied the ending and sixteen other people died around the country two of them with parnassus in the telling hardy had come to remember the scandal clearly now but although it had been prominent in the news he didnt recall that parnassus had been any part of it and he said as much ann jumped to markhams defense tim covered for ross thats why kensing was shaking his head not he turned to hardy tim released a statement that the two patients who had died had taken samples theyd gotten here from before the first death had been reportedapparently this was trueand that wed recalled all the samples and taken sinustop off the formulary at the first indication of any problem not true and if you call that covering for ross thats what he did ann snapped at him hardy jumped in before the smoldering anger in the room could erupt again okay good he said thats the kind of thing i want you both to keep thinking about he turned to each of them in turn but tension remained high he was afraid to push his luck any further standing he kept up his patter to keep them from each other im afraid ive got another appointment mrs kensing thanks for your time were settled in terms of the kids right all good there eric id like a few words with you on our way out ill wait while you tell your children good night honey im home ricky ricardo he wasnt but for years early in their marriage hardy had come through the front door with his deadon imitation hed made it with four minutes to spare by his watch and considering the everescalating demands of the case that had been consuming his hours he felt hed done well all lanky arms and legs rebecca came flying down the hallway daddy im so glad youre home she jumped at him and knocked him back but he held on and gave her a spin in the dining room the table was set frannie came to the door of the kitchen with her arms crossed over her chest but she was smiling cutting it close buster very very close ill get better i promise they shared a chaste married kiss vincent hanging back by the family room said gross so the two adults made eye contact and suddenly had their arms around each other making out like teenagers he picked frannie all the way up off the ground and she kicked back her heels gross me out vincent shouted cmon you guys please just stop okay this was rebecca arbiter of social correctness to the whole family i cant help it hardy said finally stopping your mother makes me crazy kiss me kiss me kiss me frannie begged hardy complied the romantic assault drove the two kids to the front of the house gagging at peak volume the last kiss turned into a semireal one and when it ended frannie caught her breath for a second then said oh that reminds me treya called this morning we talked for nearly an hour hardy was thinking this was swell the wives were going to referee and that would end with them all hating one another what about he asked shes pregnant malachi ross sat kittycorner to marlene ash at a large table in the police commissioners hearing room facing the members of the grand jury when ross had first come in he took the oath and sat down declining to remove the jacket to his suit this had been a mistake once the initial opportunity had passed no other appropriate moment presented itself he didnt want to seem nervous which he was by now he was sweating heavily rooms in the hall of justice were traditionally far too hot or way too cold due to the state power crisis maintenance crews had adjusted each and every one of the thermostats in the building now all the rooms that had been too cold were too hot and vice versa it must have been eighty degrees in the airless chamber rosss original plan was to cooperate fully with the investigation into tim markhams death and to that end his time in the witness chair began amicably enough for nearly a half hour this attractive and competent woman walked him through the many years of his and tims relationship the founding of parnassus the social contacts shared by the two men ms ash was looking for the person who had killed tim he had expected this sort of background drill had even mentally prepared himself for it hed just given the grand jury a couple of minutes on the nature of his professional relationship with mr markham hed told them that there had been very little friction between the two of them over the course of a dozen years although of course theyd had their disagreements but basically they respected and trusted each other marlene ash took this moment to stand up and move off a few steps into the center of the room this was when the focus of the interrogation began to change dr ross she said turning back to where he sat how is parnassus doing financially right now he took a misdirected shot at some levity were doing about as well as most health organizations in the country which isnt saying much but were still afloat if thats what you mean a frigid smile not quite i was hoping you could tell us with more specificity one can be afloat and still sinking at the same time isnt that right wasnt that the entire second half of titanic arent you now the acting ceo of the corporation yes he composed himself looking down at his linked fingers when he raised his gaze to the grand jury the effect of the tragedy hed endured was apparent after last tuesday after timmr markhamdied the board appointed me ceo on an interim basis so youre intimately familiar with the companys financial situation are you not well its been less than a week i wouldnt say ive got the handle on it that mr markham had but im reasonably conversant with the numbers yes and frankly have been for some time then you would know if in fact parnassus is under some financial duress wouldnt you yes has the company in fact considered filing for bankruptcy understanding that financial pressures at parnassus would clearly appear to the da to be a possible motive for markhams death ross had expected his inquisitor to get to this line of questioning sometime but now that it was here he felt somewhat unprepared he ran a couple of fingers over his damp forehead considered whether he should ask permission to take off his coat or simply do it in the end he did nothing its certainly been discussed its an option weve considered do you know if mr markham had considered it as well yes the matter has been on the table now for some time during the next fortyfive minutes ash led him on a grueling journey through the parnassus books through the intricacies of incomes copays expenses payrolls premiums and corporate salaries the damned woman seemed to know enough to cut through his obfuscation and get to the real nuts and bolts of how the place worked ross knew that many other employees had also gotten subpoenas and figuring that on balance they would tell the truth he had no choice but to stay close to the facts himself so dr ross to your knowledge is parnassus going bankrupt in the next six months if not please explain how you plan to keep the company solvent the sheer effrontery of the question made him want to snap back that it was none of her goddamn business but he realized that he was trapped now began a catandmouse game where he provided as vague and general a version as possible of his plans for parnassus from which ashcalm collected and apparently with all the time in the worldpried out details one by one and piece by piece he felt as if he were being very slowly ground to sausage by the time they finished the water pitcher in front of him was empty and he was so wet with perspiration he might well have dumped its contents over his head instead of drinking it the only good news was that the questions about the formulary had centered on the dollars and cents details such as how much items cost and the volume of prescriptions ash didnt really probe how new drugs got listed in the first place ross found it agonizing to wait for that shoe to dropwhat if they knew or even suspected wouldnt they have had to tell him he was under investigation would he have to stop and insist on seeing a lawyer but these fears remained unrealized ash moved along to her own priorities so dr ross to summarize it is your testimony under oath that you do not expect parnassus to go bankrupt within the next six months whether or not the city pays the thirteenmilliondollar bill it has presented ross put on a fresh face for the nineteen citizens seated in front of him he was surprised to see such a focus an apparent interest in most of them they were waiting for his answer although he had a sense of gathering impatience but maybe he realized that was him well never say never bankruptcy protects the corporation from its creditors true and we could indeed use some relief there if the city defaults on its obligation but with a group like us when our biggest client is the city and county of san francisco it would also negatively impact our credibility which is not too high as it is as some of you may know weve been getting a lot of bad press lately im glad you brought that up dr ross ash looked like she meant it i was hoping that you could give us some insight on the type of disagreements that must have surfaced at parnassus in light of say the baby emily case i should tell you that the grand jury already has a working knowledge of those events maybe you could fill in some of the blank spots specifically mr markhams role and reactions of various staff to it please begin with mr markham are you saying you think his death might be related to baby emily or something of that nature thats what this inquiry is about doctor mr markhams death she had moved a few steps closer to him and now standing while he sat she loomed as somewhat threatening someone introduced a lethal dose of potassium into his iv as a doctor would you agree that it is unlikely that this could have been an accident ross didnt know what kind of answer ash wanted he wished they would have allowed him to bring his lawyer into the room he had to rely now upon the truth and this made him uneasy its always possible to give an improper dose of any drug if mr markhams heartbeat had become irregular i could envision the need to administer a therapeutic dose of potassium its also possible though rare for a drugs concentration in solution to differ from whats on the label he was slightly shocked to find ash prepared for this of course please assume we have the drip bag that held the potassium in this case and the concentration is correct also assume that there is no indication that mr markhams heart prior to the attack brought on by the overdose was malfunctioning so given these assumptions do you have any explanation for these events other than that this was an intentionally administered overdose ross wiped sweat from his upper lip i guess i dont see any other possibility do you mind if i take off my coat not at all in half a minute he was seated again ash hadnt lost her place so doctor if mr markham was intentionally overdosed i didnt say that then amending i didnt realize wed gotten to there at this ash turned dramatic she paused as though in midthought and glared down at him thats exactly where we are doctor did you and mr markham have serious disagreements for example over policy ross lifted his chin in controlled outrage are you joking he asked her about what as i take it youre asking me if some argument about business would have made me want to kill my longtime friend and business partner i resent the hell out of the question i never asked that question ash said you made that leap yourself but having asked it please answer she fixed him with a steadfast gaze he matched her with one of his own no then nothing nothing that even remotely would have made me consider anything like that he spoke directly to the jury tim was my friend a close friend ross forced himself to slow down a fresh pitcher of water had appearedmaybe it had been there for a while he poured some into his glass and took a sip i need to point out ms ash that the medical decision on baby emily though hugely unpopular wasnt all wrong baby emily did in fact make it to county and to the premature baby unit where she lived until she was transported back to portola i didnt kill her by any means or even endanger her unnecessarily but how did mr markham react to all this he was all right with it until it became big news you two did not have words over it of course we did after it blew up on us he thought i should have consulted him that i shouldnt have acted only on business considerations again he directed his words to the grand jury we had some heated words thats true we run a big complicated business together and our roles sometimes overlap wed been doing this for twelve years he made some eye contact decided hed be damned if hed even dignify ashs insinuation with a further denial as theyd been sitting down to the tuesday lunch group at lou the greeks treya had made apologies for glitskys absence hed been called away at the last minute to a murder scene in hunters point hardy was convinced that this excuse was an outright falsehood a murder scene at hunters point indeed he mused as though they didnt happen every week hardy knew that unless some gangbangers had slaughtered themselves and twenty or thirty other bystanders in a daylight shootout involving children drugs the goodyear blimp and a sighting of the zodiac killer glitsky the administrator wouldnt need to be called to a murder scene in hunters point in hardys mind the nature of the excuse had even deeper implications the mundanity of the explanation though perfectly plausible on the surface was in reality so lame that hardy took it to be a secret yet personal fuckyou message to himself murder scene my ass he thought right up there with my grandmother died or the dog ate my homework furious at most of them but especially at him abe was avoiding the group today it probably hadnt helped when hed gotten the word this morning that jackman had directed strout to go ahead with wes farrells request to dig up his clients mother before theyd sat down strout told hardy that he had called abe as a courtesy to tell him about this decision hed endured an angry earful of glitskys opinion on the question then thanked him for it and said hed be going ahead on jackmans approval anyway but no one else seemed bothered by his absence theyd barely gotten settled before the conversation had gotten into full swing david freeman had started with a few comments about the parnassus situation how prescient theyd all been last week before too long half the table had chimed in with one comment or another eventually they got to jeff elliots first column on malachi ross which led jeff to ask marlene ash if shed talked to ross yet and if so how hed fared before the grand jury shed smiled glanced at jackman and sipped her iced tea no comment im afraid even if were off the record here ross and markham were close personal friends is what i hear hardy said never a cross word between them he shot a look at treya across the table from him kind of like me and abe but elliot thought he knew where the story lay let me ask you this marlene he began diz thinks they are close personal friends yet i have heard that they disagreed on just about every decision either one of them made over the past couple of yearsbaby emily sinustop formulary issues you name it marlene ash sipped her iced tea i cant talk about it jeff its the grand jury get it im not even saying who i talked to you want to think it was ross you go ahead it was today though right the grand jury still meets tuesdays and thursdays gina roake joined in anybody else here for repealing the first amendment but the words were innocent banter lightly delivered she cant talk about it jeff really even to an ace reporter like yourself and far be it from me to try to make her elliot shook his head truly amused at the games these lawyers played and apparently even took seriously he flashed a smile around the table however for our own edification dr ross has a secretary joanne who told me when i called that thats where he was i dont think shes been let in on the top secret part she talked to you roake asked incredulously after what you did to her boss last week elliot nodded soberly she might have gotten the impression that i called to apologize or something as freeman and jackman fell into a more serious discussion about last weeks issuethe possibly fraudulent outpatient billingshardy leaned over and spoke quietly to elliot howd you hear about sinustop same way i found out ross was at the grand jury im a reporter i ask youd be surprised people talk not as surprised as youd think ive talked to a few people myself have you found anything on kensings list elliot gave the high sign and stopped as lou came around and described todays special which involved eggplant tofu squid and some kind of sesame oilbased sweetandsour sauce really good he promised maybe even a culinary breakthrough although those werent the exact words he used when theyd all ordered the special since there was no other choice lou moved to another table and the buzz resumed at jackmans elliot leaned back toward hardy but about those unexplained deaths i know one thing is true its a definite rumor hardys face fell was jeff ahead of him on checking out the names on kensings list maybe hed discovered that eight of the others had died like james lector of natural causes what do you mean hardy asked i said that wrong i think calm down elliot put a hand on hardys sleeve i dont mean its only a rumor as in theres no truth to it what i mean is its a rumor a lot of people are talking about it if i could find a few more items like that id like to patch them all together and get another column but theres no story there yet ive talked to some people at portola but nobody has even one small factoid it sucks what about our friend ross a shrug i did him already you might recall and after that its pretty much a onenote samba ross and mother teresa dont share a common worldview but other than the fact that hes greedy heartless and rich i cant seem to get another column inch out of it i may have something for you pay attention hardy then directed his attention across the table john he raised his voice so strout could hear him i almost forgot he took an envelope from his pocket and passed it across do me a favor next time i give tentoone odds on anything remind me about this one as hardy had intended this little show engaged everyones interest hed originally planned the move as a way to make his case indirectly to glitsky if he could draw the group into a discussion on the lector autopsy without having to labor over it abe might come to see that hardys position wasnt entirely selfserving that it wasnt a lawyers cheap smoke screen either that the idea had merit on its own and had been worth pursuing now though he realized that he could make a similar impression on treya and trust that it would get back to abe through her for the truth remainedif he couldnt get glitsky working on his side he would almost certainly never completely clear his clients name also though still raw with anger he wasnt inclined to lose his best friend over his job he already had sacrificed enough to his career to the chorus of questions hardy replied that it was merely the payment of a debt of honor i felt strongly that james lector had been killed at portola as tim markham had been although maybe not in the exact same way and i put my money where my mouth was jackman and freeman disagreed as to whether this was noble or idiotic but the discussion did give hardy the opportunity to segue into wes farrells situation with mrs loring which had been his other intention all along elliot he noticed started taking notes but jackman wasnt letting hardy off without some kind of a warning they were standing on the corner of seventh and bryant just after lunch waiting for the light jackman had held hardy back under the guise of telling him an offcolor joke about arkansas vasectomies these were quite common it seemed and involved a can of beer a cherry bomb and the inability to count to ten without using your fingers when hardy finished laughing he found that theyd hung back enough now to be alone at the curb jackman was good with jokes because he never laughed at his own punch lines no part of him was laughing now i did want to make one serious point diz if you can spare another minute the switch in tone was abrupt enough to be surprising and hardys expression showed it all right he said of course due to the nature of our deal ive been working under an assumption that ive taken to be true butmarlene mentioned this to me last night just before i decided to okay your request for johns second autopsy that wasnt me sir that was wes farrell its his client diz the voice was deep nearly caressing avuncular jackman laid a hand that seemed to weigh about thirty pounds on hardys shoulder lets not go there hardy thought these were as impressive and effective a few syllables as hed ever heard sorry he said and he meant it as i was sayingjackmans hand was back in his pocket they were strolling now in the crosswalkive been working under the assumption that we are sharing our information were giving you our discovery and you in turn are giving us your clients cooperation before the grand jury when he gets there but beyond that i would hope youre also giving usgiving abe specificallywhatever information you uncover that doesnt implicate your client they walked a few steps in silence hardy finally spoke hes not been in much of a listening mood lately i realize that but id appreciate it if youd keep trying thats been my intention but the deal was that my client would talk to the grand jury not a bunch of cops in a small room with a videotape machine i take your point but abe seems to be skating toward the erroneous conclusion that somehow were all conniving to circumvent due process theyd reached the steps of the hall of justice and stopped walking jackman was frowning deeply im extremely sensitive to this issue to even the appearance of it has abe actually said that no but he doesnt like being ordered not to arrest someone with respect clarence thats nothing like what you did you admitted when we cut the deal that you probably didnt have enough for a conviction even with the socalled confession and now he doesnt even have that which i need hardly point out is the latest complaint hardy nodded hes in a complaining mood clarence he thinks i saw the opportunity for emotional blackmail and took it which i need hardly point out kind of pisses me off i didnt and wouldnt do that and abe of all people ought to know it well one of you big boys is going to have to find a way to settle your differences and meanwhile marlene would probably like to be kept informed of what youve discovered whether it comes through abe or not youve obviously got a few things going on these autopsies for example and as an aside let me say that as a courtesy and in keeping with our spirit of mutual cooperation it might have been appropriate to call them to our attention a bit sooner he waved off hardys apology before it began it doesnt matter thats water under the bridge but dont forget that ive gone out on a limb here especially with the chief of homicide on this call to let strout go ahead im hoping theseunusual exercises have a point that your client isnt going to do something stupid or go sideways and refuse to talk at the grand jury that would make me feel foolish that wont happen clarence but i cant stand here and tell you ive got another suspect whos any better than kensing the good news is i have some who arent much worse jackman took this news mildly then you need to get abe looking at them thats my fondest dream clarence honest other than wes farrells autopsy paying off with what hardys face showed his apprehension at this point clarence almost anything they said their goodbyes and hardy watched jackmans back disappear into the building a press of humanity was hanging out on the steps grabbing smokes or snagging lastminute legal advice or simply ebbing and flowing from the hall itself a couple of enormous great danes were chained to one of the metal banisters everyone who passed gave the two dogs a wide berth as they slept on the warm stonedue to the recent death of a young woman by dog mauling the popularity of mans best friend in the city was at an alltime low at the far end of the steps a young chinese couple was having lunch on either side of a boombox that blared with asian rap the smell of baothose delicious buns of sticky dough and savory barbecued porkmade him suddenly realize how hungry he was lous special today may have broken new culinary ground but most of the table hadnt evolved to the point where they could appreciate it hardy hadnt eaten more than three bites when hed given jackman enough time to disappear hardy went inside himself and rode the elevator to the fourth floor glitsky wasnt in his office hardy walked out into the hall and punched a number into his cell phone two rings then the mellifluous tones glitsky hows hunters point whos this take a stab a beat what do you want five minutes where are you really department twentytwo this was a courtroom on the third floor if anything at all had been going on in it glitsky would have turned off his phonenot to do so would incur the wrath of judge leo chomorro so the courtroom was dark or in recess and glitsky was in hiding if hardy was going to accuse abe of withholding discovery from himand he washe was going to do it to his face the lieutenant sat in the back row the seat farthest from the center aisle he looked over briefly at hardys entrance but didnt seem inclined to make an effort to meet him halfway which made two of them i just talked to clarence hes of a mind that we should cooperate hardys voice echoed in the empty and cavernous space i might have mentioned to him that that was a twoway street but i didnt that was noble of you i was wondering though why your inspectors never got around to checking whod been near the icu when mark ham died did you just tell them that kensing did it so they didnt need to bother glitskys head turned to face him what are you talking about im talking about bracco and the other guy his partner what theyve been doing this past week glitsky folded his arms over his chest and shook his head hardy took the nonresponse as a kind of answer because im having a hard time understanding why they didnt ask any questions at the hospital where markham died doesnt that strike you as odd that would seem like a logical place to talk to witnesses wouldnt you think whats your point i believe you told them to go there thats the first place you would have looked thats right it turns out that was one of the first places we did go so again i ask you whats your point the point is there wasnt any sign of that in the complete discovery that you were supposedly giving me the deal was that i got what you got remember you did get it glitsky said i didnt get anything on anybody at the hospital and now you tell me your men were there what do you think that looks like glitsky seemed to be mulling this over after a second or two he glanced at hardy maybe the transcripts havent been typed up yet maybe thats it so where are the tapes without transcripts since i also have a bunch of those but hardy had been in the practice of criminal law long enough that hed learned a few tricks used by police to enhance the odds of a successful prosecution maybe he added pointedly maybe you instructed them to forget to run a tape this was a popular and not uncommon technique the exercise of which was almost impossible to prove it occurred to me hardy went on that since youve decided im not playing fair that you might as well do the same thing glitskys mouth went tight his scar stood out hardy knew he was hitting glitsky where it hurt the most but he had to get through to him somehow and as a consequence it took me four days to find out on my own what you already knew hardy said and what is that that there were any number of people with opportunity and maybe even motive to have killed markham but glitsky wasnt budging if you couldnt find it thats your problem my inspectors went and asked they got a complete chronology for the whole day from markhams admittance to suddenly glitsky stopped threw a quick look at hardy then stared into some middle distance his nostrils flared and his lips pursed what hardy asked glitskys expression suddenly changed something he remembered made him draw in a quick breath then visibly clamp down further hardy waited for a beat said im listening he waited some more finally exuding disgust and embarrassment the lieutenant began to shake his head slowly from side to side they forgot to run a tape its bracco and fisk you know their first case they just didnt follow protocol and he stopped again knowing it was hopeless to try and explain further no one least of all hardy would believe him and under these conditions he understood that no one should hardy first reacted as abe expected he must id call that selfserving on the face of it he replied crisply how convenient that only just now at the moment i catch you at it the explanation comes back to you and such a handy one at that the sarcasm fairly dripped theres only one thing hardy took a step toward the door to the courtroom faced his friend and spoke from the heart the thing is i know you abe i know who you are and i trust every part of it if youre telling me thats what happened then thats what happened end of story thats what happened glitsky couldnt look at him all right well then maybe somebody could write me up a report on what they found so im up to speed he pushed at the door but then stopped and turned in midstep oh and congratulations treya called and told frannie then he was out in the hallway leaving glitsky to his demons part three bracco couldnt figure his partner out sometimes he was worthless and uninvolved then hed get some offthewall idea and it would get them someplace all day yesterday theyd been a couple of flatfeet walking and talking walking and talking the hospital the coffee group the judah clinic ten hours and then no glitsky to report to when theyd finally gotten back to homicide hed rushed out someplace on some call evidently in high dudgeon and theyd gotten the message last time they could report next morning here at the hall rather than at his house although they hadnt been able to do that either not today the lieutenant hadnt yet come in by the time they had to leave for their appointment with kathy west and that was sometime a little after now they had all been outside on the patiosundappled no windat this italian place on union for over two hours as far as bracco could tell they were having the kind of lunch society folks must have every day and why werent all of them fat he wondered then of course he realized that harlen was but still two hours for lunch and it wasnt over yet maybe this was how his dad felt hanging with the mayor bracco had to admit that his partner was doing a hell of a job getting to know nancy ross of course he had the entree and help of his aunt kathy who was part of their lunch foursome even so bracco thought that fisk was handling this interrogation very well in spite of the tape recorder that now sat in the middle of the table amidst the halfempty coffee cups and tiramisu plates nancyshe was nancy by nowseemed to be completely at her ease although bracco believed she would be equally composed in any situation she was a thoroughbred seemingly born to be waited upon to command to direct though not as physically magnetic as ann kensing with her eyes and curvature nancy ross wore a kind of timeless elegance but she didnt come across as an ice queen by any means she had a good ready laugh a naughty turn of phrase somehow shed gotten into a running gag with kathy west on the word longmy what longbread sticks they serve here or did you notice the longearlobes our waiter hasand the two of them had gotten nearly giddy a couple of times fisk was very much at home with her in some kind of foreigntailored suit and a bright silk tie with tasseled cordovan loafers and a creamcolored silky shirt fisk had of course taken a good measure of grief in the detail when hed come in but bracco had to admit the guy looked good like he belonged in these threads which were cut so well they took thirty pounds off him fisk had asked him to dress nice for lunch so hed worn his corduroy sportscoat a sports shirt with a collar pressed dockers but he felt underdressed and as a consequence found himself more than a little reluctant to speaknot only because he felt outclassed in a literal way but because until ten minutes ago there hadnt even been the pretense of doing any police work he knew that homicide inspectors didnt punch a clock at the end of the day but the obverse of thatthat he could sometimes take two hours off in the middle of itmade him uncomfortable now it was clear that fisk had had a plan after all the anecdotes and chatter were prologue nancy ross by now wanted to help this nice man this nephew of supervisor kathy west who also happened to be a policeman in any way she could i know she was saying malachi was so nervous this morning can you believe this is the first time hes ever testified before a grand jury hes never even gotten a parking ticket in his whole life or really talked to any real policemen working on something this serious i wish hed met you sooner harlen and you too darrel he wouldnt have thought a thing about it fisk tsked sympathetically im sure he has nothing to worry about the main reason they wanted to talk to him is to get some kind of daytoday sense of the pressures at parnassus it seems to me that your husband would be the best source of that information now with mr markham gone oh he would thats true sometimes i thought he and tim might as well have had the same job and now of course malachi has tims although he never would have wanted it in these conditions this has just been horrible do you know if hes appointed anybody yet to take over his own old spot she shook her regal head no hes looking butwell to be honest the basic problem he tells me is that there arent too many doctors who can make the hard decisions malachis had to learn to live with them over the past few years theyve really taken their toll on him you know in spite of the way that awful reporter made him sound again fisk clucked sympathetically as bracco saw hed intended she took it as encouragement to go on as though jeff elliot whoever he is has any idea of how difficult it is to run a company like parnassus what does he think the officers and directors are supposed to work for minimum wage i mean really he just doesnt know i dont think many people do fisk too thought this was a sad state of affairs i mean nancy went on you wouldnt believe the calls to the office the day of that column i dont know how malachi stood up to it how it didnt completely break him he was so exhausted by then i mean the night tim was killedoh never mind its all right nancy what she sighed just that he was so much trying to do the right thing as he always does staying late to talk to that mr elliot he didnt have to do that you know but he wanted to try to make him understand which mr elliot obviously wasnt there to do at all so all that talking and talking till past midnight when hes exhausted beyond imagining to begin with and what good did it do him still it came out all wrong fisk was in sync with her i couldnt believe elliot mentioned your husbands income in his column even if it is supposedly in the public record he included his partner darrel and i both thought that was pretty low and as though its that much money after all for the work your husband does kathy west chimed in and thats all malachi does too isnt that right nancy its not like hes sitting on twenty boards gouging the system exactly right thats all we live on we dont have trusts and inheritances and outside income except for a few partiesand without them some important charities would sufferwe live very frugally fisk continued to lead her on and half goes to taxes anyway and then half of whats left on the houses and entertaining i hear you i really hear you bracco was trying to do some calculations in his head unlike his partner he did not have any understanding of where million dollars could go every year even if halfsix hundred thousand dollarswent to taxes and then half of thatthree hundred thousand dollars morewent to houses note plural and entertaining that left another three hundred grand after taxes to squeak by on that was three times braccos gross salary including overtime lots of overtime but fisk had briefed him beforehand that the point of this meeting would be to find out if ross and his family considered themselves well off or knocking on povertys door astoundingly to bracco it was beginning to seem the latter you do know harlen i cant tell you how refreshing it is to talk to somebody who understands the numbers i mean a million dollars it sounds like so much doesnt it then more seriously it used to be so much i suppose but not anymore fisk appeared to be having a grand old time laughing at the figure i used to believe that i could retire if i had a million dollars can you imagine that nancy laughed at the absurdity of it if you only planned to live a year or two after your retirement maybe and not that long if you have any household helpim not even talking fulltime help and livein forget it i mean a maid a few times a week or the yard man or kitchen help and dont forget political donations kathy west added halfhumorously and the charities the opera the donations to the girls school which is on top of the twentythousanddollar tuition its actually a little terrifying when i stop to think about it bracco almost couldnt bear listening to any more of the litany in his life he didnt even have one of the last half dozen expenses theyd mentioned but he had no idea how to strike the familiar tone fisk had established especially when it was about money and he had to hope his partner was getting to what he had come for but fisk apparently still sharing nancys plight continued what i find so unbelievable he said is that elliot made it look like your husband was the prince of greed he should have done another article on reallife expenses it seems to me that dr ross would be perfectly justified if he just bolted from parnassusim sure hes in demandand went somewhere that could pay him what hes worth actually he almost did that he was interviewing last year top secret of course even tim didnt know bracco noted that she pausedperhaps she hadnt meant to reveal that but then she sighed prettily i cant tell you how incredibly trying its been really only just getting by if that year after year after year no savings nothing put away for the girls colleges and malachi only staying on at parnassus out of some sense of duty and then having everybody suddenly assume were just fabulously rich its just too great an irony fisk volunteered that maybe he could go and talk to mr elliot at least try to make him see your side no thank you harlen thats very nice but i dont think it would be wise hed only turn it against us somehow although i dont know how that could be it couldnt be is the answer kathy west said she was patting her hand and reaching for the check itll all blow over i wouldnt worry nancy the best thing to do with these kinds of articles is forget them fisk neatly palmed the tape recorder and slipped it into his pocket im sorry we got on this difficult subject he said its a part of the job i dont much enjoy but youve been very helpful and the lunch was fantastic nancy ross also reached for the check harlen and his aunt objected but she overrode them both bracco deeply relieved stammered out his thanks hed caught a glimpse of the figure not including the tip this was half what bracco paid his father every month for rent then everybody was standing up and kissing everyone else on both cheeks nancy ross seemed to have completely recovered from the depressing financial talk for braccos part he shook nancys hand and then kathys told them how pleasant it had been how much hed enjoyed it and in a way he realized it was true it had been an intimate glimpse into another totally separate world that coexisted with his own and in that world malachi ross had money trouble wes farrell got the news about mrs loring from strouts office about five minutes after he arrived at his office after thinking about it for a minute he decided that this wasnt the kind of uplifting information you wanted to immediately share with your client hi chuck its wes farrell here great news theyre digging up your moms body and cutting it up for science no he didnt think so it was however a good break for him a cause for celebration and in the past months thered been few enough of them he made a valiant attempt to conduct other business until lunchtime but once he locked the door and headed back for his house he suddenly knew that it was going to take more will than he possessed to get him back in his office before a new day had dawned he had an artichoke and a can of tuna fish for lunch then took a half hour power nap in his living room now he was outside accompanying his sixtyfivepound boxer bart on a walk around buena vista park he sported a pair of threadbare slacks hightech tennis shoes and a sweatshirt that from a distance read bush and up close contained the tiny lowercase fillin letters ll it farrell liked to think that hanging in his closet he had perhaps the worlds premier collection of bumpersticker wisdom affixed to shirtwear the sun had broken through the cloud cover and the day threatened to grow almost warm it had been warm only two days before and no san francisco native would reasonably expect a reprise so soon and yet it appeared to be happening wonders would never cease and among them was the appearance of his beloved samantha duncan cute fit feisty and now almost forty sam had moved in with wes over five years ago and both considered the arrangement permanent although a formal marriage was not in their planswes had been there done that and had issues with it and sam thought that was fine as soon as hed gotten home hed called her where she worked at the rape crisis counseling center on haight street and asked her if she wanted to take some time off and maybe engage in some consensual adult activitythe kind of humor she hated in everyone else in the world but tolerated in wes but shed been busy and wasnt likely to be able to get away but suddenly now here she was falling in step beside him taking his hand he stopped kissed her held her against him for a minute howd you get away fate one of the volunteers just decided to come in and work bart was pulling at his leash and they both started walking she turned to look up at him so what happened that its suddenly a holiday he told her trying to give her some of the flavor of hardys idea strouts original reluctance this mornings turnaround the immediate and salutary effect it might have on his billings he could for the first time in about five years find himself involved in a highprofile case get his name in the paper attract a broader client base which ive heard you say more than once you dont want to do if i said it it must be true he admitted but thats the problem you get a lot of people to start paying you next thing you know they want you to actually do work for them its a hell of a drain on resources but youre going for this anyway got to youve seen what happens when you try to hold your practice to only five or six solid clients at a time as i have so masterfully done you find yourself turning into some kind of a legal specialist you turn in the same motions five times each except youve changed the names and one or two details so you cut your work by a fifth and multiply your billings times five its just a beautiful license to print money fortunately im man enough to swallow my principles and bill the shit out of all these people while still providing excellent service of course of course she dropped his hand i have no idea why i like you im more fun than everybody else is why but im even more fun than that if ive got spending money hence my fiveclient plan except then what sometimes happens as weve recently seen is one supreme court ruling and the bottom falls out the money dries up you leave me then i probably kill myself its horrible and all because of the supremes and their picky little decisions those darn guys sam said and two women dont forget as im sure you never would anyway so i figure this might be good press and a golden opportunity i can expand the business again then i can pick and choose great clients who can afford to pay huge fortunes for very little work on my part and then you and i can go on in our life of meaningless hedonism you sound like an awful awful person do you know that i keep telling you its the real me the real you who spent all those nights at your office last summer getting the mackeys suit included with the others and then forgot to charge them anything for all that work i know farrell wore a look of chagrin i almost fired myself for that besides my real plan was that theyd win the lottery and be so grateful that theyd split it with me dont look at me like thatit could still happen theyd come around to the grass at the very top of the park sam sat and wes stretched out on the ground and put his head on her lap bart getting on in years rested his muzzle on farrells stomach after a few minutes sam stopped combing wess hair with her fingers i dont understand something she said no he said you pretty much seem to get everything what youre trying to get is lucky isnt it im shocked and dismayed that you could think such a thing he put a finger to his forehead theatrically spoke as if to himself oh no wait i cant be both then back to her im shocked sam that you could think such a thing id never stoop to flattery hoping to coax a carnal favor from you our love is too precious and too real i should have worn boots she replied its a little thick out here wes shrugged all right ill be serious what dont you understand all this talk about clearing beds mrs loring even dismas hardy says one possible motive someone might have had for killing her is to get the bed empty but so who does that help if the beds empty then they can put somebody else in it wes said right thats the part i dont understand youve got a sick person in a bed and then that person dies and the next day youve got another sick person in the bed theyre paying the same thing for the same bed right so why is it to anyones advantage to get rid of person a in favor of person b i just dont see it farrell lifted his head a fraction of an inch bart you want to tell her ow those hairs are precious to me wes put his head back in her lap rubbed a hand over where sam had pulled if youre going to get snippy about it put simply here it is the city contracted with parnassus to provide all its employees with basic hmo health coverage on what they call a capitated basis which is im glad you asked it means that parnassus gets a set amount every month to provide all the physician and hospital services to city employees who are enrolled in the hmo which they can do at no cost to them it comes with the city gig okay weve still got that bed im getting there please so what happens in real life is that parnassus gets a monthly check from the city it becomes part of their general operating income then like any other set payment parnassus starts using it to cover overhead and salaries and so on so if parnassus winds up having to provide an expensive service for somebody in the hmolike chemotherapy or heart surgeryit feels like its not getting paid for it but everybody agreed up front he wagged a finger not the point the point is there are other patients whether they are city employees or not who have chosen a more expensive provider option for these folks parnassus gets real live money for the services it provides but it gets real money every month from the city anyway right im still not seeing the difference okay lets say a city employee enrolled in the hmo spends five days in intensive care the city doesnt send an extra check parnassus gets its hundred and fifty a month and thats all however if a person enrolled in a preferred provider program for example spends the same five days in the icu parnassus gets about five grand a day so it can be argued than an hmo city employee in an icu bed is costing parnassus maybe as much as five grand per day per day every day my dear you dont watch it pretty close itll add right on up so now lets take our own marjorie loring who happens to be a pretty good example of what were talking about she was a city employee insured through the parnassus hmo so if she happens to defy the odds and hangs on for six months shes going to cost portola what at least a hundred grand maybe more now if you were running portola would you rather have marjorie loring in that bed or someone else whos insured with a preferred provider program that paid a full dollar for every dollar billed all other things being equal sam didnt have to think very long all other things being equal she said it sounds to me like dismas hardy might be on to something it was getting on to midafternoon and glitsky couldnt eat another bite of rice cake a littleused and semienclosed staircase ran along the hall of justice on the seventh street side and he took it down to the ground out on the corner he was waiting at the light to cross and go get some peanuts at lous even if they gave him an instant heart attack that felled him at the bar suddenly he found himself facing his two new homicide inspectors coming his way in the crosswalk fisk was dressed like a fashion model and even bracco looked pretty sharp wheres the party he asked you feel like a handful of peanuts coming from their boss this wasnt really a social request the light changed and the three men walked the bar at lous didnt have any empty stools so glitsky stood while he ordered three small bags of cocktail peanuts and a pint of iced tea following his nonalcoholic lead bracco and fisk bought cups of acidic coffee after which they all repaired to a booth and got settled the lieutenant sat on one side and the two inspectors on the other glitsky threw a bag of peanuts at each of them tore at his own so whats got you two boys so duded up since the lunch with nancy ross and kathy west had been harlens idea bracco thought hed let him explain it he was surprised when the lieutenant seemed to approve when the narrative ended glitsky was nodding so we now know what weve always suspected you cant make too much money and nobody thinks they got enough anything else bracco decided he needed to speak up couple of things he said one it might be interesting to compare rosss tax returns the last few years with what theyve spent mrs ross might not have realized it but she basically said they were living on more than they were making so am i glitsky said who isnt he chewed his ice for a moment so theyve extended themselves on credit cards so what and what would that prove anyway hows it relate to markham if ross was taking money from parnassus in some way and markham found out you mean embezzling something like that i dont know bracco admitted glitsky didnt like it anything obvious or proven and he would have fired him on the spot dont you think he drank some more tea frowning my problem with this whole line of thought he said at last is that ive got to go on the assumption that whoever killed markham in the hospital probably wasnt planning to kill him until he showed up there after the accident thats why i like kensing so much he didnt just have a motive he had several longstanding motives where he might see the opportunity and just go at last on the other handjust hear me outif ross was somehow threatened by markham to the degree that he actually planned to kill him doesnt it make more sense to think that he would have done something proactive like actually try to run him over for example rather than just wait for fate to put him in his path what if it didnt happen and ten out of ten times it wouldnt if i may sir harlen said glitskys face relaxed a degree you may theyve worked together a long time ross and markham so there could have been the same buildup of motives that we know about with kensing couldnt there the point we made this afternoon was that ross needed his job but something was making him want to leave parnassus this wasnt too conclusive for glitsky he read the writing on the wall the place was going down he didnt want to go with it okay fisks frustration with glitskys objections was beginning to show but he couldnt get any other jobs his wife told us hed gone looking and couldnt get hired anywhere else why not finally who benefits most immediately from markhams death dr ross who took over the top job and gets another two hundred grand a year salary just for starters glitsky upended his peanut bag threw the last few into his mouth chewed thoughtfully but we dont know that there were in fact any seriousand i mean deadly seriousproblems between him and markham do we downcast the two inspectors looked at each other then back across the table no sir bracco said but it might be fun to keep looking you can look all you want glitsky replied but as far as i know the only person weve got in the room when markham died was kensing and the nurses who had no personal relationship with mr markham at all and that pretty severely limits the field dont you agree has that changed actually it might have bracco said i went back up to the icu station yesterday while harlen was waiting for an interview downstairs he went on to describe his successful entry into intensive care unmolested and apparently unnoticed and when he finished glitsky was frowning what time was this about the same time markham died early afternoon and what about the nurses station one nurse was at it sitting at the computer how long were you in there bracco shrugged a minute give or take i walked around to each bed and nobody else nobody i just walked behind the nurse at the computer opened the door disappeared which means that anybody else could have done the same thing glitskys face had hardened down to granite his cell phone rang and he picked it from his belt and growled out his name then listened intently the scar between his lips stood out in stark relief he said are you sure in less than a minute he closed up the phone and stared out over the heads of his inspectors the town of colma just over san franciscos border with san mateo county has far more dead inhabitants than live ones hardy stood at one of the thousands of gravesites this one was near the end of a row of headstones under a redwood tree with the cemeterys permission he had planted the tree himself twentyeight years before it was april the day hardys son michael had been born hed died seven months later when he fell out of his crib it probably had been the very first time hed stood up certainly neither hardy nor jane his wife back thenthe marriage was another casualty of the tragedyhad ever seen him get up on his feet hed only been crawling a few weeks it seemed a couple of film rolls worth so they left the sides down on his crib not all the way down halfway down theyd childproofed the house but neither one of them had ever given a thought to the sides of the crib michael wasnt old enough for that yet but he must have been able to stand all the way up otherwise he would not have been able to pitch over and land wrong hardy wasnt thinking about that now about that one longago moment that had forever modulated the course of his life who he was what he had become into a minor key he wasnt conscious of any thought at all he was simply standing here by his infant sons nowold grave he had never faced this place before though hed always marked the date and had been to colma many times he had never before been able to find the courage but something had drawn him here today something he either couldnt define or didnt want to examine too closely he felt that too many of the important things in his life were slipping away maybe he hoped that a gradual slipunlike an abrupt fallcould be stopped lives could be saved he had called frannie and told her where he was going he could tell the call worried her should she meet him there shed asked him was he all right he didnt know the real answer to that but he told her he was fine that he loved her hed see her tonight after vincents little league practice when his normal life resumed downtown near his office the day had been threatening to be nice again driving out as far as the shamrock he had his windows down but here except for his lone redwood the eucalyptus and the windswept twisted cypress trees and the thriving endless lawn it was all grayseverything from the sky down through the air itself gray and cold he wore his business suit and even with the coat buttoned it wasnt nearly enough to alleviate the chill in the groves both close and far the wind droned with a vibration he felt more than heard already in places the cloud cover had gone to ground and wisps of the fitful fog drifted and dissipated into the endless gray he had not prayed in thirty years perhaps he wasnt praying now but he went to a knee then both knees and remained in that position for several minutes at last he stood up took a final look at the name still sharply etched into the marble headstonemichael hardy now so unfamiliar so impossible he drew a breath gathering himself when he turned to walk back to his car glitsky was standing on the asphalt path thirty feet away he wore his leather flight jacket his hands were in its pockets he took a step forward at the same moment hardy did when they had closed the gap both stopped i tried your office glitsky said then the cell then frannie he hesitated you okay he motioned vaguely back behind him he would have been twentyeight today i thought i owed him a visit a gust shuddered by them glitsky waited it out thats my greatest fear he said its a good one ive got my three grown boys diz i beat the odds why do i want to do this again hardy took some time before he answered most of the time it doesnt end up like this thats why most of the time they bury us glitsky was looking somewhere over hardys shoulder i couldnt put my finger on why i was so he couldnt get the thought out its what if they dont bury us what if it is like this then you do what you have to do hardy replied you suppose time goes by but youre not part of time anymore and then one day something you eat has flavor again or maybe the sun feels good on your back something you start again he shrugged you did it with flo so you know yeah i do know but the funny thing is im more scared of it now im not good with fear ive noticed that a ghost of a smile flitted around hardys mouth id actually call that a good sign especially compared to how you were before you met treya that long sleepwalk after flo died now it all matters again though doesnt it and aint that a bitch no its good but no but about it abe its all good he motioned back toward the gravesite again the little guy had something he needed to tell me i think that was it coming back at glitsky he realized that theyd been baring their souls to each other and that this was in fact who they were without any need to acknowledge it both of them knew that their fight somehow was over they might still have serious professional issues between them but the essential bond was secure they started walking together to where theyd parked their cars there was something else glitsky said why i was trying to get you in the first place whats that strout called marjorie lorings autopsy done already this was very fast but hardy wasnt really surprised jackman had made it clear that it was a high priority glitsky nodded you were right she didnt die of cancer a wash of relief ran over hardyhed invested more than hed realized in these results so what was it he asked potassium no some muscle relaxers pavulon and something chloride both of them stop natural breathing both would have been administered in the hospital kensing wasnt anywhere near her abe he was on vacation with his kids in disneyland and before you say it i know this doesnt mean he didnt kill markham but it does mean something doesnt it glitsky didnt need to go over it you and i have to talk you said you got more of these people hardy nodded ten more and thats just kensings list i know at least one nurse that has her own suspicions she might have some names to go with them although id agree with you that one homicide doesnt mean there are ten of them i didnt say that yeah i know i read your mind but it does mean theres one of them and it wasnt kensing but it also wasnt potassium which i kind of wish it was glitsky looked questioningly at him why is that because if both loring and markham got killed the same way it would be the same person doing it wouldnt it it might at that glitsky admitted but as far as im concerned this is good enough in terms of me and you theyd gotten to glitskys car he stopped by the front door i think i owe you an apology i agree with you was that it a small chuckle as good as it gets but surprisingly he went a little further all i can say is that you dont work with as many defense attorneys as i do you get a little cynical after a while even with your friends this was the sad truth and hardy believed it he could argue that he dismas hardy abes best friend wasnt just another defense attorney given to pulling unethical tricks out of his hat just to protect his clients but he knew that in the world of criminal law this in itself would be a rare and suspect guarantee hardy had won at least a couple of lesser cases on technicalities that glitsky in his cop mode would probably consider some form of cheating wes farrell had gotten his boy off the other day when the arresting officer hadnt made it to the courtroom for all hardy knew wes had taken the cop out the night before and got him plowed so hed be too hungover to appear beyond that a true eminence at the defense bar such as david freeman wouldnt even blush to do exactly what glitsky had accused hardy of squeeze a witness by bringing her children into play get the coroner to dig up half of colma pretend you needed an emergency tooth extraction on the first day of jury selection if it helped your client if it even delayed proceedings for any substantial period of time it was justifiable even arguably commendable ethically required so where do we go from here hardy asked glitsky had no doubt kensings list if theres an angel of death at portola i want to know about it meanwhile marlenes going ahead with the grand jury i got another unpleasant surprise about five minutes before strout called he told hardy about braccos discovery on the lack of security for the icu at portola so anybody could have gone in is that what youre saying bracco seemed to think so glitsky paused i dont want to have two potential killers he said i really dont the idea offends me me too but threes worse hardy reminded him three whoever drove the car brendan driscoll talked most of the afternoon to the grand jury obviously he thought someone who hated him had testified before he did the prosecutor ms ash seemed poisoned against him from the outset he had been planning to talk about ross and kensing and kensings damned wife and the others who had made life so difficult at parnassus instead she wanted to know all about his personal relationship with tim and this made him very nervous hed worked very hard to keep it all lowkeyof course theyd had their disagreements when you worked so closely with one individual over a long period of time there was bound to be some friction but in general they had been an extremely good team but ash had already heard about the warning memo hed received from tim the personal dressing down hed enduredross must have been the source for that he thoughtand had spent what seemed like a lot of time going over what hed done at the hospital last tuesday finally before he could direct her to anyone else whod had runins with tim shed started asking questions about mr markhams correspondence his own familiarity with it especially the decision to bill the city for outpatient services she was clueless he thought hed rather have her looking at other people than at this business decision which so far as driscoll could tell had nothing to do with anything except the companys cash flow but if it distracted her from his own personal issues with tim especially during this difficult last month he supposed he should be happy he would have preferred to direct her attention to one of his pet enemies and he tried a couple of times the outpatient billing decision was really mr markhams to make and he was dead set against it but dr ross although during the time youre asking about mr markham wasnt able to concentrate on his work the way he liked to because dr eric kensings wife ann was demanding so much of when he couldnt get ash to bite he finally decided he had to leave it but jeff elliot was a different story driscoll had already called the reporter yesterday and made an appointment to talk to him after he was finished with the grand jury when he got outquite a bit more shaken than hed expected to behe walked to the chronicles building where elliot was waiting for him now he had a cup of coffee and had finally gotten comfortable on a chair in the little cubicle he knew who he wanted to vilify and had printed out markhams letters both to kensing and to ross as well as over a hundred memos to file these outlined tims ongoing dissatisfaction with both of them on a variety of points driscoll was making his pitch that these documents supplied a number of very plausible motives for someone to have killed tim elliot flipped through the pages without much enthusiasm this is good stuff brendan except that it looks like weve got a whole different ball game over there now driscoll straightened himself in the chair touching the knot of his tie he cleared his throat what do you mean by that over where portola it appears that a lady who died there a few months ago was also poisoned from what im hearing there may be several more he filled driscoll in on most of what hed learned to that point so needless to say this casts some doubt over whether mr markham was killed for personal reasons he might have been just the latest in a series of these drug deaths at portola in which case the motives anybody might have had to kill him would be pretty irrelevant dont you agree that makes sense i guess driscoll was sitting back in a kind of shock for three days hed been plotting his revenge on kensing for all the trouble hed caused on ross for firing him he thought hed planned perfectly certainly he had a great deal of evidence against both of them if elliot would go public with any of it it might force the board and maybe even the police to act but he hadnt been able to get his accusations aired either in front of the grand jury or now here it wasnt fair so whats going to happen now he asked dont you want any of this of course this is great stuff elliot certainly wasnt faking his enthusiasm i just wanted to be straight with you that i might not get to it real soon but hey cheer up parnassus is going to be news for the rest of the year the reporter patted the stack of paper this will be good bedtime reading brendan had one last question so these other deaths at portola do they mean that the police no longer think eric kensing might have killed tim i think if nothing else its going to give him a reprieve why driscoll shook his head i dont really know i think id just come to believe that he had actually done it certainly he had more reason than anybody else i guess ill just have to adjust vincents little league team the tigers practiced only a few hundred yards from hardys house theyd gotten permission to set up a backstop in an otherwise deserted section of lincoln park golf course up against clement street hardy couldnt commit the time to be the teams manager but he tried to show up as often as he could and help coach hed played ball through high school and his sons love for the game was a source of satisfaction in his own life he got back from colma in time to pitch batting practice there was no fog here twenty blocks inland when the team broke down for infield practice hardy came off the field and stood next to abe who had been watching from behind the backstop mitch the manager laced one down the thirdbase line where vincent snagged it backhand and threw a strike to first abe nodded in appreciation your boys looking pretty good glitsky had called home and told his family to meet him for a barbecue at the hardys so after practice they stopped in at the safeway and bought tritip steaks and some kind of gourmet sausage prepackaged potato and caesar salads sodas and a sixpack of beer vincent pulled a half gallon of cookie dough ice cream out of the freezer glitsky held four flavors of bottled iced tea in two fourpacks hardy stood behind glitsky and his son and watched as they loaded their goods onto the conveyor belt it struck him that louis xivthe sun king himselfprobably didnt have this kind of food selection this kind of weather that in fact he was living in a kind of golden age and hed be a fool to forget it if it sometimes threatened to break his heart it was a good thing he put a hand on glitskys shoulder one on his sons rebecca simms this is dismas hardy again he thought he heard an intake of breath nurse simms had been straightforward enough last time about not wanting to hear from him again not wanting any more involvement he rushed ahead before she could cut him off or hang up i know its a little late but i thought i owed you a phone call have you seen the news on tv no she said i try not to watch too much tv i read instead what news jackman got the word out that he wanted them all in his office before eight oclock the next morning what the da wanted the da got dead silent bracco and fisk stood against the open door wes farrell and hardy sat on either end of the couch drinking coffee while glitsky was in the outer office with his wife at a couple of minutes after the hour jackman arrived accompanied by marlene ash and john strout after greeting everyone cordially the da went behind his desk sat and gave a sign to treya she ushered glitsky inside and closed the door after him jackman wasted no time on preliminaries diz he began i hear youve got ten more names on this magic list of yours youll be giving that to abe i presume yes sir already done copies to dr strout and i spoke to another potential witness last nighta nurse at portolawhos going to talk to the people she works with dr kensing only began his list about six months ago my nurse witness might have more names and that doesnt include what comes out of the woodwork marlene ash put in ive got a feeling that everybody who died at portola is going to seem fishy to somebody jackman nodded in agreement but hed considered this thats why im asking dr strout here to have one of his assistants review what i expect is going to be a flood of requests for exhumations and autopsies at least that way well make sure some doctor might have thought something was wrong about a premature death before we go ahead good luck with that farrell said youre talking about these folks overruling the pm their own hospital conducted youre not going to get a lot of cooperation from doctors who work there and the administrations going to be worse theyll have to if we order it sure farrell said but we cant make doctors and nurses voice suspicions if they dont want to or dont have them jackman wasnt worried about it dont get me wrong i dont want a lot of these requests but were going to get them from families if no one else ash looked around the room wed better be ready all right jackman was ready to move on john why dont you give us a little rundown of your results yesterday although i think weve all gotten the basic message the medical examiner laid it all out for them mrs loring had been killed by an overdose of pavulon and succinylcholine chloride they were two muscle relaxants that especially in the case of someone who is already comatose might mimic a natural death no might about it farrell interrupted nobody thought a thing about it until diz gave me her name and told me id be smart to look i was even planning to sue the hospital over negligent care and didnt have any suspicion shed been murdered strout went on with his explanation these drugs were extremely powerful and always administered in ivs beyond that since mrs loring had been bedridden in the icu there was no real possibility that shed taken pills orally in an effort to end her own life she wouldnt have had access to them the conclusion was that strout was calling this homicide death at the hands of another in other words some degree of murder but no potassium glitsky wanted that nailed down not any no a silence settled in the room and jackman broke it it seems to me that the salient point here is not so much the type of drugs that may have been used in these two deaths and i dont want to speculate ahead of the facts on potential future discoveries we might make but more than the difference in drugs the common feature of these two homicides is that somebody seemed to know or believe that portola rubberstamped their postmortems when they were done at all especially in the more obvious cases i checked into that a bit strout volunteered seems the cutbacks theyve been livin with have left them very short in this area hospital pms as a rule arent very thorough anyway these guys were barely goin through the motions they dont even have a forensics specialist on staff anymore instead they run only basic scans out to their lab if they even take it that far farrell said strout bobbed his head i would agree that it might not always happen so what are the standard scans john hardy asked it can vary strout said but basically were talkin money and levels of complexity youve got your ascan which is set for alcohol and some of your common drugsaspirin cocaine and so on generally you find a cause or possible cause of death at one levelsay youve got toxic levels of cocaethylene which is cocaine and alcohol at the ascanthen you stop looking but if you want to keep goin the bscans set for a slew of other drugs anyway each level of scan gets more expensive so if you got a cause of death at the zeroscan level most folks stop there and thats what you think happened here with mrs loring jackman asked strout nodded genially thats my best guess nobody looked too hard they looked at all somebody woulda seen em once you got a cause of death did you stop too john marlene asked him or did you take it beyond there yes maam i sure did she had her chemo agent and some morphine for the pain i got her records when i called for the body and she was selfmedicatin with morphine in the hospital but nowhere near a fatal dose of anythin else but if she was selfmedicating farrell asked that means she was fairly coherent doesnt it it could strout agreed she knew when she was hurtin and when it got bad enough she hit the button for a dose of morphine which is premeasured am i right john ash asked him and timerelease controlled right no way she overdoses herself if thats what youre sayin so she wasnt in any kind of coma hardy had for some reason imagined she was somehow the fact of her consciousness made her death all the worse youre telling us she was alert and somebody just came in and killed her i dont know bout that diz she mighta been sleepin at the exact time but otherwise in terms of was she in a conscious state id have to say pretty much yeah everyone seemed lost in private thoughts the da simply moved his head up and down up and down finally he stopped mr farrell i want to thank you for coming to this early call i expect well be hearing from you in the near future i appreciate your cooperation it took farrell a moment to realize that jackman was telling him to leave when it clicked in he was gracious about it thanking the da for thinking to invite him then strout for his efforts and hardy again for his strout spoke up as well if you dont need me clarence i got a feelin im lookin at a busy day and id best get on with it after the two men left jackman stood and came around the front of his desk then boosted himself up onto it diz were sharing information with you on markham and youre the man responsible for bringing mrs loring to the attention to all of us were grateful to you but we still expect your client to testify fully before the grand jury especially in light of this list he provided for us which opens its own can of worms he looked around to ash and glitsky to the two inspectors by the back wall if anybody wants mr hardy to step outside im sure hell understand but nobody said a word jackman gave it another few seconds then turned to glitsky all right abe we all know that this throws some kind of a wrench into markham how do you propose we proceed when hardy came in david freeman looked up from the no doubt brilliant brief he was writing longhand on his yellow legal pad ah mr hardy he said with pleasure come in come in he had half of an unlit cigar in his mouth the top button of his shirt was undone his tie so loose it was barely attached hardy thought it might have been the same tie hed been wearing yesterday the same shirt the shutters were still partway drawn although it was by now well into the workday had freeman slept here in the office it wouldnt be the first time but he decided he wouldnt ask all in all hed rather not know you wanted to see me if its about the rent im not paying any more and thats final in fact i already pay too much freeman harrumphed this portola woman is your doing isnt it perhaps which makes you either the unluckiest son of a bitch on the planet or the dumbest id be curious to know your thoughts when you asked strout to dig up this poor womans bones howd you know it was me and in actual fact it wasnt it was wes farrell although i admit i played a role that charade yesterday at lunch which perhaps in all the excitement youve forgotten john strout mentioned both mr farrell and mrs loring by name and i happened to notice them again in the newspaper this morning front page if im not mistaken and jeff elliots byline now that i think of it ive got to call him and have him buy me lunch or something freeman sat back took him in youre not taking this seriously hardy took an upholstered chair and moved it into freemans line of sight then sat in it yes i am and with all due respect to your gray hairs its neither unlucky nor dumb i checked to make sure my client was long gone when mrs loring died he couldnt have killed her no maybe not her but maybe shes got nothing to do with markham technically true but not relevant shes got everything to do with him what pray as i understand it and even mr elliots article made it quite clear your mrs loring died of a different overdose from an entirely different drug than mr markham that in itself points to a different hand res ipsa loquitur nestce pas can it be you dont see this hardy was getting a bad feeling about freemans direction but he had to admire somebody who could string english latin and french together so fluidly and without apparent forethought it was something you didnt hear every day so hardy had half a grin on when he replied sure david i see it i just dont see the problem freeman came forward arms and elbows on his desk he took his cigar from his mouth the problem is that it neither proves nor disproves anything about your client in regard to mr markham and youre pretending that it does when in fact all it does is bring more pressure to bear on mr jackman to bring an indictment on at least somebody at portola and the closest person to hand might in fact turn out to be dr kensing hardy shook his head as it turns out i was just with clarence hes not thinking that way at all he will give him time i dont think so hes going to be looking for the person who killed mrs loring and maybe several other patients at portola hes then going to assume that that person killed markham as well and why will he do that jesus david because it makes sense doesnt it just stretch your credibility a little too much to believe that two separate murderers are prowling the halls at portola hanging his head freeman sighed didnt ojs slow car chase stretch credibility didnt monicas blue dress turning up unwashed stretch credibility or the florida recounttwo hundredsome votes out of sixty million trust me diz people nowadays are used to a boundless elasticity of credibility and what i see is that youre sorely tempted to think youve won already youve gotten kensing off im telling you that thats not the case all youve done here is put the magnifying glass on everybody at portola and that includes him you cant ignore that and from what im hearing thats what you were intending to do hardy glared at the old man so whats your suggestion freeman was glad to give it the heat is way up now diz theyre going to have to put handcuffs on somebody for something soon or theres going to be a peasant revolt theyre entirely likely to do your client for markham then kind of hint hes good for most if not all of the rest but they just cant prove it his eyes glinted under the steel wool brows you may have given kensing a defense at trial but now its a hell of a lot more likely that hes going to have one in fact hardy had concluded that kensings troubles were pretty much over in the euphoria of guessing right on mrs loring then of glitskys conversion he conceded now that he might have gotten carried away with some of the implications of the autopsys results freeman was reminding him that his client was still exposed and vulnerable and now maybe more than ever hardy had better remain vigilant until the whole drama had played out let me ask you this the old man said what if one of the new batch of autopsies shows potassium again you think that helps your client david he wasnt there for mrs loring get it if he didnt kill her he didnt kill any of them not true pure wishful thinking and now youre getting angry as well you should when you see your logic breaking down but dont take it out on me he picked up his cigar and chewed at it thoughtfully listen i dont want to rain on your parade i really dont i admit youve opened a door here and it might lead where you want to go i hope it does i hope its one serial killer who confesses to it all before sundown but think about this who supplied the names of the dead people kensing if he was so suspicious so many times why then didnt he mention some of this sooner why did he wait until he was a suspect in mr markhams death isnt that a little convenient and isnt it possible he could have been in collusion with someone else at portola maybe one of the nurses so he neednt have been physically around for every death youre laughing but none of these are frivolous questions have you considered the possibility that kensing and one or more of the nurses could have been getting bonuses under the table from parnassus for clearing the beds of terminally ill longterm patients without adequate insurance this kind of thing has been known to happen especially in cashstrapped organizations he slowed down for a minute sat back in his chair and drummed the desktop with his fingers im not saying any of this is even remotely likely diz but i am concerned and you should be too hardy shifted uneasily in his chair freeman had been his informal mentor for many years and though he might sometimes be outrageous he was never stupid it was worth hearing him out and he had one more point to make from his intensity maybe it was the most important of them as i understand it diz the ten or so other names on your clients list were all people with a longterm but terminal prognosis isnt that the case a nod thats why kensing started noticing them they died too soon so if that proves to be true does any further conclusion spring to mind particularly regarding markham hardy saw the problem immediately he doesnt fit the profile either he wasnt longterm terminal exactly finally it appeared that freeman was satisfied now if it turns out that each of the other ten died of this muscle relaxant and not potassium then markham had both a different prognosis and died from a different drug than all of them this to me may not be conclusive but it does provoke its own questions wouldnt you agree such as who killed markham and why right where we are now he stood up and to think i was feeling good a mere fifteen minutes ago as though id made progress itll feel that much better when it is real diz you watch im sure it will david im sure it will he turned to go but freeman stopped him again there is one way you might be able to use this to help dr kensing now that i think of it im listening if as you believe youve got clarence and abe excited about the various possibilities raised by your discovery of mrs loring there might be an opportunity to dig a little deeper into things without arousing any suspicion tongues might be looser pearls might fall this was what hardy had experienced to some degree this morning in jackmans office when there had seemed to be a first flush of intuitive belief that maybe kensing hadnt killed anyone but freeman was probably right in saying that it wouldnt last long if hardy wanted to take advantage of it he had to move quickly glitsky wasnt going to send his rookies out alone on this one he knew that his most senior veteran inspector marcel lanier had taken the lieutenants exam in january passed high on the civil service list and now craved a chance to show what he could do administratively he would soon be reassigned out of homicide to his own command and wanted it to be a good one this would be his opportunity so while bracco and fisk got practice writing up search warrants for hospital records glitsky left lanier in charge downtown and drove out to portola there he skirted around the phalanx of television news vans huddled in the parking lot and walked nocommenting himself by the knot of reporters in the hospitals lobby outside the administrators office the secretary started to tell glitsky that mr andreotti wasnt seeing reporters individually hed be holding a press conference in about a half hour at this news the lieutenant produced his badge and wondered if the administrator could spare a few minutes for him right now andreotti came around his desk with a death mask of a smile grabbing abes outstretched hands in a kind of desperate panic gaunt gray and holloweyed dressed in a gray suit with an electric blue tie he seemed composed today of equal parts terror and exhaustion glitsky didnt suppose he could blame him in the week since tim markhams murder the hospitals troubles had increased exponentially culminating in this mornings bombshell not only were portolas postmortems as a matter of course slipshod at best and criminal at worst but at least one and perhaps as many as eleven people had been killed while they lay in their beds in the icu it wasnt yet am harried and distracted andreotti had already been on the telephone with time and newsweek usa today and the new york times hed met with representatives of his nurses union of the parnassus physicians group and of parnassus health itself the mayor wanted to see him at two oclock he got glitsky seated then went around his desk again and sat whatever we can do to facilitate your investigation lieutenant he began just let me know well try to cooperate in every way we can ive told everybody here the same thing weve got nothing to hide im glad to hear that sir my staff will be coming by before too long with whats going to look like a substantial shopping list including search warrants regarding staffing records for the icu including the time mrs loring was hospitalized yes of course also as you may know there is some speculation that other patients may have been killed here as well weve got a list were working from yes kensings isnt it yes sir it is all right you know what youre doing i suppose but the word here wasthat is ive heard that he was on your departments short list for mr markhams murder he phrased it as a question that glitsky didnt feel compelled to answer he waited him out anyway andreotti finally said i guess if it were me id just wonder about any such list supplied by a murder suspect nodding thoughtfully glitsky crossed a leg normally in principle i would agree with you but in this case the first name came up positive mrs loring was killed here andreotti said it all but to himself jesus dont i know it but to backtrack for a minute you said youd heard that dr kensing was our prime suspect for mr markhams murder was that the common feeling about him around here well no i mean andreottis eyes shifted to the door back to glitsky i dont mean to accuse anybody of murder dr kensing was quite popular here with the medical staff the medical staff well the other doctors and nurses hes a very good doctor but a bit of anopinionated man i think many of his colleagues admired his integrity though he could be difficult to work with he was not a team player so he didnt get along with the administration he didnt no nor did he get along with mr markham it wasnt any secret you know no weve heard about that so he killed mr markham is that what you think well he had big problems with the man and he was in the room andreotti spread his hands imploringly i suppose ive thought about it though i hate to admit it youre allowed glitsky answered but im not here today about mr markham i wanted to talk directly to some of the staff and wondered if you could supply me with some records of who might have been on duty especially in the icu about the time when mrs loring died im sure i could find out can you give me a couple of minutes it was more like ten but when glitsky saw the name rajan bhutan he remembered the name from the transcript hed read of braccos and fisks interviews here he asked andreotti if bhutan still worked at the hospital and if so where he could find him rajan was surprised to be summoned again to talk to the police theyd been here so often in the last week talking to everyone when theyd come to him what had there been to say hed been with dr kensing treating mr lector when the screeching had begun on mr markhams monitors after that it was like it always was during code blue except twice as busy he couldnt say who had come into the room who had gone he was taking orders from dr kensing trying to anticipate all of it going by so fast he remembered none of it really although hed been there of course entering the lounge he saw at a glance that this new man was older than the others and harder his skin was as dark as rajans but he had blue very weary eyes a scar began just above his chin continued through his lips cut off under the right nostril something about the sight of the man frightened him and rajan felt himself begin to shake inside his palms suddenly felt wet and he wiped them on his uniform the man watched him walk all the way from the doorway to the table where he sat he didnt blink once rajan stood before him and tried to smile he wiped his hands again and extended the right one how do you do you wanted to see me have a seat i want to ask you a couple of questions about marjorie loring do you remember her marjorie loring he thought yes he remembered her of course he tried to remember something about each of his patients although over the years many had vanished into the mists of his memory but marjorie loring had not been so long ago after all she was still with him he could picture her face she was to have been another of the longsuffering dying as chatterjee had been but fate had delivered her early after freemans lecture hardy wasted no time now he was back at the medical examiners office where to his complete astonishment strout had his feet up on his desk and was watching the closing minutes of some morning talk show on a small television set hardy had seen the tv before but assumed it was inoperable since it must have been used to kill somebody strout indicated he should pull up a chair and enjoy the broadcast the two hostsa man and a womanwere talking to someone hardy didnt recognize about a movie hed never heard of the actor was apparently branching into a new field and had just released a cd he proceeded to sing the eminently forgettable and overproduced hit song from it when the segment was over strout picked up his remote and switched off the television i love that guy he said who that singer no regis regis diz please strout didnt believe that hardy didnt recognize the most ubiquitous face in america you ever watch that millionaire show thats him you notice the ties i been wearin this last year the guy invented a whole line of em my wife tells me i look ten years younger i knew there was something hardy said and you know why else i love him you ever notice how happy he is not really no i cant say i see too much of regis myself strout clucked youre missin out he sighed then picked up a stiletto from his desk pushed the button and clicked the narrow steel blade out into its place now what brings you back here so soon and im hopin its not another request like the last couple the last couple got you one headline and a quick thousand dollars strout was cleaning his fingernails with the knife truth of the matter is i been wrastlin with the idea of givin you back your money since it turns out you was pretty close to right that was work worth doin after loring nobodys gonna call me for doin the first onemr lector i mean well you do what you want john if you want to give me back the money id take it but you won it fair and square while youre deciding maybe we could talk a minute about carla markham strout didnt answer right away instead he closed the knife up clicked it open again closed it clicked it open i was kind of wonderin when youd want to talk about her are you saying theres a reason i should have no im not necessarily sayin anything i ruled on it clear enough comin down on murdersuicide equivocal but something about it makes you uneasy strout nodded a lot about it makes me uneasy you get a copy of my report is that it hardy nodded hed read it for the first time on sunday night then again at the office yesterday it had become a habit for him to read and reread witness testimony and reports where the truth often lay buried beneath mounds of minutiae i noticed the gun was fired from below and behind the right ear going forward thats correct strout closed the stiletto again then stood up and walked over to the floortoceiling bookshelf that lined his lefthand wall he boosted a haunch onto the thin counter pulled an old sixshooter off the first shelf and spun the cylinder ive seen it before how often strout spun the cylinder again maybe twice in your thirtyyear career a nod about that maybe three times hardy took that in so i take it mrs markham was righthanded nope that aint right either except for an unconscious rocking of a leg the coroner finally went still plus you know shed bit the back of her front lower lip i saw that did somebody have a hand over her mouth comin up behind her you mean possible but by no means conclusive just as likely she bit her lip hardy sat a moment he stared without focus in the direction of the venetian blinds behind strouts desk dust motes hung in the striped shafts of sunlight the cylinder spun a few more times eventually he looked up so whyd suicide even get mentioned she had gsrgunshot residueon her right hand and i know i know what youre going to say strout held up his hand doesnt prove she fired the gun the shot that killed her could have put her in the gunshot environment and youre a hundred percent right but theres the gun by her hand strout wound down met hardys eyes i didnt have any forensic reason to rule it out diz so somebody might have done a decent job of making it look like a suicide thats within the realm of the possible diz it surely is but let me ask you a question why do you want her to be murdered i guess because its the only place left except your list you mean hardy shook his head as mr freeman points out theres no definite correlation between anybody on that list and who killed tim markham but if carla was killed im betting it had to be the same person who killed her husband but wasnt your client the last one at her house before strout let that hang hardy sighed the theorys not perfect yet john im working on it armed with their search warrant bracco and fisk approached donna the records clerk at portola she was about thirty years old slightly overweight edgy at first when she found out they were policemen she wore a small ring in her purple lips and another through her right eyebrow it was obvious to fisk that bracco wasnt going to be comfortable talking to her so he took point somehow within minutes they were all friends she was competent at her job and pulled up and printed out all the portola personnel and patient records for the relevant days within about a half hour after another half hour in one of the conference rooms they pretty much had what they thought glitsky wanted as it turned out the icu nurses did rotate on a fairly regular schedule although throughout the hospital there were more of them than the two inspectors had first been led to believe in all on the ten shifts when kensings list implied that patients might have died prematurely nine nurses had spent some time in the intensive care unit only two however had been on duty for every death shiftpatricia daly and rajan bhutan except we dont know for sure yet that any of those ten were homicides do we bracco asked all we know is loring and markham but we do know daly wasnt around for markham dont we fisk replied although bhutan was his partner that shift waswhats her name she was one of the other seven regular icu nurses and bracco had it at his fingertips connie rowe i dont know how you remember a detail like that i recognize the name when i hear it but i cant pull it up for the life of me thats all right harlen thats why they put us together theres stuff youre good at that id never think about like donna for example just now or looking for lorings shift which i had completely blown off fisk warmed by the praise stood up and stretched whats another half hour when were having this much fun they both walked out to recordsby now they were old friends with donnaand told her there was a last shift they had to check bracco the detail man remembered the date november marjorie loring had breathed her last during the swing shift between pm and midnight donnas fingers flew over the keyboard then she looked up at them thats weird she said i think every shift youve looked at theres been this name r bhutan and its here too are you guys looking specifically for somebody no but he just keeps turning up doesnt he the young woman clicked her black fingernails on the countertop what is it about these dates anyway can you tell me fisk leaned over and theatrically looked both ways up and down the length of the room we could he said and added the old chestnut but then wed have to kill you donnas eyes grew into saucers for a second then she giggled and punched the key to print a hard copy of the record fisk took the sheet and glanced at it connie rowe again he noticed not patricia daly with a meaningful glance he showed it to his partner then turned back to the clerk let me ask you something donna if i may is there any record of the doctors who came and went during these same shifts that weve been looking at she thought for a moment well the individual patients would have had their own doctors making rounds is that what you mean not exactly i mean all the doctors who had reason to go into the icu on those days for whatever reason all of them fisk shrugged and smiled at her i dont know im just asking her tongue worked at the ring in her lip they might keep a record at the nurses stationyou could ask although i dont know why they would the doctors come and go all the time you know i think it would kind of depend on a lot of things to jack langtry the crime scene supervisor the situation was bizarre just before lunch marlene ash invited him down to her office to discuss carla markham when he arrived another guy was standing by her leaning over her desk examining the scene photos langtry could smell lawyers a mile away and this guy was one and then ash said by way of explanation mr hardys representing dr kensing lieutenant glitsky and mr jackman have agreed to cooperate with him in exchange for his clients testimony hed like to ask you a few questions langtry didnt know what to make of this but if marlene ash was okay with it then so was he sure mate he said no worries hardys eyes were pinned to the color print of mrs markhams body as it lay when langtry had first seen her on the kitchen floor the gun was in the top of the picture hardy had his finger on it whered the gun come from lowerleft drawer in markhams desk which was in the office next to the kitchen at least thats where the registration was the ammunition and cleaning stuff we got a picture of it somewhere in that stack i think ive seen it twentytwo right langtry lifted his own eyes from the picture looked in hardys face said nothing you got it in evidence right how many rounds did it hold six but there were only five spent casings hardy frowned so five shots fired langtry shruggedhow the hell did he know four dead people one dog one round each what are you getting at diz hardy turned to marlene im thinking somebody else fired the gun the first five times then put it in her hand and fired again and took the last casing with him whered the slug go langtry asked i dont know out the window closed maybe it was open the night before how about the kids hardy asked he flipped a few photos to where they began then he looked up and away for a moment and sucked in a breath langtry felt the same way sickened again at the sight of them what do you want to know just what went down while langtry spent the next few minutes outlining the specifics of the crime hardy flipped through the pile of photographs when langtry was done he had another line of questioning how louds a twentytwo revolver not too nothing like a three five seven just a flat pop you shoot one in a house at night you wake everybody up i dont know maybe not all right heres another one why would markham have a twentytwo i dont know that one mate makes no sense for protection wouldnt stop any determined bugger now would it unless the shot was deadon or pointblank like these here okay he flipped through some more pictures if you dont mind sergeant and marlene id like to see the house they drove out separately langtry met him again at the markhams front door and as he was fiddling with the key suddenly another man was coming across the lawn from next door waving at them in a friendly manner excuse me he said i saw you waiting standing on the stoop here you should know that nobodynobody lives here anymore yes sir thanks langtry had pulled his wallet and badge and now showed it to the man police we know all about it and you are the neighbor from over there frank husic he motioned toward his own home just keeping an eye out we appreciate it thank you langtry said were taking another look you go ahead then sorry to have bothered you no bother now they were inside in the kitchen hardy stood on the mexican tiled floor warm daylight suffused the room through a skylight the noon sun drew a large and bright rectangle in front of the stove there was a doublewide window over the sink a laundry room off the back welllit with natural light a short hallway by the refrigeratorwhere the dog had been killedled to a halfglass back door langtry was sitting behind him on a dining room chair that hed pulled over hardy went down to one knee rising he crossed to the sink undid the latch and lifted the righthand window stepping sideways he did the same to the left one then walked back to where carla had fallen if im down here near the ground and put a bullet through either of those windowshe could have been talking to himselfi dont hit the house next door i hit the sky you want to do me another favor stand here in the kitchen a minute langtry did as requested and hardy went back out through the dining room his footsteps fell audibly on the central staircase then his voice carried as he called down count to ten and then call up to me as loud as you can after another minute hardy was back in the kitchen i heard you but just barely i was in ians room which means what it means nobody wakes up while carla and the dog get shot it means the dogs shot to shut him up which is the only thing that makes sense then why do the kids get shot hes afraid hes woken somebody up either that or the kids knew he was here when they went to bed except the kids are asleep the gunshots didnt carry up but its still too risky so its ian first and he silences the gun with the pillow then the girls hows that sound hardy wasnt going to talk to a witness with a cop there he followed langtry for a few blocks then honked a goodbye and drove back to markhams street where he pulled up parked got back out of his car and knocked on frank husics door the gentleman probably assumed since hed been next door with langtry and his badge that he too was a cop hardy let him think so husic invited him in and offered him iced tea which he accepted they then went out the back door onto a wellconstructed redwood deck hardy didnt know when hed last sat amidst such an explosion of welltended flowers husic had planted them around the deck on the ground in pots on the deck itself and now in late april they were blooming in profusion but hed left an open area in the center of the deck and in that had placed a wroughtiron table shaded by a large canvas umbrella here they sat in comfortable padded chairs from the transcripts hed read hardy knew that husic was a retired dentist sixtytwo years old he had a ruddy complexion and cropped gray hair today he wore faded navy blue slacks loafers with no socks a shirt with a buttondown collar two buttons open at the neck he came across as solicitous friendly intelligent hardy made a mental note that should it come to that husic would make a terrific witness yes i heard the shot he said its only a stones throw away over there i already told this to the police you know hardy did know this but one of the frustrations of his discovery in this matter was the ineptness of some of fisks and braccos interrogations he wondered if theyd ever heard of the relatively simple concept of asking witnesses where theyd been what theyd seen or thought and what theyd been doing at the time of a murder this he thought was not highconcept police work and husics interrogationjust random chat about flowers and investments almost nothing about the day of markhams deathhad been one of the worst he thought so he had a lot to fill in here i realize that he replied in fact ive read a transcript of that interview but ive got a slightly different approach you just now said shot you only heard one i thought i noticed you said three somewhere husic sipped his drink thoughtfully put it down carefully on the table they asked that too and im afraid i dont have a good answer i believe i told the other officers that i was in bed at the time pretty tired after the day over at carlas it was emotionally draining as hell over there let me tell you but if she needed me i wanted to be available lightly slapping his forehead he made a face which doesnt answer what you asked me does it sorry youre a dentist you spend your whole life making conversation with people who cant answer you it affects your patterns of speech and here i go again all right how many shots did i hear distinctly only one hardy looked across the expanse of lawn to what he knew to be the markhams kitchen he realized theyd left the kitchen windows open when theyd gone i thought it was a backfire or something i mean a gunshot is not your first thought in this neighborhood but you may have heard three of them well thats funny you know none of them were really loud in my memory its three but when i go back there and try to hear them its more like i heard one and remembered two im not making sense am i what i mean is the last one definitely was somethingi sat up in bedbut the first two were almost as if i dreamed them you know how that happens sure hardy nodded the siren that turns out to be your alarm clock but this he thought might possibly be the two shots that killed the girlsright there seventy feet awaythen the last round through the open kitchen window which would have been louder but you were in bed when you heard them do you remember what time it was yes exactly it was ten fortytwo on the clock by my bed i remember being very frustrated i dont go to sleep easily since meg passedfour years ago nowand if i wake up thats usually it for the night im up and last tuesday with all the strain i came home from carlas and had a glass of wine but barely dozed then with the gunshot you were awake the rest of the night until three anyway those are long hours eleven to three hardy made a sympathetic noise i know them pretty well myself so when did you finally determine that they were gunshots oh not until the next morning the memory bushwhacked him for a moment god its just so awful you were close to them the markhams he hesitated well carla id say so tim was a bit of a cold fish at least to me moving along to happier memories his face came alive but carla would come over and help with my garden here sometimes wed have coffeesome nice talks i cant believe he hung his head and shook it when he looked back up he smiled but his eyes had a glassy quality hardy let the silence extend another moment finally he asked quietly so you didnt go and explore the source of the noise when you heard it no after a minute i got up and looked out the window of course but everything was still just so still would you mind telling me what you saw exactly well really nothing unusual at all carlas house right there husic seemed puzzled by the question just her house not their house hardy noticed just her but i knew people had been over and if theyd all gone home i wasnt going to bother her not that night let her sleep i thought so it was dark again puzzlement wellno there were lights on in the kitchen and i remember over the front porch and then the upstairs hall light was on he turned and pointed thats that middle one on the top and what did you do then husic blew out heavily im sorry mr hardy but didnt i already give you all this in my first statement maybe not all of it sir could we take five more minutes id really appreciate it another sigh as husic gave in i turned on letterman i thought if i could laugh maybe i could get to sleep but nothing was going to make me laugh that night not even dave i was still worried about carla couldnt get her out of my mind actually what was she going to do now absently he reached for his drink and stirred the ice in it with his finger but i couldnt do anything more that night you know i had to wait and let timeanyway i was still awake so i came out heresee the little greenhouse back thereand worked with my bonsais for an hour maybe two thenby now its two oclock thereaboutsi saw the lights were out so carla had gone to sleep at least i thought that at the time and then suddenly i could too the first letter was dated nearly seven years ago parnassus medical group embarcadero center san francisco california dear dr kensing this letter will document the decisions mutually agreed to by you the parnassus physicians group and the parnassus medical group collectively the group pursuant to the disciplinary committee meeting held last week you have admitted that at various times and in various locations since you commenced employment with the group you have taken unspecified quantities of morphine and vicodin for your personal use additionally you acknowledge that you are an alcoholic whose medical performance while in a diminished mental state due to alcohol consumption has on several occasions fallen below the standard of reasonable medical care the group recognizes your considerable skills as a doctor and communicator and before the recent discoveries memorialized herein considered you a valuable member of its community because of this consideration after substantial discussion and over the dissent of the medical director the groups disciplinary committee decided at this time to issue only this formal letter of reprimand rather than terminate your employment and pursue possible criminal charges against you upon the following conditions you will immediately and forever desist from use of all alcohol and all narcotics except those drugs that may from time to time be prescribed to you by another physician for legitimate medical reasons you will voluntarily submit to random urine sampling to determine the presence of drugs or alcohol in your system you will immediately accept the recommendation of the substance abuse counselor and attend and cooperate with any programs recommended by the group for the next calendar year in addition to the regularly scheduled visits with your appointed counselor you will daily attend a socalled step program approved by the group to address your problems with addiction and chemical dependency after the first year of such counseling but for the remainder of your service time within the group you will attend such step programs as the group deems necessary but in no event shall these be scheduled less frequently than once a week you freely acknowledge your culpability in these above matters and further acknowledge that any breach of the points agreed to above will result in your immediate dismissal from the group without appeal and may result in further criminal and civil proceedings as may be appropriate very truly yours timothy g markham parnassus medical group embarcadero center san francisco california dear dr kensing in view of the fraternal rather than militant approach that ive suggested the group take in helping you deal with your problems over the past couple of yearsand over some highlevel objection i might addid like to personally request that you consider tempering your critical remarks both to your colleagues and to the press about our various internal policies regarding the drug formulary i am not trying to muzzle you or interfere with your right to free speech in any way but i believe youre aware of the financial difficulties were encountering in many areas wed like to keep the group solvent so that we can continue providing the best care we can to the greatest number of our subscribers were not perfect of course but we are trying if you have specific suggestions for improvement or disagreements with group policy i will be happy to discuss them with you at any time sincerely timothy g markham parnassus medical group embarcadero center san francisco california dear dr kensing it has come to my attention that you intend to appear on the public affairs television program bay area beat let me remind you that the several medical committees on which you sit with the physicians group have confidentiality arrangements with the health plan i will interpret any breach of this confidentiality as grounds for dismissal as a personal note you are aware i am sure of the critical negotiations we are conducting with the city at this time i find your public appearances and negative comments about some of the groups policies to be singularly ungrateful and morally unconscionable particularly in light of the groups leniency and compassion toward you in other areas in the past very truly yours malachi ross chief medical director and cfo parnassus medical group embarcadero center san francisco california dear dr kensing if you dont want to prescribe sinustop to your allergy patients of course that is your prerogative and your medical decision but it is a useful drug and i have approved its inclusion on the formulary your continued efforts to undermine the groups profitability by questioning my decisions are inappropriate i have been patient with you long enough on these matters the next event will have disciplinary repercussions malachi ross where did you get these hardy asked jeff elliot he flipped through the pages he held maybe twenty more of them they were at the counter at carrs a nondescript anddue to the new starbucks around the cornerpossibly soon outofbusiness coffee shop on mission by the chronicle building especially this first one jesus a twinkle shone in elliots eyes as you know diz i can never reveal a source but hardy didnt have to think very hard to dredge it up driscoll markhams secretary elliots eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch hardy knew he would rob jeff blind at poker why do you say that hes come up a few times hes fired right and probably saw that coming in advance so he emailed his files home in case he wanted some leverage for later or just simply to screw somebody for the pure joy of it elliot scratched at his beard without either denying or admitting your guess as to my source hes a reporters dream vindictive gossipy craves attention he probably gave me five hundred pages all on kensing no no elliot laughed at hardys panicked response no as far as i can tell on the whole world at parnassus does marlene ash know about them shed be trying to get them if she did although of course i couldnt give her any of it either i did tell him thoughmy source i meanthat if he wanted to keep any kind of exclusive control over its use he might want to download it onto disks and put it someplace special where marlene or glitsky wouldnt think to look for it and yet youve got it here i know elliot grinned sometimes i like my job hardy picked up his spoon and stirred his coffee anybody could have just typed them you know they might not be authentic youre right maybe theyre not but somebody would have to type really fast to get all this since last week hardy accepted this in fact he had no doubt that the letters were genuine theyd never be accepted as proof of anything in courtnot without hard copies and signaturesbut this wasnt the law this was journalism and jeff could decide to accept them if his source was credible enough so what are you going to do with them this was the crux and they both knew it jeff had called hardy as a courtesy because hardy was kensings lawyer in view of the intense interest in nearly everything to do with parnassus since markhams death elliot told him that kensings substance abuse problems constituted real news on the other hand he said the heats kind of gone up under the loring thing if theres a serial killer at portola thats going to trump kensing every time i dont really want to run this dizi like the good doctor and it would ruin his daybut if it turns out to be important i wont have a choice what could make it that important jeff how about if he was high when he was working on markham in the icu hardy had to admit that would do it has anybody said boo about that no but ill tell you something if my source actually read most of these pages and thinks about it enough i predict its going to come up hardy shook his head marveling at the capacity for simple meanness in some people eric kensing was only one doctor out of two or three hundred at parnassus but hed unfortunately crossed driscoll perhaps more importantly he committed the cardinal sin of dissing the boss with whom driscoll identified heavily but a fresh thought surfaced driscoll might have a far better reason to impugn the characters of kensing or anybody else than wanting to punish them for real or imagined past slights he might simply want to keep people from looking at him what are you thinking elliot had been watching him hardy covered nothing really except whether youre going to tell me anything about the other four hundred and ninetyfive pages i havent gotten to them i can only read so fast the kensing letters popped up pretty quick and i thought i owed you as well you did so now if you do me another favor ill owe you right elliot considered nodded maybe what if you hear some more rumors from your unnamed source about kensings sobriety a week ago tuesday dont run the story until you get it confirmed someplace else i dont think the letters are rumors diz i didnt say they were but ive got something that isnt a rumor either maybe we could trade when hardy finally got back to his office at about he was both gratified and depressed by the delivery of more discovery on the markham case from the hall of justice it was nice that glitsky had moved into a more cooperative mode but he could do without another six hours of tedious reading material but he opened the box pulled out its contents and placed them in the center of the blotter on his desk glancing at his phone he saw that he had two messages diz this is eric kensing checking in im at home if you need me hearing kensings voice reminded hardy of how frustrated he was with his client maybe hed come to terms with his drug and alcohol problems long ago but how could he possibly convince himself his lawyer didnt need to know about them the next voice was glitskys of course it being abe there was no preamble of any kind if youre really there pick up a silent threecount pause all right call me hardy thinking what a personality he picked up the phone but didnt call abe he called his client when he finished kensing didnt say anything for several seconds eric im here what was i supposed to do you were supposed to tell me hows that why he asked all thats far behind me that was early career early family pressure and a giant mistake i havent touched he stopped himself abruptly said simply thats not who i am anymore hardy heard the words and believed that they might be technically true but their truth wasnt his issue youre saying youre not an alcoholic whats the first thing you say at your aa meetings hardy knew the answer my names eric and im an alcoholic present tense a permanent condition of being for those in the program look this is water under the bridge now eric but jeff elliots got this information and its the currency he deals in a note of panic sounded in kensings voice hes not going to print this is he how did he find it out anyway everything about it has been confidential but hardy didnt have time to form a reply before kensing said shit driscoll hes upset and taking it out on the world the point is that the hospitals under siege as it is if it now comes out that theyre making secret deals to hide problems with their doctorstheres no question that its news eric driscolls trying to take the whole place down with him isnt he a sigh and the small shall inherit the earth lets hope not anyway i made jeff a deal to keep you out of the limelight a few more days maybe forever but ive told him he cant use what i gave himwhich means youre still on the burneruntil i tell him he can and thats going to depend on you okay whatever it is im in all right hardy realized that hed been gripping the telephone tightly he relaxed his grip forced an even tone you remember the night markham died you went to his house sure i never said i didnt i want you to think about what you did when you left what time was that by the way a little before ten i think that inspector bracco he saw me drive away he might have a record of it he might hardy conceded but he didnt stay around and its conceivable that you might have come back well i didnt why would i do that he hesitated whats this about its about carlas murder i want to know what you did after you left there what ive always said i did i drove home and went to sleep i know youve said that but that doesnt help me i want you to try and remember if you met somebody in your building or talked to anybody in the street or used any of your phones or computer anything that could place you away from markhams house between ten and eleven or even better ten and twelve another pause i used my cell phone to call the clinic and see if i had messages this was good hardy thought there would be a record of the call they would even be able to pinpoint its point of origin within a severalblock radius great when was that right after i left i dont think id gone two blocks wrong answer kensing could have made the call driven around the block and been back in plenty of time think of something else hardy pleaded why whats this about he wanted to scream at him to just answer the questioncould he give himself an alibi instead he answered its about me talking to a witness who heard the shots eric and placed their time at about a quarter to eleven which fixes the time of death yep quarter to eleven shes dead and the lights are on two oclock theyre all off i figure that whoever killed her waited around a while then turned off the lights and snuck away why would anybody wait though i dont know maybe spent the time looking for something maybe covering up maybe thought theyd be seen leaving the place after the shots your guess is as good as mine but now weve got a murder and a time which means youre clear if you can think of anything that no suddenly kensing blurted it out just no okay jesus i didnt kill anybody diz im a doctor i save lives for christs sake i just didnt do this can we leave it hardys exasperation boiled over sure we can eric but nobody else on the planet is going to so you just take your own sweet time and if you remember exactly what you did that night why dont you call me back if it isnt too goddamned much trouble hardy slammed down the phone brendan driscoll couldnt believe the emptiness hed gotten up at his regular time a little bit after and made breakfast for himself and roger after roger had gone to the bank hed spent a couple more hours with the parnassus files but even now they were beginning to lose some of their fascination for him after all jeff elliot wasnt going to use everything at least not just yet worse this new situation over at portola with the lady theyd found murdered was going to seem more important to jeff than any inside information about the business side so hed turned off the computer then fighting a nagging sense of ennui he decided to work out at his gym for a couple of hours when he came home from that he showered and made a really lovely wellpresented mesclun salad with beets and feta cheese for lunch which he ate alone on his sunny back patio area but it didnt cheer him up depressed he called roger at work but he was busy with clients and thought he might even be late getting home which made brendan edgy you just never knew really and now he didnt have a job well he was just feeling insecure and who could blame him he certainly would never have thought tim would have considered letting him go either people changed you had to be on your guard flexible ready for anything the afternoon yawned before him endless he put on some music walked to the back of the house threw in a load of laundry washed his lunch dishes finally deciding that it was the house he was just going stircrazy he got dressed went down to the garage put the top down on his miata and pulled out into the day now hed been driving for two hours hed crossed the golden gate bridge and driven up as far as novato then turned and come back stopping for twenty minutes in corte madera for a cappuccino he spoke to no one and no one seemed to notice him even in his red convertible he was alone alone alone crossing the bridge again the ocean blue and whiteflecked below him he found himself on seacliff drive turning and pulling up in front of tims house a realty company had already put a sign on the lawn the sun was behind him warm on his shoulders when he could no longer bear sitting in his car he got out and approached the house which seemed to shimmer pink in the afternoon light on the stoop he stood and without really thinking about it rang the doorbell listening to the loud chiming finally he turned around and sat on the top step he had no idea how many times hed looked at his watch today but now he checked it again the sun slipped another degree or two he didnt move a mercedes drove by on the street after another segment of time another car passed this one throwing newspapers onto some of the driveways but not the markhams a large crow landed on the walkway down by the sidewalk hopped a few steps toward him and cawed loudly it was already the longest day of his life and still hours before the sun would set he started to cry glitsky bracco and fisk met up at the hospital cafeteria and sat at one of the isolated tables comparing notes i talked a while to mr bhutan glitsky said he had a plain dry bagel in front of him and a cup of hot water he was turning into tea hes an uptight guy and doesnt seem to have many friends here or anywhere else but he struck me as more sad than violent the suffering of patients seems to bother him a lot for someone who works with it all the time are you saying you think he euthanized some of them this was fisk whod reached this conclusion on his own a little earlier maybe its a little early but he might be worth squeezing as time goes by but fisk was attached to his theory he was the only nurse who worked all of kensings list you realize that yep what i dont know though is how many of those people were homicides and were there other homicides not on kensings list where bhutan wasnt on duty some sign passed between the two inspectors then bracco admitted that hed mentioned the same thing a while ago he was drinking from a can of diet coke and interested in finding more true homicides you have any luck with that lieutenant bracco asked you said you had somebody else with suspicions glitsky nodded another nurse named rebecca simms no names of victims yet but shes asking around i should tell you that she also mentioned mr bhutan by name i like him fisk said i got that impression harlen i did too for a while but then i got to talking to him about tuesday night tuesday night when carla markham died glitsky waited for the words to sink in then continued im as fascinated as the next guy with loring and what we may find with the rest of kensings list but ill tell you both frankly im having trouble with the leap of faith that weve got related killings bracco repeatedly flicked the side of his soda can you mean are kensings eleven homicides related to markham at all thats it glitsky replied one thread leads back through these pavulon deaths and another leads off the potassium but do the threads meet his tea was getting dark enough and he tested it bit his bagel chewed thoughtfully then shook his head from side to side i know its possible it might even be what we have here and id love em somehow to be connected but i cant seem to make the jump theyve got to be fisk protested why is that harlen well i meanmarkhams how we got to here right that was my original thought when i first heard about loring but now im wondering so maybe you can tell me why do they have to be connected we got any evidence tying them together we got a similar drug the same mo anything tell me id love to hear glitsky knew he sounded a little harsh he was angry with himself more than anything with the first of his conjectures brought about by the addition of loring in the markham mix but hed use fisk as a surrogate whipping boymaybe the rookie would come up with something glitsky hadnt himself considered after a moments reflection fisk spoke up we do have the same place for the homicides lieutenant the same way the drugs got administered through the iv right thats something yes it is glitsky admitted he sipped more tea but does that in fact really connect loring and markham same basic mo but different poisons i dont know the problem is carla and the kids i cant believe shes not connected to markham i just cant go there bracco had a question okay how about bhutan then you were saying you asked him about tuesday night i did turns out hes got master points in bridge and that night he was at a tournament at a hotel in san jose and spent the night down there which if true and im betting it is eliminates him from carla and therefore markham but not from loring or any of these others fisk finally saw glitskys problem right it has no necessary bearing on those at all in fact if bhutan did loring they almost certainly cant be connected and at this truth they fell silent glitsky ate some more bagel bracco tipped up his soda fisk deciding he needed some refreshment pushed his chair back and headed for the snack counter the two other men watched him go so what do you want us to do now lieutenant glitsky knew what bracco was asking in an administrative sense the homicides from the kensing list werent going to be part of the markham homicide investigation any longertheyd just pretty much established that the two new inspectors had no claim to the assignment of what might turn out to be a very highprofile serial killer case what do you want to do darrel bracco didnt hesitate id still like to get some kind of a line on markham and how do you propose to do that youve been on that case over a week you got a suspect i dont know about i got questions i havent asked if thats what you mean ive got a couple of ideas good lets hear one of em lets take the focus off markham nobody saw anything here but weve still got carla and as you yourself said whoever killed her killed her husband am i right you might have trouble proving a negative with respect though sir we havent even looked you havent wanted us to glitsky knew that bracco was right that hed hamstrung their investigation from the beginning by keeping them away from the true principals including even kensing this had created a vacuum where there should have been basic informationalibis timetables opportunities bracco was going on weve been dicking around for a week now with motives and womens gossip but if somebody killed carla were looking at a very limited universe of suspects how do you figure that braccos eyes were alight with the chase first we forget the nurses here as i think weve just proven a connection between any of them and markham is a fluke none of the nurses from here killed carla and her kids id bet a million dollars on that i would too okay so whos that leave who else was here last tuesday he ticked them off on his fingers kensing driscoll ross waltrip cohn its one of them one of who fisk was back with an icecream sandwich glitsky was nodding in satisfaction darrel was going to be a cop someday what fisk asked again glitsky motioned to bracco darrel will tell you in a minute harlen meanwhile you guys remember hardy glitsky asked kensings lawyer jackmans office this morning the guy with kensings list bracco said exactly as you may have noticed hes got a deal going with jackman weve been sending your transcripts and other discovery over to him at their expressions of disbelief he nodded dont ask but in theory were trading information so you might want to find out what he knows before you start who hes talked to what they said he did used to be a cop and who did fisk asked hardy long time ago harlen he was my partner actually we walked a beat in uniform together he let them digest that enjoying their faces hes not stupid and he might have talked to some people already which would save you time if you even think hes holding back on you arrest him and bring him to me better yet shoot him and hide the body but something wasnt sitting well with bracco so if hardys somehow with us we cross kensing off glitsky allowed a hint of a smile no but it wouldnt be the worst thing in the world if hardy got that impression hardy threw his darts as a form of meditation like sherlock holmes playing his violin hed told freeman once but bracco and fisk didnt know that hed been perusing his new discovery binders for nearly two hours ever since a few minutes after getting back from his meeting with jeff elliot and when the inspectors had arrived he had just stood stretched decided to throw some darts and let the new facts settle both of the inspectors undoubtedly thought he was goofing off at the end of the workday and he saw no need to disabuse them of that notion he threw another dart what do you want first the lieutenant said youd give us whatever youve got bracco replied except that most of what ive got is your stuff it could get a little tedious the last shot of the round hit the double and hardy cracked a quick grin in satisfaction walked up to the board and pulled darts but okay heres something you may not know you remember frank husic the guy next door right he heard the shots at quarter to eleven he looked next door and the lights were on they were still on an hour later then two hours after that somebody had turned them off and heres a clueit wasnt carla i was there at a little before ten bracco sat forward stiffbacked on the couch elbows on knees hands clasped in front of him does lieutenant glitsky know this i was planning to call him later so he probably doesnt he shot a look at bracco what time did you leave there bracco answered without inflection a few minutes after your client say ten straight up and he was the last visitor the last car in the street out front yeah plus he told me he was the last one there except the family and they were turning in after he lefthardy threw a dartdid you go up to the house fisk idly turning the pages of one of hardys magazines suddenly stopped and looked up at the question no bracco replied your guy kind of convinced me that theyd had enough for the day what did he do after he left he drove home and went to bed and inspectorhardy threw againhe didnt come back can he prove that can you prove he did fisk cleared his throat closed his magazine and dropped it onto the end table mr hardy darrel what do you say we keep kensing out of the mix until he puts himself back in hows that sound hardy had gone back to his board and was pulling darts now he walked back to his desk put them down on it and pulled a chair around thats a good idea inspector dr kensings not going to put himself back in he met both of their eyes i apologize if im touchy about my client bracco hadnt moved an inch but his shoulders settled almost imperceptibly when he spoke the tone was conciliatory too weve narrowed it down to the five people whod been around the icu that morning excluding the two nurses does that fly with you hardy was somewhat disturbed but not surprised to see freemans predictions of the morning come true so quickly if the nurses were out of consideration for markham then marjorie lorings death wasnt any part of kensing anymore if indeed it ever had been but betraying little he only nodded if the nurses have alibis for tuesday night both of them do bracco said rajan bhutan was playing bridge in san jose although lieutenant glitsky says some of the staff think he looks good for loring for what its worth harlen and i dont think he looks too bad either hardy interrupted and he was one of markhams nurses yeah but with this alibi for carla and the other one connie rowe was home with her familyhusband two kids she didnt go out okay so the scenario at markhams house is that someone came between ten and ten fortyfive and carla opened the door to whoever it was then the kids start going to bed while carla and x talk a while at some point x excuses himself and goes into markhams office where he keeps his gun whod know that hardy asked abruptly not just that he had one but where he kept it thats a point fisk said but if x was an acquaintance of carlas which it looks like he was he might have known hardy thought that this was reasonable enough okay lets go back to whos left he said besides my client of course bracco had them on the tip of his tongue driscoll ross waltrip cohn hardy had come across the name cohn only about an hour before in his readingthe report bracco and fisk had written up on what theyd discovered last friday night but had forgotten to tape at that time it had leapt off the page at him and brought his heart to his throat hearing the name again now he showed nothing even let himself chuckle you realize i havent talked to even one of those people who are waltrip and cohn as far as hardy knew from the transcripts and reports hed read the inspectors hadnt spoken to any of these people either although they didnt volunteer that instead bracco was lowkey just some doctors whod also been in the icu that daykent waltrip and judith cohn but no sign theyd been to carlas no fisk replied we assume they both knew markham but other than that we dont have much on them their names is all bracco added i dont think either of them played any role here but we kept them in just to be thorough hardy nodded so its driscoll or ross it was braccos turn to break a small smile under the local rules meaning not including kensing hardy allowed a friendly nod so how are their alibis driscoll and ross obviously embarrassed the inspectors exchanged a glance we havent had a chance to talk to them either maybe you want to do that he said gently meanwhile just to be thorough ill try to get in touch with waltrip and cohn the second and third names on kensings list had been cremated rather severely limiting the options for further forensic analysis the fourth name was shirley watrous she had died on the day after last christmas shed been admitted to the hospital a week before that for acute phlebitis then suffered a stroke in her bed that left her paralyzed and unable to communicate moved to the icu for observation and further testing on the fifth day she passed away without ever regaining consciousness the hospital pm listed the cause of death as cerebral hemorrhage this time around strout knew exactly what he was looking forthe pavulon cocktailand he found it mrs watrous too had been murdered glitsky ash and jackman were crammed into marlenes office having a powwow her office mate had checked out at close of business and jackman sat at his desk glitsky had pulled a chair around and was facing them straddling it backward of course glitsky was saying hes got no idea what he was doing on november twelfthhe was talking about rajan bhutanbut the day after christmas he might remember is he a christian marlene asked maybe he doesnt celebrate christmas either way its a holiday jackman turned to glitsky abe hes clean on carla markham hes got maybe twenty people wholl swear where he was when carla got shot for me that clears him on both her and markham jackman pushed some paper clips around the blotter in front of him when he spoke it might have been to himself it beggars belief that kensing could be the source of this problem at portola when theres no relation to markham marlene added her own thoughts i think its high time we get him in front of the grand jury find out what he knows once and for all have you ruled him out on carla abe glitsky almost laughed not close far as im concerned hes still the inside track matter of fact im dropping by his place on my way home glitsky produced a terrifying smile and then a piece of paper from his jacket pocket with a search warrant this time marlene got out of her chair if you can give me five minutes i can have a subpoena for you to deliver too you mind whoa whoa whoa jackman interjected youre both forgetting something i promised hardy wed give kensing thirty days grace this dampened the rooms enthusiasm level for a nanosecond but only that marlene had the answer almost before the objection was out that was on markhams murder clarence when kensing was our suspect rather specifically theres no way hardy could object to the grand jury needing to hear about the list kensing himself provided and as soon as possible glitsky turned to the da and added formally to keep our mutual and cooperative investigations on track jackman considered for a long beat then finally nodded okay do it dr kent waltrip told hardy hed made his morning rounds at the icuhe had a patient coming out of a bout with spinal meningitisand hed finished up at about after which hed gone to the clinic to see his regular patients hed worked there all day judith cohns office number too was listed and hardy was surprised and happy when he got his second human being in a row to answer the phone at a little past he identified himself to the receptionist explained his relationship to eric kensing then asked if dr cohn would please call him when she got the message i could page her right now the cooperative voice replied if you give me your number ill just punch it in two minutes later hardy was standing by his open window looking down on sutter street when his direct line rang he crossed to the desk in three steps picked up the phone and said his name on the other end of the line he heard a sharp intake of breath erics lawyer right is he all right hes fine thanks for getting right back to me i wondered if i could ask you a few questions sure if theyll help eric im here great hardy had considered his approachhe didnt want to scare her offand written a few notes now sitting down he pulled his pad around im trying to establish erics movements on almost a minutebyminute basis on the day tim markham was killed the police dont still believe he had anything to do with that do they i think its safe to assume that they do yes he heard her sigh deeply dont they know the man at all have they ever talked to him couple of times at least christ then theyre idiots they may be hardy said but theyre our idiots and we have to play with them i understand you had your own patient or patients in the icu on that day as well tuesday a week ago oh i remember the day well enough it started bad and kept getting worse you know how it works with scheduling the icu and er dont you early on kensing had explained the parnassus idea to maximize efficiency the doctors at the judah clinic who were part of the parnassus physicians group as well as usually on the staff at portola were responsible for making sure that at least one physician was assigned to the icu and at least one to the er as well at all times this duty was on a rotating schedule and its essential purpose according to eric was to eliminate at least one fulltime doctors salary from the payroll its other effect was to leave the clinic perennially shorthanded it was not a popular policy basically hardy replied theres a staff physician covering each room right in the icu only a few of the beds if any contain that physicians personal patients except if they get somebody straight out of er or the or or a critical baby something like that anyway so that morning i had er downstairs late to work as it was when the markham madness just broke it open wait a minute you were with markham in the or you did the surgery on him so hardy realized she had not just floated by the icu to check a patientshed been there at portola all morning yeah he was a mess i was amazed he survived to get in much less out anyway i walked in frazzled at being late to begin withim never late what had happened hardy asked quickly with you being late it was so stupid i just overslept me miss insomnia i think i must have turned off the alarm when it went off and never really woke up i guess the only good news is i was wellrested for markhams arrival i needed to be believe me although phildr beltramo hed just worked ten to sixhe didnt appreciate it much so when did you make it up to the icu finally i came up with markhams gurney when we got him admitted and settled in there eric and i then i bopped up i dont know for sure must have been four or five times before he died maybe every fortyfive minutes whenever i got a break id pulled him out after all he was my patient she grew silent for a moment i didnt expect him to die i really didnt he didnt just die doctor somebody killed him hardy was trying to assimilate this unexpected information which he had to admit cohn was volunteering easily enough he wasnt picking up any phony sympathy for markham any reticence to describe her own actions and the police continue to think it might have been eric were you in the icu when markham went code blue no i was down in the er although i heard it of course and came right back up but you didnt notice eric in say the ten or fifteen minutes before no the last time i saw him he was in the hallway with rajan bhutan hes a nurse there they were with a patient on a gurney this comported perfectly with everything hed heard so far about the minutes just before mr lectors monitors started to scream and as before it didnt do his client any good except insofar as it might implicate cohn herself let me ask you this doctor did eric tell you anything about his visit to mrs markhams later that night not really she said i was asleep when he finally got in and then we didnt get any time together for a few days after that what would there be to say though it must have been depressing as hell but hardy had cued on something else what did you mean when he finally got in back from mrs markhams you meant right right so you were at erics place that night a small laugh you didnt know that whoops blown our cover i guess then more seriously i thought he could use some company after the day hed had i know i could reeling from this latest revelation hardy struggled to control his voice so what happened did you go home from work together another laugh no no weve given up trying to plan anything were both on call half the time our hours get too weird i just went over there and let myself in ive got a key aha hardy said jostling her along but eric stayed late at portola then went to mrs markhams by the time he got home id finally gotten to sleep the insomnia kick back in jesus with a vengeance probably because id slept in that morning ive said a million times if i could change one thing in my life other than my frizzy hair its insomnia hemingway says he wouldnt trust anybody whos never had it yeah well look what happened to him insomnia just plain sucks theres no upside and i ought to know can you imagine what it would be like to want to go to sleep close your eyes and presto youre gone i would call that heaven id sell whats left of my soul for half of that but that wasnt tuesday night jesus she suddenly sounded tired just thinking about it it must have been one oclock and i started tryingim talking in bed with the lights outaround ten and eric wasnt home by then no he was still at mrs markhams evidently it went on pretty late glitsky held the warrant up in front of him were talking now he said marcel lanier was with him and brushed past in a show of force getting himself inside the apartment where do i start sir he asked back to front but maybe first the bedroom ill be with you in a minute or two what are you looking for kensing had gotten back from a run recently he still wore his running shoes shorts and a tank top hed been at his kitchen table drinking orange juice and ice when the doorbell had rung now he turned at the sound of lanier rummaging somewhere back in his room you cant just come in here and tear things apart glitsky turned the warrant around pretended to read it came back to kensing judge chomorro says i can oh and before i forget he handed him ashs subpoena as well whats this an invitation to talk to the grand jury tomorrow nine thirty you cant do this kensing repeated this isnt right mr hardy had a deal with the da im going to call him go ahead glitsky stepped over the threshold hes not allowed in here without our permission when were conducting a search he might take something but you can call him if you want then you can both wait until were done take it easy doctor i told you last time you should have let me in when we could have talked in a more comfortable atmosphere youve really left me no choice what are you looking for glitsky read from the warrant medical paraphernalia specifically syringes and prescription drugs im a doctor lieutenant you want ill go get all that for you he turned and wiped sweat from his brow again i dont believe this this is america right we do this here youd better thank god this is america doctor and that this is how we do it anywhere else it wouldnt be so pleasant glitsky was reading from the warrant again clothes with splatter or stains consistent with blood youre going to find that too i work with blood every day it comes from inside people glitsky raised his eyes in a baleful expression i want to call hardy absolutely id never try to stop you but hes not coming inside here another thumping noise emanated from the bedroom glitsky raised his voice marcel easy by the book please nice and neat the doctor hung his head for a minute then looked back up this is bullshit he said bracco struck out trying to reach either malachi ross or brendan driscoll he was in the middle of leaving a message with the latters answering machine when another call came in on their line and his partner picked it up fisk homicide sergeant fisk this is jamie rath again from carla markhams coffee group im calling because ive been worrying all day my daughter said something last night and it got me to thinking that maybe it was something youd want to ask her about what was it well you know she plays soccer shes at practice right now in fact but she also runs crosscountry so she gets up early every morning and runs down to the greenbelt on park presidio and then up to the park and back the same way okay well we were talking about tims accident me just being a bitchy mom trying to remind her how dangerous the streets could be even when you were paying attention and she said she didnt need me to remind her on the same day that tim had gotten hit almost the same thing had happened to her only a couple of blocks away fisk was snapping his fingers at his partner indicating he ought to pick up the other line mrs rath was continuing it had scared her silly shed just turned off lake onto twentyfifth coming back home and was crossing the street she saw this car coming but there was a stop sign and she was in the walkway then suddenly she heard the tires screech and she looked over and jumped backward and the skid stopped just in time lexi was standing there with her hands on the hood just completely flipped out she said she yelled something at the driver to watch where she was going then slapped at the hood and went back to running but i didnt have to tell her how dangerous it was she knew did she say anything else about the car what color it was for example oh yeah it was green which i guess is what made me think about tim didnt i read that the car that hit him was green bracco butted in what time does your daughter get home from soccer practice mrs rath lexi sat between her mom and dad doug on the couch in their living room shed been home long enough to have showered and changed into jeans tennis shoes and a light sweater she was a tall and thin fourteenyearold with braces and reasonably controlled acne her long brown hair was still wet she was holding both of her parents hands nervous at being the center of attention at talking to these policemen who were sitting on upholstered chairs facing her it wasnt really that big a deal i meanher eyes begged for her mothers understandingi had this kind of thing happen before while ive been running maybe not this close but almost people just space out when they drive but i know that so i pay attention when im out there im sure you do fisk responded and paying attention the way you do did you notice anything unusual about the car that almost hit you lexi threw her eyes up to the ceiling in concentration looked from jamie to doug back to the inspectors i really only saw it out of the corner of my eye you know there was a stop sign i saw it coming up the street and thought it would stop so i didnt break my stride i guess she didnt see me until i was right in front of her so it was a woman the driver oh yeah i mean yes sir definitely was there anybody else in the car no just her did you get a good look at her she nodded yes but only for a second bracco had been letting fisk take the interview hed crowed all the way out here about the car the car the car jamie rath had called him at the detail or at least hed answered the phone he knew all along that the car would be part of it bracco didnt mindfisk tended to be good when gentleness was called for but bracco thought that sometimes he didnt hit all the notes but you did get a good look at her for that second is that true do you think you could recognize her again i dont know about that maybe i dont know doug patted her reassuringly on the leg its okay hon youre doing good you are doing good lexi fisk seconded what were asking is maybe we could send an artist out here to try to draw her face as you remember it would that be all right with you she shrugged i could try i guess bracco asked her about the time wanting to narrow it down i know just what time it was because when i stopped when she almost hit me and then i started running again i checked my watch to see how much time id lost it was twentyfive after six this perfectly fit the timetable for markhams accident so let me ask you this lexi would you close your eyes for a minute and just try to visualize everything you can think of about the car or its driveri know it was only a secondjust tell us what you see obediently she leaned back into the couch scrunched between her mom and her dad closing her eyes she took a deep breath okay i was on lake just running like and then i usually turn up twentyfifth and cross over so i got to the corner and there was this car maybe i dont know a ways down the street but coming to the stop sign so i thought it would stop was the car speeding do you think bracco asked i dont know probably not maybe or i might have noticed it more okay but then i was off the curb like one step and i heard the brakes go on or the skid you know that sound whatever its called so i turned and she was going to hit me so i jumped backwards and was facing her luckily she stopped just as i was reaching out you know in case she hit me all right fisk said gently so youre leaning on the hood of the car is it damaged at all crashed in a little the light yeah i guess it would be the front my left i remember because i didnt want to cut myself on the broken headlight front right then on the car okay i guess so she opened her eyes and seemed to be silently asking her parents if she was doing all right a couple of nods assured her and she closed her eyes again but shook her head uncertainly i was kind of shaking then it was pretty scary but then i just got really mad and slammed my hands down on the hood again really hard i screamed at her do you remember what you said you almost killed me you almost killed me you idiot i said it twice i think i was really mad and screamed at her then what then she held up her hands like it wasnt her fault like she was sorry lexi bracco said with urgency what did she look like it was almost comical the way lexi screwed up her face but there was no humor at all in the room maybe a little younger than mom i think i cant tell too good about adults ages but dark hair kind of frizzy any particular hairstyle no just around her face frizzy what race was she not black not asian but other than that i couldnt say how about what she wore anything stick out no it was only a second she was showing the first signs of defensiveness we just stared at each other okay thats good lexi fisk said thank you so much but bracco wasnt quite done just a couple more things about the car okay would you call it an old car or a new one how would you describe it if you can remember again she closed her eyes not a sports car but not real big you know kind of like a regular car maybe but not a new one now that i think about it the paint wasnt new it just looked older i guess not shiny suddenly she frowned the back lights were kind of funny the back lights bracco asked how were they funny how did you see them i turned right after i started running again they kind of went out from the middle almost like they were supposed to make you think of wings you know fins fisk asked like on uncle dons tbird mrs rath volunteered you know how they go up in the back theyre called fins but she was shaking her head no not just like that lower kind of along the back where youd lift up the trunk oh and a bumper sticker you are doing so good lexi fisk enthused this is great what about the bumper sticker she closed her eyes again squeezing them tight but after a minute she opened them and shook her head i dont know what it said i dont remember maybe it wasnt in english at the days last light the two inspectors made one last stop at the stop sign at lake and twentyfifth they had already decided to send a composite artist specialist out to the raths to work with lexi fisk had a book at home with front and back views of every car made in america for the past fifty years and he was planning on bringing that by as well to see if lexi could give them a positive identification on the make and model they got out and walked from the stop sign back to the first streetlight there was no sign of a skid mark from which fisk hoped to get something perhaps a tire size and then bracco remembered the storm he said we can forget it kensing reached hardy on his cell it sounded as though he was in a restaurant somewhere jackman had already talked to him hed phrased the subpoena as a request they wanted to proceed with dispatch on investigating kensings list and without his testimony the grand jury would be left in the dark hardy thought cooperation here wouldnt hurt them and hed okayed the new deal but he wasnt nearly as sanguine when kensing told him about the search warrant glitsky was there tonight looking for what i dont think anything really i think it was just to scare me although they did take some of my clothes why did they do that they said they were looking for blood they probably found some christ on a crutch hardy had meant to turn off his cell phone when he and frannie had left the house on their weekly date it was one of their rules but hed forgotten and then of course it had rung and hed answered it telling her hed just be a sec that had been nearly five minutes ago once he had kensing on the line he wanted to grill him at length about the discrepancy between judith cohns account of tuesday night when he hadnt gotten home by at least one oclock and his own which would have put him there by about but they wound up talking about the search and then about tomorrows grand jury appearance then their waiter came up and gave him the sign and hardy realized he really ought to hang up they frowned upon cell phones here hardy did too just not at this precise moment he squeezed in one more sentence but we really need to talk before you get to the grand jury if either glitsky or his inspectors talked to cohn as hardy had done theyd get the message to marlene ash and kensings appearance tomorrow in front of the grand jury wouldnt be pretty with his multiple motives and glitskys animus the squishy alibi might just be enough to get him indicted at least he ought to know his girlfriends story or hed get bushwhacked so they were meeting tomorrow at kensings at now frannie raised her glass of chardonnay clinked it with his that sounded like a pleasant conversation she said hardy ostentatiously turned off his cell phone put it in his jacket pocket honest mistake i swear he said which is better than the one kensing made when he talked to abe or when he lied about when he got home last tuesday frannie stopped midsip i dont like to hear about clients who lie to you its not my favorite either in fact as a general rule id put lying in my top ten for what im not looking for in a client and abe just now searched his house hardy dipped some sourdough bread into a shallow dish of olive oil pinched sea salt over it all i got that impression last night abe seemed to think it might not be kensing after all right but last night we were all hot over mrs loring and we knew for a fact that eric wasnt around when she was killed so it looked like he was completely in the clear but today unfortunately it turns out that these other deaths at portola might have nothing to do with markham or his wife basically it looks like nobody in the universe that could have killed mrs loring even knew carla markham much less went to her house in which case theyre unrelated in which case your client gets back on abes list if he ever really left but you know abe he likes to start with a big list then whittle it down youre saying hes got a lot of other suspects sure its still early how many two maybe three others frannie whistled softly big list anybody else abe likes as well as kensing hardy held his menu and looked down at it then up at her grinning but enough about the law im going with the sand dabs tonight there is no fish more succulent than a fresh pacific ocean sand dab and they do them great here lemon butter capers out of this world you really ought to try them kensing was in a business suit sitting at his kitchen table he had poured some coffee for both of them but the cups sat cool and untouched hardy sat between the table and the sink he had pushed himself back a little so he could cross his legs and now his ankle rested on its opposite knee so you told glitsky this last night too yeah of course why wouldnt i its the truth jesus christ diz why do we keep going back over this theres nothing to talk about hardy drew a breath collected himself let the breath out it was possible he supposed though doubtful that judith had remembered the wrong night as a matter of fact there is eric the reason i cant get over it is that you never told me that dr cohn was here that night sleeping over this is hard for me to fathom since she could have corroborated your alibi his voice grew harsh and then we could just leave it or is it time to find yourself another lawyer kensings eyes did a quick dance came to rest she was asleep when i got home he paused scratched his fingernail across the table as it turns out i didnt wake her up so she wouldnt have known i was there i wanted to keep her out of it hardy waited to see if kensing would ask the obvious question but when it didnt come he supplied it arent you interested in how i found out shed been here no answer i talked to her and i asked her how about that last night and she was asleep when you got home youre right although it wasnt ten thirty was it it was after one in the morning are you going to tell me shes lying kensing ran a bluff for about five seconds then all the air left him in a rush his shoulders sagged his head hung down he stood up and walked over to the sink out of sight behind hardy who didnt turn to keep an eye on him and suddenly felt the hair on his neck stand up a selection of kitchen knives hung off a magnet strip on the wall back there kensing could pull one off and slash with it before hardy could move a muscle he whirled his client wasnt even facing him and hardy felt a moment of something like shame kensing was leaning with his hands on both sides of the sink staring out the window he finally spoke in a hoarse whisper ive been clean and sober for seven years diz seven years a day at a time you know how long that is he chuckled bitterly the answer is you dont nobody does so last tuesday the man who ruined my marriage and took my kids from me shows up in my unit and three hours later hes dead just dead an act of god as far as i know finally some justice finally something fair but then between carla and driscoll theres bedlam in the hospital then ann comes to see me and shes raving talking about me killing him and for a minute i actually wonder if i didnt do all i could to keep him alive he stopped ran water into a glass drank it off and wiped his mouth with his hand anyway somehow i made it through the rest of that day going over to carlas trying to find a place for thisthis thing that had happened then that cop bracco outside at carlas and more talk as though somebody had done this to tim but then i was gone free from it driving home at last i even got all the way here parked just up the street a ways i saw the light on and knew judith was here a deep sigh then i walked down to harrys and had a drink a double actually scotch and soda just sitting there savoring it the most delicious thing id tasted in forever then another one drinking to the good mr markhams health the beauty of it god it was so beautiful he came back to the table and sat then another one this one for all the lost nights and my babies and annie and all the shit id taken from her and a couple more for parnassus and what my life had turned into a sham of healing people with minimum care pretending that i was some paragon of virtue and knowledge one more because the whole things a lie and im a fraud then the rest because im a drunk and a loser and thats all i am so finally when i try to order one more the bartender god bless him cuts me off its closing time hell even give me a lift home if i need it you think hed remember you hardy asked without a doubt but if this gets out i lose my job and i wont get another one soon hardy considered it for a while you realize this is your alibi for a murder eric kensing was adamant it cant come out a flat gaze of frustration then you better hope glitsky hasnt talked to judith if he has ill tell him she made a mistake it wasnt that night the rest of the conversation was simpler it took place in the lobby of the hall of justice both men had had some time to cool off on their respective rides downtown although hardy had come to the unsettling realization that now judith cohn had no alibi for the time of carlas death but he wasnt going to bring that up to his client not this morning he had other more pressing concerns he started the conversation by reminding kensing that there was no physical evidence tying him either to markhams death or carlas trials were about evidence if the prosecutor found herself getting too carried away with motives and possible motives hardy told kensing that he should politely answer the questions he didnt have to be confrontational dont argue keep it on point and the point eric is to take yourself off the list of viable suspects the lecture continued hardy once again admonished his client to tell the truth about even the most seemingly damning of situationsbetween him and markham markham and ann him and parnassus tell the whole truth especially about his trip to the bar on the night of carlas death eric could believe it or not but the truth was the best friend of the innocent and further protecting the secrets of witnesses was precisely what the grand jury was all about youre telling me they dont leak hardy hated to admit it but he did no everything leaks eric from time to time but the grand jury really doesnt leak often if youre lowkey and explain the situation dont call undue attention to it it will flow right by after which youre not a suspect anymore he really needed to drive this home why should the grand jury care if you stopped by for a few drinks at a bar after a stressful day okay youre an alcoholic and not supposed to drinkbut murder not alcoholism is the crime hardy needed to make him understand this crucial point they were standing off alone by the wall engraved with the names of slain policemen it was already after and kensing had to be upstairs by the volume in the cavernous lobby was picking up with the increased trafficcops and lawyers and a steady stream of the public which sometimes did seem vast and unwashed especially here hardy moved a step closer to his client into his space backing him against the wall locking him in his gaze listen to me eric youre an intelligent man but right now you are letting fear and lack of focus hurt you i dont blame you for being worried its a scary time but dont let it blind you to the way youre going to strike those nineteen grand jurors youre a doctor an upstanding citizen a voluntarily cooperative witness in a murder you cant be a suspect because you simply were not at carlas when she was shot you were somewhere elsewhere that was specifically isnt going to matter once the jurors hear that the psychological advantage is all yours where you were when you werent killing carla markham wont even be newsworthy enough to leak no more than what color tie youre wearing theres really only one person that gives a shit if you went to that bar and had a drink and thats you so dont let the prosecutor in theremarlene ashdont let her paint you as a killer thats not who you are in truth and in fact hardy actually poked his finger in kensings chest get it inside you believe it act like it but his client still wasnt quite with him and youre willing to risk my career over it hardy considered and answered in a level tone if you go up there with something to hide its going to be all over you like a stink and the jurors will smell it and when inevitably it comes out youve committed perjury which is a felony go up there an innocent man thats how youll walk out if they catch you in a lie and glitsky will if you give him time youre probably indicted then youve perjured yourself youre still a drunk and maybe a murderer to boot wheres your career then marlene ash had a double agenda but there was no doubt at all about which one she was going to pursue first today she had abe glitskys prime suspect for a murder at the table next to the podium where she stood while she respected clarence jackmans opinion and the deal theyd both made with hardy she didnt for a moment believe that one of the staff doctors in the parnassus physicians group was in possession of any insider knowledge about bogus billing at the corporate level so she was going for the murder indictment over the past few days shed put in long hours going over printouts of computer files supplied by parnassus mostly about kensing his estranged wife and their relationship with tim markham it had been anything but pleasant without question the two men had hated each other ironically marlene thought and only from reading one side of the correspondence kensing seemed to become bolder and more threatening as the relationship between his exwife and markham flowered markham appeared to be bending over backward to give kensing what he wantedthe subtext being that kensing would expose them and now in spite of her ammunition ash couldnt seem to make a hit shed had kensing now for an hour and hed cordially rebutted each of her assaults with reasonable responses that rang true he hadnt been worried about losing his job under markham as the correspondence had made clear the relationship between markham and his wife was insulation against that in fact markhams death had actually imperiled his employment he was currently under dr ross on administrative leave proof that in a way markham had been his reluctant protector and not a threat at all he had once felt rage for tim markham and his wife certainly who wouldnt but as a matter of fact he was in a satisfying relationship at the moment in retrospect he realized that his wife leaving him had been an opportunity albeit a painful one there was no anger anymore if anything he was doing better than ann the divorce was proceeding amicably they were sharing visitation ms ash was misinformed there had been no fight last weekend ann had had an accident he had filed no charges against her and shed brought none against him she was hurt and angry and wanted to lash out because tim markham had left her the week before her rage was understandable his nonexistent he took the kids until she was back home he and ann had talked for several hours just two days ago the police had regrettably misunderstood again ms ash was misinformed he had never admitted killing tim markham no of course he hadnt he wasnt sure what ann thought shed heard she had probably misunderstood he hadnt wanted to discuss her testimony with her in advance because his lawyer had told him not to he readily admitted that the baby emily case had exacerbated the already strained relations between him and parnassus there he had simply done the right thing and doing so had angered the money people in his company this was a recurring theme in medicine everywheremoney versus care he was a doctor and made no bones about where he stood on the issue did this he inquired make him guilty of something he had come here voluntarily he could take the fifth amendment yet did not he wanted to clear the air clear his name so he could get back to his life his patients all right then dr kensing marlene ash said at last you were the last person to see carla markham alive were you not i cant say maam id assume that would be her murderer a snicker rippled across the jurors when did you leave the markham house on the night of mr markhams death at a little after ten and you told lieutenant glitsky you drove straight home isnt that true yes maam thats what i told the lieutenant he took in a breath then came out with it but that was not true he had his hands locked on the table in front of him and addressed himself to the jurors lieutenant glitsky interrogated me on this issue i didnt want to tell him where id been when i talked to my lawyer he told me that today i would be under oath he told me my testimony would be protected and you would keep my secret im sorry i lied to the lieutenant but i didnt go straight home the truth is im an alcoholic and fisk and bracco had decided that their priority was to collect the facts that theyd been unable to gather previously to do this most efficiently they should split up bracco had drawn brendan driscoll called him from the hall of justice made an appointment the suspect seemed enthusiastic driscoll had dressed for the interviewpressed dress slacks shining wing tips coat and tie when he opened the door braccos first question was if he was going someplace the answer surprised him dont i know you i dont think so no he held up his badge inspector bracco homicide yes i know come in come in they went into the living room off to the left of the hallway at the front of the duplex it was a bright space made more so by the slanting sun through the open windows the whiteonwhite motif water bubbled soothingly from a japanese rock sculpture in the corner bracco was suddenly intensely uneasy he could not place the other mans face but there was an unmistakable recognition a shift in the dynamic between them driscoll indicated one of the chairs then sat kittycorner all the way back on the couch almost lounging one arm out along the top of the cushions bracco got out his tape recorder turned it on and placed it on the glass tabletop next to a large flat tray of raked white sand and smooth stones keeping himself busy with the standard preamble he finally looked over again at his potential suspect im going to cut to the chase mr driscoll i understand you were at carla markhams house in the late afternoon through the evening on the day her husband was killed yes thats true do you remember what you did later that night obviously the question was unexpected and resented what i did why if you could just answer the question well i cant just answer the question without a reason why would you want to know what i did later that night i thought you were coming here to talk about dr ross or dr kensing that maybe mr elliot had come upon something in what id given him jeff elliot what did you give him driscoll had to some degree recovered his aplomb after the insult some of my files from work evidence i would suppose youd call it although the grand jury didnt seem interested when i talked to them you think these files contain evidence relating to mr markhams death absolutely of course they do they must and do you still have copies here driscoll hesitated for an instant then shook his head no i gave them all to mr elliot bracco didnt believe this for a moment and yet you thought i was coming over here to discuss them with you i thought you must have talked to him no bracco met driscolls eye but maybe i should on second thought he probably wouldnt show them to you sources you know but i could call him and get them back then let you know that might be helpful bracco said or we could get a search warrant and go through them ourselves driscoll was shaking his head supercilious youre way late sergeant ross has erased all the good stuff by now everything about him and tim anyway but you say you had it and gave it to jeff elliot a selfimportant shrug i didnt read it all but some of it was certainly provocative if you know what i mean he was definitely firing ross you know markham im sure he was taking kickbacks for putting drugs on the formulary tim got wise to it too after sinustop he just needed more proof before he could accuse him directly but if you read between the lines you can see it it was over between them bracco decided not to press anymore with driscoll the issue of whether hed kept copies of his files or what might be contained in them hed come here today to talk about the tuesday night and he returned to that topic im still wondering about after you left the markhams a petulant glare then a sigh of capitulation all right then i came home here thank you and what time was that im not sure nine nine thirty you have to understand that my world had just fallen apart i wasnt keeping track of the time very well a brusque nod were you alone brendan brought a hand to his forehead he closed his eyes for a long moment yes roger was working late which hes been doing all the time recently but i called him and he was just crunching numbers no clients at that time and we could talk at least we could talk it had been the worst day just the worst i almost went down to his bank just to be with him but he told me hed be coming home you called him at his bank after you got home at nine thirty yes i was so upset just so upset did you and roger talk a long while i dont know it seemed too short but you know how that is i just couldnt tell you how long it was honestly ross didnt have any kind of trouble remembering he told fisk i was talking with jeff elliot here in the office until latei dont know the exact time maybe nine oclock something like that it had been the day from hell ill tell you then he finished with mealthough he didnt really finish with me until hed written that fucking columnand i realized id hit the wall so i got in my car and went home fisks young and earnest face clouded over so you got home about nine thirty yeah something like that is there a problem with that fisk scratched behind his ear only sir that i think your wife said something about you getting home after midnight that night ross gave it some more thought then let out a humorless chuckle no shes got it mixed up with another night ive been getting home at midnight so often lately she probably thinks thats my regular hours but it wasnt anywhere near there maybe ten tops glitsky had put off taking care of some of his administrative duties as long as he could but this morning he came in and began for three hours hed been caught up in such minutiae as collating the mileage run up by his inspectors on cityissue cars now he was chewing on the last dry bit of rice cake and sipping the dregs of his tea which had attained room temperature so he was in a suitably cheerful mood when marlene ash knocked on his door as she was opening it he sat back gratefully pushed the paperwork aside you broke him he said she closed the door quietly then turned back to him and leaned against the wall her arms crossed over her chest pending verification of his alibi which id expect in the next few hours dr kensing is no longer a suspect at least for carlas death and that means markhams too id suppose glitsky squinted up at her shook his head he doesnt have an alibi he didnt tell it to you he wanted the secrecy protection of the grand jury as though id tell anybody he wanted to be sure and you believe it what was it ash uncrossed her arms and took one of the folding chairs across from glitskys desk you know the story of the man in the old west who was sleeping with his best friends wife at the time of the murder and got hanged because he wouldnt admit thats where hed been it was something like that except it didnt involve sleeping with anybody he was someplace he shouldnt have been close enough abe and about as far as i want to go even with you if this gets out later and it always might i want to be able to say i never told a soul i believe it rock solid he didnt do it still way back in his chair glitsky sat with this new reality for a long beat this is one of the few times marlene when i see the value in profanity youre truly satisfied he couldnt have been at carlas whos going to check this out not at ten fortyfive abe unless that time is squishy and i have an investigator out checking now but glitsky had taken hardys information then gone back himself to talk to frank husic he considered that mans testimony to be unimpeachable and carlas time of death established if kensing hadnt been there at he was innocent hed give a lot to know precisely where the doctor had been but knew he wasnt likely to get it from any source and certainly not from marlene ash thanks for the headsup he told her you got anybody else you like not really abe im talking to the accountant and maybe a couple of board members this afternoon ive got to broaden the net and make some progress on the money side or clarence is going to be unhappy hes already going to be unhappy that his deal with dismas got us nothing of any substance it got me something glitsky said ruefully i didnt arrest him which is starting to look like a good idea this was unarguable and marlene went on well anyway ive subpoenaed all of their financial records for the past three years and well see who can explain them satisfactorily im going to have the grand jury take the fraud issue headon then maybe ill get back to the murder indictment but for now my priority what are you guys talking about bracco and fisk werent exactly talking theyd come back and met at the hall after their respective interviews in the morning the volume of their conversation out at their desks had pulled the lieutenant out of his office and his meeting with ash nothing sir sorry darrel bracco didnt want to fink on his partner although he was plenty disappointed in him it didnt sound like nothing glitsky stood over their combined desk with the stoplight in the middle of it he was looking down on them one to the other at last fisk caved malachi ross told me when he went home on the tuesday night but it was a different time than his wife had said so harlen told ross what shed said bracco finished for him you told him glitskys voice was flat ash had come out and was standing behind him shaking her head at these keystones fisk nodded she said after midnight and he said ten oclock so he just said she was wrong shed made a mistake and then the minute harlen walked out the door he called her bracco was appalled at his partners error how much you want to bet easy darrel glitsky turned a surprisingly patient eye to fisk usually when you get contradictory statements from two witnesses especially if theyre closely related like married you dont want to tell the one what the other said until you can get them together and confront them with the contradiction that can be instructive yes sir i got that now i made a mistake do you think hes called his wife absolutely bracco said ash spoke from behind glitsky do you have her number you could call and ask her yourself fisk said he thought hed try that while he made the call bracco started to tell glitsky about his interview with brendan driscoll when ash heard about the correspondence and computer files she piped in what are all these papers he never mentioned them when he was up before the grand jury he told me you didnt ask about them how could i i didnt know they existed outside of the company computers what did he do steal them i gathered he emailed them to himself before he got fired so he stole them are they still at his house i got that impression the disks anyway ash turned to glitsky we need that stuff abe jeff elliots already got it bracco offered forget it glitsky said hes a reporter well never see it so well go for driscolls originals ash said where are your warrant forms you keep em up here you might not even need them bracco told her driscolls just looking for a way that he can disrupt things at parnassus hes bitter he wants to get back at people especially people who made life hard on markham ash nodded but told them to get a warrant anyway fisk came back over to the knot of them dejected she didnt admit he called her but she said she remembered wrong and changed her mind she was glad i called she was going to call me he looked mournfully around him ten oclock he called her bracco snapped it doesnt matter glitsky was in a fatalistic frame of mind after kensing the wife wouldnt have testified at trial against her husband anyway we havent lost anything not like with kensing the two inspectors shot glances at each other what about kensing bracco asked again ash stepped in you can take him off your list he has an alibi for carlas murder i was just telling abe this brought them all to silence which bracco broke so its all coming down to carla glitsky nodded looks like is there anybody left without an alibi what about driscoll i asked him this morning bracco said he might have been talking on the phone to who his partner roger i was going to check his phone records its on my list after a moment fisk perked up i dont know if youve heard lieutenant but weve made some progress on the car hardy should have been elated after all his client was no longer a suspect hed remained on the fifth floor eschewing an opportunity to visit with either glitsky or jackman waiting on a bench outside the police commissioners hearing room until kensing had come out eric told him how it had gone which was pretty much exactly as hardy had predicted the two men had walked up to johns for a celebration lunch but it had turned out to be a sober affair in all senses hardy made a fewhe thoughtsubtle attempts to get eric to open up about his girlfriend how had judith cohn gotten along with markham with ross with all the parnassus problems monetary and otherwise with which kensing had such difficulty what were their plans together if any eric was reasonably forthcoming shed only been on staff at portola for a year after her residency at usc and internship at johns hopkins then two fourmonth stintsone in africa and one in south americawith medicins san frontieres you know doctors without borders although she always gives it the french reading posters in her room and her bumper sticker even shes proud of her languages french and spanish and shes a fanatic about the organization really i think shes got me halfconvinced to go over with her next timeits nigeria this summeralthough god knows theres enough to do here in this coun try but if parnassus does let me goandmy kids i dont know how theyd handle it remember when decisions used to be easy after they said goodbye hardy stood in the sunshine on ellis street about midway between his office and the chronicle building it should be over he knew but somehow it wasnt this wasnt the familiar emotional letdown after the conclusion of a trial there was no conclusion here not yet someone had murdered tim markham and his family someone had murdered a succession of patients at portola and he still had his deal with glitsky they were sharing their discovery and he was privy to knowledge that abe did not share it rankled and left him feeling somehow in his friends debt which was absurd hardy had if anything done glitsky a big favor but whatever the complications he knew that he was too involved to quit even if there was no one left to defend it couldnt be the end it wasnt over part four there was no reason now for jeff elliot to use any of the dirt that driscoll had supplied on eric kensing if he wasnt any longer suspected of killing markham and his family then he was a private person with his own private problems and they were not the stuff of newsat least not the kind of news that made its way into citytalk hardy sat in elliots cubicle the stack of paper driscoll had provided on the rolling table in front of him he flipped through the pages slowly one at a time over the course of the afternoon while jeff toiled on his next column it was really a hodgepodge of data the letters to kensing that elliot had shown hardy the other day for example occurred over the course of several years and were widely separated within the printed documents likewise the memos to ross and the board on various issues including baby emily and the lopez boy occurred in chronological order hardy was finding that only a careful reading of all the documents related to any one issue would lead to any real sense of the gravity of the thing over time there were at least a hundred memos to file as well formal documentationprobably dictated to driscollof various meetings and decisions nothing that struck him as new or important more interesting to hardy although far more cryptic were the thirty or forty shorthand reminders and comments that markham had probably typed to himself it was obvious that he believed he could write in a secureprobably a passwordeddocument but that driscoll had breached that security and gotten access but try as he might hardy couldnt make much out of them markhams early memos to portolas administration on lopez were mostly concerned with the facts of the situation they were about insurance considerations and a litany of medical explanations of specific decisions that might mitigate their liability in the inevitable lawsuit several memos both to file and to the physicians group explored the culpability of a dr jadra who had been the first physician to examine ramiro lopez at the clinic somehow hardy gathered it was determined that jadras actions were not negligent the boys fever had been mild on that first visit the throat infection had not yet progressed to the point where a reasonable diagnostician would necessarily prescribe antibiotics or even order a strep test further jadra did not note the cut on ramiros lip in his file at all and when questioned about it later had no memory of it these jadra memos struck hardy as interesting because he could read the obvious subtext markham was looking for a scapegoat and the case against jadra would not be as clearcut as that against cohn so these jadra documents had to hardy an odd defensive character by contrast when markham finally recommended that they prepare an on cohnwhich went on her permanent record with the state medical board and the national practitioner data bankthe letter was sharply worded and extremely critical dr cohns inability to recognize the early signs of necrotizing fasciitis and her failure to recommend highly aggressive treatment was surely the primary factor contributing to the patients death by the time he was admitted to the icu the disease had progressed to the point where even the most active intervention would probably not have been efficacious we recommend that portola suspend dr cohns clinical privileges for thirty days that you submit an report on this incident as required and that you conduct a full enquiry to determine the advisability of dr cohns continued employ within the parnassus physicians group hardy knew what markham was doing heretrying to distance himself and the hospital from judiths failure to make an early diagnosis again this decision was about insurance about getting sued about the money from kensings perspective though admittedly biased the real ultimate culprit in this tragedy had been malachi ross pulling the strings and denying the needed care from on high instead the opprobrium was falling most heavily and solely on a relatively newly hired young female staffer even if judith might have done a better job with the early diagnosis it was clearly unfair to single her out as the reason the boy had died many people contributed as did the corporate culture and hardy thought the whole thing stunk it did however provide a solid motive for judith to have hated markham he turned the page and stared uncomprehendingly at the next something about ross he was sure the initials mr then priv invest but did this refer to a private investment in one of the drug companies with whom parnassus did business or to a private investigator that markham might hire to keep tabs on his medical director there was simply no way to know he went on to the next page i do not remember rajan bhutan shook his head sadly fisk had had a few ideas he wanted to pursue about the car and some other things so glitsky had asked darrel bracco if he wanted to sit in with him while he talked to rajan bhutan whod volunteered to come down to the hall in the early afternoon nevertheless bhutan seemed nervous and reluctant when he showed up punctually for the interview he asked glitsky several times if he needed a lawyer and once if glitsky was going to arrest him glitsky reassured him that he was free to leave at any time no one was arresting anyone today bhutan told glitsky he did not like it that people thought he might have killed someone glitsky told him they just wanted to clear up some things hed said before maybe get a few more facts but of course glitsky reiterated he was welcome to call an attorney at any point if he wanted to spend the money but now with no attorney bhutan was saying he didnt remember the day after christmas you dont remember if you worked at all that day bracco was doing bad cop glitsky had already made friends with bhutan in their earlier interview and preferred to leave things that way im sure there is a record of it bhutan responded wanting to be helpful you could check with personnel weve already done that rajan and they tell us you were working that day and it just seems like you would have remembered do you know why do you remember shirley watrous she died that day she was murdered on that day glitsky sat at the head of the table kittycorner to both of them he held up a hand restraining bracco for bhutans benefit do you remember anything specific about shirley watrous rajan was she a difficult patient something like that bhutan hung his head then raised it again with an effort i do remember that name she was no not difficult there really is no one more difficult than another in the intensive care unit they are all just people who are suffering the suffering bothers you doesnt it rajan bracco was sitting across from him there was a video camera masked in an air vent mounted in the corner on the ceiling an unseen tape running under the table yes its why i became a nurse my wife suffered terribly before she died and i learned that i could help glitsky poured more water from the pitcher into bhutans paper cup did you ever think you could help patients more by putting them out of their misery no i have never done that kind of thing not one time never pulled the plug on anyone when it was clear they were going to die anything like that glitsky asked gently bhutan sipped from his cup shook his head no always that is the doctors decision i am there only to help not to decide if i have a question i ask a doctor again he drank some water and i never know when people are going to die lieutenant no one knows that not even the doctors no one but god in these years i have worked at the icu i have seen people come in and think they wont make it to the night but then a week later they sit up and can go home it is just what happens bracco jumped all over that well shirley watrous didnt just happen something happened to her same as with marjorie loring and you were on duty for both of them what do you have to say about that glitsky leaned in helpfully maybe they were belligerent rajan they didnt want you poking at them changing their beds maybe they were making it worse for the others in the room bhutan looked from one inspector to the other i dont know what to say what do you want me to say you are the common denominator on both of the shifts where these women died rajan bracco thought they were getting close and his intensity came through weve got another nine or ten people who died in the icu and you were on for all of them as well if you were sitting here where we are what would you think he brought his hands to the black circles under his eyes i would think i must have killed them myself his eyes sought each of theirs in turn but i swear to you that isnt true bracco threw glitsky a quick look then struck in a loud voice are you expecting us to believe you had nothing to do with the deaths of these women and the others who else was there rajan who else had any chance i dont know i dont know who would do this there must be a record of who else was there some doctor perhaps even a janitor or sometimes a security guard they come and go you understand glitsky reached over and touched bhutans sleeve do you remember anyone rajan bracco slapped at the table then stood up knocking his chair over behind him as he did so theres no phantom janitor or doctor rajan theres only you dont you understand we have your records you have been on duty for every death we know of even tim markhams oh no rajans eyes were wide at the accusation i did not kill him but you did kill the other ones no i have told you no rajan glitsky said quietly listen to me were not going to go away were going to keep on this until we find the proof we need and we will find it when you murder ten or more people ill tell you for a fact that youve left a trail somewhere either when you checked out the drugs or someplace else maybe youve got vials of it stashed somewhere maybe you confided in one of your bridge partners or another nurse whatever it is were going to keep looking until we find it were going to ask your friends and the people you work with it will be very ugly and eventually after all your efforts to hide it it will come out anyway you have to understand that it will come out bracco or you could just tell us now do yourself a favor glitsky said it could all end right now i know it must be bothering you i know you need to explain why you had to do this he stood up motioned to bracco lets give him a few minutes alone darrel glitsky wasnt going to leave a message at hardys conceding his mistake with kensing if hed been wrong and it looked like he had beenwell hed been wrong before and would be again but he wasnt going to give hardy a tape recording of himself admitting it his friend would probably run a loop of it and make it a part of the outgoing message on his answering machine so hed called once left his usual cheery glitsky call me and waited the callback came at a little after ive got a question hardy said wait give me a minute fiftyfour good answer unfortunately not the right one you werent going to ask how old id be when my child is born no but thats an awesome fact fiftyfour thats way too old to have new kids why im not even fiftyfour myself and my children are nearly grown and out of the house so are mine glitsky growled so what was your real question actually i have two i had kind of thought wed agreed on the idea that youd inform me when you were moving on my client is that a question the question is whyd you choose last night to search his place and not tell me about it first i wont dignify the second half as for why we picked yesterday we wanted to know what we might have with him before he got in front of the grand jury it would have been embarrassing if he had a floorplan of markhams home with xs where the bodies were found and marlene didnt know about it when she was asking him questions know what i mean hardy did and it made complete sense as did the lack of warning if glitsky had told him in advance when they were searching hardy would have gone there first and removed any shred of anything that could have been construed as incriminating he decided to move on the second question is easier have you talked to your two cowboys or know where they are now we were going to get together again and i thought id set it up theyre out talking to somebody about the hitandrun vehiclehey we dont call them the car police for nothingbut they ought to be back before five inspector fisk has an aversion to overtime whatever that is you want to drop by here on your way home theyll probably be around i can congratulate you on getting your client off you got the word did you marlene just before lunch which leaves you where with the rest of it real close hardy chuckled good answer why do you care if its not your case anymore its still my case abe i just dont have a client a pause we had a deal i may have found out a few things glitsky decided he liked the sound of that see you in a couple of hours he said the last time hardy had just picked up and without any warning decided to pay a call on a working doctor at the judah clinic was when he had tried to convince kensing to talk to him while he was scheduled to see patients that hadnt worked out so well but after two plus hours with jeff elliots documents down in the windowless chronicle basement hardy couldnt abide the thought of returning to his office when he told cohn what his unscheduled visit to the clinic was about he was confident that even if she was busy she would see him but maybe not he waited outside with his brain on full speed for a little more than twenty minutes and still she hadnt appeared he would give her another ten before he went inside again and made a stronger demand it was the sixth consecutive day of sunshine and he was going to get as much of it as he could before the june fog slammed the city again mr hardy he squinted up got to his feet extended his hand guilty judith cohns mouth was set in worry the cause of which immediately became apparent the same question shed asked first thing on the phone yesterday is it eric is he all right hes fine in fact hes better than hes been in a couple of weeks he explained only that his grand jury testimony had made them decide that he was no longer a suspect he said nothing about the actual alibi the stop at harrys bar if kensing wanted to tell her about that it would be his call so hes clear looks like oh god she put a hand histrionically over her heart smiling now broadly at him that is such a great relief i am so glad then the smile faded but you didnt come here to tell me that did you no i didnt her hand was still on her heart what he started at the beginning his call to her yesterday which had revealed that she did not have any corroboration for where she had been at on that tuesday night then the lopez case her problems with markham oversleeping the morning markham had been hit im not saying that i think youve had anything to do with any of this but the police may not feel the same way if they find out with very few other people on their radar screens its likely that they will it would be better if you were prepared for their questions shed listened intently and now her face clouded over with dismay but ii was at erics i never thought id have to prove that did you talk to anyone else see anybody in the hallway do you remember if anybody might have seen you she was continually shaking her head stunned by this development how it might play and so theyd thinki could have killed mrs markham and their children it would not eliminate you thats the point and theyre going on the assumption that the same person killed tim at the hospital yes for a moment hardy thought she might panic her eyes locked on his then combed the street in front of them as though looking for an avenue of escape but then almost as suddenly the strain bled out of her expressive face she reached out her hand and placed it on hardys sleeve then this would only matter she said if i had been in the icu within a few minutes or so of tims death right i dont know exactly enough time for the potassium to work so lets even say fifteen minutes outside and that would be a hell of a long time thats when i would have had to be there right right but it was my understandingyou told me last night in factthat you were there right after the code blue i was but not right before right beforea half hour before at least maybe morei was in the er putting some stitches in a babys lip she dropped her bottle then fell on it what a mess but i had my nurse with me and the babys mom everybody in fact everybody knew i was there when they called the code blue i was just washing up after the stitches and i turned to my nurse and said ive got to go see if thats mr markham shell remember when hardy walked into the homicide detail it was old home week though bracco and fisk had not yet arrived eight out of the fourteen homicide inspectors were at or near their desks hardy thought it had to be close to a record for the room the hazing of the new guys continued he noticeda keystone kops childrens toy two soft police dolls hanging from a paddy wagon sat in the middle of their combined desks by the stoplight while hardy waited three separate inspectors pointed out to him that if you squeezed the wagon it went oogah oogah when he declined to try it for himself they all seemed disappointed adding to the party atmosphere jackman had stopped by with treya at the close of business and hearing of hardys imminent arrival had decided to wait around marlene ash had finished up with the grand jury for the day she wanted to get glitskys debriefing of rajan bhutan as well as whatever latebreaking news he might have on the stilllive markham suspects whoever they might be glitskys office couldnt have held the crowd so everyone had moved over near the first interrogation room and thats where hardy joined them after taking the expected grief from jackman about the merits of the deal theyd made about his client hardy listened with growing interest as glitsky went on about the second proven portola victim shirley watrous and rajan bhutan the consensus seemed to be that the two series of multiple murders were unrelated and that bhutan remained the prime suspect for the people on kensings list theyd talked to him at length this afternoon and glitsky had sent two inspectors over to his home shortly after that with a search warrant the inspectors sent up a rousing huzzah when the rookies arrived glitsky turned and glared at the world in general then motioned fisk and bracco over to talk with the big boys darrel and harlen in hardys estimation had accomplished quite a lot in a very short time since theyd just arrived from markhams old neighborhood and their investigations about the car glitsky let fisk expound on that topic although his skepticism was evident he proudly showed off to the assemblage a composite sketch of the cars driver hardy was glad to note that the woman bore no resemblance to judith cohn except for a halo of unkempt dark hair as the composite went from hand to hand around the room fisk then announced that their witness a teenage girl named lexi rath had tentatively identified the make and model of the car that had nearly hit her and presumably hit tim markham it was a dodge dart probably a model from the last year of the sixties or the early seventies fisk had already contacted the dmv and discovered that there were only twentythree such cars registered in all of san francisco county when hed told motor vehicles that they were investigating a homicide they faxed him the names right away he now had addresses and registered owners for each of the cars and with luck by tomorrow hed have seen most of them any of the names look familiar harlen glitsky asked related to parnassus or markham in any way no sir well good try anyway if we get the car thats something all by itself keep looking hardy knew glitsky well enough to see that he was humoring fisk about his supposed detective work but he didnt want to ruin his inspectors day or dampen his enthusiasm the man had put in a decent amount of effort and perhaps it still might all lead someplace hardy thought a show of interest on his own part wouldnt be out of place could i get a copy of that list inspector fisk looked the question over to glitsky who nodded but it was clear the lieutenants real area of concern lay elsewhere in the alibis for the time of carlas death darrel he said turning to bracco did you get anything more on driscoll i dont think harlen was quite done sir his patience straining glitsky yielded the floor back to fisk i thought id try to make amends for my giveaway to dr ross so i called my aunt kathykathy west he explained to the rest of the room and told her what id done and what had happened which was what harlen glitsky prompted him much to hardys satisfaction he outlined the story brieflyross and his wife and his alibi then he went on i asked heraunt kathyif she could get in touch with nancy ross just as a friend and find out if her husband had called her and asked her to change her memory but it doesnt matter the wife would never testify any way marlene ash objected repeating glitskys earlier argument jackman added to that your aunts testimony would be hearsay anyway and probably inadmissible in any event isnt that right diz but hardy was no longer interested in parsing the law he wanted answers and information he saw that fisk had begun to wilt under the heat of the lawyers questions he wanted to keep him talking to find out what had happened so what did she say anyway inspector your aunt that ross had called his wife and told her she was mistaken about that night hed been home by ten she had to remember that it was important he looked around the room again but nancy told aunt kathy that in fact he hadnt been home by ten although of course shed back him up if it was important to malachi it was probably some big hushhush business deal but she was sure that he hadnt gotten home until way after midnight which is when shed gone to sleep still glitsky said all that means is that he didnt go straight home hardy was reminded of eric kensing and all the variables on that score is there any sign that he went to carlas though have you got any evidence or testimony or hint of anything putting him there fisks face fell no sir glitsky threw him a bone im not saying its not something harlen and it does make up for the morning okay keep on it now darrel how about driscoll he did make that phone call all right i talked to rogerthe roommateand got the phone bill fortyeight minutes beginning at nine fortysix everybody worked it out in their heads glitsky said so he couldnt have made it to carlas bracco seemed to agree he would have had to fly it was the bottom of the fourth inning and hardy was standing in the third base coachs box at pop hicks field in the presidio it was a great field in terrific condition in a city starved for playgrounds but in typical san francisco fashion the little league was probably going to get kicked off it before too long they might be forced to relocate to a field on treasure island in the middle of the bay this was because someone had raised the issue that there might be toxins in the dirt though none had been found to date every news story on the issue had pointed out that the presidio had been a military base for years after all and who knew what those military types had dumped where probably there was poison everywheremustard gas anthrax battery acid hardy considered it foreordained that theyd shut the field down but tonight it was still a wonderful venue for kids baseball and vincent had just opened the tigers half of the inning by doubling to the gap in left fieldhis second double of the night he was now dancing down the baseline trying to draw a throw from the pitcher hardys mind was not as much on the game as it could have been after the meeting in homicide had broken up and fisk and bracco had left hed stayed around jawing with glitsky and treya marlene and clarence for a few minutes marlene seemed to be excited about the prospect of getting her hands on brendan driscolls computer disks but since hardy had spent a good portion of the afternoon reviewing those printouts to no avail he didnt quite share her enthusiasm he still had copies of markhams cryptic notes in his briefcasehe thought hed work on those puzzles over the next few days in his free time and in fact he was doing it now though still going mostly nowhere clarence obviously frustrated at the pace of the investigation so far announced that he had heard from the mayor his honor had gotten wind of the second verified homicide from kensings list and wasnt much impressed with the das subtle approach to parnassus and its troubles the hmo was a major contractor with the city and their business practices were seriously suspect clarence was now of a mind to go and seize all of its records for the grand jurys perusal and forget about avoiding a possible panic among city workers people were already beginning to panicthe mayors office was fielding about fifty calls a day it was high time to put parnassus in receivership and turn the grand jury and another team of homicide inspectors concurrently onto this second set of homicides whether or not there was any relation between them and the markham deaths they were a big deal in their own right the mayor was adamant that there had to at least be the appearance of progresshe mentioned creating a special task force if there werent some results soon everybody knew what that would mean meddling by amateurs political deals compromise and quite probably no resolution ever the message was clear if jackman wanted to get any credit for fixing this mess this was his chance and hed better take it the next batter lined a sharp single on one hop to the left fielder and vincent running on the hit was to third base and by him before hardy got his head back into the game the throw to home beat his son by fifteen feet after the play mitch the manager came down to the end of the dugout diz he said urgently you gotta tell him to hold up on that play give him a sign come on now youre coaching lets get in the game the tigers won in spite of hardys mental error and the team went for pizza to a place on clement the whole family had attended the game and didnt get home until frannie and rebecca had become survivor fanaticstheyd taped the evenings show and went straight in to watch the replay while vincent showered did the last of his homework made it for the last half of the program bedtime rituals consumed another hour so it was almost midnight when hardy and frannie dragged themselves up the stairs to their bedroom he came up behind her and put his arms around her as she was brushing her teeth put his lips against the side of her neck i will come straight to bed if youre even remotely alive theyd been having a decent run of physical contact and he was telling her they could keep the string alive if she wanted but he knew she was exhausted she leaned back into him managed a goofy smile in the mirror through the toothpaste i dont think i am arent you tired not really evidently i slept during vinnies game it wasnt that bad so what are you going to do ive got some reading material in my briefcase maybe if i blur my eyes just right i can get it to make some sense he was sitting at the desk in the bedroom five of driscolls purloined pages spread out before him he wasnt completely sure why these five had made his cutnone had more than a couple of lines but something about each of them had seemed pregnant enough with some kind of hidden meaning to warrant one more round of conjecture see ma re recom on ss compare mr memo talk to mraddress complaints re hands on at port ppg ult medrasbiosynthmr foley invest saratoga da layoff disc wc see coz re punitive layoffsmr document all prep rpt to board severance and then a little voice said go to sleep this is not happening he must have made it to the bed because thats where he was when he woke up glitsky kissed his wife goodbye at the front door if im around for lunch ill call if im around i might go out with you treya gave him a mocksad moue a year ago the mere thought of lunch with me would have made your morning youd have planned your whole day around it i know but were married now and youre pregnant and all its pretty natural the romance going away with all that daytoday stuff she put an arm around his neck and brought her mouth up to his ear what was last night then last night glitsky scratched at his scar pretended not to remember last night she swung a hard elbow and caught him in the gut oh sorry a smile then shoot for lunch rubbing his stomach he closed the door and came back into his kitchen where hardy sat at the table hed called an hour before and offered to drive glitsky in to work though he usually drove in with his wife but hardy thought he might have something on markham although he didnt know what it was and maybe abe now pulling up his chair could help hardy drummed his fingers after twenty seconds glitsky said you want to stop that then ross looks like hes in some kind of trouble doesnt he a minute later he pulled one page over in front of him this one maybe it could be mike andreotti new to me hardy said the administrator at portola hell talk to you if i ask him to hes all cooperation with these homicides i might even go with you whered you get this stuff jeff elliot couldnt make heads or tails of it he said if i could i was welcome to it yeah but where did it come from originally it was markhams through driscoll then through elliot not exactly tinkers to evers to chance no but ill take it at this pointglitsky was getting upill take anything if at glitskys last meeting with him andreotti had been at the edge of physical and nervous exhaustion now he was the walking dead he didnt even bother rising from the chair behind his desk didnt wonder that the new man something hardy wasnt a policeman or a da or even a reporter he just didnt have any more energy to expend hed been at work all night dealing with a sickout of his nurses scared off either by the rumors or sensing an opportunity for leverage in their struggle for higher wages he didnt know and really at this point didnt care the ship was going down anyway and he saw no way to stop it and now these men had a puzzle for him he got a perverted kick out of that he was so beat hed have trouble with the rules of tictactoe and they wanted him to decipher this puzzle it was funny really if he had the strength to laugh see ma re recom on ss compare mr memo no idea he said the other fellow hardy leaned forward slightly we believe the mr stands for malachi ross does that help glitsky had seen a lot of burnout in his job and read the signs here he pulled the page around facing him again see mike andreotti about his recommendations on ss compare with the malachi ross memo dated october twentyfourth does that help whats ss this time there was no hesitation sinustop and what was your recommendation well it wasnt mine im just the administrator but the ppg recommended excuse me hardy said whats the ppg andreotti blinked slowly took a breath and let it out the parnassus physicians group basically theyre the doctors that work here okay glitsky staying with the program continued and what did they recommend about sinustop just that wed been inundated with samples and that perhaps we should make it a policy for a while to go easy on giving the stuff out until more data got collected on it which now in retrospect was a smart suggestion but you didnt implement it hardy asked no ross overrode it he wrote a long memo justifying the positionive got it somewhere here i gather the stuff was medically pretty substandard im not a doctor myself but some of the senior staffers were appalled that our medical director would put his stamp on anything like that so as usual we compromised and malachi got what he wanted you dont like him much glitsky didnt phrase it as a question but andreotti merely raised his shoulders a centimeter people become pricks around money and moneys been so tight here for so long another shrug if it wasnt him it would be somebody else only a couple of weeks ago it was markham hardy reminded him no it was still ross ross has the passion for money markham just wanted to make a profit theres a difference whats the difference glitsky asked well take sinustop for example it didnt have to be any issue at all but ross saw it saving us a million bucks a year right to the bottom line if there might be some downside he was willing to risk it if it stemmed the bleeding and markham wasnt sometimes but nowhere near the way ross did you think it was markham who made the call on baby emily no chance he pointed at hardys page again anyway i guess thats why he wrote that note to himself he thought ross went too far there again what about you mr andreotti glitsky asked what did you think another weary sigh i know this always sounds terrible but im an administrator i resist the temptation to play doctor i follow orders but hardy had what he needed and had already gotten a hint on something else if we may sir he began translating the second note as glitsky had done talk to ross and address complaints about handson at portola parnassus physicians group ult which must be ultimatum it was this wasnt any mystery to andreotti he actually almost seemed to perk up slightly sometime last year ross started coming by the hospital all the timedropins he called them checking up on our physicians procedures on everything from birthing to surgeries to er procedures first making recommendations to save a buck here a buck there later actually advising doctors what they ought to do right while they were treating their patients now when you realize that even the lowliest gp has a selfimage just a notch below gods you can imagine how popular these visits were finally the ppg issued an ultimatum that he had to stop and mostly he did at least enough to satisfy them but not completely hardy wanted to be sure no but the dropins fell off from twenty a month to maybe five and he stopped giving orders disguised as advice do you have any record of the days he came the actual dates hardy asked andreotti pondered for a moment no i doubt it why would we he wasnt on staff here so thered be no personnel record he just dropped in why no reason just curious hardy kept it deliberately vague pushed the other pages across the desk if we could just take one more minute of your time mr andreotti does anything else strike you about these the administrator pulled them over and took time now one by one i dont know medras but biosynth is a drug manufacturer most of their stuff is lowrent overthecounter theyre not real players but ive heard a rumor theyve got something big with the fda right now he turned to the next page looked up foley is patrick foley hes corporate counsel i dont know who da is glitsky knew that one the district attorney a light was coming on in andreottis eyes but he made no comment turning to the last page see coz re punitive layoffsmr document all prep rpt to board severance coz is cozzie eu shes the personnel director he labored over the rest of the note for a few seconds then slowly he raised his head tim was going to let ross go wasnt he glitskys mouth was tight its a little early to say sir but thanks very much for your time as they drove out to the embarcadero center and parnassus headquarters the way they decided to phrase it to corporate counsel was that hardy was an attorney working with the da that was true in all its parts if not quite literally pat foley met them at the door saw them through then looked back along the hallway in both directions before he closed it they didnt get a chance to try out their explanation before foley started talking you caught me just as i was going out but my appointment is just over in chinatown maybe we could talk as we walk in five minutes they were in portsmouth square surrounded by pagodas and tai chi classes some asian porn shops and a line of cars waiting for space in the garage below high clouds had blown in over the night and the morning air was chill with a brittle sunlight foleys dome shone even in the faded day the few hairs that were left were blond as was the wispy mustache thinshouldered and slightly paunched he was the picture of what a life behind a desk with tremendous financial pressure could do to a young manhe didnt appear to be much over forty if that when he finally sat himself on the concrete lip of one of the parks gardens he was breathing heavily from the walk sorry he said i didnt want to talk about it in there the walls have ears sometimes talk about what glitsky asked mildly well susan said you were with homicide i assume this is about mr markham or the other portola deaths although i have to say i work almost exclusively with corporate matters im not aware of any information i possess that might be useful to your investigation if i was as an officer of the court of course i would have come forward voluntarily glitsky gave him a flat stare do you talk that way at home before foley could react hardy stepped in do you really believe your offices are bugged the onetwo punch confused him he couldnt decide which question to answer so he asked one of his own is this about mr markham then the truth was that neither hardy nor glitsky knew precisely what this meeting was going to be about the telltale initials mr did not even appear in markhams note so though they both had their suspicions that ross was somehow involved they didnt want to give anything away do you have any idea what the word saratoga might refer to mr foley glitsky asked you mean the city down the peninsula out behind san jose i think theres another one in new york as well upstate somewhere i believe is that it hardy and glitsky fell into a more or less natural double team hardy followed up have either of those cities turned up in your corporate work foley turned to his other inquisitor he thought a while before he answered i cant think of when they would have he said with a stab at sincere helpfulness we dont have any business either place maybe a few patients live in the city out here but that would be about the extent of it glitsky so the name hasnt come up recently saratoga something mr markham might have discussed with you foley passed a hand over his dome and frowned maybe not plain saratoga hardy guessed a saratoga something that flicked the switch ah foley said its an airplane sorry i think saratoga and i think cupertino i grew up down there went to bellarmine but its an airplane its the one john f kennedy jr was flying when he went down hardy and glitsky exchanged a glance and the lieutenant spoke was the company planning to buy a plane no it was mr ross thats how it was brought to my attention in what way hardy asked at this turn in the questioning foley actually turned and looked behind him wiping some perhaps imaginary sweat from his broad forehead he tried a smile without much success well it came to nothing really glitskys voice brooked no resistance let us be the judge of that what happened one night rather late i think it was toward the end of last summer mr markham called to see if i was still working then asked me to come up to his office this was a little unusual not that i was working late but that he was still there i remember it was full dark by this time so it must have been nine or nine thirty still he told me to close the door as though there might be other people working who could overhear us when i got seated he said he wanted our talk to be completely confidential just between the two of us and no one else he said it was a very difficult subject and he didnt know where he stood even with his facts but he wanted to document his actions in case he needed a record of them down the line what did he want to do hardy asked he wasnt even sure of that eventually he came to where he thought he ought to hire a private investigator to look into mr rosss finances glitsky kept up the press what made him get to there several things i think but the immediate one was the saratoga foley was warming to his story as though relieved that he finally had an opportunity to get it off his chest it seems that mr markham and dr ross had been at a party together one night at a medical convention they were both attending in las vegas a week or so before theyd been close friends for years you know and evidently they went out together afterward alone for a few drinks just to catch up on personal stuff well over the course of the next couple of hours dr ross maybe drank a little too much but he evidently made quite a point of telling mr markham about the condition of his finances which wasnt good at all his personal finances i mean exclusive of parnassus which was hurting badly enough as it was so ross cried on markhams shoulder glitsky asked essentially yes told him he had no money left no savings his wife was spending it faster than he could earn it between the alimony for his first wife and the lifestyle of his second he was broke he didnt know what he was going to do hardy had gotten some inkling of this from bracco and fisks report on nancy but it was good to hear it from another source and what did markham suggest the usual id guess cutting back somewhere living within a budget it wasnt as though dr ross was unemployed he still had a substantial income and regular cash flow but that wasnt the point the point of our meeting that night what was glitsky asked foley had sat on the hard cold concrete long enough he stood brushed off his clothes checked his watch earlier that afternoon mr markhams wife had called himthis was between the foley decided not to explain something hardy assumed it was about ann kensing anyway his wife called and asked if hed heard the news dr ross had just traded in his old airplane and bought a brandnew one a saratoga he and his family were taking it to the place at tahoe that weekend and markhams wife had called to ask if they wanted to fly up with them bring the whole family you know what a brandnew saratoga costs pat he asked me half a million dollars give or take depending on how its equipped so he goes on i arrange to run into mal at the cafeteria and tell him i got the word about the plane but im curious he goes how are you paying for it and either dr ross doesnt remember details from when he was drunk or he figured he could tell his friend and it wouldnt matter but he smiles and goes something like cash is king now that hed said it foley wore his relief like a badge again he drew a hand over the top of his head again he assayed a smile a bit more successful than the first so thats it he said mr markham wanted my opinion on what we ought to do as a company how we ought to proceed he thought there was a chance that dr ross was accepting bribes or taking kickbacks to list drugs on the formulary but he didnt have any proof he just couldnt think of any other way dr ross could come up with any part of a half million in cash hed already talked to his wife and carla glitsky jumped on this sign of communication between them i dont remember hearing markham and his wife got along even when they were together oh yeah they were inseparable for a long time before theybefore all their troubles they talked about everything carla would even come and sit in at board meetings sometimes and shed know more than some of us did it pissed off some people but nobody was going to say anything and it wasnt like she was a drain on the boards resources very direct and opinionated but smart as hell business smart put it out there whatever it was and let us deal with it for hardy this cleared up a small mystery hed wondered about the notes disc and had concluded it must be the personnel person cozzie but now maybe c was carla still he wanted to bring foley back to markhams action so what did you both finally decide to do you said that it all came to nothing in the end anyway this was an unpleasant memory well i told mr markham that if he really thought dr ross was doing something like this we should probably turn it over to the da and the tax people and let them take it from there but you didnt do that glitsky said why not foley gave it more time than it was worth the simple answer is that mr markham called me off the next day before i could do anything he said hed confronted dr ross directly their friendship demanded it ross told him he should have shared the good news with him when it happened but the money for the plane had come in unexpectedly from his wifes side of the family an aunt or somebody had died suddenly and left them a pile a morning breeze kicked up a small cloud of dust and car exhaust and they all turned against it hardy had his hands in his pockets he turned to the corporate counsel and when you stopped laughing what did you do then i didnt do anything id been called off and you believed him markham that wasnt the question but glitsky had no stomach for this pattycake well heres one mr foley what did you really think what do you think now the poor mans face had flushed a deep red hardy thought his blood pressure might make his ears bleed any minute and it took nearly ten seconds for him to frame his response i have no proof of any wrongdoing you understand im not accusing anybody of anything i want to make that clear just like you didnt accuse anybody of bugging your office hardy asked mildly and yet here we are a quarter mile away we dont care how you justify it tell us what you think this took less time by far ross had something on markham as well maybe some shady stuff they both pulled together when we were starting out i dont know maybe something even before that in any case he threatened to expose markham and they got to a stalemate and he heard the original latenight conversation between you and markham because the offices are bugged glitskys scar was tight through his lips thats what i assume how come you havent swept the place this time foleys look conveyed the impossibility of that especially now if ross had ordered the bugging and was now running the whole show you get on dr rosss wrong side at work bad things start happening to you he said then added by way of rationalization ive got a family to think about there it was again hardy thought that sad and familiar refrain today certainly was turning into a day for clichesfirst andreotti just following orders now foley and his family for an instant the question of what he was made of flitted into hardys own consciousness why was he here without a client on the wrong side for a defense attorney at some threat to his own peace if not his physical safety he couldnt come up with a ready answer but he knew one thinghe wasnt going to hide behind his family or his job he was doing what he had to do that was what it came down to it seemed like the right thing that was enough hardy was still tagging along while glitsky was trying to get his next warrant signed judge leo chomorro was the oncall judge reviewing warrants today and this turned out to be extremely bad luck he wouldnt sign a warrant to search rosss house or place of business a swarthy brushcut squarefaced aztec chieftain chomorro had ruined plenty of hardys days in the past and more than a few of glitskys but this wasnt personal this was the law im not putting my hand to one more warrant on this case where probable cause is thin and getting thinner ive been pressured and finagled and just plain bullshat these past few days issuing warrants for everybody and their brother and sister who might have had a motive to kill somebody at portola hospital that doctor you thought did it last week lieutenant you remember or that nurse who might have poisoned half the county and then last night marlene telling me that the secretary had a motive too that wasnt my office i chomorro held up a warning hand i dont care probable cause lieutenant do these words ring a bell i dont sign a search warrant which i might remind you is a tremendous invasion upon the rights of any citizen unless there is probable cause which means some real evidence that they were at least in the same time zone in which the crime was committed when it was committed and left something behind that might prove it glitsky swallowed his pride thats what we hope to find with a warrant your honor but youve got to have at least some before you can look for more those are the rules and you know them as well as i do and if you dontchomorro turned a lightning bolt of a finger toward hardyill lay odds your defense attorney friend here is intimately familiar with every single picky little rule of criminal procedure and im sure hed be glad to bring you up to date to say nothing of the fact that the named party on this affidavit isnt some schmo with no rights and no lawyer but the chief executive officer of one of this citys main contractors you are way off base here lieutenant even asking your honor against the odds hardy thought he would try to help dr ross is the answer to the most basic question in a murder investigation cui bono not only does he take over mr markhams salary and position chomorro didnt quite explode but close dont you presume to lecture me on the law mr hardy or in this example some mystery writers fantasy of what murder cases are all about i know all about cui bono and if youre to the point where you believe that a smattering of legal latin is going to pass for evidence in this jurisdiction youd be well advised to get in another line of work am i making myself clear to you both he was frankly glaring now at the end of any semblance of patience find more or no warrant and thats final i wish he wasnt a judge somehow magically the peanuts had reappeared in glitskys desk drawer and hardy had a small pile of shells going id kill him dead dont let him being a judge stop you its no worse killing a judge than any other citizen if your minds set on it i say go for it im the head of homicide after all i bet i could lose most of the evidence no weve done that when we havent even been trying imagine if we worked at iti could lose all of it and you heard his honorno evidence no warrant i might not even get to arrest you although id hate to miss that part maybe i could arrest you then have to release you for lack of evidence hardy cracked another shell popped the nut thats the longest consecutive bunch of words youve ever strung together when i was in high school i did the friends romans countrymen speech in julius caesar that was way more words but you didnt make them up theres a difference glitsky shrugged not that much youd be surprised you were mark antony another shrug it was a liberal school then next year we did othello and they wouldnt let me do him because he was black did you point out to them that you were black too i thought they might have seen it on their own but i guess not so you were discriminated against must have been it couldnt have been just somebody else was better for the part bite your tongue if you didnt get the part and you were black then thats why go no further the truth shall set you free how long have you lived in san francisco anyway that ive still got to tell you the rules i bet even after all this time you could sue somebody for pain and suffering and get rich i could write up the papers for you and maybe i could get rich too you would have been a great othello i bet freshman year i didnt get shylock either and im halfjewish hardy clucked no wonder you became a cop to fight injustice well glitsky deadpanned it was either that or girls liked the uniform your school did a lot of shakespeare glitsky slowly savored a peanut it was a different era he said the old days rajan bhutan gripped the telephone receiver as if his life depended upon it he sat at the small square table in his kitchen that he used for eating and reading for his jigsaw puzzles and bridge games this evening the tabletop was bare except for a drinking glass that hed filled with tap water against the thirst that he knew would threaten to choke off his words when he began to speak since chatterjee had died he had been continually downsizing winnowing out the superficialities most people lived with and even felt they needed now the simplicity of his life was monastic the tworoom studio apartment in which he lived was at the intersection of cole and frederick within walking distance of portola it consisted of a tiny dark bedroom and a slightly largerthough no one would call it largekitchen the only entrance to the unit was a single door without an entryway of any kind the framing itself was flush to the stucco outside and all but invisible painted a cracked and peeling red and seemingly stuck willynilly onto the side of the fourstory apartment building the door itself might have been the trompe loeil work of a talented artist with a sense of humor because of the slope of the street most of the studio itself was actually below street level and this made the place perennially cold dark and damp rajan didnt mind rent control would keep the place under seven hundred dollars for at least several more years he had a hot plate for cooking his rice and onepot curries the plumbing was actually quite good there was regular hot water in the kitchen sink and in the walkin shower the toilet flushed the half refrigerator stuffed under the formica countertop on the windowless front wall held enough vegetables to last a week sometimes more a portable space heater helped in the mornings now as the first ring sounded through the phone he raised his head to the one window covered with a yellowing muslin cloth outside it wouldnt be dark for another hour or more but the shade cast by his own building had already cloaked the block in dusk a couple walked by laughing and he could make out the silhouettes of their legs as they passedat this point the bottom of the window was no more than twenty inches above the sidewalk the muscles around his mouth twitched either with nerves or with something like the sense memory of what smiling had been like a tiny movement on the formica counter drew his gaze therea cockroach crossing the chessboard for a year now hed been enjoying the same game conducted by mail with chatterjees father in delhi he thought in another two movesmaybe less than a monthhe could force a stalemate when for a long while it looked as though hed be checkmated he believed that a stalemate was far preferable to a defeatthose who disagreed with him he felt missed the point the phone rang again he ran his other hand over the various grains of the table which was his one indulgence he had always loved woodshe and chatterjee had done their apartment mostly in teak from the scandinavian factory stores cheap and durable he had loved the lightness the feel of it the grain they used a sandalwood oil rub that he could still smell sometimes when he meditated but he had changed now over the years and this table was something altogether differentit was a game table of some mixed dark hardwoods laid in a herringbone fashion each place had a drawer built into the righthand corner which players could pull out and rest drinks upon he hosted his bridge group every four weeks and the other three men admired the sturdy utilitarian practical design hello ross residence hello is dr malachi ross at home if you please may i tell him whos calling my name is rajan bhutan he may not know me but please tell him that i am a nurse at portola hospital attached to the intensive care unit he might remember the name it is most urgent that we speak just a moment please another wait rajan closed his eyes and tried to will his mind into a calm state it would not do not at all to sound frightened or nervous he was simply conveying information and an offer he straightened his back in his chair drawing a long and deep breath down into the center of his body he let it rest there until it became warm and he could release it slowly he took a sip of water swallowed cleared his throat this is dr ross who is this again please dr ross i am rajan bhutan from portola hospital perhaps you remember i was in the icu with dr kensing when mr markham died i am sorry to bother you at home how did you get my home phone number he asked its unlisted it can be found if its needed if one knows where to look after a short silence ross sounded slightly cautious all right how can i help you the maid said it was urgent rajan reached for the water again and drank quickly it is that i need to speak with you frankly are you in a place you can talk freely rosss tone kissed the bounds of aggressiveness whats this about it is something we need to discuss thats what were doing now but im afraid i dont have too much more time my wife and i are going out in a few minutes if it can wait no im sorry but it cannot it has to be now or i will speak to the police on my own after a short pause ross said just a minute rajan heard his footsteps retreating a door closing the steps coming back all right im listening but make it fast as you may know the police are looking into the deaths now of several patients at the icu that they are calling homicides of course ive heard about that i run the company ive been monitoring it closely but that has nothing to do with me personally im afraid it has instead to do with me doctor the police have talked to me more than once i am the only nurse who has worked the shifts when several of the deaths have occurred i think they will decide i have killed these people he listened while ross took a couple of breaths then if you did youll get no sympathy from me no i would not expect that no more than you would get it from me if they charged you with killing mr markham or the others this time the pause lasted several seconds what are you saying i think you know what i am saying we would not be talking still if you did not know i saw you you saw me what i dont know what youre talking about please doctor please rajan said he could feel his throat catching and reached for the water we dont need to waste time in denials we dont have time instead i have a proposal for you you do how amusing youve obviously got an agile mind mr bhutan so id be curious to hear what it was although your premise is fatally flawed if it is we shall see my idea is only thisyou may remember the day after christmas four months ago when you did a dropin at the icu is that still familiar to you i was on that shift and there was a patient named shirley watrous and the police think you killed her is that it rajan ignored the question but you were there with me i keep a daily diary but also i remember you and i had a pleasant discussion about working during the holiday season people dont like it but it is in many ways preferable to the family obligations and raised expectations you may remember maybe i do but whats your point was that the day after christmas i dont remember that but you must you see im hanging up now ross said but he did not and rajan went on i didnt even realize what you were doing of course and then the police told me the names of some of the others and i realized youd been there for all of them and what youd done i feel like a fool really perhaps i always knew but how could one in my place ever even suggest that you were doingwhat you were doing i not even a doctor and who was to say it was the wrong thing to put these people beyond pain even if i had been sure no one even questioned the deaths before so how could i accuse you when everyone else seemed to take these things for granted rajans clipped tones were speeding up and he forced himself to slow down then when i saw you with mr markhams iv i thought again i must have been wrong i did not want to know i was too afraid to say anything then i was afraid because i had not said anything sooner but now i am most afraid of all because i know if i accuse you you will accuse me but i was not at the hospital for all these killings and i know you had to be because you did them he was at the end he closed his eyes for the strength to finish so please doctor please you must tell the police i was with you when these people died you will be my alibi and of course i shall be yours you cant be serious rosss tone was harsh filled with disbelief and even outrage but he was still on the line rajan had seen similar bluster among the vanquished during bridge tournaments and even chess games when in fact they had known all was lost your nerve amazes me mr bhutan are you sure thats all you want no not quite im afraid i will have to be leaving the country soon so i will also need to have fifty thousand dollars please tonight in cash panic was the devil ross had a core belief that it was a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate acts his great talent he sometimes thought was in recognizing the desperation of others emergency at the office he told nancy something to do with an audit yeah even friday night these people worked all the time he had to go in but hed make it up to her tell the sullivans he was sorryto make up for the lastminute cancellation of their dinner date maybe theyd fly them all up to tahoe next weekend in his office behind the locked door he was pulling the tenth pitiable little stack of bills out of his safe this man bhutanhe shook his head almost smiling at the mans naivete fifty thousand dollars for what he knew that was yet another problem with most peoplevery few had a clue about value if it were ross it would have been ten times that and a bargain at the price but perhaps bhutan really was being shrewd if he accused ross ross would indeed accuse him but that would lead to awkward questions about why he had not spoken up sooner just for a moment he stood stockstill trying to remember he had been alone in the room he was certain bhutan had not come in until he was done could he really have seen him from the hall seen him without being seen not that it was going to matter he couldnt take the chance that bhutan would panic and talk to the police despite being paid or not panic and decide he needed more money or just do something stupid and give them both away and if bhutan was bluffing if he really hadnt clearly seen ross at the iv so much the worse for him he actually presented an excellent opportunity to resolve this increasingly sticky problem the bills would be back in here by tomorrow morning although he would miss owning what he called his bond gun there was a certain charm in the walther ppk that his father had chanced upon in a downtown gutter one evening and had eventually given to him he loved the secret sense of sin it gave him the thrill of private power carla had brought it all upon herself i know what youve been doing she told him in the hospital that morning he was almost certain that she was referring to his second source of income the kickbacks but it might have been the other the patients hed had a sense that tim was closing in on that somehow checking his dropin dates at the hospital asking questions he must have thought were subtle the accident had thrown carla into a panic and under that panic was an insane inflexible resolve there was no mistaking the hysterical edge to her control as hed come up to her in the corridor outside the icu seeing her husband smashed up intubated unconscious had undone her ross walked up to her ready with a comforting hug and some platitudes about bearing up and supporting each other but her eyes had been wild and desperate as she whirled on him dont you dare insult me with your phony sympathy carla what whatever happens here youre finished with us mal with all of this you think this will free you dont you you think this will be the end of it he tried again a comforting hand on her arm dont touch me youre not our friend youre not kidding me anymore youre not tims friend and you neverhave been do you think he hasnt told me what youve been doing well now i know and i will not forget whatever happens to himwhatever happensi promise you i will take you down thats what he wanted thats what he was going to do to save the company from all youve done to destroy it and if its the last thing i do i will see that it happens carla please youre upset you dont know what youre saying but shed kept on sealing her own death sentence even if tim doesnt pull through ill owe it to his memory to take it to the board even to the police after the explicit threat did she think he wouldnt act could she imagine he wouldnt unless he acted swiftly boldly without mercy he was done knowing this and what he had to do ross first had to disarm her he took her hands forcefully in both of his they were eye to eye carla first lets get through this lets get tim through it i have made mistakes and im sorry for them but so have we all i promise you well work it out if i have to leave so be it but never say it has anything to do with our friendship nothing can touch that thats forever the plan presented itself fullblown potassium would leave no trace and the hospitals pms were hopelessly shoddy if the medical examiner hadnt autopsied timand ross had never envisioned thatthe whole plan would have worked he realized that if he could make it appear that carla was distraught enough to kill herself and her family the police would never even look for a murderer he would use the gun tim kept in his home office when he got to the house the upstairs lights were out he wanted the kids to be asleep so he would not have to see them he would do that part in the dark they would feel nothing suspect nothing sleep but carla stood inside the door and at first would notopen it to him theres nothing to talk about mal were all exhausted and at the end we can meet tomorrow but hed worn her down please carla i know tim must have told you some things but we were working them out just like we always have i loved the man i need to explain i need you to understand theres nothing to understand then i need you at least to forgive me and shed paused a last time then unlocked the chain as he entered he took the walther from his pocket and told her they needed to walk quietly to the back of the house now he would do it again he had experience now it had to look like suicide it had to look as though bhutan knowing the police were onto him for all the murders at portola including markhams chose to take the cowards way out that would close all the investigations he also had to make sure no one heard the shot which he supposed would be louder with the walther than tims had been first he would have to distract bhutan then use chloroform to put him out except it would stay in the system long enough to be detected maybe ether he had ether in his medical bag right here that would do as well and of course he could simply shoot him as though it had been a robbery attempt or something but a suicide was far preferable hed have to consider his options on the drive over then play the thing by ear bhutan obviously thought the police were coming to get him at any moment so he wanted fifty thousand dollars tonight he was desperate and being desperate he was doomed to commit foolish acts to make dangerous decisions just like tim for example he couldnt get over tim when theyd both been humping to get the business up and running and thered been so many opportunities to make hay under the tablemuch smaller potatoes than now of course and much of it in soft currencies and perkstheweekends in napa or mexico the fine wines the occasional corporate escorts for the convention parties when the wives couldnt make it tim had willingly enough succumbed to those temptations right along with him but the first hard money payoff had scared him off this he thought was wrong where to ross it was no different than what theyd been doing in fact it was better but tim always wanted to believe that somewhere inside he was essentially an honest and good person the fool hence all the agony hed put himself through over wanting to schtup the admittedly sexy ann kensing ross couldnt believe that the guy had nearly ruined his life over what should have been at most a playful dalliance but no hed been in love whatever that meant stupid stupid but not as stupid as letting himself believe that just because tim had decided not to take anybodys dirty money ross was going to do the same thing oh sure tim had had his little crisis of conscience all those years ago and had come to ross saying they had to stopnot just because it threatened the health of patients and the company but because it was wrong and ross had pretended to go along and why not why burden the selfrighteous idiot why split the money with someone who didnt want it ross knew the truth was that he wasnt really harming any patients by taking the odious drug money if tim was happier living with the fiction that ross had found the lord with him hed let him enjoy his fantasy but then even while tim was sleeping around on his wife he discovered rosss brilliantly conceived fraudulent billings and could not believe that his longtime partner and medical director still cheated and took kickbacks his whining selfrighteousness made ross puke what a hypocrite tim was coming to ross in handwringing desperationwhat should he do what should he do it had come to his attention and so on and so forth didnt ross understand tim had asked him hed crossed the line where now tim had to do something now had to act andthe conflict was ripping him upross had been his friend for so long their families blah blah blah but even in the face of this direct threat ross remained calm and told tim that of he felt compelled to accuse him publicly of criminal behavior that ross would have no choice but to point the finger back at him they would both then be ruined and who would that serve stalemate but he knew that tim was a time bomb eventually he would force the issue again and again ross would parryit was the same with ann and carla and ann again and carla again but ross would not panic he would calmly wait while tim vacillated and if something did not change as it often did then ross would eventually have to find a permanent way out a permanent solution and then tim was suddenly delivered to him on the edge of death needing only a push that no one should ever see to send him over he kissed nancy at the door told the kids to be good in the circular driveway he spontaneously decided to take the old toyota bhutans address was in the haight and he didnt want to drive one of the good cars which would only be magnets for the vandals the old green heap would get him there and attract no attention and thats what the situation demanded throwing the briefcase onto the seat beside him he pulled out into the traffic and adjusted the visor against the rays of the sun as it cleared the thin cloud layer above the horizon and sprayed the street in a golden glow as ross drove by the door threw him off at first what kind of place did this guy live in if it was just the door and the window down almost at the sidewalk level the apartment didnt look to be much bigger than a closet no space to swallow the sound of the shot fortunately there was no lobby he could simply knock and walk in take care of his business then walk out with relative impunity nevertheless his heart was pounding much like when hed gone to see carla this was a necessary business but he couldnt deny the adrenaline rush he finally parked a block and a half down and across the street now in the last minutes of daylight he tried to envision rajan bhutan he must have met him dozens of times in the hospital of course but he hadnt paid too much if any attention if he had any impression of him at all it was of a quiet man of very slight stature if so ross could subdue him easily if he could maintain an element of surprise but what was he going to do about the ether rajan the nurse would be intimately familiar with the smell might pick it up as soon as he opened the door if ross had already opened the bottle poured it into the gauze stuffed it into his jacket pocket and how would he get behind the man that seemed crucial there was no hurry he told himself hed gotten the call no more than an hour before then had made noises about fifty thousand dollars being difficult to get ahold of in such a short time but bhutan hadnt bought that told him to figure some way to get it and then be at his address by nine or he would call the police ross looked at his watch again it was ten to eight he had all the time in the world he held his hands out in front of him and looked at them for a long time no trace of the shaking that had plagued him afterward with tim and then with carla he was actually looking forward to the moment this lastminute planning even had a little bit of the quality of a game it was amazing how easily the man had delivered himself up to him a phone call then one decisive act and his problems would be over and suddenly as he was sitting there as he knew it would as it always did when he really needed it the solution came to him he had been trying to be too clever by half there would be no need for ether no surprise as soon as he was inside he would simply brandish the gun and control events from there sit down mr bhutan spread your palm against your temple a little more distance between the fingers please so that i can put the end of the barrel right up against the hairline where it ought to be thank you goodbye smiling to himself he took the bottle of ether out of his pocket and put it and the gauze back in his medical bag the gun was in his right pocket small and concealed he reached for the briefcase opened the door stepped out onto the sidewalk the dusk was advancing rapidly now a light shone inside the low window but there was no light over the door which was to the good he stopped and stood still for a few seconds then proceeded uphill to frederick where his street deadended he crossed to bhutans side now on the uphill corner he could see beyond his car down the hill and in both directions on frederick the cross street a few cars were parked up and down both sides of the street but there wasnt a pedestrian in sight he walked past the window once leaning over to glance inside it was covered with a cheap cloth he could see through when he got close and there waiting alone inside at a table he saw bhutan he remembered him now a nonentity he stood another instant at the door savoring the power it was time it had been a long hour and then some rajan felt himself nearly crying with fear and apprehension when the knock came at the door he picked up his water and sipped so he would be able to speak then put the glass down on the table wiped his hands on his pants legs said come in please its open he almost expected malachi ross to look somehow different but it was the same man whod appeared at the hospital so frequently over the past couple of years tall and thin controlled and commanding ross exuded a quiet terrible power in the halls of portola as soon as he was through the door rajan felt that physical force in the room his bowels roiled within him and it occurred to him that this might not work that it had been a mistake he might not be able to pull it off ross closed the door behind him and took in the tiny room with a dismissive glance you live here there is another room rajan replied defensively indicating his darkened bedroom through the open doorway i have simple needs apparently ross still stood by the door he held a briefcase and rajan pointed to it have you broughthis throat caughtthe money this holding up the briefcase the man seemed almost to be enjoying himself which rajan could not imagine how much was it again he knew that ross was playing with him but he didnt know the rules of this game fifty thousand dollars and im giving this to you because why maybe you could refresh my memory it does not matter you know why thats why you have come here maybe not though maybe not the reason you think rajans eyes raked the rooms walls he reached for his water again and drank quickly ross crossed the room in two steps and pulled a chair out from under the table you seem nervous rajan are you nervous a little bit yes its not quite the same as making threats over the telephone is it you and me here together one on one ross placed the briefcase between them in the middle of the table bhutan tried to answer but no words came he tucked his head down quickly and tried to swallow when he looked up ross was holding a gun in his right hand pointing it at his heart oh dear mother of god he said under his breath ross still spoke in the same conversational tone do you want to know what i find supremely ironic about this situation are you interested id think you would be rajan could only manage a nod his eyes never left the weapon ross continued in almost a playful banter because you see whats funny is that youre afraid that the police are going to arrest you for all those poor sick souls at portola that they think you killed and you want to run dont you because you dont have any defense except to say you didnt do it imagine that ill be the first to admit that it looks bad for you and i dont blame you really but ill tell you something you want to know yes whats that i think youre going to help the police solve this case rajan in fact i know it and why is that i would never tell what reason would i have to say anything ill bet you can figure that out rajan the answer is that you wont need to say anything but the great irony is that after tonight after you kill yourself everyone will know not only that you killed all those patientsall those poor patients who were costing me thousands of dollars a daybut that you also killed tim markham and his family you can take the money back rajans voiced echoed in the tiny space a gun theres no need to use a gun ross pushed his chair back and started to stand up dont move police drop the gun glitsky came out of the darkness and was in the doorway to the bedroom his weapon extended in both hands before him drop it ross froze for an instant turned his head then slowly lowered his hands to the table he dropped the gun the last inch to the wood where it landed with a hollow clunk all right now knock it to the floor all the way rosss eyes never left the weapon that was on him he still had his hands where hed let go of the gun over the table and he reached his right hand back as if to swat it onto the floor glitsky saw his move and perhaps misreading it perhaps lowering his guard for an instant he let the angle of his own weapon drop a half inch ross moved like the strike of a snake he grabbed at the briefcase and with a vicious lunge threw it across the tight space at glitsky who fireda tremendous explosion in the small roomand blew the briefcase open as it hit him knocking the gun from his hand spilling the stacks of money onto the floor plaster from the back wall rained onto the formica countertop another explosion and more plaster dont you move ross had his own gun back in his hands and had fired it at the floor where glitsky had reached for his own get up then kick it over here now rajan was huddled in the corner by the refrigerator ross glanced over at him and told him to get up too then motioned for glitsky to move out of the doorway to the bedroom and into the kitchen itself the medical director was breathing heavily but his eyes were clear and focused he held a gun in each hand now his mouth arced in a tight half smile you guys stung me he said im impressed especially you rajan good work but then the mouth turned into a line of bitter resolve but i see whats going to happen here now you cop you came here to arrest mr bhutan and he decided that he wasnt going without a fight so it looks like theres going to be a shootout here after all and sadly neither of you are going to survive still stuck where hed been all along standing behind the wall in the darkened bedroom hardy had no choice there was no way he could predict when ross might take the first shot at one of the two of them he had to move first and fast the light switches were next to the door and he was right there he reached up and flicked the switch down plunging the apartment into total darkness and it seemed immediately into deafening sound as well he dropped to the floor and counted four shots in an impossible succession running together almost as one within the first heartbeat then the sickening and unmistakable crunch of a body ramming into another one and taking the wind outhnnhslamming it back into something immovable and accompanied by the crash of more breakage another explosive shot then a further struggle before a final crash a hollow thumping sound and glitskys voice almost unrecognizable but clearly his yelling lights diz lights which he hit just in time for the front door to slam open and braccos form to appear in it gun drawn hands extended turning the light off and then on was the signal theyd worked out for reinforcement then bracco was all the way inside the room fisk behind him with his weapon out as well hardy leaned in adrenaline exhaustion against the frame of the doorway into the bedroom rajan bhutan was still huddled in his corner crying softly his head down on his knees glitsky a gun in each hand had gotten to his feet and was standing unsteadily over the prostrate figure of malachi ross who was bleeding from the nose and mouth turning glitsky handed both the weapons butt end first to bracco then he took an awkward half step backward and stumbled seeming to lose his balance hardy took a step toward him abe are you glitsky turned to him and opened his mouth to speak but a trickle of blood was all that came out tracing the line of his scar before he fell again to the floor citytalk by jeffrey elliot the tragic death of the chief of the san francisco homicide department lieutenant abraham glitsky marks a bitter last chapter in the saga of the parnassus medical group and its efforts to remain solvent at no matter what cost to its subscribers and constituency glitsky had been a cop with the city for his entire working life of thirty years in all that time half of it spent in the homicide detail he worked almost ceaselessly in the citys underbelly interrogating often hostile witnesses arresting desperate murderers who would not hesitate to kill again his professional world was filled with violence drugs and disregard for civility and even for life yet the greatest boast of this deeply humble man was that he had never drawn his gun in anger last night for the first time he had to and it killed him he was not working with what the police facetiously call a nohumansinvolved case where everyone involved whether as witness or suspect already has a substantial criminal record in fact his killer was a classic whitecollar businessman who had been the subject of a recent column in this spacethe ceo of parnassus health dr malachi ross glitskys investigation which had begun with the death of tim markham rosss predecessor in the icu of portola hospital had grown to encompass the murders of markhams family and then most unexpectedly numerous other terminally ill patients over the course of a year or more at portola dr ross now sits in jail allegedly the murderer of all of these people and of lieutenant glitsky glitsky was a personal friend of this reporter he did not drink or swear he liked football music and reading he had a dry sense of humor and an acerbic wit informed by a wideranging intelligence beneath a carefully cultivated somewhat intimidating persona he was the soul of compassion to the friends and families of victims a firm yet flexible boss to his colleagues in homicide and a paragon of honesty and fairdealing within the legal community halfjewish and halfblack he was well aware of the sting of discrimination yet it did not color his judgments nor his commitment to due process he treated everyone the same fairly he was justly proud of the way he did his job he will be sorely missed he is survived by his father nat his three sons isaac jacob and orel his wife treya ghent and his stepdaughter lorraine funeral services are the phone jarred elliot from his words his weary eyes scanned back a few graphs realizing that it wasnt nearly enough it didnt capture the way glitsky was the essence of him the force hed been to those who had known him he looked at his watchit was nearly one in the morning he had another hour until he had to submit this copy instead of the other column hed written this afternoon maybe he could pull the file for an anecdote or two maybe a picture if they had one of him with something resembling a smilehighly unlikely he knewanyway something to humanize him more the telephone rang a second timenot picking up wouldnt help wouldnt change anything one way or the other he grabbed at ithardy whats the word he asked on the following tuesday morning hardy sat in the police commissioners hearing room kittycorner from marlene ashs place at the podium he raised his head and saw the clouds scudding by outside and thought them somehow fitting it was going to be a cold spring probably a cold summer he was going to take a sabbatical for a couple of months after the school year ended rent an rv with frannie and the kids drive all the way to alaska and back camping he was going to fish and hike and take some time because you never knew how much you were going to have things could end abruptly he needed to think about that to do something about it im sorry what was the question again the events that led to lieutenant glitskys presence at mr bhutans apartment okay he spoke directly to the grand jurors assembled before him as ive said and as ms ash has explained id been working independently but in a parallel arrangement with the district attorney on elements of the portola homicides i had obtained access to some documents that mr markham had written and following up on those asked lieutenant glitsky to join me in the course of the morning we spoke to mike andreotti the administrator at portola and then the parnassus corporate counsel patrick foley lieutenant glitsky thought we had enough information to obtain a search warrant for dr rosss housespecifically he wanted to confiscate his clothing and deliver it to the police lab to check for trace amounts of mrs markhams blood whichas i understand itallegedly did turn up on one of his suits but glitsky was unable to obtain a warrant with the information we had at that time lieutenant glitsky returned to his duties as chief of homicide he couldnt lawfully pursue dr ross without more i was on my own for the rest of the day during our talk with mr andreotti i had conceived the notion that dr ross may also have been at portola and had a hand in the homicides on what wed been calling dr kensings listterminal patients who had unexpectedly died there in the past year or so another suspect for those homicides was a nurse at portola named rajan bhutan mr bhutan appeared to have been the only person with opportunities for these multiple deaths and with a reason to have killed themeuthanasia his wife died several years ago after a long illness and inspectors had noted that for a nurse he appeared suspiciously oversensitive to suffering the police had interviewed bhutan but the lieutenant and i agreed that i should do another interview perhaps i would be less threatening since i was not a police officer in any event i asked glitsky if i could talk to him and he gave me his permission and mr bhutans home address and phone number i went to bhutans house after work as i hoped he finally voiced suspicions about dr ross he also admitted to a very great fear that the police would try to blame him for the murders it became clear that dr ross had been at portola quite frequently and at least on several other dates when the homicides were suspected to have occurred at that point i thought it might be worthwhile to try and force dr rosss hand because of some other information wed gathered i suspected he had large amounts of cash on hand at his house i enlisted mr bhutans aid to pretend to blackmail him to see if we could lure him out and make him come to us reliving it hardy now hung his head ran a hand over his brow in hindsight this was probably a mistake i should have simply taperecorded mr bhutans original phone call which would probably have been enough for judge chomorro to sign a search warrant but i didnt do that instead mr bhutan made the call when it seemed to work i called lieutenant glitsky who arrived there with inspectors bracco and fisk within about a half hour i want to add that both lieutenant glitsky and the other inspectors were upset with and vehemently opposed to my plan the lieutenant actually predicted that dr ross if guilty would become unpredictable and violent he was very unwilling to involve a nonprofessional such as mr bhutan in such a situation nevertheless since events had already been set in motion and since mr bhutan was not only willing but eager to participate we went ahead there seemed no way to halt events without ruining whatever chance remained to force rosss hand so lieutenant glitsky and i waited in the darkened bedroom just off the kitchen while inspectors bracco and fisk were stationed in their car around the corner with instructions to come running when the lights went on and off he shrugged miserably the plan seemed reasonable and not excessively risky but i did not contemplate that dr ross would act so quickly in fact had mr bhutan not found a way to mention the gun out loud without giving away our presence and had lieutenant glitsky not acted so quickly though at great cost to himself mr bhutan might have been killed a week later after hours coming out of a client conference in the solarium in freemans office hardy was surprised by the appearance of harlen fisk waiting in an awkward stance by phylliss receptionist station the chubby freshfaced inspector looked not much older than twenty he seemed uncomfortable nearly starting at the sight of hardy then bustling over to shake his hand i just wanted to tell you he said after theyd gone up to hardys office that im going to be leaving the department im really not cut out to be a cop not the way darrel is anyway or the lieutenant i dont know if you heard but darrels starting over in a uniform again with motorcycles my aunts offered to find me something in her office but im not going to go that way people seem to resent it somehow thats a good call hardy said anyway ive got some friends with venture capital and they think id be valuable to them in some way id like to give something like that a go be in business for myself be myself in fact you know what i mean hardy with no idea in the world why fisk was telling him any of this answered with a neutral smile always a good idea is there anything i can do for you well you know fisk sighed i had hoped that id be able to find something on the car that killed mr markham i know people always were laughing at me but i really thought for sure thered be some connection and id show them but you were the one person who took me seriously who listened took a look at my dodge dart list even asked for a copy i just wanted to let you know i appreciated it the kid was going to be a great politician hardy thought every connection was a chance to make a friend make an impression trade a favor i thought it might lead somewhere itself harlen well thats the last thing i wanted you to know that it didnt i checked out every one of the twentythree cars in the city there were really only twenty three were nowhere to be found i just thought youd want to know how it ended i appreciate it hardy said your new company needs a lawyer look me up you do business law too sometimes im not proud okay well fisk stuck out his hand nice to have worked with you at the door he turned back one more time nobody blames you you know in case you thought they did the trail led hardy to one of the housing projects apartment house boxes in the western additionthreestory blocks of concrete and stucco once bright and now the color of piss where the graffiti didnt cover it as he expected nobody knew nothin but he knew that elsi court apartment d was the last known address for luz lopez who had been the registered owner of one of fisks missing three dodge darts finally he convinced one of the neighbor women that he wasnt a cop that he was in fact with the insurance company and was trying to locate luz so that he could send her some money about her child she had moved away the neighbor didnt know where one morning maybe three weeks ago she had just left early and never come back though the neighbor thought she had worked at the osaka hotel for years maybe they had a forwarding address for her the car yes it was green the bumper sticker said finata hardy did some research on the net finata had been an agricultural reform movement in el salvador where ten percent of the population owned ninety percent of the land about ten years before finata had been a radical government plan for redistributing the wealth in that country but its supporters had mostly been killed or driven out shed come here with her son he reasoned and then parnassus had killed him markham as the spokesman for the company had taken the public responsibility for the boys death though hardy knew it had been ross but to luz lopez markham had killed her boy powerless povertystricken and alien she probably felt she had no recourse to the law the law would never touch such a powerful man but she could avenge her babys death herself she could run over the greedy unfeeling uncaring smiling bastard it was four oclock a saturday afternoon the second day of june outside the sun shone brightly and a cold north wind blew but it was warm inside the shamrock where hardy was hosting a private party the bar was packed to capacity with city workers cops lawyers judges reporters assorted wellwishers and their children theyd pulled in sawhorses from the back and laid plywood across them to make a long table down the center of the room there were going to be a few minutes of presents and testimonials then no agenda except to enjoy the two guys in wheelchairs were at the head of the table back by the sofas jeff elliots was the first gift and he banged on his glass to get the place quieted down mcguire turned off the jukebox right in the middle of the song hardy had bought for the occasionit was the only disco song on the box gloria gaynors i will survive i think this is only appropriate elliot said handing the flat package across the table what is this glitsky asked its the page proof of the citytalk column i was in the middle of writing when it looked good that you were going to die its a pack of lies i wasnt ever going to die i was just resting it was a fatiguing case well you had a lot of us fooled then at the shouted requests glitsky held the framed page up for the amusement of the crowd and everyone broke into applause hardy frannie and treya sat around the far end of the table the wheelchair is a bit much dont you think hardy asked he was walking fine yesterday at your place hes not supposed to exert himself for another few weeks frannie said doctors orders treya added then whispered leaning over the fool was trying situps last week and ripped open one of the scabs situps how manyd he do hardy asked dismas frannie on his case eight the fool hardy shook his head in disgust only eight and he busts his gut he looked down the table glad as hell to see his best friend sitting there in whatever condition he might be what a wimp the trip took luz thirteen days it amazed her that after so much time she could still find the house shed grown up in that was because things made sense here not like in san francisco she had turned from the highway and come up through the town one of the first things she saw gave her some hope they had rebuilt the building where the newspaper had been from which they had dragged her father the last time shed seen it it had been a burntout shell but no one seeing it now would ever suspect that then her brothers clinic albertos old clinic it was still there in the same place looking well cared for with the bright flowers planted all around she didnt remember those if they had been there when shed gone there were a few cars in the lot out in front people going in to see a doctor they knew one they could trust she felt a sharp stab of regret but she didnt want to let herself start thinking this way again she had struggled for months to see that the bitterness was for the most part behind her now purged in the tears and finally in the taking of that pigs life who had cost her son his now although the loss of ramiro would never cease to ache in her chest she could imagine someday coming to a kind of peace with it all it all might have been to teach her something she might not have seen on her own there was only this life and she had squandered a decade of it trying to fit into that foreign place ignoring her own happiness and trying to make something that would be better for her boy but what had come of that demeaning work a life she did not enjoy for one day and never would a boy who never knew the joy of a family of the love of his father a pain with no sides she was thirtytwo years old and a graduate of the university there was she knew work to do here in el salvador not only family work starting over with jose perhapsbut work with the people to make this land theirs this was where she would make her stand her mothers house had grown young the banana trees now grew nearly wild over the porch hiding it in blessed shade the paint was fresh the screens fixed tightly to the doors and windows she had not called here since shed left they would be worried sick she had just been driving surviving to get here through california mexico guatemala the borders and guardia and men but she had made it to here now and she stopped the car after all the breakdowns in san francisco whenever she really needed it the car had finally been fuerte when it mattered she pulled to the side of the road getting out stretching she was aware that she stunk she did not care it didnt matter she wasnt in the us anymore there was a motor going somewhere in the back and she walked around the house to the sound of it josestrong silent ugly josehad his shirt off working over the generator they still used most of the time for their electricity after all these years she still knew his body standing ten feet from him now in the saw grass she waited in a kind of hysterical suspense how badly did the scars show on her had she changed beyond his recognition and if he did know who she was would he still love her would she love him suddenly the noise stopped he straightened up wiped his forehead with a bandanna then saw her for a long moment nothing in the world moved then his face broke into the smile of his youth he held out his arms took a step toward her and she ran to his embrace john lescroart john lescroart the new york times bestselling author of such novels as the mercy rule the th juror nothing but the truth and
