the dealer and the dead gerald seymour prologue they were right and he knew it but he could not admit it to them petars boy had started had nagged at it then tomislavs son had taken it up and now it was andrijas cousin who voiced the obvious we are here too long sir we should have been well gone sir we have to accept it it is in our faces and an idiot could see it the respect they showed him waned with each minute they stayed huddled and bent low trying to find some minimal shelter from the rain the corn which had ripened two months before and had not of course been harvested offered no refuge from the cold and wet that engulfed them they respected him because he had taught them basic lessons at the villages school adding and subtracting writing and reading with a degree of discipline he sensed that their respect had almost run its course but he would not admit to them that they were right and he was wrong we stay he said they will come they promised they would i have their word as the schoolteacher in the village zoran was a person of status if there had been a resident priest the teacher would have had second place but they shared a priest with other small communities if the land around their village had been administered and worked by a collective zoran would have lagged behind its manager but the strip fields had escaped the centralisation of the old regime and were farmed by individuals they waited on a path between petars crops near to the vuka river zoran was wrong because now he could see the men who challenged his authority not clearly in detail but he recognised their shapes and shadow movements he knew which was petars son and tomislavs and which was andrijas cousin he could see them because the dawn was coming slowly because of the deluge of rain they should not be on the path after first light they called it the kukuruzni put and knew it was an act of suicide to be moving on the cornfield road without the cover of darkness but he demanded that they wait if anyone stood at full height and peered to the west through the drooping tips of the corn they would have seen the constant light over the town that was perhaps five kilometres down the cornfield road the brightness was from the many fires that the incendiary shells had lit if they stayed crouched with their faces a few centimetres from the mud and cupped their selfrolled cigarettes in their palms they still could not escape the rumble of the big howitzer guns the explosions intensifying because a new day always started with a barrage of destruction were muffled if the firing came from across the danube and aimed at the heart of the town loud if the targets were the villages of marinci and bogdanovci and shatteringly clear if the shells came down on their own homes when the closest shells detonated each man shuddered or winced zoran thought of his wife and the young men of their fathers petar and tomislav andrijas cousin thought of maria and andrija in their cellar for almost three months the cornfield road had been the lifeline for the town and three villages that straddled it the men and women who defended them accepted that when this last route was cut the siege would end and resistance would collapse zoran could have berated them for smoking for allowing the smell of burned tobacco to waft in the wind but did not it was hard for him to believe they would not come he strained his eyes to search for the tiny torch beam that would show his trust had been well placed he tried to shut out the murmurs of the men with him and listen for the squelch of boots among the collapsed corn he saw nothing but the vivid brightness of the fires in the town and heard only the complaints of those he had brought with him listen old man are you wanting us all dead they arent coming they would have been here by now if they were twentyfour days ago he had walked fast down that path then the cetniks the yugoslav military and arkans scum had been further back now they were closer and had snipers with nightvision gear who watched the gaps where the crop had failed artillery and mortars were used at random and it was only possible to cross the fields at night wait a little longer they promised theyd come he gave me his word twentyfour days earlier clutching a weighted briefcase zoran had negotiated the path through the corn and travelled with the hope and sacrifice of the village stuffed into the frayed leather case that had once held classroom notes and textbooks telephone lines were long cut and the enemy listened routinely to the motorola radios he had left the village and gone through the lines and into the comparative safety of vinkovci then had taken a taxi to the embryo capital of his country in zagreb a city of bright streetlights restaurants serving hot food and bars where beer was drunk he had met a nephew who worked in the fledgling ministry of defence he had been told it was inconceivable that an arms shipment would be sent for his village alone and not the town on the bend of the great river then his nephew had sat forward eyes darting from side to side checking they would not be overheard and had murmured that reinforcements and resources would be directed to the front line nearer to the city the price of a ceasefire on all sectors was the fall of the town and their part of eastern slavonia his nephew had slipped a piece of folded paper into his hand saying that zoran was in his prayers when his nephew had gone zoran saw a kind of normality around him but the people in the cafe had no comprehension of the lives of their fellow countrymen beyond vinkovci in the town and the villages he opened the paper to find a name and a telephone number with an international code he had gone to the telephone booth by the door to the toilets and dialled his call was answered he had lingered in the city for two days unable to learn anything about the siege on the danube he had hated the place had felt a stranger among his own the bombardment of dubrovnik had attracted international headlines but not the struggle for his village the others and the town he believed his nephew from the ministry of defence they had been abandoned he had met a man he had placed an order spelled it out and had half expected a croak of derision the answer no problem bolder he had said when the order must be delivered and to where the response no problem last he had unfastened the briefcase shown the man its contents and explained that this represented the total wealth of the village the reply you have nothing to worry about and thats a promise he had watched the man go away down the street past the big statue in the square and towards a taxi rank he had bent to get into the back seat then looked back when he saw that zoran was still watching him he had waved then was lost in the traffic zoran had gone home on the bus to vinkovci on foot along the cornfield road to the village that had been the last time the path was used in daylight an hour after he had passed a sniper had killed two men walking wounded from the town and had wounded a medical orderly who had volunteered to work in the towns hospital in the command bunker a concrete pit with a kerosene lamp he had told them what was coming in what quantity and when he had seen scepticism doubt disbelief and had sought to suffocate it he promised he shook my hand he had been back for three weeks the reserve ammunition stocks in the command bunker amounted to a thousand rounds maybe ten bullets for each fighter and a box of a hundred fragmentation grenades they had brought with them two wheelbarrows a large upright prams chassis and a handcart from petars farm he had wondered how many boxes they could move in one trip whether they would need to return the next evening even the ferocity of the rain could not disguise the light to the east where the enemys howitzers fired get it into your head theyre not coming weve been here too long already should have been gone a quarter of an hour ago mother of god you want to stay zoran you stay but im off until then he had been the undisputed leader of the village and its defence now his authority was stripped from him he attempted to reason with them one last time a few more minutes he shook my hand he took as payment what i brought him without them were defeated and dead a clear whistle pierced his skull the sound of an incoming tank mm shell an artillery mm shell and an mm mortar they were all rooted to the spot a flare lit them the whistle became a symphony because three or four shells were in the air when the illumination flare burst the dawn had trapped them a machinegunner fired in the moment before the first shell came down the machinegunner laced the corn with bullets the flare hung poured white light on them zoran saw that tomislavs son and andrijas cousin had crumpled their faces showed shock surprise and then the blandness of death the first mortar detonated zoran dropped and felt the mud ooze against his face since the fight for the town and its satellite villages had started nearly three months before he had seen several men die on the front line in the slit trenches that were reinforced with felled treetrunks two had been speared by timber splinters in the command bunker where there was an area for the wounded men had slipped away with neither fuss nor rancour a cetnik with an unkempt beard had thrown down a jammed rifle as he sprinted towards a strongpoint and had collapsed at the single shot to his chest zoran was on the ground and his breath came hard petars boy who had been slow to learn arithmetic quick to read and a star at football towered over him you fucking obstinate old fool youve killed us it would have been the shards from the fourth mortar bomb that cut him down zoran was trying to assemble an answer that had dignity and logic when the metal shards hit him the flare had died but it was getting light rain dribbled on his face on the blood from his chest stomach and hip the pain in spasms was coming he wished then that he was dead that night he had carried neither a grenade nor a loaded pistol and could not end his life he saw movements in the corn and between his gasps heard stems bent and broken four men they were not regular soldiers but arkans people whom the serbs called the tigers and the croats called the scum the blades of their knives caught the light it was bright enough for them to see that he was alive so he would be kept until last he heard chuckles from the four their knives cutting into flesh and ripping of clothing the tigers always mutilated the dead and the living he heard them cut out the eyeballs then tear trousers to expose the genitalia of the two sons and the cousin then came the castration the forcing open of mouths and the placing of bloodied gristle down the throats he remembered what the young man he had met in zagreb had said you have nothing to worry about and thats a promise a young face and a fresh smile had won his confidence the hands had found him and his ears were filled with the tigers oaths without the weapons he had believed he had bought the village would not survive when its defences fell the cornfield road would be cut and all links to the town in the west broken he screamed the knife went into his eye a promise had been broken he prayed a few silent jumbled words for the release of death at the last he called his wifes name and his second eye was taken out the cold and the rain were on his lower stomach and groin and he had no more cries for his god only her name then a ratcheting scream and a curse on a man who had broken a trust the rain fell hard on the wasted corn crop as the mutilated bodies were dragged towards the river and washed away the blood the wheelbarrows the pram chassis and the handcart were pulled from the path as spoils of war a new day broke and the stranglehold on the town and villages had tightened it choked the defenders and condemned them have a good day mr gillot the girl at the checkin desk handed him his ticket and boarding card thank you he answered and smiled and i hope youve enjoyed your visit the queue snaked back and the flight was about to be called but his smile caused her to ignore the men and women behind him coughing irritably its understated charm usually made people forget what they were supposed to be doing she was quite a pretty girl so he smiled again everyone who knew him said it was bankable ive had an excellent two days in your lovely city and i hope to be back she pushed his passport towards him and made certain that her fingertips brushed his as he took it he liked that and her wideeyed penetrating gaze which was characteristic of the citys girls he left the counter and immediately forgot her harvey gillot walked across the marble surface newly laid of the concourse where the general waited for him there would be time for coffee and a biscuit and then he would shake the older mans cancerscarred hand perhaps hug him at the gate maybe even kiss his cheeks and then be on his way none of that would indicate any fondness for the man whose last command had been to oversee the countrys storage depots and hold the inventory of the stocks kept by the bulgarian military the parting gestures would suggest that the last fortyeight hours had not been wasted but were of financial benefit to both men he reached the general and smiled a hand slipped to his elbow and he was taken to an exclusive lounge there a hand slapped his back gillots smile was important to him far more so than presence twentyfive years ago solly lieberman had identified it young man your smile makes me old solly lieberman whos been everywhere seen everything and met everyone want to trust you its priceless trust young man is the greatest weapon in a brokers arsenal and your smile tells me to trust you im suspicious wary a sceptic and cautious but im disposed to trust you solly lieberman long gone had shaped harvey gillot had taught him that trust was paramount and that his smile clinched the deals that mattered the ones that paid big he wasnt a broker of secondhand cars he didnt buy and sell holidays or property he had no interest in bulgarias agricultural products its burgeoning wine industry or prostituting its girls instead harvey gillot trafficked small arms and ammunition machineguns mortars artillery pieces and the many types of manportable missiles that could be used against buildings armoured vehicles or lowflying fixedwing aircraft or helicopters he bought and sold secure and encrypted communications equipment main battle tanks the lighter reconnaissance types and personnel carriers he was a broker of weapons and the materiel of war not too many people knew of his trade his profile was low and he practised anonymity as an art form the general spoke a little english and fluent russian gillot used some english and a smattering of technical russian but had no bulgarian for the more detailed negotiations of the previous evening at the mirage hotel the generals nephew had interpreted it was still a treasure trove before the dinner the general had taken gillot in a cream mercedes saloon to a depot seventyfive kilometres northwest of the coastal city of burgas during his years in the service of his country he had once governed it many of the men and women now posted to the depot had seemed unaware that he was no longer on bulgarias payroll instead was flogging off the countrys tanks howitzers missiles small arms shells and ammunition he and gillot had toured four great warehouses with a uniformed escort and gillot had realised that little had changed from his previous visit two years before every man he saw from general down to bottlewasher second class was on a cut from the action good quality stuff well kept and stored temperature control to ensure that the warehouses did not overheat the systems in summer or freeze them in winter a good meal served in a corner of numberthree warehouse artillery static and mechanised and a decent wine gillot had drunk little the minimum for politeness sake had kept a clear head and reckoned hed done a good deal it would be cash up front onto covered lorries hidden from view would be loaded one thousand rifles five hundred thousand mm bullets two hundred pkmb machineguns a hundred ags automatic grenade launchers and fifteen hundred mm grenades twentyfive svd dragunov sniper rifles ten s mm artillery pieces odds and sods and five hundred pomz antipersonnel stake mines the figures had been worked and reworked disputed and agreed on a host of paper napkins the general had leaned across the table grasped gillots hand and held it in a vicegrip of trust gillot had said you have nothing to worry about and thats a promise translation was unnecessary the lorries would go from the depot to the burgas docks for loading and before dawn the freighter would edge out of the port head south towards the turkish coast and chug across the black sea the more sensitive cargo buried beneath sacks of vegetables cement or crated furniture parts in the shadowed corner of the world inhabited by harvey gillot where light seldom intruded and was at all times unwelcome trust was the most valued currency he trusted the general about as far as he could have kicked a discarded coke tin and the general trusted him implicitly which was comforting and made for a satisfactory commercial relationship they had drunk their coffee nibbled a biscuit and the flight was called he would return to civilisation with an independent french airline that would take him into lyons they did the hug at the gate and an approximation of a cheek kiss its a pleasure to do business with you general and i like to do business with you you make me laugh you have good stories you are the best company maybe that is as important as your honesty if i did not think you were honest you would be in a rivers silt buried a lebanese is there because he was not honest with me it is good to laugh and to have honesty he went through the gate other than the warmth of his smile there was little to point out harvey gillot as a man of wealth of business acumen of anything remarkable he was in his fortyseventh year he carried a few pounds too many at his waist and his stomach bulged a little over his trouser belt his hair had lost the fresh colour of his youth and there was grey above his ears he walked with a purposeful stride but without the swagger of success that would have attracted the attention of strangers cameras or officials his hair was tidy his shirt clean his suit pressed and his tie subdued he had a full face but not the jowls of excess or the gauntness of abstinence unless he smiled people did not notice him a leather satchel was hooked on his shoulder in it were his electronic notepad a mobile phone and three pairs of socks he had washed for himself in his hotel bathroom two crumpled shirts a set of used underwear an ipod loaded with easylistening light classical a pair of cotton pyjamas and his washbag that was how he travelled he had no need of a paperwork mountain assistants or brochures travelling with a spartan load was compatible with his occupation and did not obstruct his ability to initiate a deal that would cost the purchaser in excess of three million american dollars trust rules was his motto handed down to him by his mentor lose the trust of those you do business with young man and you might as well quit the work and go back to what you were doing because youll be dead in the water solly lieberman had delivered the lecture to gillot on june it had marked the defining moment in his life he had known that mr lieberman was about to alter his life make an offer that could not be refused and gillot aged twentyone had stood damn near at attention in front of the scratched desk behind which the wizened old guy had sat he had heard the lecture in a gravelcoarse american east coast accent and had not laughed at the advice trust was harvey gillots lifeblood trust would liberate several tonnes of surplustorequirements munitions and weapons from a bulgarian military depot and trust would ensure a purchaser handed him a healthy deposit as down payment on acceptance of terms he needed too the trust of the shipping company and of customs officials at both ends of the transaction trust was as good a weapon as any in the global economic climate and bless the lord in hard times the price of conflict didnt much matter money could be found if there was trust many trusted harvey gillot and he had worked hard to earn that trust he could have called home as he walked out into the blast of the sun that reflected up from the concrete but didnt think the effort worthwhile and left his mobile in the satchel if he lost that trust and word spread he would be back to selling office equipment and stationery his eyes smarted in the glare so he tugged his polaroids from an inner pocket and hooked them on the aircraft was in front of him above the sun burgeoned from a cloudless sky clear and blue the dog did well from the table it was given cheese cubes slices of cold sausage cake and biscuits it sat on its haunches its tongue hung out and its eyes showed unrestrained happiness the dog was a centre of attention it was named king it had been trained in bosniaherzegovina in the fields near to the ravaged town of mostar had received certificates and been sold by its austrianborn handler to canadians who had shipped it first to rwanda in central africa then west to angola now in its eighth year the german shepherd was in the last stages of a career that many called distinguished its final handler a taciturn croat from a hill village near to the slovenian border permitted the indulgence seemed indifferent to it he owed his life to that dog every day they worked the handler could assume that if the animals senses and nose failed they would be dead they could be killed by the cloud of razor slivers from the mines that severed limbs and cut arteries leaving man and animal beyond help he was used to this sort of occasion where food and drink were laid out and local people pleaded their gratitude the noise around him grew and he saw empty bottles plum apple and pear brandy all home distilled taken out and fresh ones brought from the cellar if they had worked together for an extra hour the previous evening they might have finished the clearance before dusk made it too dangerous to go on but he had been with these people for seven weeks and he would have reckoned it ungracious to slip away before their celebration with himself and his dog as the honoured guests soon he would drive the dog back to his home on the outskirts of osijek where it would go into its pen and he would sit at a desk read papers study maps and learn the detail of the next site he was to be assigned to there was no shortage of work the government said that a quarter of a million mines had been laid during the war but more realistic studies put the figure at close to a million they had been in the ground now for seventeen eighteen or nineteen years and had lost none of their lethal potential were as deadly as the day when the spades had made the holes in the fields the mines had been dropped into them and covered with earth when the dogs working life was over it would go to his father and live out its last years as a pampered pet and he would take on another dog a twoyearold with its training just completed when that dog was ready to finish there would still be the seeded fields all over his country where the conflict line had been the day he had started to work on strips of land at the edge of the cornfields round the village close to where the vuka river flowed he had explained his tactic to the farmer on whose land he would be he had said that mechanical flails mounted on an armoured bulldozer were acceptable on flat fields but useless and dangerous on the steepsloped riverbanks he said too that if the clearance were to be done by hand men on their knees with fine probes it would take for ever and this area did not warrant priority so it was him and the dog they worked along yellow tape lines king a few metres ahead on a long loose lead finding them there were at least twenty all primed all killing agents the dog could smell explosive chemicals could smell also the fine metal filament wires that would trip the unwary and detonate a device he had talked of the acoustic signature that the wires gave off which the dog could hear when a man could not he had thought the farmer cared only for another hectare made available to plant more corn or sunflowers he was called forward the handler knew what was required of him from under his dusty overalls he produced the certificate of clearance boldly he signed it glasses were filled raised and downed the drink ran in dribbles from their mouths he rarely drank the telephone could ring at any hour day or night to tell him of a child mortally injured in a field that had once been a battle zone a farmer blown up and lying injured with a leg held at the knee only by cartilage and if he was drunk he could do nothing people believed in his skill and the dogs he had done his best he had lifted twenty antipersonnel mines from the wilderness ground at the perimeter of the field then had gone down the bank the strip he had cleared was at least two hundred metres long and forty wide a very brave man or a very stupid man would declare that ground now free of mines he knew the history of this village of its fight and its courage and knew too of its fall the dog slumped satiated and its tongue lolled with the heat he thought it was not often that these people had something to celebrate with the paper presented to the farmer he believed it was a suitable moment for him to go to move out of the lives he had shared these several weeks to leave them free of the crack of the mines he had detonated he assumed that after he had gone the music would be turned up the dancing would start more food would be eaten and the pile of bottles outside the back door would grow higher he was wrong he knew the farmer as petar and knew the mans wife but could not communicate with her because of her acute deafness king was fond of her he knew mladen who was most likely to be listened to in the village and tomislav and andrija who was married to maria and was her lapdog he knew josip and he knew such people in every village where he had worked since the land had been taken back from the cetniks he started for the door he had imagined that when he announced he must leave with his dog there would be protests there were not everyone gazed out of the window over their shoulders he could see across a lawn over a wicket fence and on to the road that ran down through the village to the crossroads in its centre an old woman dressed in black as if to commemorate recent bereavement was walking along it leaning heavily on a stick he left the certificate on the table among the food bottles and glasses he made excuses but received no response they watched her advance towards petars house he had not seen her before but he recognised authority the handler went into the bright light of early afternoon and the heat hit him she came up to him stared into his face he noticed always had sharp eyes for what was different a gift that kept him alive in the fields that she wore no wedding ring or any other jewellery she had no ring but neither did petars wife nor andrijas his puzzlement was cut short she had a harsh reedy voice have you finished yes i have done that section of the field as far as the riverbank it is clear yes did you find bodies the dog would not be concerned with bodies if they were buried we found none on the ground she left him and went up the steps to the front door the handler walked to the fourwheel drive the dog made a laboured jump into the back not a cloud above him no wind a sky of brilliant blue there was an estate of tower blocks across the road and to his right if any man or woman had been out on their balcony enjoying a cigarette or hanging washing on a frame and had seen him and the man in front of him they might have thought of a feral cat that lived behind the fifteenfloor towers and stalked rats as the cat would he valued the time he spent learning the movements habits and styles of the target if any man or woman in the cafe he passed the launderette the small gaming arcade or the kebab restaurant had seen him and noticed him then let their eyes fasten on the back of the target ahead a similar image might have locked in their minds hunter and hunted in the tight alleyways between the blocks where the bins were stored and the vermin found food a cat did not hurry when it stalked prey it attacked on its own terms and at the time of its choosing before it surged forward it would feign indifference to a scurrying rat he might have been seen but he was not noticed and that was a skill he shared with the cat the killer the man in front of him had come out of a goodsized house four bedrooms and a brickpaved driveway to a double garage had turned in the doorway and kissed the face of a woman in a silky robe he had used a code at the gatepost to pass through electronically controlled gates then walked briskly up the pavement and past the first tower block he had gone into a newsagent to buy a tabloid some chewing gum and a plastic bottle of milk then had stopped at a cafe to linger for ten minutes over a pot of tea now he was on the move again going back to the house the cat on the street was robbie cairns he knew that the rat he stalked was johnny cross lamps wilson the name was of little importance to him he assumed that the nickname related to an eye problem before that morning he had had little idea of what johnny cross lamps wilson would look like he had not been given a photograph never had been since hed started out in his line of work or a description other than that the man was balding and wore big spectacles but he had been provided with the address didnt need much else except a sense of the location and any personal security the target kept around him robbie cairns had not seen an escort on familiar ground where he ruled and was respected johnny cross lamps wilson would not have reckoned he needed one different if he was on a strangers ground he did not know why the life of the man ahead was on offer for ten thousand pounds he did not know who had agreed to pay after a brief negotiation with his grandfather for the taking of a life he did not know when the first approach had been made to his father or when his grandfather had been brought into the deal he did know that his reputation was strong and that his father and grandfather would not have considered a cheapskate hit robbie cairns walked with confidence knew he was top of the range only an idiot or a cowboy went in too fast robbie cairns was selftaught he had never had a mentor never been on a days firearms course never read a book on the procedures of foot and vehicle surveillance the talents were in the blood he had learned well at his fathers knee when jerry cairns was not on enforced absence from the family home and when hed sat close to his grandfather in a secondfloor flat on the albion estate he had gained more of the tactical skills on a sixmonth sentence at feltham young offenders aged seventeen and more on a twelvemonth sentence handed down a week after his eighteenth birthday an older officer at the prison perhaps hed taken a fancy to him had said robbie lad it doesnt have to be like this for you you dont have to spend half your adult life traipsing into court being driven from one gaol to another he had taken that advice robbie cairns had not been before a magistrate or judge since had not been in court or prison he had been in police cells and interview rooms then kicked out on to the streets when the holding time was up he listened also to his father always do ground work robbie always put the hours in hed listened to his grandfather will it all be there tomorrow will it be the same youll know more about where youre going and what youre going to do when you get there he saw johnny cross lamps wilson edge into the doorway of an estate agents premises and do the old one of checking reflections in the window glass he kept walking he wore no weapon robbie cairns never took one with him unless he was about to use it another of the small ways from a long checklist in which he protected his liberty and stayed out of reach of the flying squad the families and associates of those hed done a contract on he never passed on the chores of reconnaissance to others he did it himself he was level with the man he ducked his head mild and apologetic seeming to apologise for crowding the man then reached past him to the open top box by the agents door and took out a brochure of properties his man had gone satisfied he had no tail robbie cairns had been so close to him he could smell the aftershave on the mans face and the toothpaste he could see the shaving nick on the throat the small birthmark on the chin and through the the spectacles the mans squint he stayed a moment in the recess but he wouldnt go into the estate agents because he would be picked up on internal security cameras couldnt miss them all but could miss a hell of a number of them for the ones on the street he depended on frequent changes of outer clothing the bigbrimmed baseball cap he wore and the shades he was pleased with himself an estate agents brochure was good cover robbie cairnss head was down in the pages when the man did a last spin turn at his gate before concentrating on the pad screwed to the outside of the gatepost then he was inside and the gate clanged shut what would he have seen before he pumped the digits into the pad not much someone of average size who wore nothing distinctive carried nothing memorable looked at ease on the street and wasnt a stranger robbie cairns was twentyfive years old he was a fraction less than five feet ten but hadnt been measured since hed stood in his boxers in the induction hall at feltham and had no major distinguishing marks on his face his hands did not carry scars from fist fights or from when he had protected his eyes from a knife slash under his cap his hair was short tidy like a clerks he wore dark jeans dark trainers a drab tshirt without a logo and a lightweight jacket he had no tattoos on his body he saw johnny cross lamps wilson cross his driveway and slip a key into the front door he turned away had seen enough he walked a full quarter of a mile the sun beating on him his shadow minimal at his feet he had crossed the main road then gone through the centre of the estate where there was a little shade from the towers to a central carparking area in front of a line of shops robbie cairns could not know where all the high cameras were but the cap was down on his forehead and little of his face was exposed as he approached a mondeo ten years old from the registration plates eased from a bay and came to idle in front of him a door was pushed open he slipped into the front passenger seat and was driven away by his brother how did it go all right he eased back in the seat the car had once been grey but most of that anonymous colour was now covered with a light coating of dust and dirt all that was remarkable about the car was the engine the pride and joy of robbie cairnss elder brother when you going to go for it when im ready he was driven away from north london where he was a stranger towards the bridges over the river and the ground where he had roots cairns family territory he would do one more trip to the north london patch and watch again if nothing showed to concern him he would fulfil the contract in two days or three the sun cooked them in the car ready delta four it was one of the moments mark roscoe lived for why he had joined the police service they didnt come often enough and had to be savoured yesterday he had endured his regular duties and yearned for the raw excitement he felt now yesterday he had examined the hotwater boiler of a housingauthority maisonette and decided that it needed a plumber the property was a safehouse and was occupied by a lowlife villain and his mistress moved there by roscoes unit it was hoped he was beyond the reach of a hitman a prison cell would have been more appropriate for the villain but there was insufficient evidence to put him away so he was under protection because he was owed the same degree of security as any other citizen yesterday roscoe had realised the villain regarded him as a friend would probably have made the mistress available and was seriously grateful for the care taken to keep him alive he had fallen out with a former partner and the hit had been paid for yesterday had been slow and frustrating and the detail of it stuck in his throat today had the prospect of being special ready bravo one he had always felt the callsign stuff was cavalry and indians what he might have been doing as a tenyearold in the park close to where he had lived but in the service it was the drill the form and damn near a capital offence to ignore it the command was shrieked in the earpiece go go go he was first out of the back of the van fit and well capable of athleticism even after four hours and nine minutes inside the back of the steelsided windowless vehicle as his shoes hit the concrete he regretted that he hadnt crawled behind the curtain to use the bucket he was armed but his glock stayed in the pancake holster at his waist and there would be guys from the co crowd firearms specialists the prima donna blokes and birds who strutted the walk when theyd a machine pistol or a handgun readied out in front by a few paces two big men carrying the shortarm batteringram that delivered some ten tonnes of kinetic energy when swung by an expert amazing thing science and serious crime directorate was issued with most of the highfly kit forgetting his need for the bucket feeling the blast of heated air hearing the wood of the front door splintering and groaning roscoe was almost deafened by the shouting of the rammers the marksmen and a big dog barking fit to bust inside the handler alongside the lead guns wore a padded jacket and mask as if he were bomb disposal it was good clean fun and what mark roscoe had joined for he was now a detective sergeant he had little interest in community policing less in administration and the policyanalysis papers and none in involvement with community associations or schools liaison he had consistently sidelined himself from the broad avenues to promotion so again needing a leak but with his adrenalin surging roscoe joined the charge on the doorway of a pleasantenough property in the suburbs to the southwest of london he could live with the crap of being delta four the adrenalin was addictive problem the threebedroom semidetached mocktudor s property was unoccupied but for a dog cause of problem the unit of scd had brilliant kit but had been unable to stitch together the necessary surveillance resources for full cover and the watchers had not been in place for the previous eighteen hours result of problem one hungry dog to confront but no bad guys he went inside squeezed into the hallway had to work his way past an armourplated marksman roscoe could see into the kitchen and the dog could have been a rottweiler cross was on its back the first men in might have shot it and had not instead they seemed to queue up to scratch its stomach roscoe had two people with him bill from yorkshire and suzie from a floodplain in southwestern bangladesh via east london he led them into the back room he could live with the problem of failing to get his hands on the bad guys if the search turned up platinumscale material it was a house where gear was stored and had been fingered by a chis nobody liked a chis a chis was bottom of the heap but if the information of the covert human intelligence source delivered he would be tolerated the chis had been about as specific as was possible a cupboard in the back room alongside the brickedup fireplace a wood panel inside the cupboard that could be removed missing bricks in the party wall behind the panel the room hadnt any art on the walls just a pair of tenerife posters the smell of dog mess was coming from the kitchen and the sound of the kettle he bill and suzie had on seethrough gloves and the cupboard where the chis had said it was was open the girl inordinately proud to be a detective constable in scd looked as though the weight of the hammer might snap her skeletal arm but she insinuated herself past him expelled him from the space and had the claw into the crack at the top edge of the panel she grunted with the effort and when the panel came away she cannoned back into roscoe and he felt all of her against him the bones and bumps and bill had a torch with the beam aimed into the recess it was bloody empty mark roscoe detective sergeant of the flying squad thieftakers with a reputation to sustain and a heritage of legendary successes had called out a sixstrong firearms team who were a precious commodity and knew it and had two of his own with him plus uniforms in the street from the local station and the two with the batteringram he bill and suzie had their heads crammed into a cupboard and a torch beam lit a hole in which a few spiders milled it had been his chis roscoes call he was answerable to superiors when a foulup smacked into his face he could smell the understated scent that the girl had chosen to wear that morning and he heard the yorkshiremans obscenity no apology there would be an inquest the floorboard creaked under their combined weight as they manoeuvred clear a meeting would be convened at which the reliability of the chis would be shredded the absence of surveillance analysed and the bloody time and motion people would earn their corn he pushed himself up his own people were watching him looking for leadership and wore the solemn expressions that meant they had no wish to intrude into his grief the firearms officers were at the door and in the hallway most seemed to chew gum and had the look of men women whose burden was to walk alongside idiots he stood he took his mobile from his pocket and was about to hit the keys the board was below his feet and under the thin carpeting suzies tiny feet were on the same board and bills massive shoes she started bill followed like a shuffle dance they eased weight from toes to heels and were looking at him was he an idiot slow on the uptake he bent down took a corner of the carpet and dragged it clear it came too easily and his heart was doing big drumbeats the board had little scrape marks at the edges she used the claw hammer was crouched over the board and heaved it came up her eyes were wide with excitement bills tongue wetted his lips and mark roscoe let loose a gasp he waved one of the firearms crowd over to them and stood back not an entirely wasted day the weapons were individually checked for safe handling and the evidence bags spread out on the kitchen table the expert reeled off a monotone identification of what they had one beretta mm calibre automatic one ingram submachine pistol with silencer attached one colt pistol with silencer attached one walther ppk an estimate one hundred rounds for the colt one filled magazine for the beretta some fifty rounds for the ingram two balaclava face masks thats about it boss rather shyly suzie congratulated him with a great clap on the back bill told him it was a bloody top grade result and he could see that he had won the respect of the firearms officer ridiculous but it seemed to matter the uniforms were told to get a roll of crimescene tape round the front garden and down the shared drive to the garage so the covert human intelligence source had come up bar a location error of a few miserable inches as a star mark roscoe would have the plaudits of his peers and the chance of the house owner staying out of custody for more than a few hours was remote a contract killers kit was bagged and would be photographed and the rifling in the barrels of each weapon would go to the national ballistics intelligence system to be tracked against bullets gouged out of cadavers bodies it was indeed a hell of a good result the unit that mark roscoe served with was one of the most secretive in the metropolitan police it was charged with targeting the increasing threat in the capital city posed by wellrewarded and capable hired hitmen he found a toilet upstairs used it flushed and the result would get better in the garage they found a performance motorcycle crash helmets and boiler suits that would with the balaclavas offer dna traces he called in told his operational commander what they had found another day done it wasnt about driving contract killers hitmen off the streets or about destroying that culture of cheap killings it was about holding a line they stopped at a fastfood joint and took away chicken pieces fries and coke that part of the flying squad his team was on call twentyfour hours a day and seven days a week when overtime allowed and each of them knew the mcdonalds burger kings and kentuckys better than they knew their own kitchens it was a life of a sort suzie drove he took the back seat the heat in the car emphasised the failure of the cooling system and sweat from his forehead mixed with the sauce on his lips he cursed bill said come on boss its wonderful blue skies and no clouds we have a result and the worlds at peace you know what i mean she turned to all of them faced them from the door you will do it you will find them you have to she was the widow not a name she had sought but one that had been given there were others in the village community who were widows and some who were widowers and there were three sets of orphans but she alone had been awarded that title almost she wore the given name as if it were a medal of honour and authority instead of drinking eating pretending a corner of a cleared field is a cause for celebration you should be out there searching her man had been a selfproclaimed patriarch in the village he had gone out into the earlyevening failing light and had not come back with him had been petars boy tomislavs and the young cousin of andrija for the last days of the defence of the village she had tried to step into her husbands boots he had commanded the irregulars who fought to hold their homes and keep open the cornfield road but she had been elbowed aside not just verbally but physically by mladen they had not come back she had been pushed out of the command bunker and sent to the deep cellar a crypt below the church where the wounded were and had not felt the cold november air on her face for four days she had stayed buried like an animal in the carnage hole that was a useless imitation of a field hospital until mladen had come to her he had had to stoop to pass through the cellar and only fading torches had identified for him those she tended who had suffered horrific injuries now the painkillers and morphine were finished he had groped towards her past the radio that played the live broadcast of sinisa glavasevic who was trapped in the town further down the cornfield road mladen had knelt in front of her and taken her hands bloodstained in his he had begged forgiveness for her expulsion from the command bunker and had told her the resistance was over that evening all those who had the strength to run walk or crawl would go into the corn and try to reach the defence lines at nustar and vinkovci they could not take the wounded she was told that further defence was suicidal would achieve nothing and that the village with no antitank missiles could not be held it would be her decision as to whether she stayed with the wounded or went into the cornfields she had stayed of course she did not talk about what had happened in the hours after the men and other women had fled under cover of darkness she did not speak about the arrival of tanks in the heart of the village and the torches beaming down the steps she had never discussed the actions of the cetniks as the wounded with herself and two other women who had remained were dragged crudely up the steps from the cellar into the nave of the wrecked church catheters bandages and drip tubes had been wrenched loose and clothing ripped from bosoms and stomachs she had kept silent about what had happened forty hours later a red cross convoy had been permitted to evacuate the handful of survivors they lived as if they were dead minds worked ears listened eyes saw and feet moved but souls had been killed when seven years later the widow had left a prefabricated wooden home outside zagreb and returned to the devastated village she had been elevated to matriarch mother to them all nothing passed in the village unless she endorsed it you search for him you know where to find him do i have to take up a spade is that womans work as teacher in the village school her husband had been a man of books there were more books in their home than in all the others in the village she had qualifications in nursing he had been undisputed in his leadership no bank managers lived there no agricultural cooperative managers and no priest his authority had been handed on to the widow she had stood for an hour in that kitchen had drunk only water and refused the open sandwiches cake and fruit an electrician before the war mladen lived off a good pension payable to the surviving commander of the village and responsible for its heroic defence he had the additional status of widower behind him she thought the boy uninteresting was the son simun who had been born in the church crypt on a day of fierce shelling and whose birth had killed his mother mladen was a big bullshaped man but had knelt before her and she had accepted his guilt the farmer was petar his wife had survived the capture of the village and the loss of her son and lived in a lonely soundless world and there was tomislav whose elder son was dead missing disappeared whose wife and younger children had fled he was the one who had known how to use the weapons that should have come through the cornfields that night there was andrija the sniper who had escaped his wife maria who had been captured and violated and josip the clever one and the coward the one they needed and the one they despised she saw them all in petars wide new kitchen which the government had paid for there were others she knew each one she had treated them ushered them into the world she dominated them find them you owe them that what hurt as much as the loss of her man stupid obstinate pompous was that he had not shared with her the detail of the purchase who had zoran met who had been given the money and valuables collected in the village he had spoken only of seeing his nephew from the ministry but the nephew had been killed by a shrapnel burst at the bridge over the river at karlovacs she knew nothing and it was a cut to her selfesteem she looked each of them in the face was given mumbled promises that the search for her husbands body and the three others would start the next day she snorted the widow went through the door and the boy simun pushed forward to take her arm and steady her down the steps but she shrugged him away the sun had dipped her shadow was thrown long and sharply angular on the road she went by the church most of it rebuilt and took a lane leading out of the village to the north she passed one house where serbs had lived and where the pram chassis had been found and another where the handcart had been dumped but there had been no word of what had happened to her husband and the younger men it was a long walk for her but the suns strength had slackened and she had her stick she hobbled forward on a worn path of packed earth and the corn rose high on either side of her dwarfing her far in the distance there was the treeline and the river she went as far as the corn and stopped where the planted strip gave way to verdant weed at the point where she stood there would have been until that morning a metal sign a little rusted after thirteen years that warned of the dangers of going on to mined ground birds sang and flipped between the corn stems a buzzard wheeled she could imagine how it had been and that fuelled the hatred to the north the town fronted on to the great and historic waterway the danube river a winding sprawling snake with a slow endless slither the other three boundaries of the town were formed by cultivated fields that stretched away that summer of devastating heat with long strips of corn sunflowers and vines alongside the crops were planted the speciality of that region of central europe mines had been rooted in fertile ground beside the mass graves of civilians and soldiers that year promised a good harvest trailerloads of grain vats of oil casks of wine and as happened every year the fields would give up more of the maiming devices more of the graves would be uncovered where the dead had been dumped but never forgotten the agricultural land on the plateau high above the danube had always held graves had always been on a fault line of violence it was far from the great cities of europe remote from the councils of hurrying leaders who cared life moved on the town surrounded by minefields and mass graves was vukovar it had lived barely in the eye of a media storm for a few days as winter had set in during an atrocity nineteen years before vukovar had been an image of dead cornfields distant columns of smoke rising to gunmetal skies of mud misery and murder but it was all far away from london paris berlin and rome it was even further from washington who cared if savages butchered each other in a distant corner not many did it matter not a lot now most memories had wiped away the name of a small town on a fine river vukovar but a minefield had been cleared and a farmer would drive his tractor the next day over the ground that an old german shepherd dog had found to be safe he would have confidence in the dogs nose and those who had not forgotten would never forget would watch the plough turn fresh furrows a new strip would be prepared for sowing old grievances awakened and hatreds reborn that evening there was a fine sunset over the river and cranes tracked the barges that plied upstream drawn by tugboats a mist gathered and the suns colour was diffused it had been gold and became blood red he heard a long shouted moan voices in unison calling to him when he looked at them arms fingers and fists pointed behind him petar was able to hear them because for the second day he had not brought out his best tractor the massey ferguson fourwheeldrive turbo but used the older and lighter prvomajaska which had no closed cab their voices carried to him above the engine noise on the first day he had dragged a chainlink harrow over the ground and it had rooted out much of the long grass thorn scrub and thistles that had taken hold in the nineteen years since mines had been laid in the part of his field that was against the southern bank of the vuka river there had been no jolting detonation under the tractor chassis and he presumed that the work of the dog and its handler had been thorough but he was wary enough of the danger from longburied explosives to have told the men and women from the village to keep back from the tractors path he knew as did any farmer in the old combat zones of eastern slavonia that mines could float that floods and ground movements of erosion or buried aquifers could shift the mines or tilt them the last evening after covering the ground with the harrow petar had taken it off his pvromajaska and replaced it with an old plough it didnt matter to him if it was damaged by an explosion he was at the far edge of the land that had become a wilderness and to his right was the riverbank his wheels had perhaps a metre more of secure tread he was concentrating the river as he remembered it was deep here perhaps three metres and if the tractor slid and went down he might be trapped by the steeringwheel he saw them pointing waving and he could hear them but their gestures were behind him and he thought it unwise to swivel in the seat or turn his head he would not risk losing control of the tractor because briefly he could not see the ground over which the front wheels were about to go yesterday close to here the front left wheel had gone into a hole as a vixen had sprinted clear and he had seen momentarily the bright eyes of cubs against the darkness of the den then the heavier rear wheel had gone over the hole and the tractor had lurched but not tipped it had hurt to kill the cubs and for the remaining hours he had worked the ground he had seen the vixen at the treeline beside the river watching him petar had inflicted violent death had known the agony of it but he had felt pain at burying the cubs he went to the end of the furrow raised the plough and gunned the engine for power difficult because the prvomajaska lacked the finesse of the massey ferguson he wrenched the wheel round and was relieved to be away from the drop of the bank sweat had dribbled into his eyes he wiped his face with his forearm he could see what they pointed at and their voices were now a clamour an arm thrust up out of the ground well petar thought it was an arm it could not have been a branch with tatters of cloth hanging on it mladen shouted used his weight and his voice to keep the rest back they stood the village community and petars entire world at approximately the point on the road that the teacher had marked with a redcrayon cross before he had taken the young men out into the dusk his boy had gone with tomislavs because they still had strength in their arms legs and backs the siege of the village had lasted already more than eighty days but his boy and tomislavs had had enough of their strength to be in that small party as had andrijas cousin he was almost certain that the plough blades had turned up a body and thrown it aside at such an angle that the arm outstretched now rose like a mast from a ship that had sunk after a collision in the river beyond the town the key turned the engine died petar was now sixtyseven he weighted less than seventy kilos was below average height and had spent most of his adult life labouring on a farm other than when he had been fighting for his village and the few years he had passed in the torture chamber for him of an urban refugee camp wooden huts on the outskirts of zagreb he did not spare himself stiffly he swung his legs away to the side hung on to the wheel for a moment then dropped on to the turned earth he blinked focused a great quiet hung over the field petar coughed and spat then he started to walk towards the arm they had been wearing camouflage tunics that night the tunics had come in a batch fifty of them with camouflage trousers and had been brought to the village by the police at osijek before the siege had begun mladen the teacher his own son tomislavs and andrijas cousin a giant of a man from nustar had all worn the black grey and duckgreen outfits he did not know if the arm raised from the earth was or was not his sons he had not seen the vixen that morning he thought she would have moved on accepted the death of the cubs he wondered how he tomislav andrija or the widow would make an identification the sun sapped him he wore a hat woven straw with the brim pulled low to keep the light from blinding him none of the men in the village had rings as none of the women had had necklaces bracelets or wedding rings by the time the teacher had led three others with the handcart two wheelbarrows and the pram chassis into the darkness and down the cornfield road not a bauble nothing that was precious and could be dropped into a canvas sack with money and house deeds had been missed everything had been collected three weeks before by andrijas wife at the teachers direction it had gone to zagreb when zoran had sealed the deal and returned with a promise that the weapons were coming at that distance petar could not tell whether the raised arm was the left or the right could he remember which undershirt his boy had been wearing the one of the new york baseball team or the one of the dinamo club in the capital the arm now seemed slightly crooked at the elbow and the material was dark the colour had no meaning there was no flesh on the skeletal hand and the fingers climbed to the sky and the sun as if they had been liberated from the ground he did not know if the arm was his sons he sank to his knees and wept it was the first time in nineteen years that petar had allowed himself to think of his son picture him and tears to flow the others came none ran they advanced in a line to him and made a circle he shook his head almost ashamed of his weakness bastards he spat anger and hatred bubbling on his lips bastards his father was the main reason for robbie cairns to avoid carelessness again he followed the man it was the third time and the routine was solid out of the house within a fiveminute window then through the gates along the pavement to the newsagent then the cafe where a small pot of tea was drunk a stroll home no minder trailing him it was a street free of closedcircuit cameras behind johnny cross lamps wilson giving him space robbie cairns regarded this as quality time gettingtoknow time he was some seventy paces behind the target had good vision on him and could think through where he would make the approach on which stretch of pavement and whether it would be on the way to the cafe and maybe close to the newsagent or going back to the house and its electronic gate he had options which was important robbie knew the value of flexibility they always said about sport that a football team had to have plan b for when plan a went down the sewer he had plans a b c and d a fistful of plans which all covered the killing of johnny cross lamps wilson the first two times that robbie had done legwork on this target he had noted that the man used basic antisurveillance tactics didnt this morning he couldnt see there would be any difficulty in getting up close for a head shot might do it from behind might do it from the front might step out from a shop doorway or from the cover of the bus shelter might walk into the cafe the closest point to where vern had parked in the mondeo when he was pouring tea and sucking sugar lumps his father was away and would be for another four years because he had been dumb enough to spit had wound down the window in the supermarket car park and spat then the armoured van had arrived and the cameras had shown men in balaclavas running from the car doing the necessary with a shooter and two pickaxe handles and the security blokes had frozen theyd run back to the car and shifted out itd been a flying squad job robbery section and theyd done over jerry cairnss secondfloor flat on the albion estate just along the walkway from where granddad and grandma cairns were the alibi trotted out in the interview room at the rotherhithe nick was copperbottomed and cast iron strong as granite hed been down in kent with dot looking at properties to buy just driving along the lanes and an army of respectable folks would come forward to swear theyd seen jerry in the motor in kent the dna in the saliva had done him for a fourteenyear stretch robbie cairns thought that only an idiot would have done what his father had then gone running towards the cash wagon he knew more than most about dna robbie cairns knew that dna stood for deoxyribonucleic acid and he knew there was plenty in spit down the road from where he lived in bermondsey dna had done for a hit team theyd taken a thirtythousandpound contract to shoot a guy who had lost big money from a robbery he was minding shots to the head as the target opened up his courier business at dawn the dna had been on spectacles dropped by one of the team on the filter tip of a cigarette smoked as they waited for the guy to turn up and on the casing of a security camera theyd climbed up to shift so that they wouldnt be on film when they moved in and theyd used a mobile on the scene when they were looking the place over he didnt like people being stupid and had told his dad jerry so to his face he watched johnny cross lamps wilson punch the keypad disappear inside and the gate closing next time robbie would have a converted baikal izh tucked into his waistband where his right hand easily could reach it it had been manufactured robbie knew in the russian city of izhevsk and built to fire teargas pellets there it had a street price of maybe thirty euros it would have gone overland to lithuania a bulk order and in the capital it would have been modified to fire live bullets not pellets and now it had a street value vilnius prices of around a hundred and fifty euros by the time the weapon had reached london the value of the pistol manufactured on a production line at a huge plant like the izhevsky mekhanichesky zavod where they made the ak the kalashnikov would have soared into the skies for it to fire mm bullets and have the engineering work done a threaded end that enabled it to be fitted with a silencer the buyer must pay fifteen hundred euros robbie cairns had had cash in hand no names a test firing of two bullets out on the rainham marshes he never used the same weapon twice if he thought his track was covered hed sell it on if not it was dumped three handguns had been sold and five thrown into deep water off the queen elizabeth bridge downriver and out to the estuary he peeled away went back down the street past the newsagent and the cafe he had seen enough there was a walkway towards the supermarket car park and he headed into it four or five kids advanced towards him walking abreast and just about filling the space robbie cairns didnt back off he might have eased his arse against the graffitipainted wall dragged his stomach in and allowed the kids to pass him he might many would have ducked his head like a dog and seem to apologise for blocking the kids making them shift their formation two were black and three were either north african or somali and the chance was that at least some would have shortbladed knives he did not back off he did not make way for them he did not offer any apology for inconveniencing them never crossed his mind that he should he walked towards them and they parted to made way for him it was his presence it was the roll of his gait and the confidence of his mouth jaw eyes he had not disrespected them but they would have had a good enough look at him to realise it was sensible to give him his space as they did so he smiled to left and right his brother would have seen him come into the car park slide the shades over his eyes and use his fingers casually to flick the hood over his head all the big car parks had cameras he walked the last paces with a limp and slumped shoulders it was verns responsibility to look after the vehicle logistics which lockup garage and under which railway arch for the storage of a motor and where to collect a new one clean that was what vern did the brothers didnt entertain smalltalk you know when youll go vern asked same time tomorrow well go tomorrow robbie cairns said where when they were back over the river he should be dropped off he would do it tomorrow and his grandfather would invoice the people who had bought the hit tomorrow would be another day at work for robbie cairns a quiet day would have been pleasant if the airconditioning had not chosen it the hottest of the month to cough rattle and ultimately go down fixing the central heating in midwinter or the airconditioning in high summer was a complex matter the teams worked out of three partitioned areas plywood and frosted glass and each owned sufficient wall space to display mug shots surveillance photographs operational maps satellite images of properties bizarre but in electronic days they still hankered after good old bits of paper and seriously vintagestyle images it was as if this corner of serious crime directorate couldnt operate unless it was all there and tacked to a wall screens were for kids a complex matter of course because scd did not employ heating engineers plumbers electricians the people who came to the building for maintenance were vetted after a fashion but werent chained in by the official secrets act fixing the airconditioner unit that made an interior working day bearable would necessitate stripping out sanitising the areas of all three teams and exacerbating the problem not one window opened electric fans riffled papers but distributed no cool air between the partitions a quiet day expenses day timesheets and overtimedockets day a day for writing up a search report with results and another on the value of a covert human intelligence source mark roscoe thought it a good day but quiet calm civilised days had a way of kicking them in the teeth without warning actually hed done well and the paper mountain was shrinking ahead of and rising behind him they were all the same on a quiet day they beavered at the paper time was seldom on their side it was the way of mark roscoe his bill and his suzie to value time away from the coal face most of the targets they sought to save were the godawful people who organised the big cocaine shipments kept a main residence at puerto banus costa del sol fell out with a dealer or a supplier and owed maybe a million sterling then word came in that the aggrieved party was not going to the high court for justice but was hiring a gun couldnt be allowed to happen duty of care and all the horse shit from the european court of human rights had to jump through the hoops do their damnedest to prevent blood tissue brains scattering across a london pavement mark roscoe thought was near certain that bill was asleep at his desk space on the far side of the cubicle area and suzies head was rocking at another southwest area command police station detectives were grilling the tenant of the house searched roscoe wasnt big on liberal tendencies but while grilling was acceptable stitching up was not his dad had been a detective in the days of black eyes and facial abrasions when the accused regularly walked into doors and conveniently fell downstairs in the cell block his father didnt like to talk of those days as if he was ashamed of them he had turned his back on thirtyseven years service sold up the west london family home and disappeared to the lake district when the tenant had been grilled when names were on the tapes the interrogation would begin who was the hitman who paid the hitman who was the hitmans target who did the collection and who did the drop off he didnt quiz his father about the old days of policing london but had he done so and had he suggested to his father that it was interesting to be involved in the protection of organised players serious players keeping them off the mortuary slabs the veins would have jumped on his fathers temples his cheeks would have gone puce his breathing would have quickened and his eyes narrowed best thing for those animals is bad on bad the more the better best place for them is in a box and going down under rare enough for roscoe to make the long journey north and not right that when he did their time should be spent bickering enough to say that the major work of his squad was protection of men he despised it was sensible to let a day go slack when little jumped in his face wouldnt last could have bet his shirt on it the information might come from a chis or from an undercover officer even a member of the public an innocent who had seen or heard something and picked up the phone or from the serious and organised crime agency or the spooks or even from the listening superstars at gchq when things moved and the alarm bells clanged it was usually at speed and without warning what he called straight out of a clear blue sky the worst sort of sky a man wasnt going to be brought in to fix the airconditioner because nobody would take responsibility to strip down the walls looking between the slats of the blinds mark roscoe could see the great emptiness he loathed above the rooftops the clear blue sky a police patrol car was parked back from the field as if to give space around the raised arm a priest had come from vukovar at the same time and his car was further down the cornfield road any of the villagers or those who had lived in bogdanovci or marinci or men and women of croat origin from vukovar could tell which of the policemen was from their own ethnicity and which the serb always now in the police a croat and a serb officer were together petar could tell which was the serb because he had stayed in the patrol car was reading a newspaper and did not make eye contact with the villagers perhaps he had an elder brother a father or an uncle who had been here nineteen years before and the priest moved among them and in an officious way tried to speak about gods will gods work and gods love but no one wanted comfort petar stood with his wife she was a stout woman with heavy legs and a drooping bosom she wore no cosmetics and never had in the thirtynine years of their marriage a few of the wives had gone before the trap snapped shut on the village but she had not she had been beside him for the two and a half hours since he had pushed himself from kneeling close to the arm and the others had come forward they had made a ring of stamped earth around the arm he and his wife did not speak or touch she had been profoundly deaf since the howitzer shell had come through the wall of their sons room scattering molten shrapnel in the corridor down the stairs and across the hallway she had been in the kitchen should have been in the cellar and he had dug her out with his bare hands moving bricks and timbers and done it alone because every other man was required in the slit trenches and the women were with the wounded in the church crypt now they communicated by slate board and sticks of chalk but the board and the chalk were in their house his hands hung slackly at his sides and her arms were folded over her chest one finger still showed where she had once worn the wedding ring he had given her the croat officer had told mladen that a forensic specialist was on his way to the field a man of expertise and experience in their circle they waited with the arm the clawed bone fingers and the shreds of camouflage uniform a small songbird flew over their shoulders might have perched on the bones but andrijas wife threw a fistful of soil at it and it was gone the croat officer said it might be another hour before the forensic specialist reached them but they did not break the vigil well im not exactly top of his christmas card list megs snorted theatrically then shrugged but you know him thats what i said more specifically i know of him and about him is that clear enough and after a fashion harvey gillot knows me but thank god not as well as i know him so whats on your shopping list she was a regular for megs behan the coffee shop was her third space and she used it three or four times a week she took the leather sofa and the low table in front of it in starbucks just north of the city and came early in the morning she didnt move out until the undermanager rolled his eyes at her when the place was filling up with the lunch trade the other two potential spaces were her flat one poky bedroom and a decentsized sitting room which she shared with two others on the same floor and her office security requirements dictated that the building had a keypad for admission and that visitors were not permitted on the thirdfloor landing from which planet protection worked the coffee shop was comfortable reasonably confidential and the guests for whom she held court were expected to provide a relay of fair trade coffee and organic cakes she never paid would always make some faux annoyed grunt and confess to having come out without the purse megs could not have afforded starbucks prices on three or more mornings a week i said i was at hm revenue and customs i took that on board i assume the alpha team youre penny laing and your point of interest is harvey gillot so lets push on i am alpha team and it is harvey gillot penny laing allowed herself a short sharp shock of a smile megs behan worked full time as a researcher for the nongovernmental organisation known as planet protection they monitored the arms trade lobbied for national and international curbs on the shipment of weapons by western administrations to thirdworld conflict zones and could summon up a network of similar enthusiasts and campaigners across the continent she had not met the woman opposite her who sat on a hardbacked chair leaned forward over the low table between them and boasted a cleavage that was on a different richter scale from megs behans in the nine years she had been with planet protection she had met others from hmrc but penny laing was new to her are you going in after him can i call you megs thanks were looking to update our files somebody must have said you were a good source were looking at what i suppose we would call the first division of brokers maybe thats a dozen ive come to see you a colleague goes to amnesty and oxfam were trawling please megs dont bridle we all she must have frowned had probably narrowed her lips and might have let the light blaze in her eyes the suggestion of collusion had got up megss nose true of course but not welcome the woman opposite her did not do tact we all know that your extremely efficiently managed ngo is supported by charitable funds bring and buy carboot jobs jumble collections that meet some twenty per cent or being generous twentyfive per cent of operating costs and that the rest of the budget is funded by the taxpayer its from us foreign and commonwealth and overseas development so please shall we hack on megs could have added that special branch backsides had sat on the leather sofa or the chair opposite and spooks another truth and one that penny laing would not have appreciated was that humble little ngos had better research facilities in the field than the secret intelligence service the counterterrorist police the civil servants of overseas development the diplomats of the fco and the investigators of hmrcs alpha team who specialised in arms trafficking and potential breaches of legislation megs had heard it said charity workers in east and central africa were the best sources for the specifics of what plane had landed at what airstrip and offloaded what cargo into the hands of what rebel group or gang of drunk militia youve been given harvey gillot it goes without saying if we sniff any illegality well follow it were looking at harvey gillot but thats not to say we already have evidence against him i suppose you could say hes an individual we regard as having potential almost with innocence megs asked do you have experience of the arms trade i have some should be enough for me to be excused patronising shit i did time in the congo the kinshasa office attached to the embassy i havent just come from luton airport and dutyfree allowances megs slapped her own wrist and grinned her little gesture of guilt so harvey gillot funny thing and just chance but we had a girl from a sister group in paris and she was out yesterday at charles de gaulle anyway harvey gillot walked right past her had come off a flight from burgas and wheres that she reverted back to the theatrical wheres that its a black sea port city in bulgaria ukraine for secondhand stuff is about played out and bulgaria is the best source of lastgeneration weapons for the independent dealers she identified the flight before you ask because he came through with a wedge of passengers who had that places tags on their bags and it was the only flight down at that time satisfied harvey gillot is alive and well and hasnt retired to put his feet up if hes just been to bulgaria hes buying big or little fish what my kid brother would have called specimen size megs behan had always enjoyed a captive audience it seemed to her pretty pathetic that her majestys revenue and customs alpha team were tapping her for intelligence again again she savoured it then pointedly finished her coffee she was brought another mug and another biscuit how long have you got however long it takes for your insights he was born in in guildford surrey his dad was a postoffice sorting supervisor and his mother worked as a contract office cleaner they named him herbert but he didnt fancy that he did grammar school but not university and was taken on in an office equipment and stationery business then picked up by solomon lieberman american resident in uk bigtime and amoral that was where he learned the trade lieberman died in and harvey gillot took on the business company records show that the deal was for a knockdown hes done business since then all over except big except central africa id say his prime areas are the middle east with interest in south east asia tends to handle surplus it wouldnt be conscience or altruism thats kept him off central africa just that its a crowded market and there are other dark corners where the goings easier she talked for half an hour she might she reflected be underselling the commercial capabilities of harvey gillot couldnt quite bring herself to describe a winning smile manners and charm little courtesies to describe him as good at his job would have been similar she reckoned to talking up the communication skills of a grooming paedophile she said he gave an impression of affluence he drove a big car his suits and shirts were good how did she know so much she gathered trifles of information from any quarter it was what the spooks the branch the government offices and hmrcs alpha team could have learned but it would have been timeconsuming and theyd have pleaded lack of resources she wound up he has a wife and a teenage kid he lives on the south coast on portland but ive not been there you see he is nothing gilded a trader in death misery or destruction the arms trade is a filthy business and an arms trader getting fat off it is beneath contempt i hope you nail him if we find something but i doubt youll nail him she said it defiantly as if to provoke the reply inevitable i can assure you that if we find evidence of illegality well throw the book its just that we havent looked at him closely for too long time for an argument a brief cat scrap maybe it was too hot even inside starbucks maybe she hadnt slept and was too tired because lucy from next door a clerk in a solicitors firm specialising in immigrationtribunal appeals was shagging noisily half the night maybe she didnt believe that penny laing hmrc alpha team was worth the hassle megs behan walked out into a rather pleasant summer morning and felt as if she had a stone in her sandal and a pain in her gut the image in her mind was of the man walking past the police cordon and the crash barrier and not seeming to notice the line of her people outside the fair at the excel centre or herself not even in the traffic dodging it could she wipe out the image of harvey gillot on her phone penny laing spoke to her team leader dermot yes she was quite interesting really rather sad theyre out on the margins people like her its her obsession dont think there is anything in her life except hanging around outside hotels conference halls bawling abuse and being ignored but not entirely wasted and ill follow the paris line ill see you back at the office it wasnt illegal for a uk citizen to trade in arms and broker weapons deals it was illegal if they were not declared and cleared under the trade in goods control order si and an enduser certificate had to have been rubberstamped it was the area of alpha team and they were expensive supported by bravo team in an adjacent office without hits arrests and publicity to match they were pretty bloody surplus to requirements she would have liked it to be promising but it hadnt she went to catch a tube seemed an interesting guy harvey gillot a worthwhile target if his security ever slipped he didnt take notes in meetings harvey gillot had a good memory he did not like so many clutter up the hard drive of a laptop or use memory sticks to store his version of what had been said from the aircraft steps he walked the few paces to the bus on the tarmac enough had been indiscreet in the world of harvey gillot mostly there was spanking clean legitimacy but but every few months or perhaps every couple of years a deal fell into his lap that was just too good to lose for the sake of an enduser certificate those rare enough were the occasions when a trail of paper electronic messages or mobile calls could put a man in the most unwelcome places hmp belmarsh hmp wandsworth hmp long lartin her majestys prisons were unpleasant and avoidable he boarded the bus he knew enough who had ignored the survival rules he couldnt understand why more hadnt followed the diktats of solly lieberman when the old man had gone and hed cleared the office searched the locked drawers of sollys desk and opened his personal safe it was quite extraordinary how sparse the paper trail was enough had been left that concerned whitewash deals those in which he bought kit nightvision or radiocommunications boxes that had come out of the old warsaw pact warehouses and sold them to the ministry of defence and uniforms boots magnification optics and ammunition but of the choice stuff there had been no trace brilliant man solly gillot had learned the lesson on this trip he reckoned himself to have been off the radar he had gone through immigration at charles de gaulle on the passport he used for israeli visits and out the next morning on the one he used for arab countries he had laid off using the mobile and had kept no record on his phone or laptop of the purpose of his visit to paris and the overnight stay no reference existed in his baggage of his journey to the airport at tbilisi with a charter of schoolchildren on the dc aircraft of the georgian national airline when he came off the bus he allowed the kids to spurt ahead two men waited for him could have been just about any place any airport anywhere not good suits shirts that should have gone in the wash the previous evening shoes that needed a little care with polish and a brush haircuts that were fierce shades and armpit bulges they didnt have to hold up a sign esteemed guest harvey gillot we are honoured he nodded recognition he knew enough of those who had fouled up the system because they demanded that material be stored in files in safes or on computer chips they were in uk gaols us french and german gaols they had in common that they had all scented the big deal that would make the big bucks and had left tracks that any halfefficient bloodhound could canter after one guy nice man had even shredded his files hadnt done the history lesson taught by solly lieberman the old east german secret police had shredded till the machines blew up but the new federal authority had put together a unit hired a warehouse brought sacks of paper to it and set to work with rolls of sellotape the same exercise had convicted a guy from the southeast who was on a dodgy deal of heckler amp koch machine pistols manufactured under licence in tehran harvey gillot stored nothing he was led to a car a mercedes with privacy glass his meeting in paris had been at the office of the georgian embassys military attache he had listed what he could ship from bulgaria what it would cost and an arrival date ahead of him lay a long afternoon evening and night of detailed discussions why did the georgian government want weapons from bulgaria through the back door simple enough after the mauling georgia had received from russian tanks and artillery in the summer of the government would have wanted to rearm on their own terms not on american or european union terms and harvey gillot was the man they had turned to and would pay handsomely for the privilege of independent action not that he cared anything for the politics of east and west it was a hell of a good deal hed brokered the car went fast a blue lamp flashed on the roof and traffic swerved to give it space he was among people who valued him saw him almost as a saviour the knight in shining armour at the top of his game here far from home and his countrys lawenforcement agencies he could savour his importance he couldnt at home on trains or in aircraft he would find himself beside men and women who insisted on spilling their life stories to him but he never reciprocated he maintained a wall of privacy around himself could hardly respond dealer in death when asked what his trade was would have been the same for an undertaker he didnt recognise loneliness but was a man alone maybe a blessing and maybe a carried cross but isolation went with the work harvey gillot felt good here almost closed his eyes and almost dozed the man came in a land cruiser that trailed a plume of dust behind it petar saw it from far back the priest was almost a stranger to them at this moment the police already were he thought of the land cruiser and its passengers as an intrusion tomislav had threatened earlier to walk back to the village collect half a dozen ditching spades and start the job himself others had growled support and sworn they would help to excavate their own from the ground andrija had supported tomislav petar had not known what was best or what he wanted the priest had said diffidently that they should wait the croat policeman had ordered that no digging should be done and had said that the field where the hand protruded was now a potential crime scene the serb policeman was in the patrol car but petar had believed he smirked while the argument went on tomislav had not gone to get the spades the grave had not been touched the land cruiser braked soil flying up from the wheels a girl climbed out of the front passenger seat and a man from the back the villagers did not surge forward or seek introductions and the priest caught their mood the girl had a good voice im sorry youve all had to wait so many hours for expert help to reach you im grateful for your patience im kristina from the department of pathology and forensic science at the university hospital in zagreb under government statutes it is required that all graves from the homeland war those with the possibility of genocide a crime against humanity or a war crime must be investigated with rigour and care i was delayed because i went to the airport and was fortunate enough to meet one of the principal experts in his field today he was due here in two days time after giving a lecture in the hospital in zagreb tomorrow to government and media but this situation is more important and the lecture has been postponed he has come directly from the airport following his flight from the west coast of america he is professor william anders petar saw a big man solid muscular without surplus weight he had a strong chin with two days growth on it petar had never been on an aircraft the furthest he had travelled from the village was to the refugee camp for displaced persons near zagreb there were big bulges under the mans eyes and the lower rims of his dark glasses rested on them he wore laceup walking boots a creased pair of jeans a shirt and a cotton jacket he looked as though he had slept rough on his head shading his face from the sun now low was a widebrimmed leather hat as he was introduced to them he was lighting a cigar smoke eddied towards them the man spoke the girl translated when he paused i understand i know how you feel there are bodies perhaps of loved ones and they have not been laid to rest with due dignity now they have been discovered and everybody says hey hold on wait an important man is honouring you with his skills and his presence be patient im going to tell you some facts and then i want to make a promise to you petar thought his voice similar to many he had heard on programmes broadcast on croatian tv he noted control authority and sincerity the facts a judge said of the big crime down the road at vukovar silence condones once awareness exists it is unthinkable to remain silent he went on the families demand truth and justice a colleague of mine who worked here and across the border at srebrenica liked to say bones are often our last and best witnesses they never lie and they never forget maybe there was a crime and maybe there wasnt if there was a crime it will be me who says so the man and his translator threw long shadows i said i would make you a promise i am now about to do that i promise i will investigate this grave im told its likely to hold the bodies of four local men to the best of my ability if there has been a crime i will discover it and search for evidence that will convict those responsible my work is to find the guilty men swaggered when they had victory behind them and a loaded rifle in their hands they murdered and believed themselves safe from justice i tell you those men cringe when confronted with the weight of evidence i produce they piss their pants you have my promise he flicked ash from the cigars tip let it fall to the ground he had them all petar understood in the palm of his hand i dont know this village but i know the town i was there thirteen years ago i came to vukovar to help in the excavation of the warcrime site at ovcara i forget nothing my promise then was to search for the evidence of murder i continue to honour the promise better than i you know the figures there is a difference between the numbers taken forcibly from the hospital when vukovar fell and transported to the farm at ovcara and the numbers of bodies recovered from the mass grave somewhere on that farm land there is another grave that holds the bodies of sixty men because of my promise i come back each year and help to hunt for that grave i gave my promise the same promise i make to you the shadow of the mans hat covered petars boots had climbed towards his knees perhaps that was why petar was chosen the eyes fastened on him the translator asked what happened here i drove the tractor with the plough for nineteen years this ground has been mined we have been told it is cleared we looked for the bodies you knew bodies were here we knew that here where it was mined was where our men had been they waited on the path on the cornfield road that linked vukovar to vinkovci they were on it who was there our schoolteacher he had gone out three weeks before to buy weapons we received nothing from zagreb we were betrayed by zagreb the priest tutted but received an acid glance from the american muttered hung his head and was quiet continue please everything we owned in the village was collected and given to zoran the teacher he asked for our trust what we collected was taken to a meeting and given to a supplier of weapons a deal was made that night zoran went with three others to receive the missiles and launchers that our valuables had bought everything was given as payment we waited for their return they would have been heavily burdened by the weight of the weapons they didnt come there was mortaring in this area but that was near dawn and they should already have been long back with those weapons we could have kept the cornfield road open their tanks cut it we lost the road through the corn we lost the village and bogdanovci and a week later we had lost vukovar the teacher had sworn to us that the man he had met and paid was honourable we know now that the lorry with the weapons never reached the far end of the cornfield road some say it never loaded or left the docks at the harbour where they were supposed to be landed as he spoke petar saw that mladen who led the community bit his lower lip and the widow in black blouse black skirt and black stockings with brilliant white hair stood erect and gazed high over the americans head how many were with the teacher petar said he had taken with him my friend tomislavs boy my friend andrijas cousin and my only son if there was guilt well find it and ill work to name those who should face justice from the back of the land cruiser the professor and the young woman took long rolls of tape and circled the raised arm the professor told the people of the village that he would sleep in the back of the vehicle and that the dead would not be alone petar walked back to his tractor started the engine and led the way back to the village before they had gone far they heard the chugging beat of a small generator and lights lit the place they had a mans promise he could picture his son tomislavs andrijas cousin and the teacher it was owed them that the guilt should be uncovered and punishment meted out he thought it would be quick and without pain he thought it would end the misery it was two years since andrija had last tried to end his life he had waited until his wife had gone down the village street to the shop then had hobbled to the far end of the garden put a pistol into his mouth and pressed the barrel to the roof he had squeezed the trigger depressed it and nothing had happened he was not dead and he had wet himself his pistol had jammed the malfunction in the mechanism would have resulted from inadequate maintenance cleaning and care he had allowed corrosion of the metal parts to spread internally now andrija was ready again he lived on the northern edge of the village one of the last houses on the tarmac road towards bogdanovci he was now at the bottom of his garden shielded from the house by a row of bean plants that had reached the top of the hazel poles he could see the tip of the spire of the rebuilt church at bogdanovci and he could remember they had gone from here on a november night in light rain and total darkness the schoolteacher had led petars boy and tomislavs had followed and his cousin had been at the back they had taken with them the pram chassis two wheelbarrows and the handcart from the farm the guilt ate at him it had grown more acute with each hour since the lone arm had been turned up by the plough and had been agonising as the grave workers had excavated the sodden shapeless corpses he wanted it ended this time andrija believed his wife was in a front room and wouldnt have seen him go out of the open kitchen door at the back she would know nothing until the explosion he laid his crutch on the grass wet from the nights dew soon as the sun rose the moisture would be taken from it there was shade thrown by the beans and the grass was fresh and cool he bent his one knee and subsided the right leg was off just above the joint he had steadfastly refused a prosthetic limb getting down on to the grass jolted his spine hurting him and he winced he reached into his jacket pocket and took from it an rg hand grenade the fragmentation type the ring rattled the canister as he moved it inside its casing were andrija knew weapons and how to handle them grammes of high explosive a similar amount packed into an antipersonnel device had all but severed his right leg in the breakout the women and the wounded left in the cellar below the church he had managed to get some two and a half kilometres clear of the village a third of the distance to the safety of the forces round nustar or vinkovci and then had triggered a pomz antipersonnel mine fastened to a stake with a fine tripwire in the long grass to activate it he had already been in the corn for sixty hours and was dehydrated famished exhausted he was alone with no comrade to help him he had made a tourniquet above the wound from the laces of the boot on his right foot now useless and had dragged himself a little more than five kilometres it had taken two more days to reach the lines he could remember the dawn breaking over the cornfields when the teacher the boys and his cousin had not returned he had lain in cover with his snipers rifle and waited for sounds of them approaching ready to give covering fire the grenade had a delay on the fuse of four seconds from the pulling of the pin he would not be the first of his village two men had used a grenade in the last year to end the torment there had been three from the other villages more from the town two years before he had thought it would be easier with his handgun he held the grenade in his hand a big hand the grenade snug in it before the war he had delivered post in the three villages a good job that offered status security and a uniform he had not worked since they had come back to the village he heard his name called three or four times with rising impatience his wife maria had a strong voice a short temper since they had come back to the house thirteen years ago and rebuilt it they had not slept together as man and wife he had not penetrated her she had not opened herself to him she had never told him how many had raped her a section a platoon regular troops from the jna cetniks of arkan the terrorist in when the village had been held and then fallen andrija had been twentythree a star athlete and handsome so women had said maria had been twentyfive a beauty and ravenhaired now he was crippled disabled and destroyed and she was haggard her hair grey without lustre and cropped short they were removed from each other ate their meals in silence and slept so that they did not touch many in the village were scarred by the siege and the defeat he rolled on to his stomach the grenade gouged into his belly and the index finger of his left hand was inside the ring he could pull it he could end it he considered what his life consisted of there was no joy and everything was a burden he ate with her cleared the plates then sat on the porch and watched cars and lorries go past people who walked by would call to him but he would seldom answer only sucking at a cigarette in the middle of each morning he would head down the road to the cafe swinging on the crutch there he would be with tomislav and mladen and they would fight again the battles on the different pinch points of the perimeter they could take two hours to recreate the moments when the last rpg round had been fired against a slowmoving tank and two more hours to chew on the killing with the dragunov sniper rifle of a major whose death had stalled an infantry advance they took a minimum of two hours to talk over the bayonet battle at close quarters on the far side of the village when twelve had stopped forty in their tracks they were never defeated never found wanting in tactics or strategy as they sat in the cafe toyed with the coffee and smoked always they were betrayed by the government which had not allocated resources and fresh men and had not broken the siege of the town and the villages but they had also suffered the treachery of the weapons paid for but not delivered betrayal treachery every day in the cafe they blamed defeat on the two evils her voice was sharper demanding to know where in the garden he was she had collected everything of value in the village in a plastic shopping bag and during the day through the night the quiet times and when the bombardment was fiercest the people of their community had come to the kitchen of andrija and marias home and had brought with them everything of value they possessed jewellery ornaments heirlooms cash insurance policies house deeds it had all gone into the bag and been transferred to the care of zoran maria had stripped the villagers of all that was precious to them it should have bought the weapons but had not the anguish was worse because a grave had been found the american had been at andrijas house the last evening and had asked translated questions concerning the clothing his cousin had worn that night nineteen years before he was asked what colour undershirt and underpants what pattern on the socks and what sort of boots he had had no answers he had sat in his chair and said he did not know he thought his ignorance shamed him he had nothing to live for devils beset him only in death would he escape them he was kicked she stood over him his wife used the toe of her flat shoe to push him from his stomach on to his back and the grenade was exposed it was maria a principal voice among the women in the refugee camp who had demanded that each woman never replace her rings necklaces bracelets brooches and earrings until the betrayal and treachery were answered he closed his eyes she bent over him and he felt her breath on his face she did not kiss him had not kissed him on the day they were reunited in the refugee camp of wood huts in the mud on the south side of zagreb or on any day since and did not run her hand over the stubble on his cheeks or tousle his hair but she took his hand she prised the grenade away from him and he thought his finger would dislocate as she freed the pin so it would go on the misery and the anguish were on a conveyorbelt and he had no escape from them andrija did not know how betrayal and treachery could be answered and did not know how freedom could be regained she walked away from him with the grenade had he been prepared to pull the pin many had he pushed himself on to his side took his weight on his knee then levered himself up with his crutch he thought he would go to the cafe and fight again a day of the war he did not know how the evil done would be answered there had been a moment for robbie cairns of indecision it had been overcast sultry that morning on the south side of the river his tshirt had stuck to his chest and back when vern had picked him up in the car new number plates they had crossed southwark bridge and gone north had been close to the location when rain had spattered the windscreen rain mattered in rain would johnny cross lamps wilson put on a raincoat or hoist an umbrella then go down the street for his newspaper and a pot of tea would he say he could pick up the runners and riders later skip the cafe and do without his walk robbie cairns didnt fancy hanging about between the electronic gates and the estate agents with the recessed doorway or waiting opposite the newsagent on the other side of the street he wore a lightweight windcheater as unremarkable as everything else about him but it had an inner pocket in which the baikal pistol nestled he would hardly want to be stuck out on a pavement armed up not knowing whether the target would come to him or stay in and watch breakfast tv or shag his missus while the rain hosed his windows it wasnt robbie cairnss style to ask his elder brother for advice enough times in the past vern had been driving him towards a target when robbie had abruptly aborted he only had to say it was turnround time and vern would spin cut across traffic lanes and be well gone vern was not one to debate he did as he was told the indecision moment passed quickly some rubbish plastic bags and a sheet of tabloid newspaper were blowing down the pavement and a glance into the direction the wind was coming from showed that the rain was temporary theyd done all the talk no reason for him to do more explaining about where he would wait and where he would hit he had done all of that the previous evening then he had put the detail of a killing out of his mind and most of that evening he had been on the sofa with barbie watching tv not thinking about being up close to a target and doing the hit between the eyes with a converted baikal if he had wanted to abort he would have said so vern didnt prompt the first time robbie cairns had taken a life was a week after his twentyfirst birthday he was doing debt collecting going the rounds for a local man who dealt in tablets and skunk and the joker at the door had told the freshfaced lad who had come for the envelope to go piss yourself then he had laughed and spat at robbies feet a little of the mess had gone on robbies shoes robbie had not told the local man that his debt was as yet uncollected he had gone into the family network had hired the handgun and a halfdozen shells for the magazine three nights later he had been back at the door and was ringing the bell two issues to be resolved unpaid debt and respect first he had shot the man one bullet through the kneecap the pain had been sufficient to persuade him that paying up was sensible there had been a trail of blood across the carpet as the man had clung for support to furniture before getting to the safe and extracting the necessary cash but that had dealt only with the debt robbie had then settled the matter of respect if he hadnt laughed and spat the man would still have been walking awkwardly down a bermondsey street but he had so there was a handgun in his face nobody in the block had heard seen or knew anything the police had called it a wall of silence a few knew who had collected a debt and killed and word spread among those who regarded it necessary to have a guy of cool nerve on the edge of the payroll robbies second target was an albanian trying to muscle into the cocaine trade at canada water where the city people had their apartments a nightclub owner had hired him to take out a rival who interfered in profit margins since then four years in the trade the numbers had ticked up and a reputation had been established he was dropped off outside a minimart he was being cautious he went through and out at the side entrance the rain was easing he had a mile to walk and he blended well he went past the house and saw the car parked in the driveway he checked his watch and was satisfied between them his father and grandfather jerry cairns and granddad cairns took the contracts evaluated them put a price on them and slipped the necessary information to robbie he didnt need to know the customer just as he didnt need detail on the personal life of the target if his father or grandfather thought the money was right robbie cairns sent his sister to the quartermaster they used took out the weapon passed it and johnny cross lamps wilson ambled along the pavement and the last drips of the shower made the pavement glisten in the lights robbie didnt need to know anything about him robbie swivelled and looked behind himself left and into the cafe right and across the street then far ahead of him and over the shoulder of johnny cross lamps wilson he didnt see a policeman on foot on a bicycle or in a patrol car he stepped into the targets path maybe three or four seconds before his life was curtailed johnny cross lamps wilson realised the mortal danger confronting him the expressions on his face did a slideshow of emotions astonishment disbelief then the aggression that might have had a chance small of saving him the baikal was out safety lever off and aiming for the head the man tried to duck and to lunge robbie fired once a hell of a shot a class shot the target had been moving and weaving and the one shot had taken him clean through the front of the skull just above deep lines over the forehead the man crumpled the life of johnny cross lamps wilson was extinguished about halfway between the cafe and the newsagents the blood had not spread far on the pavement hadnt reached the kerb and the gutter before robbie cairns was away didnt run to run was to attract attention he just walked briskly went past the cafe down the side alley into the car park saw the car as it edged forward to meet him and he was gone it was like another notch for him he had done it well but then he always did back over the river the baikal would go to leanne his sister would move the weapon back to the armourer clear his clothing and dispose of it beyond the reach of the forensics people if he was in high demand his price would rise maybe he was the best he felt good confident and the car wasnt yet at any of the bridges that would take them south over the river and on to their own ground outside the newsagents the blood had not had time to congeal it was not territory they normally worked on vacation leave had eroded the teams based nearer to this murder site in tottenham bill said thats one shot professional a man who knows his business that is top grade there was white tenting behind the police tapes a photographer worked inside it and a scenesofcrime technician had bent to make a chalk mark on the wet paving that circled the single discharged cartridge case the flap was lifted by a local detective and the young woman had pride of place at the front mark roscoe was at her shoulder and the yorkshireman craned behind him suzie said the target isnt some innocent wilsons record goes back twentyeight of his fortyfive years he was a hustler ducked and wove therell be a deal in the immediate background where hes come up short or welshed hell have known where he shouldnt be where he was threatened on his own patch he must have felt secure the body lay awkward and angled a leg bent under the weight of the stomach an impossible contortion for a living man the colour had already drained from the hands and ankles and from the face except where the hole was very neat precise could have dropped a pencil into it roscoe scratched his chin the sight of death seldom fazed him theres a shooter right in front of his face not a man who freezes suzie had confidence and gave her opinion as if it was expected of her they had come up to north london because there was little to detain them in their office and the failed airconditioning was an incentive to be clear of their workspace the word immediate on the team screens was that the killing had been simple and ruthless that the hitman should be of interest bill said would have taken evasive action its right in his face his life on the line suzie said but only one shot discharged its a quality hit boss bill said about as good as it gets roscoe grimaced then turned on his heel his own girl chrissie did scenesofcrime funny thing but hed never met up with her inside a tent she shared with a cadaver back at their flat he wouldnt tell her about the killing of wilson a tosser who must have overstepped whatever line was drawn in front of him and she wouldnt tell him where shed been and what bodies shed sidled towards with her box of tricks and kit they both did needtoknow took the principle to the limits and had little to talk about they relied on sex hiking on welsh cumbrian and scottish mountains anything and anywhere that challenged and movies when one or both would be asleep within half an hour he liked her a lot was comfortable with her but they didnt seem either of them to fancy commitment he walked away bill followed and suzie skipped to keep up he hadnt spoken to chrissie that morning shed been gone when hed woken her half of the bed empty he hadnt spoken to her the night before because there had been a briefing on developments from the cache and by the time he came back shed already been in bed light out regular breathing that said sleep he hadnt wanted to disturb her they might get some time at the weekend and might not bill was another seldom disturbed by corpses and violent death he said cheerfully what id think boss is what would you think not usual for roscoe to be scratchy sour forget it boss sorry was playing the pig what would you say id think that would be a good player to put in the cage boss all right off our usual ground but hes a man wholl move and wont just be local were late on the scene its already happened and the remit is to be proactive but what i think boss is the jokers a good guy to put away suzie said breathy hed come at a price and hed be in demand they were at the car roscoe wondered how it would be to look into the face of a man who held a handgun had no shake in his hands had certainty in his eyes wondered how it would be to see the finger tighten on the trigger bar didnt know the hospital in vukovar was a fifteenminute drive from the village it was a pleasant site with space left among the buildings for lawns trees and flowers on one of the larger and more expansive areas of grass a white canvas marquee had been erected and next to it was parked a refrigerated trailer a dieselpowered generator throbbed between them the hospital had history and william anders had helped to put it on the lists of genocidal war crimes his work now courtesy of businessclass travel and a reasonable degree of comfort took him to the places where atrocities had blackened a name he was back and felt good vukovar and the hospital had been early among his achievements a large part of his reputation as a forensic scientist had been built on the excavation of the murdered corpses of men who had been brought from the hospital by the victors of the battle driven from the town to the farm then slaughtered dumped in a pit and buried anders had been in the second wave of experts to descend on vukovar and he would say it himself his work had been of the highest quality that day he had four bodies in the marquee and the trailer skeletons with clothing still clinging to them he had only the names dental and medical records had been lost in the firestorms when the town had suffered artillery bombardment and bombing there were no rings on the fingers no silver or gold crucifixes hanging from chains but he had height approximations and descriptions of clothing from two parents and a widow he had done the boys first the father of one was the farmer whose land had been mined and whose plough had exposed the grave site the other father lived alone and kept his home as a shrine the interpreter had told anders behind a hand that the mother had been serb and had run with the younger children scraps of clothing were sufficient for identification and estimates of size stature the third the cousin was decided by elimination there was always a problem with the results thrown up by his painstaking examinations with his small brush a spatula and a trowel much smaller than his wife would use on her geranium pots in faraway san diego he had the skills to say how a victim had been put to death with each corpse he had found bullet and shrapnel scars on bones then holes and rents in the surviving clothing but he had also removed the remnants of decayed gristle from the mouths usually he maintained total honesty in conversation with victims loved ones and in his detailed reports to investigating magistrates and lawenforcement agencies he knew of the mutilation of the three young men and now turned to the last he had the shape of an older man from the construction of the pelvic bones and could imagine the weight from the tread of the boots worn that night therefore he had a name as background he had been informed by a policeman and it was corroborated by a hospital official that a small group had been in the cornfields waiting for a munitions delivery they had stayed too long and had disappeared until the plough had found them the smell was foul it was extraordinary even to this forensic scientist how the stench of the longdead could penetrate his plastic gown to his skin and was hard to remove even with intense scrubbing he started to work through the pockets of a battlefield camouflage tunic coins the fragments of a cigarette packet a lighter a handkerchief still folded a smooth pebble that might have been a keepsake a comb but this was a man of authority in the community and anders understood the necessity of appearance even in a goddamn lifeanddeath military scenario lightweight gloves a little torch and a small can of boot polish he assumed it was for smearing on the face by a man who couldnt tolerate bending to pick up mud and wipe that on his cheeks there was also a wad of folded paper in the pit that had been gouged for the four bodies this corpse was the last to be lifted clear it had been first in the deepest and was the best preserved there was more flesh on the bones and the clothing had lasted as had the boots and the folded paper it was the only piece of paper he had found on any of them he asked an assistant for clean gloves and another pair of tweezers similar to those his wife used on her eyebrows when he had what he had requested and the clean gloves were on his hands he used his own tweezers and those brought to him to open the closely folded sheet the preservation was remarkable but that didnt surprise william anders neither did the clarity of the writing letters and numbers it started as half the size of a postage stamp opened out the single sheet of paper discoloured and crossed with the folding lines was a little larger than the packet of twenty marlboro lite cigarettes that was already bagged he used a magnifyingglass to read there were moments on all the digs and autopsies when he was able to insinuate himself into the lives of the dead in srebrenica rwanda east timor by an excavated pit outside baghdad and the place where a husband had buried his wife then playacted anguish for local tv stations when he had called back a truth from the past he didnt know the significance of what he read but he sensed a moment of importance the blood rushed into his face with the magnifyingglass covering the smoothed paper he could make out the name and the individual numbers his back hurt had stiffened he felt the craving of the addiction and wasnt inclined to fight it he dropped the paper into a plastic sleeve called a halt and told the assistant they would break for lunch a sandwich whatever he was never put off eating by handling decomposing bodies and the smell that settled in the pores of his skin never put off a drink and a smoke he shrugged out of the robe moved the face mask high on to his forehead kicked off the plastic boots and shed the gloves he pushed open the plastic sheets draped over an airlock entry to the marquee and stepped outside each morning before he went to work on whatever death site on whichever continent he topped up his hip flask with irish whiskey and loaded the leather cigar case to capacity there had been an anglicised name and a phone number a different ballpoint had been used to write the name of a hotel he took a serious gulp from the hip flask and felt the glow swill down his throat then he used the cutter to trim the end of a cigar and lit it he wondered who harvey gillott was and in what town or city he could find the hotel continental setaliste andrije kacica mosica i was told you were back in town so i called by anders turned it was the one man he knew in vukovar and could call a friend a wiry little runt he held the cigar between his teeth and let the grin spread it was a mark of affection daniel steyn reckoned he didnt think too many others had been offered three swigs from the thimblesized screw cap at the mouth of the hip flask good stuff there was an irish bar further down zupanijska opposite the site of the command bunker for the vukovarske brigade but the prices were beyond his budget he had been offered a cigar which he had declined instead he lit another cigarette they were cheap brought across the danube by smugglers from serbia usually using the area downriver near ilok steyn said its become legend not in the mythical sense because it happened believe me the teacher extraordinarily had a line into a weapons broker and concluded a deal cut out government bypassed the defence ministry kept the local military in complete ignorance the teacher said and would have been about right that theyd commandeer any hardware government and ministry had given up on vukovar and would have shipped it into the front line protecting zagreb while the local military would have tried to get it into vukovar rather than the villages where a thousand fighters were on their last legs and their weapons were useless for lack of resupply i never heard that before not in all the times ive been here steyn dragged hard on his cigarette then flipped it on to the grass which in on november had been covered with bodies on the night the weapons were supposed to arrive the teacher and three other men went into the cornfields a damn hazardous route and towards vukovar along the fragile lifeline they called the cornfield road they were caught in the open at dawn and the stuff theyd paid for never came you got them in there anders gestured towards the tenting and the small refrigerated truck he and steyn were from different disciplines the forensic scientist dealt with the fatal injuries caused by mass execution major bomb blasts such as oklahoma city or murder where time should have ravaged the potential clues left by a killer daniel steyn was a general practitioner of medicine but with a bent towards a meld of psychology and psychiatry his father ran a hardware store in smalltown upstate new york so he had paid his own way through university at madisons medical faculty he had practised for a few years in the city and pitched up seventeen years ago in vukovar where he had thought there would be a job worth doing he was now part of the fabric of society there loathed by local politicians and despised by the towns doctors but he hung on and spoke unpleasant truths he rejoiced when a friend turned up another cigarette was lit and another ring of ash fell from the cigar the thimble cup of the hip flask was filled again and passed steyn asked in a harsh eastcoast grating accent you find anything on the bodies rings jewellery religious gear nothing theres a big blame culture here theyre quality at chucking blame but not at themselves theyre always victims right now there are two targets for a shit bucket of blame first the government that abandoned them that was treachery second the man with whom a deal was supposedly done and left them standing unprotected in a field of dead corn that was betrayal theyd paid up front that was where the legend was born keep going i have until my smoke is completed steyn jabbed a finger in emphasis the legend is about a collection a price was agreed for the munitions and i dont know exactly what they were but they would have been important for the defence of that community and expensive everything that anyone owned of value in that village which was under siege shelled mortared and bombed was dropped into a bag and used as currency for the purchase it went down the drain the weapons drop was never made that is betrayal in my book only the teacher had the name of the seller and he didnt share it you with me the living dont know who betrayed them did it jump out at you the cigar was nearly finished and guttered in his fingers anders said no woman i saw wore even the cheapest earrings and there wasnt a brooch or bracelet in sight not even a trinket youd get out of a cracker at a kids party because a pulse beats in the place that no woman will wear so much as a wedding ring to replace what they put into the bag until revenge has been taken on whoever sold them short they live in the past more so than any other community here that suffered and plenty did that village and community are trapped heh it makes for clients i could do a years work on that one village and not have seen half of them the cigar butt was thrown down two hundred and sixty people had been taken from the underground bombproof shelter of the hospital the wounded and the staff who cared for them and butchered two hundred bodies had been taken from the ground and identified by william anders and many colleagues sixty remained hidden buried steyn knew his friend would keep coming back until the last grave was found theyd have dinner together one night his housekeeper would cook he had little money but the woman did miracles with what he could give her on the refrigerator in his kitchen he had stuck postcards anders had sent him from corners of the world where graves had been uncovered god he valued the mans company he clasped his friends shoulder and saw a car pull up a mercedes series saloon daniel steyn had not treated the village leader but knew him and his history the door was slammed he was acknowledged a question was asked steyn translated do you have the identifications i do he asks whether anything of significance has been found he watched anders raw weathered face he saw little lines form in it as if a matter was worthy of consideration then an answer not for me to censor hell this isnt a business in which we suppress we throw light we shine the beam into dark places what do you want me to say tell him to wait right here william anders pocketed the hip flask strode back to the marquee and through the flaps that kept the internal air chilled the man he knew him as mladen told steyn that one of the veterans had that morning come near to suicide but his wife had found him and a hand grenade was now back in the box beside the dragunov rifle that a sniper had once used which man he was given a name he knew the man with the crudely choppedoff leg surgeons under pressure had done their best with minimal time and skill anders was behind him translate this there was a piece of paper in the teachers pocket folded close enough for writing to survive theres a name harvey gillot and a phone number in a different ink and therefore written later theres the name of a hotel too anders passed him a sheet of paper on which he had written the name the number and the address daniel steyn didnt know whether he would have done that probably not but hell it was nineteen years ago and any trail would have chilled mladen took the paper he said softly harvey gillot harvey gillot harvey gillot does she have anything interesting or marginally relevant on harvey gillot her line manager put the question without looking up from his laptop penny laing thought it blatant rudeness not to make eye contact she feigned indifference i sent it over to you do you want it sent again his head was still lowered she wondered what he was reading that so captivated him maybe the new guidelines on safeguards required by humanrights legislation for intrusive surveillance maybe the runners tomorrow at doncaster maybe the revised pension estimates for hmrc she stood waited made silent complaint he said i didnt learn whether you thought she was worth going to following sticking with thats what im asking she ground a fingernail into her palm and let the pain remind her that sourness was the fast track back to vat work or worse yes she was but am i allowed to say it the whole scenario got right up my nose i did time in the democratic republic of congo and now the line manager interrupted with a sweet smile to match his voice and ive worked in halifax glasgow and plymouth why is megs behan worth sticking with can i be blunt blunt will do because she has better assets than i do because shes better informed than i can ever be she knows where gillot is what deals hes doing when hes in ostend and what charters are then flying out and are you getting me its humiliating to be traipsing to an organisation like that when we dont have the resources to do a proper job stick with her yes remember the downturn the crisis the crunch i do with my corn flakes each morning also remember were somewhat of a luxury a good conscience appeaser for legislators the church and the pink brigade were a natural target for budgetslicing to survive we need collars felt court cases convened and sentences passed sorry and all that please regular reports on harvey gillot who is likely to be a right little shite he was back at his laptop penny laing headed for her desk and wondered whether he was indeed an enemy she swigged water and thought a thunderstorm was brewing wondered if the target was touchable the photograph in the file showed what she would have called a chancers face harvey gillot oh yes bloody hell id nearly lost him who benjie harvey gillots the name deirdre little man i used to know and know no longer one place for him he had been known as benjie since he was sent as a boarder to preparatory school sixtyone years before by christening he was benjamin cumberland arbuthnot he and his wife deirdre lived in a small dampridden corner of her family seat handed down on a line of inheritance for some two and a half centuries he was now on the move it was his seventieth year so their son and daughterinlaw were giving them the push from the west wing two floors of it and consigning them to a cottage beyond the chapel adjacent to the pets cemetery clearout time he might have been arrested banged up in a cell without his tie belt and shoelaces if special branch had done a search and found the caches of classified papers tea chests of them he had accumulated during his time as an officer of the secret intelligence service there was a brochure for a hotel in a croatian coastal town fastened with a paperclip to a threepage typewritten report secret stamped in red on each page he tossed it into the scorched oil drum that acted as an incinerator more on that trip and more stamped pages than all the files from peshawar he was a magpie unable to help himself had always needed to take copies home always forgot to send them to archive or an official shredder i dont remember that name you never met him deirdre did we never have him for a gin in peshawar god no we did not careful you silly ass benjie are you trying to singe yourself flames leaped it had to be done half his damn life there in the chests now going into the fire the balkans the afghan trafficking of weapons too many files from buenos aires in late when relations were being restored over gin and more gin with the secretariat of state intelligence the balkans and afghanistan were now unrecognisable grey flakes of burned paper he said harvey gillot was just a little man who was useful for a brief window of time then we closed the window and drew the curtain with a fire like this we can get rid of damn near everything but whether i have any eyebrows left is a moot point he had always seemed an idiot could give a polished impression of imbecility and was clever at playing the fool he chuckled as a flurry of seriously compromising documents spilled into the inferno a bit of a nobody who had his moment regarded me as god damn memory id almost forgotten harvey gillot harvey gillot he betrayed us maria said betrayed us and stole from us the widow said his word was worthless the schoolbus driver said we could have held back the tanks if wed had the little baby that harvey gillot promised he would deliver to us the k malyutka we had paid for it said the man who had only one lung he had lost the other to shrapnel and the surgeons had marvelled at his survival andrija leaned against the inner door jamb they were in his kitchen and only a single bulb hanging from the ceiling lit the table in the centre of the concrete floor there was no linoleum or carpeting and no shade over the bulb some stood some lounged against the kitchen units but his wife and the widow had taken the hardbacked chairs at the table in front of them lay the slip of paper brought from the hospital he had a pain in his abdomen from the kick she had given him he offered them no alcohol no coffee but there was a filled water jug on the table and plastic glasses she had been raped on the kitchen floor seven years later when they had returned he had knelt on his one knee and she had gone to the far side of the kitchen together they had ripped up the flooring on which she had lain dragged it outside and burned it the scum had been drunk she would not have alcohol in her home now we can find him maria said it is owed to those who died to those who suffered and survived defeated to search for him the widow said as one looks for a rat in a grain store maria again andrija thought he saw faint light in her eyes she had not touched him when he had lain in the bed after the amputation and she had come to the hospital in the centre of zagreb from the camp nor when he had been discharged and she had brought him back to the camp or years later when they had returned to the village their front door had been ajar and they had realised that a serb family had left within the last twentyfour hours for eighty days andrija had been a key fighter in the villages defence creating terror in the enemy trenches but she frightened him and showed him no affection and one stamps on the rat and stamps again the man who drove the cesspit tanker said it is owed to those who were in the corn to those who were wounded tortured and violated because the village fell simun mladens son had been two weeks old when the defence of the village was broken i think harvey gillot will have forgotten about us but he will remember maria spat the widow said almost with a smile of pleasure he will remember my husband to whom he gave a promise mladen the village leader who had been an electrician and now drove a mercedes saloon said everything we had except our lives was taken by harvey gillot it was an act of treachery andrija made no contribution he had taken no part on that longago evening of decisiontaking he had not been there to speak for or against the purchase of wireguided antitank missiles he had been in a culvert drain that ran under a track that went into the corn there had been a bare open strip perhaps because the seed had been diseased when that batch was planted to which he could slide on his stomach from the culvert to gain a clear view of the enemy lines some two hundred metres away he had dropped an officer a medical orderly and a stretcherbearer such was the fear he caused in the enemy that the bodies were left to the elements on his way back into the village he had used a sharp flint to scratch three more lines on the wooden butt of the rifle his wife had organised the collection of valuables that the teacher had demanded andrijas opinion had not been required then either in the darkness men and women had come to his back door he had seen the little items of jewellery and heard the clatter of rings as they were pulled from fingers and dropped on to the table there had been envelopes that contained house deeds his wife maria had not thanked those who gave what they had all that was precious to them just tipped it into a shopping bag which the teacher had taken the next day along the cornfield road would the delivery of forty or fifty k malyutka the little baby have made any difference to the outcome of the battle would the antitank weapons have held up the enemys advance on the village indefinitely would they have kept the kukuruzni put open for another two weeks or a month andrijas eyes roved the room he noted who spoke and who did not petar and tomislav had said nothing and they had lost sons neither had josip we will find harvey gillot when we search for him he cannot hide maria said it was a smallwattage bulb and shadows riddled his kitchen andrija knew what would be decided he should know of our agony and be punished for it the widow sniffed she was the judge who passed sentence on a man condemned him he will be found will suffer and be killed and he will know why maria was panting a little as she once had when she touched him and he her the chorus chimed agreement thirty men and five women all except josip had fought for the village all had suffered loss as andrija had he could not picture the man harvey gillot could not have guessed at his features mladen returned them to reality how we are here where do we go i think he is british but i have never been to britain we have to consider if andrijas wife maria slapped her hand on the table we will pay for a man the widow ran her tongue over dried cracked lips withered by the summer sun we will buy a man andrija watched their leaders face saw hesitation it was of course inevitable that this course would be chosen and that none would speak against it since the start of the siege the women had been most ferocious in their hatred of the enemy the first to denounce traitors and accuse others of betrayal they were merciless not one wounded man from the enemys ranks had survived a night abandoned by his colleagues in no mans land in front of the villages guns the women had gone out with knives and ended the whimpering of conscript casualties who would deny them at that moment he almost sympathised with the leaders dilemma who do you pay where do you buy josip spoke i know who you should pay harvey gillot came home late it was a tedious journey from heathrow but the location suited him the isle of portland on the coast of dorset ticked his boxes as usual he had done the return leg in a devious and roundabout way tbilisi to frankfurt a change of aircraft and carrier to lhr the shuttle bus to reading then the train to weymouth and the longstay car park at the station he drove an audi a saloon the ticked boxes did not include proximity to the cliff deposits of the jurassic age in which giant ammonites and even dinosaur bones were preserved as fossils the wild beauty of the promontory that jutted out into the english channel or the extraordinary and unique chesil beach constructed by nature from a hundred million tones of shingle past which he now drove neither was he excited by the prospect of the yachting programme in the olympiad which would take place in the wide artificial bay to his left the island lay in front of him pocked with lights the wedge of valued stone the best quarried in the country suitable for the solemnity of military graveyards did not interest him he felt the warmth of coming home not at returning to josie to whom he had been married for eighteen years and his daughter fiona who was now fifteen he couldnt remember whether it was school holidays still or halfterm yet whether she would be at home or not there was the dog incredibly or stupidly loyal to him he didnt know how long it would be before pretences were locked into a cupboard and the key chucked the warmth he felt was not for his wife daughter or dog but for the place itself the boxes were ticked more boldly when darkness blanketed the causeway he had his privacy here isolation protection anonymity there was only one road along the causeway linking the island to the mainland gillot liked that the island was a place where strangers were noticed if they stepped off the few tourist paths and were away from the bill on the southern tip where the lighthouse was in the trade he practised close to the edge of whatever goddamn legislation had most recently been enacted he assumed he was under variable degrees of surveillance by the plodding hmrc alpha team and there were other risks it was inevitable in the trade that toes would be trodden on and noses disjointed his security and his familys had dictated the move to the island he had not explained it frankly to josie had not told her of two warnings coming within a month in tel aviv an israeli had told him you sell to the jews if the arabs you deal with knew of your link to us it would go bad for you as it would if you sold them items we had not first sanctioned we too have a long arm four weeks later he had been walking across martyrs square in the heart of damascus with his guide from the defence ministry the man had waved expansively at the space and said this is where we executed the israeli spy cohen who betrayed us it was and is the correct punishment for spies and betrayers in his old home he had felt vulnerable threatened on his return from syria he had slapped it on the market gone in search of a remote property and had bought one with little reference to josie this was now his home and he powered the audi through the narrow winding streets of lower town and up towards higher town he felt again the warmth of coming home and yes he looked forward to seeing his dog he would have been there in daylight but for the meeting in frankfurt he lived within a network brokers came to him he went to them confidentiality and trust were guaranteed a german dealer had access to the shipping the rustbucket freighter that would sail from a bulgarian port to a georgian dockside trust was everything in the world he had inherited from his mentor solly lieberman his hand had been gripped by the germans as the price was agreed the dates of payment and of the cargo being loaded once he would have talked to josie about the deal and cracked open a bottle a floodlight played on the war memorial the highest point on the island he swept past the hotel then veered east towards the coast road he would go past the gaols and then on to the wide old road that would take him home to its warmth and security it was a hell of a good deal worthy of celebration and if harvey gillot had to celebrate alone that would not kill the pleasure the audis lights raked the front gates of his property he used his zapper drove inside and parked she didnt come to open the car door for him but at least the dog was barking a welcome from inside he was home where all the boxes were ticked josip was always going to be on the periphery of the inner circle in the village a moment in his history had determined that he was outside the dominant group he did not try to scale the barriers instead he ingratiated himself was too useful to be rejected out of hand the result his opinions were canvassed and his advice was accepted that is what happened in now at last we have his name a few bends downstream from the town of vukovar lay the sprawling village of ilok best known for the quality of the wine produced in the local vineyards ilok was an historic crossing point over the danube and a modern bridge linked croatian and serbian territory for centuries trading had been part of the two communities lives and hatreds were brief violent then put to one side by those for whom trafficking was a way of life before serb main battle tanks and armoured personnel carriers had crossed the bridge to wipe away resistance at vukovar and the satellite villages trading had been primarily in cigarettes coming from turkey or montenegro and destined for the german and austrian markets once the inconvenience of fullscale war was removed and infant statelets were born smuggling entered new dimensions women arms classa narcotics computer chips and illegal immigrants were moved from serbia to croatia across the danube and the favourite route was east to west where mature forests came down to the riverbanks and small inlets were not watched he stole what was paid to him he betrayed the village it is a matter of honour josip came to ilok high on the hillside above the river there was a castle in a state of ongoing decay but government funds for restoration were exhausted other than the lawns and walls around a church on the site it was pitiful and abandoned but a good place for a rendezvous he met two men and they sat together in the shade smoked and shared a bottle of mineral water the heat blistered down around them as they talked we cannot do it we want to hire a man who can the two men josip met who sat on the fallen masonry with him featured prominently on the police computers in belgrade and zagreb and the older one was listed on europols fifty most wanted which circulated in european capitals alone of the villagers josip had contacts in organised crime which now he tapped into there was a scrap of paper preserved in a plastic wrapper there was a name a telephone number and the address of a hotel on croatias northern adriatic coast how to find a man who could be hired how to find a man who would kill to order the village has condemned him for us there is no forgiveness harvey gillot is dead in the summer of josip had been thirtyfive an insurance salesman able to practise successfully under the loose commercial constraints of yugoslav communism he had opened offices in vukovar osijek and vinkovci near the bus station in vukovar close to the town hall in osijek and with a view over the railway shunting yards in vintovci he lived in the village was married had two small boys and was held up in his community as an example of the virtues of thrift and hard work although three offices sounded grand the rewards were solid rather than great and the future seemed secure anyone with an overview of his affairs professional and domestic would have realised that his commitment to the village was less than wholehearted his wife was from north of zagreb where her parents lived in may a few kilometres from the village and close to the big shoe factory at borevo selo twelve croatian policemen had been killed by cetnik paramilitaries twenty more were wounded a month later artillery shells fell regularly on vukovar the columns of smoke could be seen from the village and the communities prepared for fullscale fratricide civil war between neighbours zoran the teacher who had taught josip mathematics led the village in a hectic programme of preparation trenches were dug the bunker was strengthened drugs were stockpiled ammunition and weapons distributed tomislavs wife a serb left with her younger children but her eldest son stayed nobody in the village helped her as she walked past the fortifications then over a wooden footbridge that spanned the vuka and away along a track that would take her to brsadin where her family were from she took one suitcase and did not wave to her husband and eldest son that night josips wife told him that she too would be leaving she was a catholic croat their children were catholic croats he was a catholic croat the similarities between her and tomislavs wife were minimal at four oclock the following morning he had written a letter of abject apology scrawled zorans name on the envelope and left it sealed on the kitchen table he had driven away at a few minutes after five and the dog had run after them to the outer roadblock where there was a chicane between two felled tree trunks the children had been sobbing and the picket at the roadblock had caught the dog they would have seen the cases bags and bedding in the car and would have known that a coward did not have the stomach to fight josip was well regarded by the two serbs he now met and that was history we will pay well he said believe me he had sat out the war in zagreb the village had fallen a little more than a week later he had heard of the death throes of vukovar from the radio croatia reporter sinisa glavasevi he had gone out that night drunk himself insensible and slept for half a morning under bushes in front of the railway station he had not known that while he was drinking and stumbling between bars glavasevi was being beaten and clubbed a few hours later he was shot and dumped in a pit on farmland josip had come back to the apartment he had rented to find it empty his wife and the children had gone to her own family he had started to build a business in the capital city and to gather in clients a professional killer not an amateur that is what my village demands he would see his wife on the last friday in each month and hand over an envelope filled with banknotes he had done that through and and until when he was arrested the book was thrown at him fraud embezzlement illegal use of clients money in the spring of a judge at the county court had sentenced josip to thirty months in gaol he had earned respect and gratitude he wrote letters for fellow prisoners advised on the best securities in which their money could be invested he counselled on legal argument and was a champion of convicts rights he was protected the son of the older man with whom he sat at ilok had been in the adjacent cell for thirteen months of josips sentence no one else in the village would have known how to insinuate a request for a contract into the ranks of balkan organised crime we require a man in the killing trade he received no guarantee it was suggested that questions would be asked and a price considered then he would be told what was possible he hugged the older man whose son now languished in belgrades central prison and would stay there for another seven years and clasped the hand of the second he did not think it peculiar that he a croat who had run from battle should seek the aid of a serb whose people had butchered and raped burned and destroyed his village the worlds of zagreb district gaol and smuggling across the danube did not acknowledge ethnic divisions josip said i am grateful for your time and and will be grateful for your help it is necessary to us that harvey gillot is killed and that before he dies he suffers as we did please what im saying harvey is that the trough is getting smaller but the same number of snouts are looking for their share wouldnt say i disagree charles his guest was a sales manager at a prominent industrial company specialising in the manufacture of military equipment the products glossily depicted in colour brochures did not include armourplated vehicles weapons or body armour but were confined to two areas of electronics communications and vision aids harvey gillot did good business with these people they were at a pleasant restaurant within walking distance of the ministry of defence hm revenue and customs parliament and the foreign and commonwealth office what might have been described laughably as the pulsebeat of the nation he liked oneonone lunches were cutting back on the paris stand this year halving the personnel we send to dubai and thats a big shout letting one in five of the sales team go i mean harvey its not just that money everywhere is tight its also all the ethics crap its becoming harder every day to get permission to export and an enduser certificate past the bloody bureaucrats down the road do they want factories closing skilled productionline craftsmen chucked on the scrap heap look harvey ive got eucs the military list the sanctions lists and delivery verification certificates half burying me those bastards with ridiculous pension schemes are looking after themselves and making it bloody hard for me to survive very good steak harvey am i ranting no way the man opposite gillot who ate a tenounce steak as if he was half starved and would have done a minimum of four lunches a week as a guest regarded him as a friend not reciprocated harvey gillot could be pleasant might appear generous or to confide indiscretions but he didnt carry friendship in his backpack it was another choice morsel of advice fed to him by solly lieberman friends were for the pub and the bridge table not for business he had few friends and many acquaintances he sensed already that charles looking at balance sheets in his salesdirector office studying cashflow and performance graphs was under big pressure to keep turnover ticking where are those on high looking favourably at the moment best for licences on the current list are greece japan malaysia singapore oman saudi romania thailand and you get a nice little pat on the head if its the united states of bloody america anything else and its how the mood takes them what about georgia his guest was not the only one looking at the twin contradictions of income and expenditure harvey gillot lived and entertained well a good house a good car and an appearance of affluence customers had to believe that his stall in the marketplace was guaranteed by ongoing balancesheet performance he wore a good suit a good shirt and a good tie solly lieberman always said that customers and clients were to be impressed not befriended my last mention of georgia to a starched shirt was what id call inconclusive georgia would be looked at and very closely wasnt a green light and wasnt a big red one if its ballsbreakingly cold we need russian gas and moscow hates tbilisi it would be the red light if the suns shining theres a heatwave and we dont need the gas it might be a green one i would have thought its tread carefully with georgia i wouldnt want to know harvey harvey gillot had a restaurant routine he would book a table and ask for one near the window the door the bar or the band then arrive and say he had changed his mind he wanted somewhere on the other side of the restaurant so that if he was targeted and audio surveillance was aimed at the table the listeners would have a chief financial officer chatting up his pa he leaned forward asked the question softly things fall off lorries dont they there have been errors in stock control we do our damnedest to prevent such leakage as harvey you would expect the booked table had been beside the window the one at which they sat was in the centre of the room top of my list i think would be communications gear enough for one brigade a crack one something their opposition cant break into it would go down well with some people im cosy with you a target at the moment harvey always a target goes with the territory everyone wants the best communications but the money isnt in the bag like it was five years ago youre all right arent you of course but we all have to pedal a damn sight harder now to stand still all right the mortgage went out on bankers order as did the school fees josies spending and housekeeping money were on more bankers orders and there was what she needed for the gardener each week all right yes all right im expecting to survive put it this way charles the clouds up there are a little grey but not carrying thunderclaps sunny skies ahead and the horizons pretty clear but if a system came along on a dark night good encryption and security location friendly if you dont mind trade jargon for a brigadesized unit i might just jump up and down and payment would be wherever they do a very decent meal here it was regular form the sales director reached slowly for his inner pocket but harvey gillot intercepted his arm before he could produce his wallet thanks very much harvey really good to see you again charles if anything comes my way that needs topoftherange comms stuff your people will be my first port of call he glanced at the bill slipped his platinum card into the reader and tapped out his number he stood he was smiling confident and the cold wind of recession did not appear to buffet him again thank you harvey will i be seeing you at the fair next week well have some good stuff for the punters to paw i dont think so they walked together out on to the street up a road and past the armed police who guarded the back of the security service building and he traded in firearms he trafficked them brokered them bought and sold them and was surprised that the sight of those guns unsettled him the sales director bent his ear with a joke a message went from belgrade to the slovakian city of bratislava and a question was asked a man was named and a phone number given for a suburb of the greek capital athens the caller was told that this man was the best supreme in his field of operations an introduction would cost but the price would not be exorbitant a man living in a fine villa with good coastal views out to the east of athens high on a gently sloping hill where only his extended family had won the town administrations approval for development took a call from a valued friend an email exchange was arranged through a third party in an internet cafe a man who was capable there were many one from ankara was mentioned another from tirana had found employment in sofia in a dispute between commercial entities a third from bucharest was thought to be expert but perhaps too old where was the work to be found in london the man in athens hesitated his fingers hovered over the keys then rapped out a response for such work and for a craftsman of the necessary expertise i would not suggest employing a man however skilled from turkey albania or romania find a man nearer to the workplace for the contract the man in bratislava was now beyond the scope of his contacts not so the man in athens would a fee be applicable it would of course robbie cairns was stretched out on the sofa barbie would have been at work but for his phone call he had rung and she had made an excuse to her supervisor feeling faint must be the bug doing the rounds and had come back from the oxford street store where she worked in womens fragrances he dozed it was early afternoon and robbie cairns had nothing else to do nowhere else to be so he had phoned her and she had come almost running to rotherhithe he did not own the apartment that was on the second floor of a big new block across the road from christopher close and up from the jubilee line station he rented it for her she was installed he might come in the evening or early in the morning and he would telephone her if she was already at work he expected her if he rang to pack in work stop shopping or walk out of a hairdressing salon she was nine years older than him that didnt bother robbie and he wasnt the subject of gossip for having a girlfriend who was near middleaged when he was not far out of his teens there was no behindthehand sniggering about his relationship because he kept her secret from his family he could see her in the kitchenette she would be preparing the salad to go with his favourite stilton cheese omelette barbie was not as pretty as his sister leanne she had stouter ankles a thicker waist her chest drooped and there were grey strands in her hair that the bottle had missed she dressed severely straight black or navy skirt and blouse she wore no rings she was seven years divorced and robbie had never taken her to a jewellers and let her choose a ring that would have cost a few thousand she had no bracelets necklaces or gold pendants what then he didnt know he could see her moving quietly from the sink to the work surface to the fridge her legs were bare and she wore no shoes her back was to him he didnt know why she had agreed to move into the flat or why she accepted the relationship he was not fond particularly of grandma cairns or of his other grandmother mum davies he had no affection for dot cairns his mother who had moved away from the albion estate and lived now in a bungalow in kent on the edge of a village between meopham and snodland barbie didnt boss him she didnt challenge him he had never been asked what he brought to her life they had been together in this distanced way for eight months he had been up in the west end in oxford street in the department store and he and leanne had been together joshing she had wanted perfume and they had found fragrances he had sent leanne back to lingerie and said he would surprise her then robbie cairns hitman and pride of a notorious rotherhithe family had met a divorcee from the west midlands who knew nothing of southeast london the heritage and history of its big names she had sprayed her wrists with sample after sample letting him smell the scents with a little mocking mischief in her eyes he had bought a bottle of yves st laurent for leanne and had gone back the next day he had waited on a bench until her shift had finished then done it twice more the next week she had agreed to go for a coffee with him he could have been with the quality girls of other families in walworth rotherhithe bermondsey peckham or southwark the great lookers and an alliance would have been forged but he had chosen barbie from fragrances in a department store couldnt explain it his brother and sister his parents and grandparents didnt need to know maybe later in the afternoon after theyd eaten what she was preparing for him theyd go to bed maybe they wouldnt if they did afterwards hed shower and then hed slip away he never stayed the whole night did she know what he did for a living he hadnt told her and she had never asked after a hit hed come to the flat and turn on the local london news to hear what the detectives were saying and see the people in white suits crawling over the street scene but she never asked why he watched so intense robbie cairns had a real affection for his barbie couldnt match it for anyone else she soothed him and kept him calm she was the only person man or woman he needed and he waited for the next callout for the next time his father was satisfied with a deal and gave it a green light a link in lublin southeastern poland threw up the number of a payasyougo mobile one of thousands being manoeuvred virtually untraceable around northern europe a call was made to the number gulls howled and fought as they dived for fish scraps a german stood on a quayside close to the old fish market in hamburg and said that if work was to be done in london a local man should do it would a fee be paid most certainly the german made a trifling remark about the purchaser and was told that it was not he but they a village had gone forward with the contract would buy a man a village where was it he was told that his caller had no idea the german knew a man in london would he be paid for his time a guarantee the german called london said when he was arriving and into which terminal he would come the van was an oven inside behind the empty drivers cab there was sufficient room barely for two men and a woman to be squashed together at any time two could observe through the drilled holes and hold a camera to either on the outside the van carried the name and logo of a company that repaired gas pipes the tango was washing a car tango meant target in scd jargon and grated with mark roscoe but the culture of the unit was too considerable for one footslogger to fight the man had a hose running they could have done him for breaching a hosepipe ban but preferred him cuffed and facing charges relating to firearms and conspiracy to murder his name had come up from the address they had raided and the arms cache they had found the man and the woman with roscoe were dedicated surveillance experts bland it meant little to them was just another day it was never just another day for him didnt have that sort of mindset but he could be patient he was coiled but not overwound two streets back there was an entrance to a public park and a maintenance corner where the gardeners parked their pickups two police wagons were alongside them with firearms and an entry team the easiest way to cock up was to lose patience and go too early that was irrelevant though while the tango was washing his car and the water flowed in a river down his drive into the gutter this was breadandbutter work no life on the line the real stress stretcher was when a stakeout was in place watching a potential victim and not knowing when the hit would come or from which direction that was nervejangling flying squad stuff the cashdelivery van or the wages van about to do a drop had been the training ground for what he did now when the employer might or might not have been taken inside the magic circle of confidentiality the guys who did the delivery on the minimum wage were not they didnt know the probability existed of firearms in their faces pickaxe handles across their arms and legs the cavalry coming from nowhere and gunfire good guys against bad could be up against a meanminded psycho who would take a security man with him to the mortuary could be that a guard had a heartattack in the crisis moment it was what mark roscoe was trained for where hed been he watched the man washing his car and wondered how long it would be before the contact showed up to justify the resources committed the thing he couldnt cope with happened the woman didnt make eyecontact with him just passed him the binoculars there was no modesty and no apology some of the surveillance vans had privacy corners but most did not she took the lid off then was over the bucket her baggy black trousers down her black knickers had serious crime directory printed on them in gold she peed hoisted herself up dragged the underwear and trousers back to her waist and took back the binoculars if mark roscoe had been in a van with suzie he would have crossed his legs let his bladder burst if there was no privacy screen as if it hadnt happened she said a whisper boss the cars clean fit for the queen to ride in and hes gone back inside oh thats good brilliant he crawled forward she eased back made room for him at the drilled spyhole whats good the cat crapped in the flowerbed then scratched earth over what it had done look at the cat boss the cat strode as if it owned the territory across the washed cars roof and left a footprint trail it went back and forth and made a proper job of screwing up the shiny clean paintwork he sagged back there was nowhere else he should be and nothing better he should be doing he had the patience and could wait the certainty that it would come was lifeblood to mark roscoe the german was met and walked out of the arrivals hall if he had not known the man he talked with from a heroinimportation deal he would not have entertained such a conversation a village wants a man killed apparently the whole village maybe even the priest maybe even the schoolmistress they will pay and it is in london i am being paid for running errands and you will be paid leave it with me an hour after he had landed the german was in the air heading back to hamburg the receptionist gave the documentsize envelope to penny laing she looked at it front and back her own name was written over a white sticker which covered an original address and the envelope was franked it had been through the postal system nothing on the reverse side who brought it didnt leave a name just handed it over and asked that you be told to come down for it a woman could have done with a bath in theory if the state of alert was ratcheted above amber and heading for red she could have demanded that security come out of their cubbyhole behind reception to run the package through the scanner might call in the bomb squad might wake the sniffer dog and deploy it might evacuate half the building she inserted the nail of her forefinger right hand under the sticker scratched it clear and saw that it had previously been sent to ms megs behan planet protection she remembered a dreary street and a coffee shop and wondered who was doing the buying right now she loosed the sellotape fastening the envelope paper cascaded out how in gods name had so much been inserted into one tired envelope and not split it it pulled her up as if there was a choke chain round her neck and the leash had been tugged sharply at planet protection they would have a stationery budget that verged on parsimony and little or nothing to sustain them beyond their commitment to the cause right end of selfinflicted lecture she thanked the receptionist wondered which was cheaper whether megs behan had used a bus or the tube to get from that dreary street north of the city to sunsoaked whitehall at the centre of power influence talent and selfserving shit she was having a bad confusing day and what she had seen of the papers sent to her told her that the rest might get a little worse and a little more confusing her line manager had said remember the downturn the crisis the crunch she walked up the wide staircase from the lobby made a grand exit on a stage that had seen the splendour of imperial power she went past offices where young men and women shirtsleeves and lightweight blouses struggled to confront the economic darkness she thought a low point was reached when a scruffy envelope contained more evidential material than she could hope for from her own official sources she flicked pages as she went lips pursed in concentration and annoyance and he had said also remember were somewhat of a luxury she was spoken of as stateoftheart material had done the minimum of uniform drudgery had been noted fasttracked and recruited into the investigation division top stuff real work she had jumped because it gave her the chance to run bloody fast and bloody far from the relationship with the married man who ran a department of the securityvetting programme it had been a waste of time for her but had enhanced the bastards ego couldnt quite believe shed allowed it shed been taken on by the codename golf team cocaine not grammes or kilos but tonnes shipped in from venezuela the cargoes were usually transferred via the atlantic coast of spain so she had trips down there to huelva cadiz and gibraltar she had done time with the irish too because the other main dropoff point was in the ocean south of county cork she had felt wanted then and important but the transfer to alpha had been sold as a step into an elite world on gibraltar she had met and fallen pretty fast and pretty far for a navy lieutenant who served on a frigate it had been good the best and through the sweet smile dermot had said were a natural target for budgetslicing there were photographs of harvey gillot there were travel itineraries of harvey gillot there were biographical details of harvey gillot she imagined sad unwashed megs behan beavering all the hours the good lord gave feeling privileged to dish the dirt on the devil figure harvey gillot there were lists of privatecharter cargo airlines flying into and out of ostend airport who owned and administered them when harvey gillot had been there and how long he had spent with the owner of an ageing boeing a veteran dc a tristar an ilyushin or an antonov that might just limp into a remote unlit corner of the middle east and drop on to a rolledsand runway it was laid out before her most of it typed but some in the copperplate writing that had been taught in convent schools she wandered past her line manager who was chewing gum and didnt notice her and sat at her desk what was in front of her seemed almost to bring the bloody man alive she had learned the theory of arms brokerage legal and illegal from that office with a view over the inner courtyard of the treasury building the practical classroom had been her threemonth attachment to the embassy in the drc stinking heat and stinking smells life expectancy was fortythree years one in five kids did not reach a fifth birthday more than a million people were displaced driven from their homes by the internal warfare that had claimed the lives of four million big hivaids big poverty big despair big business the arms trade into drc landing strips that a clappedout bulldozer had flattened were give or take a hundred metres long enough for one of those old aircraft based at ostend to put down on there would be spilling off the tailgate boxes of grenades crates of ammunition bundles of aks and machineguns she had worked from the un offices in the capital could have gone to bed with the dutch administrator of unhcr operations when they had both drunk a bit were almost maudlin and playing lonely but shed been dead on her feet from the heat had pleaded tiredness and wasnt that bothered to have missed out she had learned in those three months in the embassy the un compound and from trips upcountry what the arms trade did and she had seen closeup the casualties and the kids who paraded the kalashnikovs that the planes brought in there was nothing stereotypically feminine or soft about penny laing but she knew about the arms trade and thought it a disgrace that britons were a part of it she thought it an almost bigger disgrace that the alpha team were reliant to some degree on handtomouth charity and the diligence of megs behan she would work late that night the big buzz as she knew it better than sex she promised herself was the dawn hit the crashing in of an expensive front door the spread of shock on the faces of a mans family as a team moved in the click of handcuffs the howl of children and the blathering of a wife there must be some mistake of course it never was a mistake she stared down at the photograph relaxed calm thinking himself in control of harvey gillot he walked past a crash barrier a crowd baying at him and trying to push placards into his face and she saw megs behan monochrome straining against the barrier her face contorted but he did not seem to notice her it would be good to hit him at dawn on a winter morning lenny i dont do bullshit talk what im telling you is that the kids a good un granddad cairns wheezed hacked a cough then lit another cigarette he had a bad shake in his hands that day which was partly from arthritis it had been worse since his five years at hmp parkhurst on the isle of wight where the damp sea fogs were a killer he was no lie pretty pleased to have a man as prominent as lenny grewcock king of south of the river come to visit him the big man said a german comes to see me flies in and asks who id speak up for hes important to me and we do good business hes had a call from a friend there are links with serious players people all over europe have been talking through this one and pushing it on for a bit more expertise whats said for a hit here youll need a local boy too right lenny spot on and i put your kid in the frame good of you lenny what im saying is that ive backed your boy and id not want embarrassment you wont get it lenny not from our kid subject to money dont know yet whats on offer you dont need to know much except that its a funny old business hes a brit and the contract is being taken out by a village yes you heard me on the other side of europe the money wont be huge because theyre peasants but it would be good for a friendship of mine with a german i like to do business with ill talk it through with jerry do that ill be back to you grandma cairns had stayed in the kitchen best place lenny grewcock saw himself out and his minder was waiting on the walkway outside the front door he could see from the window that grewcock was hurrying and his minder scrambled to keep up with him granddad cairns reckoned that grewcock would have regarded this flat as shit lenny grewcock lived in a mansion tudor style completed four years back in kent granddad cairns couldnt abide the thought of leaving rotherhithe so the kid had a future a bright one if lenny grewcock had come looking for him with work a funny old business a village but no chance his kid a good un would cause embarrassment the internet threw up little on harvey gillot arms dealer nothing on a company registered to his name although an orthopaedic surgeon of that name practised in las vegas no website on what gillot had to sell an australian rugby league forward had that name and his site carried fulsome media praise he could be hired throughout queensland for afterdinner speaking but anonymity could not be guaranteed a trail existed around his wellprotected person he could be found by a diligent searcher the nongovernmental organisation known as planet protection funded by a swiss billionaire and public donation supposedly independent of all state agencies had made a list of the ten primary weapons brokers in the united kingdom it was included in a longreleased folder and with it a quote from megs behan researcher and overseas coordinator these men are evil and should be hounded out of existence they shame us a telephone number for those requiring additional information was provided it was necessary in josips view to keep all possible lines of communication open a man never knew where to seek the best advantage he sat beside the river where the bank was protected by a steeply sloping stone wall above him a track ran alongside the danube then a cliff face of sandstone and the symbol of the town the vukovar water tower the sun was sinking the water glistened and made soft pools of gold that rippled and every item of the remaining brickwork on the bowl of the tower was caught and highlighted the river did not excite josip it had changed little in the last halfmillennium different boats and new stonework on the banks but the great meandering flow was the same it might have been over many more than five centuries that nothing had changed it might have remained the same since a tribe had settled a few kilometres to the west at vu edol around six thousand years ago sometimes when he came to vukovar he looked at the tower and witnessed again the devastation caused by tank and artillery shells he saw the great gaps in the brick facing and felt ashamed that he had fled the fighting with his family to the safety of the capital but as evening approached and the light faded he saw neither the glory of the river nor the pride of the water tower he waited the man would come as the shadows grew he could justify what he prepared to do he had now few loyalties below him a parapet ledge was half a metre above the waterline anglers were there spaced out giving each other at least fifty metres of bank they would be hoping for catfish or perch carp or pike and at dusk the man would come on a scooter choose a place close to where josip sat and set up his tackle josip owed no allegiance neither to a community nor an individual when they could not be recognised or observed the man would join him that morning he had asked mladen to gather together the principals of the village then had told them what had been fed back to him they had heard him out in silence then there had been a frantic round of applause they had pumped his hand and slapped his shoulders and the women had kissed his cheek and none would have believed that josip had no loyalties and owed no allegiance after his release from gaol after hardened criminals had hugged him thanked him wished him well and alliances had been confirmed josip had walked to the bus station and taken a slow stopping ride to vinkovci then he had trekked for three hours until he had reached the village his home was among the better preserved it had a roof it had some of the furniture that he and his wife had abandoned and the dog was there old and arthritic but well fed cared for first by serbs then by croat neighbours he had slept there that night on the bare mattress the dog had warmed to him seeming to forget or forgive its abandonment of seven years and had slept beside him in the morning josip had walked the length of the village seen the wreckage of the battle and had found mladen he had recognised a new authority and had pledged that whatever skills he had were now at the villages service he wrote scores literally of letters to the telephone electricity and water companies requiring immediate reconnections he bombarded the zagreb and osijek authorities with ferocious demands for every kuna of resettlement funding available he became expert in extracting the most generous pension terms for those men who could justify entitlement as veterans and understood the small print on the disability claim forms many in the village had despised him initially but had reluctantly changed their minds man for man woman for woman child for child the village did better than its neighbours in bogdanovci and marinci better even than the martyr city of vukovar josip was a man of importance in the village but he had learned in his cell block that he should not push himself forward he had become an almost indispensable part of the village he lived alone now had not replaced the dog after its death and he had never brought the mistress he kept in vinkovci to the village he lived off a percentage of the pensions and grants he had negotiated if he had described himself and not sold himself short josip would have said he was goodlooking he had a mane of thick grey hair that he wore long a nose that seemed hawkish and good skin he did not have the paunch of many in the village he was not as many were a manic depressive addicted to temperamentcalming drugs or an alcoholic he lived in the village because he could think of no better place where he and his past would be accepted and he nurtured secrets his grandfather had been a policeman in split in the ustase days of the second world war and had died hanging upsidedown from a lamppost his throat slit by partisans his greatuncle had been a guard at the jasenovac concentration and extermination camp and had fled via trieste he was thought to have gone to paraguay but had never been heard of since the angler came his car had osijek plates but he would change them once a month and his old opel saloon every third month the angler was an officer in the service for the protection of the constitutional order with its recent past and the everpresent threat of communal violence in vukovar serb on croat croat on serb the sluzba za zastitu ustavnog poretka retained an officer dedicated to clandestine surveillance of the community on the bend of the danube josip had been recruited while he was still in gaol there had been an englishman in the gaol sentenced for trafficking classa drugs he had shown josip how to play two sides had spoken of hunting with the hare and the hounds in the name of christ the government had betrayed the town and the villages he did not feel he did wrong and it was important always to have a protecting friend josip said softly to the officer of the szup and did not see himself as judas his name was harvey gillot i do not have detailed knowledge in payment of the debt a contract has been taken and petar drove his massey ferguson the tractor was pulling a trailer that might have been loaded with manure corn or logs the evening before he had been out in his yard using a power hose on the wheels chassis and cab of the tractor then the trailer both shone in the morning light the trailer bore four coffins each with the countrys flag spread over it the four hearses had come from the hospital in vukovar and had stopped at the villages outskirts where nineteen years before there had been an antitank ditch a roadblock a felled oak and trenches for machineguns tomislav would have been there with the malyutka missiles and would have had a good field of fire from the hearses the coffins had been lifted on to the trailer and petar had pulled them to the partrebuilt church that was on the villages crossroads a service had been held there taken by a bishop who had travelled from osijek and assured the congregation that these men were never to be forgotten as guardians of freedom hymns had been sung and prayers said politicians from the region and from vukovar had attended tomislav thought the singing had been subdued that there had been little celebration of the lives lost the local priest who came every third week and whom they shared with other villages walked briskly in front of the tractor tomislav was behind the trailer in the front rank a small terrier skipping beside him held close on a length of baling twine alongside him were petars wife andrija and the widow it was unusual for women to walk immediately behind the coffin of a loved one but she had demanded it there were no flowers on the trailer not even a simple posy he had wondered if his wife would come if any of the other three children now adults that she had taken with her would want to be there he had had no contact with any of them since they had left his eldest boy had stood beside him as they walked away a broad arm around his shoulders tomislav walked with a firm stride behind the coffin that carried the fleshless bones of his son he was pleased his wife had not come during the siege he would have been regarded as the weapons expert he was given control of the rpg grenades only eleven of them that could be used at close range against armour he would have had charge of the malyutka missiles if they had been brought to the village he had been a career soldier in the yugoslav national army expert in warfare against tank and personnelcarrier attack with the rank of senior sergeant stariji vodnik he had married a serb girl and when the war had started the years of marriage had meant nothing he would have been able to use the malyutka the armour would have been kept back the cornfield road would have stayed open and the wheels of petars trailer were clean but not oiled and they screeched it was tomislav who had persuaded the schoolteacher that the malyutka would give the village and its untrained volunteers an edge in combat often after the dog had arrived at his home a tiny puppy licking his hand he had told it why he had wanted the malyutka and what he could have achieved with it the dog had been told of the weight of the warhead the range it could fly how the lineofsight command cable unravelled from the spool as it carried the handlers signals how far from the handler the dead zone stretched and the killing accuracy of manual command to lineofsight control at the pace the tractor went it would take them twenty minutes to get from the church to the new cemetery that was just short of where farmland fell to the river the edge of the watermeadow was marked with signs the red triangle and skullandcrossbones symbol he knew what had been done to his boy and petars to andrijas cousin and the teacher all of those who mourned had been told it was right that his wife and younger children had not come the serbs around the village in those ten weeks the irregulars of arkans scum had known that the defence had been organised by a former senior sergeant in the regular army tomislav maybe his wife had told them told her own when she had reached their lines and he was taunted at night with megaphones shouts boomed over the village that tomislavs wife opened her legs to a warrant officer a zastavnik each night and a queue was waiting to service her when the warrant officers had tired of her the sergeants would take their place then the corporals they named one a desetar and yelled into the night that she would enjoy it when his turn came tomislav heard it as did his eldest son he could remember the night his son had smeared his face with mud for camouflage had hugged him and disappeared into the night dragging the handcart he remembered the long wait and the reverberations of the explosions along the track through the corn as dawn was coming he and others had been to the place the next evening had found the crushed stems where many men had been the cartridge cases and cigarette ends the blood that the rain had not obliterated but not the bodies they came towards the cemetery the whole village every man woman and child walked with him except petar who drove the tractor petars wife had come to tomislavs home last night rooted in a drawer and found a shirt she had brought it back an hour later ironed and smart he had been as a senior sergeant the best turned out in the regiment and after he had left the military to work as a car mechanic he had always worn clean overalls he had no best trousers now no best jacket no shoes that were not scuffed and he had not shaved for three days little had remained for him to aim towards and hope for but now he had a target for his hatred tomislav thought the killing of harvey gillot could go a small way towards lessening the pain that racked his mind he had told his dog so he yearned for news of a death the tractor stopped beyond the gate and men came forward to lift down the coffins at the far end of the cemetery there were four heaps of freshturned earth tears ran down tomislavs face steyn said the one at the front is interesting which anders queried the man with the dog they stood inside the cemetery wall backs against the brickwork in clean shirts with ties but no jackets the sun seared them hes the most interesting and his son was cadaver number three a tall boy the four coffins now were carried on shoulders they looked to daniel steyn to be light loads some of the pallbearers used hospital walkingsticks he knew of these men survivors of the siege mostly from word of mouth the one he pointed out tomislav carried the third coffin in the line on his left shoulder and steadied it with his right hand in his left he held the dogs string leash whats interesting hes one of those patients that eminent men would fight over theyd all want him in a consulting room on a couch its about what war does it was eighty days of his life and now hes in his sixties and everything about him today is shaped by those eleven weeks he lost his wife and young children he lost his eldest child too now he has nothing first the cameras leave and the arclights then the politicians with the silver bands then the money for restitution this one tomislav should have been better equipped than most to handle it not so men of great heroism and women held the lines here in the other villages and the town ordinary people blessed with courage determination steyn thought it appropriate that the church political and civic leaders had left with a senior policeman from vukovar and an army officer they would not have been wanted in the cemetery the local priest was a good source of information anecdote or intelligence over a small glass of eagle rare from the buffalo trace distillery in kentucky a hell of a drink and about the only luxury in daniel steyns life shipped in by mail order his friend anders still had his cigar lit but cupped in his hand the first of the coffins went down and dirt was thrown but the reward for the heroism and courage is the most acute form of clinical depression tomislav lives like a hermit theres no aftercare here no acknowledgement of the symptoms suicide is not uncommon theyre addicted to prescription benzodiazepines and alcohol abuse is so widespread as to be commonplace rakija is the homebrewed hooch putting it crudely they need real help but its not available because no one gives a flying fuck about them youre not daniel a sack of laughs the second coffin was lowered on ropes into its pit sweat ran in rivulets down steyns back all his clothes hung loose because he was losing weight and hadnt the money to buy smaller sizes that would fit him better he didnt have new clothes because the european charity that supported his work had cut back on its commitment to the town and villages he had managed to rent a room in his semidetached house to a confectionary salesman and scraped by he ate little and the eagle rare was meanly poured for himself and special guests although dog meal was plentiful for the undisciplined irish setter he kept and loved he shrugged its a backwater of europe it had a little moment in the spotlamp that didnt last what can a guy in his position hit that hard hope for heh has to be some degree of hope you think you can make a difference me im arrogant enough to know i deliver something of value when im working in mud with the stench of decomposition and barbarity around me i can take comfort from the importance of what i do what does he have worse now steyn saw the third coffin go down and the ropes come back up flapping the priests voice carried softly tomislav big strong and quivering with weakness had crouched beside the pit then stood up clutching a handful of soil he rocked opened his hand and allowed it to cascade down how come his purpose in life was to see the minefield cleared and have the body recovered some dont want that some want to continue in a sort of vague hope they dont want the digging done anders grimaced not here steyn shook his head hard they knew the area where the bodies were now they have them the bodies go into the ground a stone is put up and the grave becomes a challenge what can they focus on now ill tell you who is responsible who is to blame who can be punished christ you know your husband or your cousin or your son your son was alive when he was castrated and was still alive when his mouth was prised open and his organs were shoved in it was the widows moment her lips moved but steyn couldnt hear what she said did she make a promise he watched tomislav half a pace behind her if he had had that man on the couch for a halfdozen sessions opening his heart and baring his soul he believed he would have been able to write a definitive paper on the longterm casualties of combat i repeat daniel how is it worse there cannot be peace until there is punishment of the individual responsible now i hear you you played your part bill i did anders was reflective you gave a name seemed the right thing to do maybe and maybe not steyn chuckled they turned away they wanted to be out of the cemetery before the villagers came through the gates he said flat but i doubt youll get the chance to ask him if it was right or wrong ask harvey gillot he said the name often he said it aloud harvey gillot whispered it or mouthed it silently once he shouted it and the name reverberated around his home part of which tomislav had turned into a shrine in memory of his boy the others who had died in the siege and the men who had not survived the camps after capture he kept the second bedroom the hallway and the living room pristine and a candle always burned in the hallway pride of place went to his son who had been allocated half of the living room photographs of him were there portrait and childhood snaps his sports teams one showed him in khaki camouflage fatigues with a cigarette lolling from his lower lip an ak in one hand and his other arm draped around petars son his friend when tomislav had come back after the years in the refugee camp he had retrieved them from the biscuit tin he had buried in the garden during the last hours before the escape into the corn there were many more photographs in the bedroom and the hall with the remnants of the flag that had flown over the command bunker it was ripped and scorched but mladen had carried it in the final breakout the sniper rifle that andrija had used the dragunov until a newer version had been recovered from a cetniks corpse was suspended from nails on a wall many weapons had been buried in the last hours and they had been retrieved now rifles a heavy machinegun pistols deactivated hand grenades all had been polished and the rust scoured off them on the wall in the hallway he had the maps on which first zoran and then mladen had planned the villages defence there were charts of the cornfield road where it crossed the defence lines and went southwest to vinkovci and northeast to vukovar tomislavs map with his proposals for where the malyutka missiles could be fired from was in the living room beside the window where he could see it from his chair when he had shouted that name his eyes had been fixed on that chart a call was made by an szup official from a government building near to the centre of zagreb it was received by the station head in a back room at the british embassy in the new city to the south of the railway station a meeting was arranged the official walked briskly from the building and went on past empty cafes and deserted boutiques they were challenging times for his country independent for less than two decades in hock with unemployment rising and organised crime the only flourishing industry friends were needed knowledge intelligence was the oil for friendships in his trade the days when croatian officials and british officers sparred for territory protecting suspected war criminals and hunting alleged barbarians were over clandestine cooperation was the new order of the day they met in a coffee shop beside the embassy it was only vague information the official stressed unconfirmed not corroborated chaff in the air it was the currency in which the agencies dealt because of events that had taken place nineteen years previously a criminal contract had been taken out on the life of a british citizen of course intelligence was an inexact science but the name of the target was harvey gillot the briton wrote briefly in his notepad pocketed it thanked the official was thanked in turn for buying the coffee and they parted whats the money going to be cant answer that lad im saying pop that our kid doesnt step out through his front door unless the moneys right and half upfront they sat in the prisons temporary visiting room refurbishment had closed the hall that was normally used the kid was robbie cairns lad was his father jerry and pop his grandfather every monday the elder cairns of the dynasty travelled from rotherhithe in southeast london by tube and bus to visit his son both had a history of success and failure as armed robbers both were familiar with the visiting suites and conditions inside them both were aware conversations were recorded on audio bugs they sat in the centre of the area with families all around them encouraging the brats to bawl and yell as they talked quietly we consider very carefully any offer that comes through because of who pushed it our way neither father nor son had delusions of importance the affluence they craved had eluded them never as much in a wages van or a safe as theyd been told there would be and there had been the cockups fiascos like when the getaway wheels engine had stalled on the strand which was jerrys closest shave with the big one and his father being grassed up then intercepted on the way to the snatch tales of ill luck littered their stories neither had ever been major league but lenny grewcock was he had a villa in spain a block of time shares outside cannes a casino in bratislava and three restaurants on the thames the bermondsey stretch yes pop we dont piss him about the surprise to father and son was that the kid little robbie no weight no muscle only those horrible piercing eyes had been headhunted by a man with the prestige of lenny grewcock i tell you this lad for nothing there was never anyone in our family before like robbie fuck knows where he came from cause he scares me vern doesnt nor leanne and id swear on any bible that dot never touched another bloke but fuck knows where the kid comes from ill jack the money squeeze what i can but itll be lenny grewcock im squeezing with me the kidll do it well and itll place us handily having lenny grewcock a satisfied punter nice one pop they talked some more jerry cairns had trouble getting his head round the news that a village was buying the services of his son what did he know about croatia not a lot asked who the target was his father tapped his nose not the sort of information to be murmured over the table of the visitors room itll be a nice earner lad because our kidll do a good clean job always does they had a little cuddle and a father left his son behind the walls of hmp wandsworth he was glad to be shot of the place hed been in there doing four and a half years for a blag fireworks day november when theyd topped a german for shooting a police sergeant hed heard the sounds of the great gaol as it went about the business of putting a bloke to death mostly had heard the silence never had liked hmp wandsworth from that day anyway he headed for the bus stop the rheumatism was a bastard and thought it pretty good that his grandson was in such demand he had almost a smile on his leathered face didnt concern him who the target was what the target had done why the target was marked he had of course known plenty of maltese and cypriots and more recently a few albanians outside gaol and in who pimped girls some ran a string and others lived off one hard worker pimp not a nice word probably what he was granddad cairns and jerry cairns two pimps both living reasonably satisfactorily off the kids earnings what relationship should an officer have with his assets veins ran in scarlet cobwebs on benjie arbuthnots cheeks and above his shaggy eyebrows there was a mop of straggling white hair he wore a suit but it had not recently been pressed and his shirt looked to have been in a drawer for six months he did not care about appearances he had addressed a group of around twenty recently recruited entrants to the secret intelligence service at the vauxhall bridge cross behemoth it had become a habit of the last two director generals to invite him back once a year and let him loose on the incomers something about they should know that beyond their comfort zones theres a real world benjie which will be good for a pampered generation that doesnt know about rough edges theyre pretty squeamish these days he had told anecdotes reported scrapes behind the wall in berlin talked about time up in the dusty radfan wilderness north of the aden protectorate about life in south armagh in the early days when the service had owned intelligence primacy in the province the young people embarking on careers had looked at him with astonishment as if he were an extinct creature dumped on them from a mythical ark or broken free from a showcase in the natural history museum but he had earned their respect he would take now a few questions it was a young woman whod raised her arm certainly not a relationship that implies affection youll live sometimes cheek by jowl with the asset agent source or jo and he or she will moan and complain and youll have to protect that fragile petal morale you may give an impression of genuine concern for their welfare and youll make promises but it will never be a relationship of equals you use him or her you do not blanch from exploiting whatever the asset brings to the table and when the usefulness is finished you walk away they disappear from your life you may have coerced them into recruitment but that is their problem and their difficulty for them to sort out were not a marriageguidance council or a job centre for the unemployed and unemployable neither do we provide protection for an endangered species but we might stretch to advice on personal security and push the asset in the right direction for that god help him or her as he spoke benjie thought of the men and women who had jumped ever higher over the hurdles he had set and how he was always challenging them for better results arabs afghans central europeans on the wrong side of the iron curtain he even thought of young harvey gillot wet behind the ears on the quayside at rijeka looking at the faces in front of him their owners hanging on his words and showing shock at the crude certainties of his message he could be content that none believed he had put on a show to hold their attention a man had his hand up wore a corduroy jacket no tie he probably had a fine degree from a good university benjie had no degree but had been awarded a commission in a wellfancied cavalry unit before switching to the service he pointed to the man how do you work closely with an asset for whom you have little personal respect easily its a job not a popularity contest we dont only use the good eggs its what they can achieve on our behalf within the parameters of our interests that matters to us im not about to dub as a hero a junior cipher clerk in the kgbfsb who volunteers to help us a major in the iranian air force or a chinese foreignministry stenographer we pay a good rate not as much as the americans but more than the russians we do the flattery well and massage an overworked ego we always tell the asset well help him get clear as soon as it gets hairy on the inside but were never in a hurry to fulfil that guarantee always one more month one more drop one more gentlemen ladies im hoping you didnt join the service to be social workers with responsibilities to assets one more no responsibilities the young man persisted none from a girl in a full burqa spoken with spirit who decides where the national interest and the assets interest conflict i do colleagues do and very soon you do look there are always going to be little people in the way and unless they get booted sharply they may trip you up i summarise the asset has his moment the moment is exploited the asset is forgotten its a hard world out there believe it ive never lost a nights sleep over the future prospects or survival of an asset thank you he went to the table and drank from his glass and the director who oversaw recruitment thanked him but there was no applause he thought he had introduced them to a career of moral uncertainties as there had been in so many places in rijeka and with so many assets funny how little harvey gillot was lodged in his mind grit in a boot so many phone calls came to the small crowded desk of megs behan it was a big day for her she was finishing off the press release two months in preparation had been up half the night and yes she had snatched up the phone is that miss behan it is yes hello thanks for your time miss behan i much admire the work you do first class i saw on the net your topten piece in which harvey gillot was named im a freelancer and i want to do a piece hope to challenge that man can you help me ill try im really pushed right now have you an address for him to get me started then ill be out of your hair can do she flicked keys slipped in an extra password to bypass security blocks scrolled then let the cursor rest its lulworth view easton thats on portland but thanks the line was cut what had megs behan forgotten to ask the caller but who am i speaking to please she gulped down a lungful of air the woman had claimed to be a freelance hack had spoken with a london accent wait wait it had been the address of harvey gillot arms dealer purveyor of death miserymaker big deal hardly was she going to feel guilty for infringing harvey gillots privacy or was she going to crack on with the last tidyup of the press release she had it up on her screen there was a shout from behind her megs im not a nagger promise when ten minutes if you get off my back and he wouldnt have minded megs reckoned if shed been on her back and him on her oh shit she swivelled in her chair giggled and beaded on her project manager so he had the lecher look so she had rolled up her tshirt at the waist and dragged it down at the throat because planet protection didnt do airconditioning and most of the windows were sealed years of paint rust and pigeon shit on the outside not a badlooking bloke but at least eight years younger than her and hed been all clumsy and frantic didnt matter shed heard them talking about her once a guy and two of the girls she hadnt had her cubicle light on and she was reading quiet not keyboard bashing all hearsay of course because she hadnt bedded the guy who was straight out of college and had a good brain to go with an acne problem one of the girls had been with a man who had now left so he must have been the top source well megs had shagged that man and he must have done some pillow talk the word from the other side of the partition was the bullet points needed a runover the global arms trade is out of control and brings in more than thirty billion american dollars a year for manufacturers of weapons and munitions she looked good but underneath the godawful clothes she wore she was sensational brilliant body hell of a waist nine million more small arms are produced every year and are swallowed by an already satiated market five hundred thousand people are killed each year by small arms throughout the world she was great in bed if she could be bothered and made an art form of it in excess of sixteen billion bullets come off factory production lines every twelve months two are available for every man woman and child on the planet apparently the downside of relationships with her was the postcoital behaviour stop grunting sit up have a laugh reach out find the cigarette paper and the tobacco pouch roll one light it puff without sharing then start spouting as if everybody was as fanatical as she was about the crime that was the arms trade half a million people the huge majority of them civilians are killed each year by conventional weapons which is equal to one person dying of gunshot injuries every minute of the day and night short sweet and not forgotten the conclusion played in her ears the united kingdom our country our government to whom we pay our taxes is the fourth largest exporter of weapons in the world she didnt have a guy at the moment didnt have time for one and wasnt fussed beyond the bullet points there were paragraphs of explanation additional statistics and a little rhetoric the scratch in her mind the phone call giving an address not getting a name slipped to a back place in her priority queue she wondered if she should have done a section on child soldiers and scanned in a photograph of some little rwandan mite holding an ak that was nearly as big as himself yes megs held up the whole process and the bullet line was today there are three hundred thousand child soldiers involved in conflicts and all are armed by the international dealers in death and they kill and are killed she thought it read pretty well and would have loved to slip on to the balcony above the fire escape for a quick roll and a smoke she hit the buttons sent it to him it came into the building when the day was winding down and landed on a chief inspectors desk not much there but enough for him to curse the timing get off his chair and shout at his door for mark roscoe he liked the young sergeant although he suffered from problems of attitude and might not be a ninetyminute team player he called him in because he had no option roscoe was the only one with the clout experience and reputation to carry this the others were out had shipped off home or gone down the pub roscoe peered over his shoulder as he tapped it up for him to look at wouldnt call them chatty would you guvnor spooks talking to lesser creatures us were honoured they even know of our existence he said drily it had been passed from vauxhall bridge cross to what they knew as box the security service and from their headquarters overlooking the river it had come to this outpost of scd little explanation covered it we understand you deal in such matters our sister agency informs us that sources known to them and regarded as generally reliable report a plot believed still in the planning stages for the killing of a british national herbert david gillot now calling himself harvey david gillot of lulworth view easton isle of portland a contract has been taken out we understand for the assassination by a community in croatia gillots occupation is selfemployed dealer broker in arms no further details are available to us doesnt exactly weigh us down with intelligence roscoe murmured or with what authority the intelligence travels but its logged timed and dated and if friend gillot ends up in a box my balls will probably be in it with him not to be ignored no what do you know about the arms trade that it arouses powerful passions is generally legitimate is distasteful until britishbased jobs are at stake and then its in the national interest i would imagine it falls into two categories theres government to friendly government and theres the verminous creature who sells where he can find a marketplace which is what i assume gillot to be he thought roscoe hesitated as if unsure of sharing a confidence he prided himself on leading his team well and having time for them he hid impatience let it dribble a wry smile played on roscoes face i was back home for a weekend with my parents in the spring a couple of years ago they moved to the lake district they joined everything and are stalwarts in their village anyway at the primary school they had a goodcauses fair while i was up there in aid of the church roof my mother was doing cakes buns and jam but on the next stall to hers there was an amnesty international girl the way she talked it up the arms trade is pretty vile believe me guvnor im not a crusader but i doubt theres much difference between drugstrafficking and moving illegal arms thats about the limit of what i know but hed have to be protected the chief inspector said a calculated throwaway of course the package had been deftly placed in the hands of his detective sergeant most of the small squads work involved intervention to prevent the murder of some of the more despicable men in the capitals organisedcrime world he didnt reckon that an arms dealer selfemployed would be out of place in that company it was part of the job description that his guys and girls had to put the same work ethic into saving the life of a bad guy as they would into ensuring that of a lawabiding citizen there was a procedure to be followed so he would drag in a superior to act as gold commander and head up the business then call together the necessary agencies not the spooks because they wouldnt give him the time of day and certainly wouldnt admit to holding a file on gillot if they had one he suggested to roscoe that he contact hm revenue and customs and ask for the alpha team not much to start with but often they had less penny laing took a call she had cleared her desk closed down her screen and had been about to head for the underground shed thought when she was home and it was cooler that shed jog shower eat and then she had nothing to do that interfered with picking up her telephone and the first five minutes of the conversation was taken up with her name yes she was penny laing yes her surname was pronounced as if it was spelled lane yes she was called penny not penelope and it was because of the beatles song her parents had met at a uk hydrographic office party and had first danced to that tune yes she did know that penny after whom the lane had been named was an antiabolitionist and confirmed friend of the slave trade which was about as politically incorrect as a man or woman could be and shed almost been laughing yes she knew who harvey gillot was and had an address could have a phone number in five minutes and would call back with it she could come to a meeting chaired by a gold commander instead of breakfast in the morning but her caller had not said why a meeting to discuss harvey gillot had been called at some bloody awful time not much beyond dawn she was intrigued she went to her team leader who had changed into his lycra and had his foldaway bicycle beside his desk dermot what in the met does scd do you ever heard of them he didnt look up but continued tying the laces of his cutaway shoes part of the serious crime directorate they are the serious organised crime agency and include the flying squad they do hostagetaking kidnaps and theyre supposed to intercept contract killers moving towards a hit all very needtoknow what did they want she was the cat with the cream they want to talk about harvey gillot she heard him chuckle and then his helmet was on and he was gone into the labyrinth of the buildings wide corridors she opened again the files and pulled them up on her screen utterly intrigued intercept contract killers moving towards a hit he had said only leanne was allowed to go with robbie cairns when he went fishing they were on the royal military canal south of ashford in kent there were road bridges about every fifteen hundred yards and he insisted on walking with the gear to a point at which he was as far as possible from the car and therefore from other anglers he was in front of her hunched low on his canvas stool and around him were tackle boxes bait trays and the landing net that afternoon and evening he had caught nothing she was behind him on a collapsible chair and had brought sandwiches and a thermos of weak tea he didnt turn to speak to her and she wouldnt interrupt his quiet leanne was pretty she had a good slight figure a clear complexion natural blonde hair and nice nails she had no boyfriend she was content to sit in the failing light on the canal bank swat away flies and watch her brothers unmoving float as his maggots squirmed he hadnt caught a single fish not even one big enough for next doors cat he could go a whole session hours of it and the float never go under but it didnt seem to matter to him she thought he needed her there would have been difficult to put it in words even tell her dad or her mum or the grandparents who lived close by in their flat on the albion estate so she told no one it had been a good day it had been the kind of day when the world moved the water glimmered in her eyes from the dropping sunlight and a water bird was in the reeds opposite in the car she had told him all the detail she had the price their grandfather had agreed with lenny grewcock the name of the target where the target lived shed laughed and nearly swerved on the outside lane of the motorway when shed described how a silly cow at the other end of a telephone had bought the crap story about her being a freelance writer and no response she had told him what she had learned and there had been one sharp nod she worked hard for her brother robbie she had no job other than supporting him a teacher at school had told her she was bright enough for thirdstage education could have gone to college the teacher had known nothing she was of the cairns family from rotherhithe and that wasnt something from which she would ever consider walking away no boyfriends but she idolised her brother she cooked and cleaned for him in clack street which was under the big blocks of the albion estate she reconnoitred ground for him did ferrying for him and knew where it would end a gutter not rainwater but blood a pavement not a black binbag stuffed with rubbish but a body she doubted that around rotherhithe in lower road or albion street in quays road or needleman street there would be a wet eye other than hers when he was bleeding in the gutter or splayed on the pavement it couldnt end in any other way the bloody float never shifted she knew how it would be the next day he would start to think around it other than that gillot sold weapons she knew nothing about him only that he was pretty much already dead he walked the dog caught his mood and stayed a halfpace behind him hed a problem could be a small problem one of lapsed trust could be a big problem of volcanic proportions the towelling robe in the second bathroom had been damp he was out towards the bill and the days tourists had long gone the lighthouse was not yet activated and the path ahead and behind was deserted a clean wind came off the sea from the west but where he walked the rocks were sheltered the swell was slight and sea birds circled over him a kestrel perched on a fence post and the day was cool now it should have been perfect but there was a damp bathrobe a receptionist had given the allclear following a lavishly expensive dinner he had hosted at the berlin marriott for him to take gratis the robe hed rather liked it and the towelling was heavy duty so he had brought it home josie had said it was vulgar on a par with nicking hotel soap and shower hats and it had been left in the spare bathroom fiona had her own ensuite as did the bedroom he shared with josie he had only gone into the spare bathroom on his return from heathrow because he thought the corner of the landing was hot and a window needed opening hed seen the robe hanging heavily touched it and felt the damp the garden looked so neat at the front and the beds off the patio were clear of weeds and well planted with colour which would have been hot work out in the sun he wouldnt have thought much about it but the gardener the prat nigel had been to the house that day and he had seen the way josie was with him nothing you could have brought into court but impressions they said the impressions that it was not the most straightforward of gardeneremployer relationships the great quarries from which the famed portland stone was extracted were behind him as was the field where fionas horse was kept the sea swells were moderate and the break of waves on the rocks below him was gentle he had not come here for the beauty didnt rate serenity wasnt attracted by postcard views it was the isolation that appealed there was a woman with another labrador also black but she was more than half a mile ahead and there had been a man behind with a toy dog but he had turned off the path near the track that led up to the neolithic site far out in the channel a warship cruised a dark shadow against the lighter greys of the sea and the evening haze he was secure here so was it a problem that a towelling robe was damp did it compare with any of the problems stored up in the life of solly lieberman his mentor solly lieberman had no women trekking in his wake well only the one who typed for him kept his office in minimal confusion and had no looks or apparent sentiments and he had never seen him drift off late from the hotel bar with a hooker tailing him to the lift his work guru would not have had a problem with evaluating the chances that his wife of nearly two decades more was shagging the gardener nigel but only after shed sent him to the spare bathroom for a cleanup shower necessary with all the fucking work hed done in the garden and he who paid all the goddamn bills where was he while they were shagging hed been in tbilisi where there had been enough tarts in the hotel lobby to cope with an ibm convention solly hadnt acknowledged such problems and his own as told to young harvey seemed far up the scale of catastrophe like being a crewman on a landing barge off utah beach on a june morning in maybe he didnt care that much about the damp robe the way solly told it shitting myself never heard as much noise in my life and never want to i was in the right flank of the higgins boats the landing craft and each carries thirty poor sods and theyre all sick as dogs and whats in front of them is going to be worse what dont they need on the final run in to the beach they dont need all those cartons they have lucky strike and camel philip morris and marlboro every cigarette produced in american factories theyre heaving up their trousers are filling and they want to get the weight of their packs down so they ditch the cartons i have a big plastic bag and when we wave them on their way up the beach i collect them twentyfour cartons do three runs on to utah taking guys off the big ships ferrying them in and bringing out casualties these guys second battalion eighth infantry fourth division the ones who survived would have been short of cigarettes and there were more left on other higgins boats it was the next evening that we brought the boat back to portsmouth i had two hundred and ninetyseven cartons of highquality american cigarettes and bulk buyers in every bar i was twentyone and it was like a big door had been kicked open for me god knows it must have been a thousand cartons i liberated that week and other higgins boats were hit but mine never was ride your luck young man and go for it the kestrel had left the post now flying and hunting the dog stayed close to him he liked the dog and the dog liked him especially when he put the food into its bowl once he had liked josie and once she had liked him he had married her two years after solly liebermans death then she had not minded the stories now she walked out of the room if he tried to tell one if an agony aunt had summarised the marriage of harvey and josie gillot she would have written of a fork in the road it had been a fine partnership for many years and a loving one that they had drifted on to everseparating tracks was as inevitable as it was unintended they had mislaid the ability to talk or the requirement for conversation he was confused by this didnt know how to resolve it or whether he could be bothered to he was not familiar with grovelling it had happened he dealt in weapons and munitions he didnt blame himself before josie had acted as his personal assistant but his targeting by hmrc the vermin meant that little now was consigned to paper and email was rarely used on sensitive deals there was less for her to file and those cabinets were emptier old contents had gone into the incinerator she was removed from his work had the money to be comfortable and had probably lost the hunger for success that had caused them as a partnership to tilt hard at targets and flatten them the holiday huts were close to him now wood brightpainted people rented or owned them they were used in the summer months and cost in excess of twentyfive thousand but they couldnt be slept in he could of course have confronted josie and demanded answers are you shagging the gardener if you are can we regularise the situation will you be leaving home and setting up residence with nigel his wife and four children assuming theres room in his attic for you to bed down alongside the water tank days had gone by since hed found the damp bathrobe and the questions had not been put he wasnt frightened he told himself maybe he didnt care solly lieberman had had enough problems and if theyd not been resolved hed have been heading for the stockade army of occupation the american zone shortage of penicillin shortage of morphine shortage of almost everything and jewellery was as good a currency as any would have been a big sentence in the stockade a bigger sentence for the disposal of weapons caches solly liked to tell that one hed have a cigar clamped and would talk through it there were arms dumps all over the place go into any forest area follow wheel tracks and there was a dump supposed to be there for the final great stand all the resistancetothelastman shit find it load it get a clever guy to do the artwork on the papers whos bothered with scanning papers at frontiers in the dead of night every little official on a border just wants a payoff send trucks to trieste simple as hell more cash into back pockets the dock gates open the freighters are there and the crane drivers im telling you young man that the infant state of israel survived on german weapons the karabiner the mauser the schmeisser the mg machinegun the potatomasher grenade even the old panzerfaust for hitting armour they went to israel good times young man that put the damp robe in terms of problems into perspective when he reached the pulpit rock a huge stone column around which the sea surged must weigh hundreds of tonnes prime unshaped rock it was dark enough for the light to come on behind him it swept across his back and his mobile rang he called the dog to his side then answered it yes the caller introduced himself as detective sergeant mark roscoe and remarked that mrs gillot had kindly provided the mobile number what can i do for you sergeant the policeman said he was from scd that was serious crime directorate and said they should meet the next day in weymouth police station and well im sorry but ive quite a busy day tomorrow im clearer later in the week he was told the meeting would be the next day at two thirty pm that the police station was on radipole lane and that he did not need to bring a solicitor or his wife the time and venue were confirmed and the call was cut he had not been asked if it was convenient that was an inkling of a real problem tomislav was sitting on his porch in the darkness the dog across his lap when josip found him he was told the deal josip had agreed twenty thousand euros was the cost to the village of a killing tomislav said a trifle of that amount would have bought the fifty malyutka they had needed did josip think it reasonable josip explained that he had spoken three times to the middle men and had dragged down the price but it could go no lower if he and mladen accepted it the village must raise twenty thousand euros tomislav said it is cheap for what we ask we want him dead josip said the man we will buy i am assured is the best quality a rap on the table indicated she was ready mark roscoe didnt know her and his detective inspector said that phoebe bermingham rank of chief superintendent and uniform was a novice or from behind his hand a virgin at playing gold commander she maam was at the head of the table roscoe and his boss at the far end and between them were representatives from surveillance and firearms and intelligence hers was the only uniform on show roscoe had been late chrissie had come back from work at three that morning had woken him and wanted to talk hed hardly slept till five and then had missed his wakeup call it had been a stampede to get into scotland yard by seven thirty and he was dressed badly half shaven his hair a mess he had missed the croissants and coffee and his boss had given him a foul look surveillance wore a suit and firearms was smartcasual he had a pain in his head and she chaired briskly and he thought a paper must have been written on the conduct of a gold group meeting did the intelligence have provenance if the spooks had been invited they hadnt shown most likely they hadnt been invited because it was certain they wouldnt attend there was a knock on the door and a young woman half fell through it she looked as if shed rather be anywhere else and had a pillarbox blush as she stammered a name penny something revenue and customs alpha team grovelling a bus not turning up had walked two miles she had a file under her arm heavy she dropped into the chair between firearms and roscoes boss maam did it all again wasnt pleased started at the beginning should the intelligence be believed same answer couldnt say and the people who could had stayed away moved on who was harvey gillot roscoes boss said hed been through criminal records and had drawn the big blank except that the joker dealt in arms legitimate a shrug didnt know a silence maam looked at the young woman penny something and gestured to her with a wellsharpened pencil and penny something in roscoes opinion gave it a good fist hes one of the top ten independent arms dealers in the uk to stay legal the arms dealer or broker must remain inside the strictures of the military list it governs what weapons may be sent to which countries where transactions are authorised he must provide an enduser certificate that lists the items being sold their origin and destination our rationale is that we dont want our enemy in the field to be well armed particularly if we have made those arms and sold them so export permission wouldnt be given for sale to say somalia north korea burma harvery gillot is a big player and a target of ours can i summarise we dont want weapons bought in minsk shipped to a baltic port then transported to the gulf moved on to karachi then into the tribal territories and finally to helmand where they kill a nineteenyearold lance corporal from leeds all these characters in the top ten stay on the right side of legislation until a mouthwatering deal drops into their lap then they break the law as i said harvey gillot is a target of ours as yet we dont have the dirt what was the significance of croatia maam asked his boss queried whether theyd had a war there maybe twenty years back but surveillance said that was bosnia his boss countered that there had been warcrimes stuff there but firearms chipped in that the war crime was at srebrenica and also in bosnia roscoe remembered torvill and dean and the bolero music the gold medal for skating at a winter olympics in sarajevo penny something coughed sharply as if to kill the blundering she said quietly with authority there was a united nations embargo on the selling of weapons to all parties when yugoslavia broke up under a resolution passed in september ninetyone it was illegal to supply slovenia serbia bosnia and croatia with weapons and it was ignored there was a feeding frenzy for the sale of weapons the dealers brokers never had it so good we have no record on our files of gillot being involved was gillot in place and selling at that time maam questioned according to our records he was taken on to the staff of an oldtime dealer solly lieberman in lieberman died in russia in and we understand that the business and goodwill were passed to gillot without cost he has been on his own since then if he was in croatia in it would have been one of his early ventures as an independent at only twentyeight would she maam requested paint a picture well ive never met him so this is all third hand very clever and verges on cunning im not talking intellectual academic at heart hes a salesman thats his driving force doing deals pushing the limits winning through all those matter to him he would be cautious suspicious and expect us to be targeting him formidable id say something else selfsufficient lives on the isle of portland and i have no perception of social life there but he will stay clear of commitments involvements and will most certainly not want it spread about that he sells tanks hand grenades or landmines if it were known he would be a pariah in the community so hed make certain it wasnt but id expect him to be charming sort of goes with the territory but the business is loathsome maam looked at her a stiletto glance then launched we dont often have the luxury of choosing who we consider worth protecting and who we dont anyone be they a convicted and released paedophile or a drugstrafficker who has reneged on a deal with his supplier is entitled to an efficient service we will be mindful in this case as in every case of the duty of care owed to mr gillot and his human rights as laid down by statute we are not here to approve or disapprove of his commercial activities we are here to prevent the very considerable crime of murder being committed and him becoming a target for a murderer didnt they know what was required of them roscoe and his boss did firearms would know it chapter and verse surveillance lived inside the restrictions imposed by the regulation of investigatory powers act and the hoops to be jumped through before his people could do covert or intrusive surveillance on a suspect the young woman penny something had frowned at the mention of duty of care owed to the tango and had grimaced at human rights roscoe thought shed done well and might just have been the only one at the table who given a blank map of the european coastlines had a fair idea of where croatia figured on it he remembered they broke and more coffee was brought in roscoe offered the young woman a biscuit from the plate not myself this morning god you told me last night the beatles penny youre penny laing i thought you did well and that maam was impressed are you patronising me he blinked dont think so not intended seemed in here that no one had much of a clue what happened south of bognor and the channel right fine anyway have a nice day remember to send me a postcard next time you get south of bognor actually im hoping ill get a long way south ill be suggesting to my team leader that we go out to croatia find out what gillot was at because itll be sanctionsbusting and a criminal offence then theres a good chance of us putting together a case charging him well lets hope nothing inconvenient gets in the way like him being shot first just a thought dont armstraffickers have links with the spooks is that a stereotype arent they arm in arm sort of bigbrotherly protection for the trafficker and deciding where the business is done the answer was almost spat they may indeed be in bed and sweaty but it wont help him they cut lesser mortals adrift make a better job than pilate at washing off responsibility we go after them because we know the law is the law and isnt chucked out of the window for the spies convenience roscoe blinked again but harder she was a bloody crusader god protect him from crusaders and those who made the world a better place and he was so tired and he had the drive in front of him he slipped away youll not take me wrong robbie im hearing you granddad hearing what you say it was a conversation they had not had before he had always admired his grandfather and liked him he knew him better trusted him more than he did his father youll not take offence do i ever they walked along albion street past the terrace of shops fastfood outlets the launderette and the betting shop across the other side was the library no lie robbie cairns had not been inside it for more than ten years and up the road from it was the norwegian church and the seamens mission the only time hed been inside a church in the last twelve years was for the funeral of his uncle albert shipped home for the last time from hmp pentonville following a coronary they walked on the street because the chance of being covered by an audio bug was minimal they talked the unrepentant veteran thief and his grandson who was a killer for hire from the side of their mouths so that if the cameras were on them there would be nothing for the lipreader to learn never before had granddad cairns talked to him like this and done it awkward what im saying robbie its for lenny grewcock a big man as big as any we know are you telling me not to cock it up well you know he saw his grandfather squirm granddad cairns didnt approve as robbie knew of violence he went pale at the sight of blood and had nearly fainted only a few weeks back when a bus going along lower road at the end of albion street had hit a cat robbie didnt expect advice about the work he took on once the payment had been agreed he had no worries about spilled blood and didnt welcome what was close to interference but it was his grandfather he had never cocked it up and he bridled you look after your side and ill do mine i just wanted to say that say it once more granddad then dont say it again because of who its for lenny grewcock a good friend and a bloody awful enemy please just tell me itll be your best effort when wasnt it his grandfather shrugged and lines cut the tired old face robbie always produced a best effort it was why he was wanted and hired the fee to be paid was ten thousand sterling and there would be extras on top he had a name and a location but nothing more robbie didnt know why this man had been marked out a teacher at the school in rotherhithe had once read a story to them and quietened the whole class with it a guy called billy bones had been given by a blind old beggar a black spot which meant he was condemned all the class had liked that story boys and girls and it had the hope of treasure in it but robbie had enjoyed best the part where the sheet of paper with a black spot was put into billy boness hand and he had known he was marked for death he didnt know what harvey gillot had done that had put the paper with the spot into his hand didnt matter whether he knew or not ten thousand pounds was on the table with extras whenll you go when im ready granddad you do understand could you let it go granddad could you wrap it now there was an edge in his voice and he saw the old man shrink from him it was almost as if his grandfather was afraid of him robbie slipped an arm loosely on the old mans shoulders squeezed and felt no flesh then he had turned and was gone didnt know where to go leanne was having her hair done vern was down at the arches where the little lockup garages were and vehicles had their identity changed and barbie was on inhouse training in the store he wandered up swan street drifted until he came to the river and found a bench close to a statue of a man and a boy something to do with pilgrim fathers but he didnt know who they were or what theyd done and he had a view of london bridge he liked it sort of reassuring and he had that feeling of being where he belonged on his own ground truth was robbie was restless near to pissed off because his grandfather had gone so far as to suggest that he might cock it up he never had never would the price for the man who would kill josip said was ten thousand euros he shifted clumsily from foot to foot tomislavs opinion was encouraging but of little importance set against mladens decision the word of the villages leader had greater significance than any other man or womans mladen sniffed ten thousand euros for the man we hire why do you tell me we must raise twenty thousand they were on the veranda of the cafe in the heart of the village near to the halfrebuilt church down the road josip could see that tomislav sat alone on his porch his dog on his lap he could hear the drone of petars tractor from the field behind the church beyond tomislav there was a splutter as andrija started the motor of a petroldriven mower everyone knew that andrijas wife had nearly broken his finger when she had prised it out of the grenades ring josip said that a man in london would take a cut of their money for finding the one who would shoot and the man in london had been contacted by another in hamburg the hamburg connection was from poland had originated in greece and the link to athens was from serbs who had come to ilok but future arrangements and payments would be through zagreb for convenience and secrecy all of them josip told mladen required payment for the introductions they had made mladen had little affection for josip who had not stayed and fought he knew that he himself could not have found a man to carry out a contract how do we raise twenty thousand euros josip said that the veterans could take loans from the bank they would give us loans to pay for it josip said that the veterans had the best pensions so loans would be available mladen turned away scraping his chair on the boards he could not now back off he would not dare to face the widow maria andrijas wife and tell them that too much money was wanted he had the largest pension with the best disability supplement and would pay the most neither could he have told his son simun that the price of revenge was too great get me more coffee he would not have admitted to any form of entrapment in the past later perhaps in an hour petar would return to his yard with his tractor and would walk down to the cafe tomislav would come listen and not contribute and andrijas mower would fall silent and he would be there his coffee was brought mladen said at what time he was prepared to go to vukovar and josip left him he and his comrades talked of the skirmishes when the villages defences had held but they had never spoken of the last hours when the line had been holed then those who had the strength took to the rotted corn and attempted to crawl through the enemy to nustar he was now in his fiftieth year a big man with a bulging gut that many of the village women considered magnificent and a shock of silver hair he could exert authority through his physique and with the ability of his eyes to pierce an opponents resolve the story of his sons survival was legendary in the village with the snow of winter still on the ground the baby had been conceived his wifes belly had been huge when the road into the village had been cut and she had refused as many did to use the cornfield road the baby simun was born in the crypt under the church the mother needed medical intervention could not have it neither could she have drugs to kill infection there were none mladens wife had been buried in the night few there because the cetniks had probed the lines they had charged twice and been driven back on the last evening when it was obvious to all that the village would be overrun at dawn mladen had gone down the steps under the church he had taken simun from the makeshift cradle and swaddled him against the cold he had wrapped the bundle in a camouflage tunic and had made a carrycot with ropes and canvas none would go with him into the corn the baby would cry and the cetniks would find them he had gone alone the inner security door opened and a youngish man came into the room he held out a hand mr gillot thank you for coming im ds roscoe mark roscoe i hope you havent been waiting long he had been waiting ten minutes almost eleven and roscoe would have known it because it was almost eleven minutes since the desk had telephoned to announce his arrival at least he wasnt asked if hed been comfortable the leatherette of the bench was holed and had no cushion the flooring was scuffed the sun burned against the outer window and the graffiti on the walls had been scrubbed unsuccessfully not the entrance that would be used by county councillors coming to visit senior officers or chums from rotary but where those on bail clocked in harvey gillot was confused if you could please follow me mr gillot they went down a corridor gillot had had little to do with police stations dealt with the military at bases and the ministry but had never supplied the police forces with gear neither had he been investigated nor entered a station to lodge a complaint there was a bustle in the offices with open doors off the corridor but he sensed that people eyed him as if word of his visit was already abroad he had dressed as if for a business meeting in a suit quiet and severe with a soft blue shirt and a conservative bluebase tie he had brushed his hair carefully in the car he reckoned roscoe ten years younger than himself same height but two and a half stone lighter and without flab hair not done jacket creased and the shirt had the look of secondday use the tie did not coordinate with the jacket the shirt or the face and was loosened at the neck gillot hadnt slept badly had been on the other side of the bed from his wife but the sergeant might have slept on the floor or not slept at all they went into an interview room did he want tea or coffee he shook his head water declined the chair offered him had metal tubing and a canvas seat between them was a table and on it a folder and a couple of biros the window was barred and the ceiling light had mesh over it gillot smiled gently so that there are no misunderstandings the timing of this meeting is at your convenience not mine and im grateful mr gillot for your cooperation i hope the inconvenience is not too great but there are things best not said on the phone just some things to get straight first a sheet of paper was taken from the file it looked upsidedown to gillot like a form of the type filled in for membership of a golf club or an insurance policy you are harvey gillot of lulworth view portland he nodded he entered the information in a scrawl of biro and yes his wife was josie and fiona was his daughter his date of birth was written in and its place the young man looked up your blood group do you know it mr gillot the biro was poised he thought the question was designed to shock him he didnt gulp hid it it was a cheap old trick but it usually gained the targets attention roscoe reckoned it was class of gillot not to react no wet tongue slid over dry lips and the eyes didnt drop my blood group is ab positive thank you he tried a smile didnt do it well youre an arms trader by occupation mr gillot i do buy and sell is there a problem with that not as far as im concerned as long as everythings legal right getting to the point have you worked in croatia he was a good detective superiors told mark roscoe he was quality if he hadnt been he would never have made it to the flying squad and then to the covert crowd he was with he recognised that the question he posed had set the mind of harvey gillot spinning flywheel speed a flicker of eyelids a short intake of breath a little tightening of the shoulders if he had taken to boxing he would have called it a good left jab not a hook but a jab that had landed ive never sold weapons munitions to a croatian client may i ask the relevance of that question not done business there correct but been there another pause fractional i was there briefly but it was a long time ago nineteen years dont ask me details tell you what mr roscoe can you say where you were in november and be exact the charm flashed the sort of smile that would have sold a mobile phone that wasnt needed a new carpet or car maybe an artillery howitzer no way i have a memory like a sieve i was thirteen and worrying no doubt about blackheads he chuckled so we have this right you were in croatia around november but didnt do business there you were not an arms dealer trading with the croats when the existence of the new state was under threat is that a fair summary may i ask again mr roscoe what is the relevance not arrogant not bullshitting him roscoe read the caution in the question with your answers and of course i accept them i have a confusion a confusion roscoe took a deep breath but when he spoke it was without theatre youre an arms dealer mr gillot but you havent worked in croatia and havent done business there we get information from many sources what im currently holding is information from the security service but they are in this case merely the messenger we assume the information i suppose i should call it intelligence originated from vauxhall bridge cross if i were to hazard a guess id expect you to know all about them a tightening of the jaw muscles a narrowing of the eyes and the tongue was on the lips going right to left but composure didnt slip roscoe assumed that an arms dealer would be to vbx what a chis was to him a packet of fags use them finish them throw away the packet and he did it as a highstreet bank manager might have explained that a customer was a little overdrawn not a repossession matter not going to bring in the bailiffs its quite hard to put it together mr gillot because you have no business connection with croatia sources available to vauxhall bridge cross have come through with information that a contract has been taken out on your life cant sugar that one a hitman vulgar phrase but the one we use is if the reports are to be believed under contract or will be imminently no answer but roscoe thought a sweat bead was forming on the forehead just below the hairline and there might be another hed give it to the guy eleven out of ten for control impressive were not flush with information well scraps from the table the contract has been taken out by what is described to us as a community it is also indicated that the carrying out of the contract is still probably in the planning stage what community means i really dont know but he let his voice tail away what had he expected from the man whose trade penny laing had described as loathsome hed probably thought there would be shock some bluster and a patter about there must be some mistake there was not tell a man that a gang of people on the other side of europe had hired a hitman and imply that hes going to come up close with a luger a walther a mauser or a baikal and it was fair to expect panic and hyperventilation but there was silence across the table gillot seemed to tilt his head back as if that would help him think better and recall his memory with a flick of a smile gillot said quietly almost a whisper you call it a community but its a village the contract will have been taken by a village where roscoe thought gillot talked like a sleepwalker i never went there but i was told it was close to a town called vukovar there is i suppose between the people there and me what might be called an issue they had paused for a few moments on the open square with marble slabs that ran on the west side by the vuka river close to where it flowed into the danube there was a statue near to them of the dead president franjo tudjman some said he was the founder of the new free independent croatia and others claimed he was the traitor who had sacrificed vukovar its defenders and the people of the villages on the cornfield road they huddled around mladen josip insinuated himself into the huddle and told them what they should say and how much they should ask for the group broke apart andrija with maria beside him went to the banco popolare on strossmeyer tomislav holding his dog on its string walked inside the slavonska banka next to the ruin of the grand hotel petar accompanied by his deaf wife went past the armed security guard and into the croatia banka mladen had simun at his shoulder as they pushed through the swing doors of the privredna banka zagreb and flitting between them the broker of the deals josip was advising prompting and reassuring they were all veterans and could show their disability allowance cards all had the security of their pensions for heroism and service in the struggle to liberate their country the pensions were collateral against a loan they might want to take out in each bank a manager asked to what purpose the loan would be put andrija wished to purchase a ticket to australia to visit cousins tomislav wanted to buy a motor car with an automatic gearbox petar wished to hire builders who would construct for him and his handicapped wife a new kitchen mladen and his son had the chance to invest in a picture gallery in osijek where his own work could be sold and that of other veterans of the war of independence for such men in vukovar there would be little bureaucratic delay papers were produced the numbers from pension books and disability forms noted signatures recorded each was loaned the kuna equivalent of five thousand euros a total of twenty thousand euros was guaranteed it had been done as josip said it should be mladen led them back towards the car park beside the bus station for their journey home as the light failed and the gaunt corners of buildings still unrepaired from shellfire cut the evening sky he left through the same door roscoe had shaken his hand a strong grip he walked quickly to his car back erect he thought they would be watching him from vantagepoints and might even have changed windows to see him go to the far side of the car park who loved an arms dealer nobody nobody loves us and we dont care an anthem of the backers of a polish entry to the eurovision song contest the chant of an east london football teams supporters it applied also to the brokers of weapons they would want from the upper windows of the weymouth police station to see his shoulders droop he reached his car flashed the zapper got in belted up and drove away he didnt give them a backward glance he headed for the main road that would take him back to the causeway and across it then he would climb high on to his refuge island how long had he been waiting a hell of a long time too damn long his home would be empty except for the dog daughter at school and josie had said she would be in london all day she had gone early and would be back in the evening laden with regent street bags he would be there on his own he could reflect on a meeting at the docks in rijeka and a bagful of junk that had been dumped a long time ago the detective civil enough blunt not pussying around had asked the issue between you and this village mr gillot would it be enough for them to want you dead nearly twenty years later to pay to have you dead hed shrugged it was slow going out of weymouth behind towed caravans and he sensed that tempers were fraying around him heh you think its hell to be stuck in traffic for a few minutes he thought he was an alone man didnt want to share and didnt need to he was a pariah clear as neat gin that the detective was weighing what he said and trying in his head to work out a threat assessment roscoe had told him he would be heading back to london and that there would be another meeting of the gold group afterwards the best advice on offer would be given a caravan and a taxi had shunted no injuries just argument he had only asked two questions first he had almost grinned how much would it cost to have him slotted depends who they go for the detective had answered digging deep in their piggybanks theyll be looking to put ten k euros in a top mans hand if theyre doing economy class it might be as little as two k but whether hes an expert with a reputation or cut price and on the climb hes also going to be listing expenses and therell be middle men looking for a cut depends what sort of village it is how wealthy he had asked second where the village would find the man not a croat not a chance roscoe had answered hed thought the detective appreciated the chance to show off a little expertise a big cocaine dealer was taken out in liverpool and all the newspaper talk was of foreign assassins flying in and out but the hitman had to wait in a doorway opposite a gym where the target worked out cant be a foreigner voice and clothes would be a giveaway if its true the village the people there have to get a line into whats available for hire in uk ill hear from you hed said youll hear from me mr gillot when ive talked with colleagues were able to put things in place quite quickly its what we do roscoe had said and had passed him a business card with a mobile number pencilled on the back any time use it then the handshake and then hed walked harvey gillot wondering what he would find drove home a team had arrived that would work for one week of that summer month with the professor they were students of forensic anthropology from a department of the university of vienna and came with their scalpels brushes trowels folders of aerial photographs and groundprobing radar gear they brought tents too and a mobile cookhouse and seemed to think themselves blessed to spend a week with william anders they had made a base camp behind a line of trees that shielded them from the memorial to the victims of ovcara no community here is more guilty than another steyn said anders could have kicked him into his car and told him to drive back to vukovar it was for anders one of the pleasures of his life that he came each year in the heat of summer to search for the remaining sixty who had been butchered near to the storage sheds of the collective farm and buried away from the main pit where the two hundred cadavers had been recovered it gave him this annual reunion a sense of purpose that rewarded him after many of the real shit places he went mexico and the work of the drug cartels was bad now and there was heavy work in central africa still but the search for the last grave at ovcara the company of the austrian students and their lecturers was a boost to his ego and seemed worthwhile steyn said blame a serb and hell talk to you of what happened at jasenovac camp in brzica a guard won a bet among his colleagues and slit the throats of one thousand three hundred and sixty prisoners with a shortbladed knife in one day he was a croat the vukovar water tower was in the far distance on the skyline with the last light on it and the students threw long shadows as they finished the days work that evening anders would drink a bottle of ilok wine and sit with them there was a woman lecturer among them who he knew all the stories and case histories that daniel steyn recycled each year but he didnt begrudge him the chance of an ear to bend the statistics of jasenovac were disputed among partisan historians maybe a halfmillion serbs died there at croatian hands and maybe it was no more than sixty thousand and steyn would tell him that serb orthodox priests were hurled over cliffs to die on the rocks below and the people of glina were herded into a church the doors barricaded and the building fired im saying bill that brutality and evil are not a prerogative of one side theres equal blame equal guilt for the last two hours of the days work steyn had been sitting in long grass watching them he had only interrupted the quiet when they packed up for the day anders thought the doctor poor company but a peddler of truths and therefore not to be dismissed theres no sense of reconciliation daniel he heard the snort of derision cant be reconciliation croats wont apologise for what they did alongside the nazis and serbs wont for what they did here nothings forgiven forgotten should we care if we dont no other bastard will steyn laughed anders joined him and they went to the food tent for the first beer of the evening the sun dipped on fine rich countryside on fields that showed good crops of corn and sunflowers and where the grapes ripened well behind anders back there were trees and behind them the site of a mass grave there were times here when he struggled to find logic and he couldnt explain the travelling belt on which the cycle of killing moved at slow speed but with a treadmills inevitability as if there was a demand for it insatiable there were interservice rivalries that was why the young woman penny laing from the alpha team of revenue and customs had been so scratchy after the policedominated gold group meeting but they were minor when set against the cold shoulders on offer from one police force to another roscoe recognised the antipathy and would have been blind and deaf if he hadnt well they were yokels down here peasants and cousindaters so they resented the arrival of a detective sergeant from a specialist crowd up in the smoke the coffee offered him had been foul the water was warm in the bottle hed been given and the room theyd made available was below the ranking of nothing special he thought it was outoforder treatment hed been handed a slip of paper as hed stood in the lobby to watch gillot his tango drive away a local honcho wanted to see him he was expected to debrief the locals on his intelligence the probability or possibility of an attack on their territory he answered questions with studied vagueness that verged on insubordination couldnt do anything else didnt know did he mark roscoe was afloat but in deep water he did not know whether the threat to harvey gillot was probable or possible or merely a concoction of halftruths whispers and rumours the local big man had silver on his epaulettes and an airconditioned office that enabled him to sit in full regalia at his desk he had looked pretty damn pissed off when he was told that the risk assessment had not yet been completed he had spoken to harvey gillot of a man who was expert with a reputation or cheap and on the climb roscoe quit the police station a modern eyesore that left he thought a footprint of ugliness on the town in his car on the way to the main road and then the link to the motorway he thought what a goddamn backwater this was it came like a kick in the shin that it was the sort of place where harvey gillot with an unresolved issue from long ago would choose to live roscoe would have said the odds stacked against him were pretty manageable if the contract was underfunded different if it was backed with money to burn the dump they had retrieved from beside a fireplace in a cupboard and under the flooring had been low grade the hit in the tottenham area no witnesses a targeted man who would have been aware of the risk killed without that three seconds of suspicion had been high grade his team didnt get to hear about highgrade people only reached the crime scene in time to pick up the bodies of course no one used it megs cop on she had in front of her the mornings broadsheets and tabloids and had gutted each one for coverage of her press release she had flipped channels between tv breakfast shows and had half listened to radio news stations she had found seen heard no reference to her work it had taken nearly three months to prepare there were photographs of kids dead on dirt roads and more kids holding aks and rpgs but the name of planet protection was nowhere she had rung a friend sweet man and bent as a corkscrew who had always been good with her material not even one fucking paragraph for christs sake giles not one i did what i could no one in editorial wanted to suck it did you shout and stamp megs i pushed as hard as i could what im saying it needed some balls no balls and no spice means no coverage are you going to hate me megs might just cut your tongue out my features editor said there was nothing new from the last amnesty release and the news editor said your statistics didnt count too much against the mood of the day the editor said this is the evening meeting that people in the uk today have their own problems like bankruptcy being out of work and losing their homes megs you want coverage youve got to spice it up and give us some balls balls are you listening to me hearing you look its been a pretty foul day for me want to take me for a meal tonight a pause he wasnt exactly jumping then really sorry megs but im on an extra roster tonight cant do it he had average expenses for a hack usually when she invited herself they managed a trattoria and mended the world over pasta and a litre of plonk shed let her hand rest on his thigh under the table in spite of his orientation he didnt seem to mind and they were good mates she could have done with a meal a freebie and there was damn all in her purse are you telling me my research is boring would that be an apt description of me my work he surged megs i love you and i admire you your enthusiasm and dedication what youre doing campaigning against the international arms trade is pretty near the lowest level of everybodys priorities dealers are nasty people merchants of death bad people traffickers in misery but where not at the end of my street not in my factory and not in my office you have to liven your act up megs then come back to me sorry i cant do a meal tonight take care the phone went dead in her ear she swept up the days papers cleared them off her desk carried them to the big black bag that hung from a hook and dumped them she felt fucking miserable as if shed been kicked then megs behan dug in her cabinet and tugged out a file harvey gillot she looked for a photograph a devil in a good suit a monster in a laundered shirt it was a twoyearold image and there was no smile as he passed the protest line as if the people behind the crash barrier and the police cordon didnt exist where would she find the spice the balls you said dermot that we needed results for alpha team to survive penny laing stood with her feet apart arms akimbo something like that ill do it verbatim you said we are a natural target for budget slicing to survive we need collars felt court cases convened and sentences passed and if thats what i said the passing of years doesnt diminish the guilt of criminality correct there was in croatia a desperate need for weapons or independence would go down the drain there was a un embargo on selling weapons to the country and it was a dealers freeforall christmas come early the town of vukovar was on the rack and a deal to sell weapons at that time would have been illegal an offence and could be prosecuted dermot if we believe that pillock roscoe we have to accept that harvey gillot was there and intending to trade its where to start vukovar is where to start youre suggesting we go there build a case have to start in vukovar or to be more exact a village outside it we need it dermot youre talking about haemorrhaging the teams budget i have to decide whether the time and effort are worthwhile the cost and the cost is minimal but theres the time and the effort itll be worthwhile or we sink dermot are we serious people or do we just shuffle paper hes a good target as good as any we need to push our investigation into gillots past dig there with a bloody pickaxe we can keep the expense to a minimum come on dermot go for it a successful prosecution i wont argue we need that he tilted back his chair and would have been aware that the others in the team nine of them had abandoned their screens to watch him penny thought he liked an audience his hands came up palms together in prayer pose his words were now slightly muffled but still distinct contracts to kill in my experience arise when a debt is not paid an agreement is broken one party reneges each gangland killing in manchester glasgow london or down on the costa is less about territory and more about retribution for a deal not honoured i venture that harvey gillot is believed by the people of this village to have broken a deal i suppose we have to hope that the hitman if he exists moves at a steady snaillike pace towards the target and that we might just gather enough evidence to warrant an arrest brilliant penny laing basked she imagined a beleaguered garrison a dependence on weapons coming through the resupply of ammunition a deal done and she had seen on field trips out of kinshasa the aftermath of combat her team leader let his eyes float over the others around the big central table he would have been weighing whose work was important and whose could go on to a backburner he gestured asif would you please go with penny first thing tomorrow yes i know the problem but itll be less than a week away make arrangements please penny to turn over the embers of that village skewer him please skewer harvey gillot he sat in an easy chair a table light in the hall and the porch lights were on but in the living room he preferred darkness and the curtains were open at the picture windows harvey gillot nursed a cutclass tumbler that had been refilled twice he could see out over the east shoreline of the island much of his life passed through his mind there was moonlight on the sea and enough wind for tiny white scrapes to be whipped up the dog slept near his feet below him the waves rippled on the rocks at either side of the narrow church ope cove but he couldnt see them away to his left just visible was the ruined tower of rufus castle shards of light fell on old scaffolding childhood hardly worth thinking about only kid in the road who had won entry to the royal grammar school shunned by most in his class because his stoughton accent clashed with those from merrow shalford or wonersh didnt embrace the middleclass attitudes of the herd but also rejected the pride obstinacy of his fathers bluecollar roots the post office supervisor who wore a tie and a white shirt to work after twenty years service no hobbies where had he been happiest happiness as he had known it was in a cafe near the gates of the barracks squaddies came there and tolerated a twelveyearold sitting near them hanging on their words about weapons they testfired hed read the janes books on infantry weapons and armoured vehicles and was a walking encyclopedia on military gear the squaddies had tolerated him enough to take him to one of the aldershot ranges to watch live firing that experience had been the thrill of his life it had been a hell of a bad day when the barracks had closed the soldiers had left and the cafe had shut its door had wanted work not college his first boss was ray bridge who had chided him for lack of ambition in not furthering his education that had been a week before he was sent with the catalogue of office gear to solly liebermans place more thoughts drifted there was a ferry whitepainted the moons light latching on to it ploughing at pace towards weymouth its cabins and passenger rooms ablaze with colour four months afterwards he had ditched his job selling stationery he had sent ray bridge a postcard from peshawar north west frontier up in the hills from the pakistan capital islamabad dear ray thought you would like to know that i am getting on well many opportunities here for selling but not much demand for stationery all best wishes harvey herbert gillot had chuckled when he had posted it in the lobby of greens hotel and now managed a croaklaugh as he sipped his drink and watched the ferry glide on doubted that ray bridge who would now be knocking on eighty if his toes hadnt curled would have equated ambition with a contract taken out in peshawar with solly lieberman he had learned how to move on blowpipe groundtoair missiles and get them into the hands of the hairy bastards our best friends of the day who were fighting the russians our best enemies of the day some were bought by saudis others by pakistani intelligence people and more had been neither bought nor sold but were the property of benjie arbuthnot who was deniable a station officer god incarnate the possessor of the biggest shortwave radio harvey gillot had ever seen and limitless supplies of black bush solly lieberman had organised the traffic of those manpads so that the big man had clean hands the money was good and it was irrelevant that the manportable air defence system of the blowpipe was next to useless that the mujahideen couldnt score hits with it they were hardly going to when two years earlier the guys down in the south atlantic had let off ninety and achieved two strikes one of which was a friendly hed never seen a man drink what benjie arbuthnot put away and harvey gillot was being paid good money he carried solly liebermans bags and ran his laundry for him and might just have wiped his butt if hed been asked to those had been the start of the good days yes it had been his intention to tell josie that evening about a problem what he had told the policeman was an issue couldnt there had been a message on the answerphone shed be late there was a supper dish in the freezer and it would microwave no explanation of where she was why she was out late who if anyone she was with would he see that the horse had its nutrients he had no close friend on the isle of portland no one to sit with and pour a share of the scotch or irish harvey gillot was not wellread he knew nothing of thomas more and his fate half a millennium before but he knew of the words that that saintly man had written in the year before his execution at the hands of an axeman perhaps the intelligence was flawed perhaps there was no contract and no hitman had been hired perhaps no shadows wavered beyond the throw of the porch lights more had written a drowning man will catch at straws he filled his glass again the wind had come up and whipped the branches he heard the clatter of a plant pot falling outside on the patio and rolling he expected he would need to refill the glass a third or a fourth time rare for him he listened for but didnt hear the crunch of her cars tyres on the gravel of the drive and cursed her for not being there harvey gillot could remember it all so well he understood why a contract was taken and a man would be paid to kill he didnt know if he would sleep a tongue washed him slobbered over his cheeks and he moved sharply then he heard the glass hit the floor and harvey gillot was awake he swore it had been good crystal and was chipped a chip could bloody a lip and he stood bright sunlight flooded into the room and the patio was bathed in clear colours from the flowers the seas expanse and the skies there was little wind to stir the bushes at the gardens edge where the ground fell away to the cove the castle and the ruined church the dog crawled across him it was responsible for chipping the glass and dislodging it from his grip he pushed the animal away the stink of scotch was rank on his clothing and the chair he headed for the kitchen to collect a cloth and realised it was the first time in years that hed slept in an easy chair clutching an unfinished measure of whisky the dog wanted breakfast and had disturbed him to get fed it probably wanted to go outside and pee and he remembered why he had been in the chair late at night anaesthetised by scotch he recalled what hed intended to say but when hed been ready to say it she hadnt been there he found a cloth under the sink in the bucket where it always was padded back into the living room and rubbed it hard against the brocade he heard quiet voices recognised hers not his he ditched the cloth and went to the bedroom door it was ajar and he hovered the room faced the front and the drive he heard josies laughter and imagined she was at an open window the second voice was deeper confident the bloody gardeners he pushed the door wider nigel was predictably at the window josie was expected beside it and had her back to harvey she wore a sheer robe the silky one and had it tight at the waist he didnt know what she was wearing underneath or what was on offer to the gardener she turned away from the window god you look a shambles harvey what time did you get in dont know never looked you were flat out he couldnt have said whether her answer was evasive or truthful you didnt wake me no harvey i didnt she mocked him you werent a pretty sight asleep mouth open snoring you looked a bit pissed actually i thought you were better off where you were the gardener was back at his van unloading gear harvey thought his walk too confident and familiar as if he thought he had rights on the territory and perhaps he did his wife had turned and the robe flounced her left leg was on show knee and thigh damn good then the material fell back closing off his view pity you didnt remove the glass you havent god you havent spilled it on the chair or the carpet i didnt want to wake you you didnt look good company so i left you holding it shit and i broke the glass do i often go out did you need to sit up and wait for me he thought then that she hit a button that summoned a minor rant god harvey i sit here and youre swanning round europe im not on the phone ringing your room and demanding to know why you werent there to take my call earlier it was just one evening with the gardener maybe maybe not had she wined and dined him had she taken her bit of rough to a pub on the mainland talked him through the french bits on the menu told him which wine to choose then gone to one of the car parks by redcliff point or ringstead bay she had paused to eyeball him pity about the glass but i expect the carpet and the chairll be fine it had been a good marriage at the start harvey gillot had been trading with the sri lankan military the usual shopping bag they had fire power but problems with communications and hed been out to colombo with the brochures he had already inherited enough of solly liebermans contacts book to know who could supply at a decent price it was a fat deal and would pay well no complaints about the flight business class and upgraded by the ba people at bandaranaike international and everything was rosy until his bag didnt show up on the heathrow carousel a pretty girl had calmed him down sorted the hassle and produced the bag after an hour he was twentyeight she was twentysix and they were married three months later some family and work friends had supported her no one on his side no friends and his parents werent there because they hadnt been invited and anyway he was halfway to losing touch with them it had been pretty good in the early days when the baby had arrived he was high on the ladder and she was at his side then he had uprooted them like fracturing a mirror and taken them to lulworth view on the isle of portland harvey gillot could have said to the day and the hour when his marriage already past the fork in the road had soured a photograph retrieved from a drawer of himself and solly lieberman in the tribal territories when they were flogging off the blowpipes benjie arbuthnot had taken it yes he talked too much about solly lieberman she had looked at it and her mouth had curled at the sight of solly the crown of his head level with harveys shoulder and shed said so thats the poisonous creature i seem to live with the death of a marriage already terminally ill and she hadnt registered it harvey had he was turning his back on her and the dog was whining at the door she challenged him why did the police want you too many speeding points youd think theyd better things to do than im taking the dog out itll keep until i get back she would have realised hed lied too offhand whats the matter phone bust and email gone down im taking the dog out and when im back from my walk then ill tell you what happened at the police station he and his dog went out together he checked the outer gate every tree that might have been a potential hidingplace and the bushes alongside the coastal path while the dog bounded ahead feet apart arms extended the baikal held firm in both hands the blast of the firing was in his ears and the recoil kicked up the barrel no smile on his face as the skull shape disintegrated robbie cairns had not used a silencer or worn earprotectors the mm bullet he had fired into the skull was soft nose the hollowpoint variety first developed in the dumdum armaments factory of calcutta it expanded on impact and created the greatest damage to any part of a human body it was a manstopper he gazed at what he had achieved the right side of the head was intact but the left had shattered it was the third weapon he had tested robbie cairns would have said it was like trying on a new pair of shoes the feel was right or it wasnt the third of the baikal izh pistols was the one that seemed good to him better than the other two they had come off the same production line had been converted from discharging teargas pellets to firing killing bullets by the same lithuanian craftsmen but the way the weight lay in his hands and the grip of his fingers on the butt seemed different he was the best customer the armourer had robbie cairns believed in the total discretion of the man who sat a mile away in a car park and didnt watch him shoot with the three pistols at the shopwindow dummy the armourer would take the secrets of his customer base to the grave if he didnt the grave would welcome him earlier blood pulsed in robbies veins always did when he fired live rounds crazy thing but the elation was no greater when he shot at a walking screaming falling target than when he aimed at a plastic head that might have been in a display at the store where barbie worked now he was careful his hands were in sensitive rubber gloves the two rejected weapons went into the briefcase in which they had been delivered the one he would use now that a contract rate had been agreed and a deal done was dropped into a small holdall with the ammunition a supermarket bag held the remnants of the two plastic heads already demolished and he knelt to pick up the fragments of the third the bullets would have been squashed beyond recognition and were spent somewhere among the trees he had had no training in handling weapons his grandfather wouldnt have them in the flat said he hated the damn things he had also said that firearms hanged men his father had never had a gun on a raid only one man had urged robbie cairns to get serious firearms expertise an officer at feltham not the one who had told him he could have a better life than traipsing in and out of courtrooms had urged him to go for the regular army on his release had told him it was possible for a teenagers criminal record to be ignored robbie had dismissed it out of hand nobody would give orders to him once the gates at feltham had closed behind him but he had met a man might have been a tinker on rainham marshes who was shooting pigeons hed had decoys pegged out and had made himself a hide of camouflage netting the man had told him about shotguns rifles and handguns he might once have been in uniform and booted out late in the day evening coming on the geese had flown in the man had shot one then passed the weapon to robbie and left it to him beginners luck or natural talent a canada goose had been hit in flight had feathered to the marshland and flapped crippled robbie had walked to it and two turns wrung its neck why had he been on rainham marshes to bury a metallipped cosh that had been used on a man at a club in southwark the guy was hospitalised so the cosh was hot and needed to disappear never saw the tinker again but had learned about posture breathing and to respect what his hands held he had taken the goose home and his mum had thrown half a fit and gone apoplectic and said it was for the rubbish granddad cairns round the corner had plucked and cleaned it grandma cairns had cooked it a good bird but stringy it had flown hundreds of miles before landing on rainham marshes when he was satisfied that nothing remained he hitched up the briefcase the duffel bag and the plastic one that held the broken head and the spent cases put the decapitated dummy under his arm and started to tramp back along a narrow path he headed for the car park where the armourer would be waiting and in his hip pocket always cash upfront was what he would pay one worry nagged at him that day leanne was in an internet cafe and would be doing the google thing on aerial views of a stretch of coast cliffs and quarries that might be working or were disused it was easy to be on a pavement in bermondsey or rotherhithe or up in tottenham merging with people he had never worked out of london had never been asked to do a hit in a wideopen space he wondered which of his talents would count when the city was behind him he didnt know when he didnt know he worried please just tell me itll be your best effort that day vern would be making the last arrangements for the car testdriving what the garages under the arches had on offer hed be going carefully because it was well known that they were flagged by the police and watched and he worried because leanne had said that the targets house could only be reached and left by one road he didnt like worrying wasnt used to it but the contract was agreed and his credibility did not permit robbie cairns to wriggle or do a weasel run theyd go down the next day to where the target lived and look the building was a warren of sections the impoverished groups that protested against brutality from rightwing governments leftwing regimes statesponsored torture the exploitation of migrant labour and the international arms trade had to work cheek by jowl it was rare though for one group to seek advice from another megs behan broke a habit on the floor above there was an overspill office used by the peace brigade what do you want me to tell you that youre just a clerk a paperpusher hows that for a start the organisations in the building were of course fiercely independent they guarded their territory jealously youre hardly going to hit their heights with a few media releases you do stands at political conferences you brief administrators a few junior ministers know your names and it all seems like the centre of the universe were not on those tracks she had had a bad night shed smoked through half of it had been up twice and into the little communal kitchen for coffee the first time then herbal tea her selfesteem battered by the sense that her efforts were useless her familys assessment of her work her father was a senior hospital administrator her mother a high court judge one brother was a partner in an accountancy business and the other a ceo in pharmaceuticals she went home at christmas endured their patronising remarks about her good works and left as soon as public transport was running again but permitted little wads of banknotes to be dropped into her handbag last year when shed heard of their triumphs and survival in the downturn shed still felt some degree of worth but not last night so she had climbed the stairs and bearded one of the peace brigade people were in colombia salvador nicaragua and particularly guatemala were not in westminster were alongside potential victims the writers the freepress journalists trade unionists priests who wont be cowed were walking with them living in their homes we are almost a moral shield where are you megs he had the tan to prove where he had been and there were scabs on his neck that she thought were from a vast mosquito in some horrible jungle if i cause offence so be it and i wont apologise the arms trade is wrong end of story its responsible for deaths on a criminal scale its an area of quite colossal greed so get off your bum megs do something thats noticed that message on board she bobbed her head bit her lip and headed for his door do they know who you are megs the brokers of arms do they know you exist are you a pain in the arse to them she stamped down the stairs and back to her cubicle she was almost at the checkin desk lifting her bag when a mobile rang not hers asifs the girl at the desk was waiting to take the printout that travel sections computers had spewed then had turned away to her screen and gesticulated at the conveyorbelt beside her penny laing dropped her bag on to it asif was talking quietly and she couldnt hear what he was saying the sticker was fastened to her bags handle and it was gone she was passed her boarding card he was still talking and the girl heaved an impatient sigh a man from the queue pushed him and a woman coughed noisily he stepped out of the queue and the man elbowed penny clear of the desk asifs head was bowed and she sensed anguish the woman nudged her further aside she might have flared up she was tired ready to flop down on a seat flying since she had joined hmrc had been limited the drc kinshasa via brussels dublin a few times and the redeye flights to malaga and all points on the costa where traffickers lived in the sun it was in gibraltar that she had met paul ill be there darling im on my way in her mind this was a good assignment potentially rewarding it had the footprint on it of harvey gillot whats the problem she asked sharply its my wife theres a complication and whens it due she knew little about the vagaries of childbirth about a month if im not travelling can you cope i mean yes she said she sounded pretty low penny was crisp just get to her call the office in your car and let them know ill be fine now ive got the files all you have is the contact list in zagreb the embassy lowlife and well hardly be camping at their door i dont have any option on your way she was decisive enough to wipe the doubt off his forehead he would not be blowing an interesting investigation out of the water it didnt cross her mind that she shouldnt travel because asif khans wife had a pregnancy complication they were supposed to be in pairs when abroad wouldnt happen unless she was beefed up when she got there no problem he gave her the embassy numbers and staffers names then was lost in the crowds shed wait until she was airside before she called in and spoke to dermot and useful precaution she switched off her mobile and would leave it off until the flight was called she had not done university but a distant cousin of her team leader lectured at the school of slavonic and east european studies a branch of london university dermot had telephoned the introduction and the guy had talked to her for half of the night she had been with him till the starbucks had closed and the disasters of that part of europe had stacked up in her mind so penny laing didnt know what she would find other than confusion and would have resisted fiercely if anyone had tried to block her she waited for the flight call the gold commander targeted him stabbing at him with a pencil whats gillot expecting from us whats your assessment im hoping maam that we can decide whats on offer then give him that to digest it was a neat response a trick based on experience throw it back the gaudier the decorations on the epaulettes the greater the responsibility bigger fish than detective sergeant mark roscoe would decide on the ramifications of a risk assessment and what could be done for a tangos protection he thought the woman at the end of the table phoebe bermingham glowered at him he had gone through his notes of a conversation the previous afternoon with the tango and had been heard he was the junior at the table responsibility was not going to land in his lap different times now there was prestockwell and poststockwell before the shooting dead of a harmless brazilian painterdecorator in a london underground carriage he would have volunteered opinions but too much shit had been heaped on the watchers and marksmen for him to do so now a stenographer in the corner was writing busily the gold commander turned almost reluctantly to the intelligence representative he was harry from scd i have nothing that tells me this threat is empty or real i have tried thames house and vbx for a little offtherecord guidance and had a door shut in my face which probably means they dont know what advice for gillot in an ideal world he would up sticks and shift somewhere off the radar who would take such a contract first and were all agreed on this its not a foreigner but a local man most likely based in london our problem is that the men who would attract the sort of cash reward on offer are successful with a carefully guarded reputation there might be six in the capital do i have their names no steve was covert surveillance scd a dapper figure recently off the road because of a kneeligament problem and therefore condemned to gold group meetings few noticed him many saw him he could blend and seemed to resent the spotlight that came with maams pencilpointing first we dont know who the hitman will be so we cant stake him we move on the potential target is not resident in the metropolitan police service area but in remote dorset there is no possibility that the locals down there would have available sufficient specialists to mount twentyfourseven surveillance of gillots property were gillot in london or the home counties on the intelligence available i doubt id support such a manpower drain of my own people but sending them down to the dorset coastline isnt on if my people were there with a realistic threat of an assassination attempt who intervenes whats the backup we wont be there the representative of firearms co was donny he had put on weight since hed slipped off the black overalls and left the h ampk in the armoury he was known as a gagartist and liked black humour it was alleged that he had said he fervently denied it as he had aimed at an afrocaribbean on a wagesvan heist make my day sunshine then fired doubletap since stockwell he had gone by the book and his catechism was that his people would not be exposed ive spoken to dorset they have enough firearmstrained personnel to cope with existing priorities and emergencies but theres no question of them having the resources to mount a fulltime protection operation on the isle of portland they point out that it would be irresponsible to deploy unarmed officers at a property we believe will be attacked by an armed criminal a killer we have a duty of care of course to mr gillot and a similar duty of care to any officers sent to protect him we cannot have unarmed officers walking into a predicted lifethreatening situation conclusions protection is not feasible there could only be an armed presence if intelligence a predicted date time and location for an attack but not an indefinite sitaround his life and his familys safety are pretty much in his own hands in its journey round the table maams pencil point rested on the team leader the cuckoo in their midst roscoe thought the man from hmrcs alpha team seemed aloof from the practicalities expressed he started impishly well what a difficult furrow we have to plough and inconvenient anyway harvey gillot is a toptenlisted arms broker we would assume that hes ninetysomething per cent legal and five plus something per cent not if we could gain enough evidence to nail him in court hed be a good scalp for my crowd the assumption is that he was involved in a sanctionsbusting deal in at which time croatia was fighting for its existence then pulled the carpet from under whatever hed agreed with the village mr roscoe talked of were now on our way to vukovar and hope to have detail on the transaction that failed we have no doubt that gillot broke faith with whoever he dealt with which has led to the contract on his life i would offer you one thought were used to principal players in international drugstrafficking feeling theyve been cheated or disrespected and employing a gunman to right a wrong very cold and brutal people who dont tolerate broken faith or disrespect my one thought an aggrieved citizen of the balkans would be a serious enemy for mr gillot to have made nothing else to add five minutes later after maam had summarised mark roscoe was on the phone the telephone had been ringing when harvey gillot had come to the kitchen door so he had gone inside and answered the call the dog had followed him and would now be in the hall the dust of the coast path would be on the carpet and didnt matter too much what the carpet in the hall looked like she was on the patio to the right of the kitchen window with a breathtaking view of the seascape she had the newspaper some coffee and her ipod in her ears the gardener was working near to her he laid the telephone back in the cradle when he appeared on the patio she glanced at him she wore shorts and a loose tshirt shed kept herself well languid eyes and a lazy voice you did give the horse that stuff last night no i did not for gods sake harvey i asked you to you did indeed and to tell you the truth i couldnt be bothered to tramp out there measure whatever it is the brute eats and so you just did the pissartist act something like that if the horse needs pills try feeding it yourself they argued rarely and never before the move to portland then he had closed down the office inherited from solly lieberman and paid off the old secretary at first josie had managed the baby and had done the accounts which showed what was suitable of his earnings they had been a team and the money had rolled in now he did his books and kept his files he knew what to shred or burn and what to keep the gardener was hunched over a flowerbed but harvey gillot was fucked if he could see anything that resembled a weed am i allowed to ask she did the aggrieved bit well am i entitled to know why your mood is so foul why the horse goes unfed maybe he said quietly his voice falling away something happened yesterday and she had turned away from him and the gardener had twisted to face her shirt undone sweat in the hair on his chest he thought she was showing him a crossword clue he said something harvey couldnt hear and she wrote on the paper then she looked at her husband oh something happened you were awarded three more speeding points nobody wants any howitzers share harvey what happened yesterday he breathed hard tried the past came back it had been dead for nineteen years but its alive now are you still pissed harvey youre talking rubbish what happened whats in the past her lips formed a derisive smile i know an affair harvey had an affair or maybe just a onenighter and now theres a big strapping teenage boy and shut up and fucking listen hed yelled it the gardener had swung round and was holding a little hand fork as if it was a weapon his raised voice would have been heard on the beach by the ruins of the chapel and on the path against rufus castle and you please fuck off a look at josie as if she had to give her permission she said im all right nigel hes all bark and no bite the gardener sloped away with his fork to the wheelbarrow which he pushed off the patio harvey had never sworn at her before he thought her face had flushed and he imagined it a rubicon moment another deep breath the detective i met yesterday hes coming down again tomorrow from london why because there is perhaps a possibility of a threat against my life are you serious the detective his name is roscoe quite decent and i think efficient is the liaison officer hes from a squad that specialises in proactive operations against contract killers they have word theres a price on my life where from the balkans specifically croatia a village there how much is your life worth whats the cost of the contract i dont know she sat up and the tshirt rucked he realised she was wearing no underwear beneath it from the patio she would have been able to see along the coastal path calculate his progress and estimate when he would be back at their home from his walk what did you do there was an acid calm in her voice i mean it cant be every day that a gang of people from central europe have a whipround to hire a killer the sun burned on his face and the reflection of the sea was in his eyes it was a deal that didnt happen you always talk about trust did you break someones he squirmed it was a long time ago it wasnt straightforward you either had a deal or you didnt before my time nearly twenty years ago pops up now so it must have festered gone rancid was it a double cross there was stuff it was youre sounding pathetic and evasive what happens to me am i included in the contract is that an extra a supplement on the price what about fiona home next week because of your stuff do i have to look under the car does she have to hide under her bed are fiona and i on the ticket with you the detective will tell us tomorrow she stood the newspaper crumpled in her fist he thought she was struggling for the ultimate riposte something that would leave him in rags she couldnt find it the ferry was going out on the crossing to one of the channel islands or st malo and the yachts were dwarfed by it a tanker was far out on the horizon she asked do you expect me and fiona to join you in a bunker he didnt answer her just went inside nobody loves us and we dont care the anthem was loud in his head a heat haze hung over the town it was clear because there were no high industrial chimneys in vukovar and the bata shoe factory at borovo upriver had closed a few fishermen were on the low platform just above the rivers waterline the wash from a widebeamed flatbottomed tourist boat that powered downstream slapping near their feet it was one of the white boats that used the river as a slow transport from vienna or budapest to the black sea in the southeast most of the travellers were on the decks crowding the starboard side of the boat and a guide was telling them about what they saw and its significance he had started work at the shoe factory and would devote nearly fifteen minutes to a description of the events at vukovar in the autumn of he spoke of the quality and craftsmanship of the shoes manufactured at borovo but not of the divisions in the labour force once conflict had erupted how former serb employees had bayed for the blood of former croat employees who had once worked and sat in the canteen beside them he did not point out the roofs of the village near the river where croat police recruits had been massacred by serb paramilitaries and mutilated or the trpinjska road which could have been identified by the church tower above the trees where there had been a killing ground for tanks and marko babi alone was credited with the destruction of fifteen ts and their serb crews and blago zadro had coordinated the tactics making himself a national hero in an infant country and he did not show them the tall building with the new tiled roof behind it was the entrance to the command bunker of brigade from which mile dedakovic the hawk had directed the defence of the town the guide had to mention the memorial on a jutting strip of land that protected a marina a great cross of white stone ten metres high four across commemorated the lives of a thousand of the towns defenders those from the villages on the cornfield road and at least another thousand civilians trapped inside the shrinking perimeter he would have pointed to the newlaid square the glass frontages of modern banks and the flags flying in the light breeze he could speak of the imposing franciscan monastery high on a cliff with yellowishochre walls but he would steer away from the desecration of graves in the vaults when victorious troops had swarmed through the building impossible to ignore the water tower to the west of vukovar the flag flew well on it that morning and little murmurs rippled among the passengers hugging the rails on the upper deck passing binoculars among them with the magnification the tourists could identify the gaping holes in the brickwork of the bowl where water had been stored for the maintenance of pipe pressure the guide allowed himself a short reference to the homeland war and deep divisions but left it implicit that peace had returned to this little corner of eastern slavonia just beyond the town no sign and therefore no need to identify the site of the ovcara massacre and the formal graves of the bodies exhumed from a killing pit the guide could enthuse because now the boat slipped past the elevated ground thirty or forty metres above the river level where the vu edol village had been dug and explored he spoke with passion of a community existing there before the birth of christ its skill in processing copper and alloys he did not tell them that the archaeological work was now abandoned through lack of funds it was gone vukovar was behind the chugging boat and only a failing wash showed its brief presence and a floating cigarette carton that had been accidentally dropped the guide knew his customers fifteen minutes from a twelveday river cruise was the maximum that people on holiday germans austrians americans french italians and british wished to spend on contemplation of an atrocity and a towns misery the guide likened passing vukovar to attending a funeral and sought to lighten the mood when he had finished talking he arranged always for cheerful music to replace him on the loudspeakers who would remember what they had seen few would the photographs taken from the deck jog memories in years to come unlikely the tourist boat had sailed on downstream and rounded a bend for a little while there had been the wake but that too was now dispersed simun had watched it he was enrolled as a student at the college in vinkovci which taught a variety of builders skills plumbing electrical bricklaying and plastering simun was also on the list of local people designated disabled his birth his childhood and the circumstances of his adolescence combined to offer him a shortcut to avoiding the need to find employment or purpose he sat on a bench watched the river and kept a vague eye on the anglers he would have been excited if a rod had arched as he had seen the boat go by it had broken into his small world had been a part of it for a few minutes and had gone his disabled status which a psychiatrist in osijek confirmed each year after an examination conducted by telephone gave him a small allowance from the state it was as if simun two and a half weeks old when the village fell was himself a veteran of the battle that morning simun had not taken the bus to the college in vinkovci but had come to vukovar to go to the new boutique on strossmeyer and buy a shirt he had seen it after leaving the bank yesterday with his father and had thought it wellstyled he would have few opportunities to show it off shortsleeved buttondown collar soft blue with a light check to an admiring audience because he was one of the few young people beyond school age who had remained in the village they were scattered but simun would not leave his father others had gone he had not his story often told by his father made him unique on the last night after his father had swaddled simun to leave the women had give them a cup of milk taken from the cow two days before the last cow petar had shot the rest because of their agony when he hadnt had the opportunity to milk them and two slices of old bread mladen had gone alone with his infant into the night out past the last perimeter strongpoint and into the corn they had been father and son three days and nights in the corn the baby had never cried and the milk had been finished by the second day the bread softened in rainwater by the second evening on the first night his father had realised that after five hours walking he had doubled back on himself and been within sight of the ruins of the church tower that the artillery had failed to bring down he had had to start the journey again and had detonated a mine a pomz fragmentation stake mine simun knew its make power and the spread of its blast because tomislav had one in his shrine to the village the mine had fallen half on its side and the blast was restricted but many pieces had lodged in his fathers leg and in the arms that had protected the baby they had been saved from the cetniks by a herd of cattle that had been close to the explosion the animals had stampeded and there had been shouts in the darkness that one had snagged the tripwire then his father bleeding had swum the vuka river on his back with the baby tied to his chest and had trudged the last kilometre to the lines at nustar a nun in the hospital at vinkovci had said the babys survival was a miracle a father had said that the childs quiet while they were traversing the cornfields where cetniks searched for survivors from the village was another in the refugee camps simun had been labelled the miracle his father was now undisputed leader of the community simun was the son of his father no one in the village not even the widow would criticise him he was subsidised by his father with the state disability pension and he traded in pills he had that monopoly in the community it did not concern simun that for twelve years he had not been beyond vinkovci or osijek or that he had never slept a night outside his village his horizon was where the ripening corn met the skies his experience of a world beyond the village was from the american programmes imported by croatian tv but he hardly watched them and never the news bulletins preferring to sit in the cafe or play pool in its back room simun knew the name of every fighter who had died in the defence of the village where each man had died and how by what weapon and its calibre he knew because he had heard it in the cafe nobody had ever lectured the miracle child now nineteen tall and wellpresented with his mothers looks on a life going to waste penny laing drove into the town and was not sure how she had stayed on the road she had been tired enough when she had flown into zagreb at the airport she had hired a small slick renault from hertz blackpainted because the investigation division always used black cars they didnt stand out as primrose yellow or tangerine would she had been to the embassy might have been a hepatitisb carrier for the welcome shed had no coffee no lunch certainly not a lifesaving beer but bottled water and some plain biscuits in an interview room a first secretary had met her and another man had sat in a corner and not contributed sod him penny laing had thought shed assumed that the interloper was the station officer the source of the intelligence there had been from the first secretary the predictable line about not offending the natives going by the book and liaising at every step on her journey shed asked direct are you the guy who kicked this off supposing you are were concerned about what credence to give it high or low it would help to know the spooks in her experience from kinshasa and those who helped with more sophisticated bugging than hmrc could get their hands on always seemed to have a little mischief in their eyes and the faintest of smiles and never answered a direct question her eyes had been on him and he had fixed his gaze on the ceiling as if he was looking for cobwebs the first secretary had said its a backward part of a backward country and it was seriously traumatised by warfare of the most vicious and merciless sort simple people they make loyal friends and dedicated enemies but you miss laing will be neither friend nor enemy i would suggest trust few and believe little stay aware miss laing she had given the first secretary a curt handshake but the other man had kept his hands firmly behind his back the road a highway had taken her to the outskirts of nova gradiska then slavonski brod where she had stopped for fuel had had a leisurely cup of coffee and reflected on the lorries that seemed to deny her a space in either the fast or slow lane she had been trembling as she held the polystyrene cup because of near misses and great beasts carving her up forcing her to swerve or stamp on the brake north of zupanja she had turned off the a and crossed a wide agricultural plain the sun had been sinking when she skirted to the west of vinkovci and then there was nustar and signs directing her to the outskirts of vukovar there were no more lorries to force her out of their path but there were big grain silos to her right when the low sun caught them she saw the cavernous holes that artillery shells had blasted she didnt know what she might achieve it had seemed easier in london where there had been certainties she no longer had them there were ruined buildings on either side of her and trees grew through what had once been living rooms that fronted on to the street she saw a sign for a hospital a green cross on an illuminated white background the lecturer had told her what had happened at a hospital in vukovar penny laing took her left hand off the wheel and smacked her cheek catching her nose she had not come for a bloody history lesson she had come to nail down harvey gillot arms dealer who had had an issue here he slept like a baby in the principal guest room harvey gillot had worked all day telephone and email on a deal to replenish stocks of artillery and tank shells for use on army ranges josie was in her own bed she had cleaned gone to the supermarket cooked and put his food on the table lunch and supper but had not eaten with him she had taken food to the horse and had watched a movie on tv shadows bounced off the walls of the house darkness nestled on it and the wind rustled dead leaves an atmosphere that a knife could have cut dense and threatening is it real or not mr roscoe the look gillot flashed at her his wife was savage roscoe assumed that he had told her his own opinion as to whether or not it was real she however deliberately posed the question again and would reckon to belittle him that way roscoe didnt do marriage guidance seldom attempted any degree of conciliation he had had a good drive down had started early enough for the road to be clear and had walked into a snakepit with no serum its a simple enough question mr roscoe is this a serious threat to us or is it merely gossip from the bazaar another look from gillot roscoe thought it would have halted a charging buffalo in its tracks but it had no effect on the wife he had sensed that gillot had anticipated their meeting would be one on one man to man he had been walking roscoe from the hall towards the open door of what seemed an office when she had come out of the kitchen and hijacked him gillot was not going to tell his wife to eff off in front of a stranger roscoe had been led out on to the patio a view that didnt have a price cliffs rock promontories an expanse of sea a great open mass of sky and a distant shoreline stretching away to the east the bright sails of yachts there were loungers and thank god an upright chair which he had snaffled and a parasol that threw shade gillot had sat on the end of a lounger scowling the wife was stretched out on another but with the back raised in shorts and a loose longsleeved blouse he thought she looked wellcaredfor he did not of course know what gillot had told her and wondered if he was walking towards a minefield anyway he didnt know whether the threat was serious or not he couldnt fathom whether harvey gillot had told his wife it was actual or a piece of mythology passed down from an illinformed height he had been given gassy water to drink you see mr roscoe this isnt just about my husband its also about me and my daughter who comes home from school next week and its about my home he did this talk most often with serious players in organised crime if the player dealt in cocaine shipments had reneged and was under threat roscoe would have been in an office in a kent mansion and the woman would have been in her fiftythousandpound kitchen and would have stayed there he wasnt used to dealing with wives who demanded answers neither was he used to having the husband sagging on the end of a lounger the sun full on his face cheeks unshaven and shirt not changed from the previous day it was a big debate area in scd how much detail could be given out concerning a contract threat give no information and mount surveillance end up with a grandstand view of the hitman slotting the intended victim before the armed police could intervene and everybody finishing up in the high court on a dutyofcare action give too much information the potential victim might identify the threat coming his way preempt the process and do the shooting himself it was a fine line what if i happen god forbid to be beside him when a shot is fired what if theres a bomb under the car and they dont know which car i drive and which is his and i have a fifteenyearold daughter its her home as much as mine can i have please mr roscoe some answers roscoe had brought bill and suzie with him bill would be padding round the garden checking out the boundaries of the property and suzie would be in the village learning about the community and routes into it it was indeed a minefield the flying squad liked to put the people in place then wait for a hit or a snatch to be just about there in good clear view in front of them before they intervened then they ended up with the proper charges not a conspiracy offence but it made for difficult judgements and frayed nerves he came clean about as clean as he could your husband as i am sure hes told you was involved with people in croatia in the degree of involvement and what happened he has chosen not to confide to us but he has let us understand that a disputed matter lies between the parties himself and a village in the east of the country we dont yet know why the matter has been resurrected after nearly two decades if your husband mrs gillot has been perceived as a cheat and this community has identified him maybe located him we have no reason to doubt their motivation to move on him and perhaps you your daughter and your home i see no reason not to take such a threat seriously breath hissed through gillots lips roscoe realised the man had sidestepped from spilling it to his wife since he had arrived he had not heard them exchange a word and there had been precious little eyecontact take such a threat seriously that is what you said its the initial assessment there are indications we should take seriously indications thats a pretty bland word when were discussing my daughters and my life and the security of my home and of course mrs gillot were also discussing your husbands life and indications of a threat to it gillot caught roscoes eyes for the first time there was a flash of light in them as if he had found about time a friend she looked away didnt accept the rebuke and stared out to sea her shorts had ridden up but mark roscoe was not harvey gillots friend work had pitched them together there would be as much bonding or as little as if harvey gillot dealt classa stuff in the sink estates of southeast london the man was a gunrunner he lived in a big property with a great view had a degree of success dripping off him and was probably inside the legal limits of his trade most of the time but he would get no more no less support than a drugstrafficker roscoe would not have said that made him any sort of zealot just that it was the way he operated and she had reacted as if his remark was a swat on the nose can we at your convenience start with some answers mr roscoe because we take the threat seriously and believe there are indications of the validity of the intelligence forwarded to us we stop the bullshit mr roscoe and get to the point he did at times in this scenario he might have played it soft and sought to reassure but he was at the point and it was sharp there is no question of us providing an armed protection unit to move into your home i assume thats not for negotiation neither because of the indications of a threat and our responsibility to our own personnel will unarmed officers be deployed to your home that means theyd have to go shopping with you maybe attend your daughters school and social engagements understood we would hardly be likely to request from the local force that they do anything more than maintain a sporadic watch on the road through the village they might extend a normal patrol pattern and come by this way but thats difficult why difficult we dont encourage officers unprotected likely young and inexperienced to approach a car in which an armed man may be doing surveillance of your home of course and when weve finished listing all the health and safety involving your people and your lack of resources what about me my daughter and my home two options mrs gillot she gave a brittle laugh what are they you can stay and well offer full advice on the installation of additional homesecurity equipment you can take your chance and hope the intelligence was faulty of course should you activate a panic button police response will be governed by the availability of armed officers it might not be immediate or you can pull out mrs gillot you and your husband can move go off the map the next question is usually for how long dont know cant estimate openended you disappear maybe take on new identities that also we can advise on the hitman if our intelligence is correct turns up here finds an empty house and he isnt here already watching us is he we dont think so usually theres quite a lengthy period of surveillance and reconnaissance ill not gild it a contract of this sort would be initiated with serious and careful people not a cowboy wholl charge in they would look for an opportunity as i say you can pull out mrs gillot and let him turn up here im not saying were lacking in the field of intelligence gathering but i emphasise we dont have the resources for roundtheclock protection vern was driving as they passed the olympics site and came across the causeway his sister was beside him and his brother slouched in the back vern thought of his sister as the kid an afterthought between their parents her conception timed after a lengthy spell his father had served in hmps wandsworth and parkhurst he thought of his brother as the young un the difference he would have called his sister kid to her face but he would never have addressed his brother disrespectfully leanne had a good temperament and could laugh not just at others but at herself she was popular and could drink in the pubs if she fancied it robbie the young un had no humour in his face seldom laughed at others never at himself and didnt drink vern had driven carefully from southeast london behind them left there was all they knew well the route vern had chosen had taken them past the yard where george francis had been done by a hitman for losing brinks mat money he was minding past the flat where a smalltime villian had been killed and dismembered later the killer had sat in the back of a car taking the pieces out to the essex marshes for dumping and waved a severed arm at motorists going the other way past the armourers home a little terraced house anonymous with a reinforced shed out the back past pubs where a tout or an undercover wouldnt have lasted long enough to buy a pint before he was busted past the garages where the cars were fitted up for them and past the osprey estate where a boy had been beaten and killed a gang of kids had thought a wall of silence would protect them but they were doing time because the wall had been holed by the police and past the complex of housingassociation homes where the irish contract killer had shot a brindle brother right under the sights of police guns vern had flicked a glance in the mirror to watch the young uns reaction and there had been none interesting that there was no reaction as they went down needleman street vern like leanne their mum and dad granddad and grandma cairns was supposed to know nothing of the woman kept there vern knew he reckoned leanne did not that hed told her he reckoned the parents didnt know or the grandparents he had seen from a car the young un come out of the blocks main entrance and pause on the pavement to look up hed followed the eyeline stationary in a traffic foulup and had seen the woman her little hand gesture at the window and there had been a secretive response a waft of the fingers from his brother he wouldnt challenge him or make a joke about it wouldnt mention what he knew he never challenged robbie he was frightened of the young un and he lived off the young uns payroll he had not asked if leanne knew that robbie had a woman in the block opposite the entrance to christopher court just assumed she did it was careful driving because a crash an incident even being pulled over by a bored cop for speeding would have been a disaster pretty big on any scale under the back seat where robbie sat in a sealed package of bubble wrap was the pistol with a twelvebore shotgun its barrels sawn down in the boot there were overalls two sets of balaclavas extra trainers a canister of lighter fuel and a bag of spare clothing his robbies and hers jumbled in together the tops in bright colours and a wig for leanne just before they had hit the causeway leanne had done the switches under the dash that played the scanner through the car radio and detected police broadcasts it couldnt decode the encrypted wavelengths of the specialist units but it registered the squelch of white noise this might be a reconnaissance trip and theyd go back to london if they liked what they saw they might hang around wait for it to be that degree better or move forward no delay she had a printout map from an internet cafe and aerial photographs one that covered the roofs of the house another of the house and garden and a third that showed the sea a small beach ruins the gardens of other homes and the lane that led to where the target lived he saw her study the photographs why did she do it she had money like he did when robbie worked she hardly bought clothes and shoes was smart but not special she didnt have a girlfriend to go with on holiday to spain didnt have a boyfriend to sneak off with maybe loyalty to her brother kept her tight to him but vern couldnt fathom it when robbie had the dark moods though black as hell only his sister could lift him in front of him was the towering heap of rock and its summit on the wheel vern flexed his fingers it was new ground for them he felt the nerves all of the drive down he had felt a tightening of the knot in his stomach as the miles of countryside yellow and ripened grazed and bare had slipped past the sea shimmered beside the causeway he knew the sea from trips to margate where his father had liked to take them when he was home and folkestone which his mother preferred he knew the sea also from the times his father had been in parkhurst and their mother had dragged them on to the ferry for the journey to the isle of wight they came off the causeway he sensed that leanne had stiffened but robbies breathing was as steady as it had been on the rest of the journey one way in vern thought and therefore one way out are you saying mr roscoe that youre prepared to get back into your car drive away from here and leave us barearsed what matters more the budget and the resources available or my life and my daughters she had pushed herself up on the lounger facing the detective she thought he showed a minimum of sympathy for her husband and none for her not familiar with a bitchy female did they not have any in the serious crime directorate the card he had produced with the pompous title was on the table by the water harvey she had been married to him for long enough to read his moods was beaten and didnt contribute the detectives eyes had wandered from her thighs to her chest so she straightened her shoulders and pushed her hair off her face he hadnt taken off his jacket but she had seen that he wore visible when he raised a handkerchief to mop his forehead a shoulder holster with a weapon in it she knew about weapons if you go mrs gillot with your husband i can guarantee that protection will be in place from myself and two colleagues ill have uniformed firearms officers on site but only for today and only while youre packing essential items you will then drive to a hotel location agreed with us then my colleagues the uniforms and i will pull out after today you would receive expert advice on how to conduct your life and my daughter probably better if she takes a new identity and changes school i should emphasise that i havent examined this fully or referred it to senior colleagues you dont believe this is just a little blip by your husbands recollection a whole community has bought the contract i dont know how theyll pursue it the fatwa against salman rushdie was alive for a decade youre different but not wholly so what im saying is that we may intercept one killer but does the community have a production line i wouldnt assume that one success destabilises the scale of the threat she could put together the puzzle and see what had been the grit in the shoe of their relationship in the home counties with her baby and then her small daughter she had known other mothers and had been at the centre of the business operations here there was a fine house with a wonderful view and a life of unrelieved boredom she knew no one belonged to nothing had little to look forward to more and more of harveys work was done abroad and she had no role to play more and more of his deals were conducted without a paper trail or an electronic footprint and payments were made abroad routed to the caymans she hated the house the skyscape the seascape and the quiet she hated too the detective sergeant with the glock in his holster who had marched into her home and was steadily dismantling her life all right if she did it but not if a wellrehearsed stranger performed the rites her husband wasnt standing his corner its our lives you could say that mrs gillot and you wouldnt find people arguing with you she turned towards harvey you stupid bastard he was abject pathetic all that shit about trust and you screwed up on a deal i appreciate these are difficult issues but you have to come to a decision and we dont want to crowd you you should think of a shortterm response and take a longer view the detective had a soft voice which he would have learned on a course how to handle a hysterical woman who is being turfed out of her home the same course that bailiffs went on he moved back was off his chair and sidling towards his colleagues who had come into her garden she said bitterly to her husband spill what sort of place was it where you fucked up on trust it was one of those mornings that she had thankfully become unused to now about bloody time too penny laing faced a chance of progress she couldnt complain about the hotel a decent room and a halfdecent meal in a neardeserted dining room the night before with a halfbottle of local wine and there was no one in london to whom she had to make a phone call yes im missing you too yes im fine yes and did you find your supper in the fridge yes ill pay the council tax when i get back there had not been anyone to call late once the relationship with paul had petered out shed been in ireland and his ship had been on its way to the caribbean when theyd called it a day done it by text on their mobiles shed known it was on a downhill slope when shed gone with him to his parents for sunday lunch they hadnt grilled her for her life story which meant they didnt regard her as a potential daughterinlaw but as the present girlfriend before the ship sailed for a halfyears duty it had been good the best of her affairs but she wasnt going to pack in revenue and customs to be a naval wife and he wasnt going to jack in the royal navy to move into civilian life theyd exchanged postcards shed run through the files and not absorbed much had slept woken gazed out of a window and seen a swimmingpool a courtyard with tables and awnings a monument of white stone in the form of a cross and the wide river shed had breakfast had been given a foldover map of the town by reception and had set off from the hotel in search of not quite certain had had the sheet of contact names and addresses on the car seat beside her it had probably been a little joke cooked up by the first secretary and the spook at the embassy they had given her an address off a wide treelined main road and it was indeed the headquarters office of the security police her hmrc pass had been examined at the desk and she had sat on a hard chair for an hour then an english speaker had come with a disarming smile and said that any arrangement for a meeting would be coordinated through the embassy not on the doorstep but the police might be able to help she had found the police station on her hotel map had driven there and the man whose name she had been given was on holiday no one else on duty had more than a smattering of english but the hospital was identified on her map back across the town at the hospital she had discovered english speakers had been taken down into a basement area and shown a museum to an atrocity and had been given another name american or north european and another address had been scratched on her map a short distance from the hospital at a semidetached house she had met a man emaciated with a seriousness in his eyes that marked obsession and isolation he had been on his way out for the day heading for osijek and was already late but another cross was placed on the map at the far extremity of the page she sat on a bench in shade with a rectangular block of ebony stone in front of her it was twice her height a foot thick with a flying dove sculpted on it from where she was at that angle she could see through the stone and the blue skies were in the doves form a little away from it there was a square garden small clipped evergreens grew from a base of white stone chippings and on a slab beside them stood jars of red glass for candles with a cross no more than a metre high close to them the arms of the cross were covered with chains and strings of beads from which hung crucifixes and medals from the army football and basketball clubs there were identity cards too preserved in laminate pouches it was very quiet she had heard a buzzard cry as it circled above and the low pitch of a tractor that pulled a sprayer to her left she could see a knot of youngsters working with equipment inside corridors marked by white tape the lecturer at the school of slavonic and east european studies had told her about ovcara she knew that the wounded had been taken from the basement of the hospital where the museum was brought to this site and butchered when the bodies had been exhumed medical equipment was still attached to them the sun came up hard from the ground burning her it was one thing she reflected to be told about a place of mass murder in a london library another to be there the cross draped with the little mementoes scratched hardest at her the symbols of the living and the light flickered brightly on the beads and chains that wind and rain had polished she had been told that the man was in the field and would come when it was convenient to him first his shadow then his voice miss laing i hear you got the pusharound and ended up with danny steyn he pushed some more and you were sent to me she grimaced i seem to have bounced off a few walls im william anders danny called me about the village yes about the village she showed him her card you mentioned to danny a man called gillot i did its harvey gillot yes he had a lazy drawl conversational but compelling not to be ignored why did you i assume youre a criminal investigator mention that name to danny her majestys revenue and customs has an investigation division the alpha team of which im a member is tasked to look for the breaking of our countrys laws in the area of arms dealing a noble calling miss laing i dig up bodies those killed in acts of genocide ethnic cleansing and plain old murder and i hope that the fruits of my labours will end up in a court of law if the hague and the international criminal court or the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia hears evidence i have provided im well pleased most especially in africa i see the results of unfettered armstrafficking harvey gillot is an alphateam target she thought a slice of his confidence had seeped away his eyes had narrowed and the wide smile was falser we have intelligence also that a village near to the town has collectively taken out a contract on his life do you sobered reflective and a cigar case came out of the pocket do you now ive been sent here to try to find out what harvey gillot did that eighteen nineteen years later has caused a community to pay for a killer to assassinate him thats my brief is it a cigar was clamped in the teeth and a big lighter threw up a flame is it now do you have anything that takes me in the direction im looking at smoke from the cigar masked his face but penny thought she saw almost regret in the eyes he said nearly a whisper i believe im responsible responsible for what i believe im responsible for initiating that contract miss laing he thought a gleam had come into her face always did when an investigator reckoned a key had been handed over that opened a longlocked door she had a little notepad on her knee and a pencil stub the forensic scientist william anders a lion of his academic community on the californian coast a scourge of the perpetrators of crimes against humanity felt what his wife an academic in european renaissance art and back home with the kids would have called a frisson of guilt he asked how long she had time enough he spoke of a call of a journey to the edge of ploughed strip that had been declared clear of mines a couple of days previously and of an arm raised he said the arm was in the air like the one in the lake that was waiting for the great sword excalibur to be heaved in its direction he received as a reward for the image a wintry smile from miss penny laing he told her that four bodies had been excavated he explained that his examination of their pubic symphyses had identified approximate age and estimated height and told her why dental records for the male cadavers were unavailable he told her which one would have been the village schoolmaster then what mutilations they had suffered she murmured something about having been in the democratic republic of congo and seen combat aftermath its effect on civilians and he reckoned she would have been useless at digging on site squeamish and without the fibre it took should he have done it was it a crime was he not a professor of his discipline a world authority did he give a fast fuck or a slow one about the life and future times of harvey gillot he described a piece of paper he had retrieved from the older mans pocket he had regained his composure normally he would have flirted with a young woman teased her a little joked and smiled and maybe later he would have looked for a coy smile perhaps a drop of the eyes some fun didnt see it in penny laing he wondered if she was overwhelmed by the place a front line in history he didnt flirt with her he was graphic in picturing for her the level of decay but also related why the women wore no wedding rings or other jewellery im getting there miss laing theres nowhere else i have to be a guy from a village came to the hospital and i met him while i took a break out of the mortuary and had a smoke i was asked a simple question had anything of significance been found i gave a simple answer through danny who did the interpreting the piece of paper had the name of a hotel and its address somewhere on the croatian coast and the name of a man you know what that name is i gave it to the guy from the village should i have censored that information i dont like censors miss laing can you tell me the history of the village he threw down his cigar end and stamped on it he told her shed have to hang around because he had work to supervise he hadnt come halfway around the world to sit in the shade and talk he walked away she called after him i think youre right to take responsibility for the contract to kill harvey gillot she had a starting point and it was as if a weight had lifted off her when he had come back from the field and his students had trudged to their tents he had done sustained talking and a picture had been unveiled for her nineteen years later some buildings new and glossily painted others old and broken a repaired town and a damaged town should have been a picturepostcard place not one that tanks had rolled through when they had and when the fighter bombers had been overhead penny laing had been ten weeds grew in the walls of the buildings that had missed out on repair trees sprouted where there would have been tvs or easy chairs and charred beams were crazily collapsed she had been ten worrying about going to a new school after her next birthday and glorying in the puppy her parents had bought she had not known that shells and bombs had fallen on this town she wondered if her parents had and thought it none of their business there had seemed a stillness about the streets there was a degree of normality in the banks cafes bars a hospital with elderly patients outside the wards dragging on cigarettes young women with bulging bellies policemen in a patrol car men fishing by the bridge over the little river that joined the danube but abnormality too in the suppressed noise as if people went on tiptoe and the buildings that gaped open she thought shed had enough for one day and drove back to the hotel later she would walk then type up the notes of what she had learned interesting that chance had thrown her into the path of the man who might have condemned harvey gillot and didnt seem fazed by it penny laing wasnt big with words she was inadequate at describing places people who might have affected others working in kinshasa had been an experience but had not affected her this town might and outside vukovar there was a village and past the village a track that had led through fields of rotting corn were staying they had been together for an hour might have been more there had been blurted conversations and lingering silences harvey had paced on the patio and she had sat on her lounger sometimes reading the paper or working on her nails contributing the same lifeless monosyllabic sentences the final exchange him im fucked if im quitting to make it convenient for those bastards her sounds as if from what those bastards have to say that were fucked anyway him its my home and ill not be put out of it because the bloody police are cutting back on their bloody resources her its our home perhaps you hadnt noticed and im backing him if he comes to shoot straight he reckoned she must have read the paper twice some bits three times and that her nails were down to the quick then he had turned and waved them forward they had been in a small group lounged against a low wall that separated the principal garden where bloody nigel had the flowers that always seemed to need weeding from the dropthrough undergrowth to the ruined chapel and the graveyard they had finished drawing plans of the garden and had done the survey of the house they had been there the men half astride the wall the girl perched on it with the insolence that comes from waiting for a decision that was likely to be obvious to an imbecile say that again please mr gillot a bit hard of hearing are we mr roscoe wax in the ears i said harvey lifted his voice and barked were staying crisply are you happy with that decision mrs gillot harvey didnt know whether she would stand with or against him and sensed the detective expected her to break ranks she said drily if i were to leave my husband and my home detective sergeant it would be because ive decided to not you impassive right so be it there was a small sharp smile on harveys lips as if he had won something you mr roscoe dont approve of our decision youd have had us run bloody rats in the night to a safehouse i pay my taxes you could say mr roscoe that i pay your salary you could also say i doubt you will that the accumulation of taxes ive paid entitles me to a degree of support from the police i neither approve nor disapprove of your decision mr gillot ive explained the options and youve rejected advice given which is your right there are enough of us here to verify your statement that youre staying and that you understand you wont receive armed protection in the face of a threat to your life thats all pretty simple and well leave a pamphlet on security precautions in the hall for you to read through basic stuff harvey said i think you should know mr roscoe that in a lifetime of business ive accumulated influential customers the ministry of defence the secret intelligence service and a glint lightened the policemans eyes i wouldnt know about that sir but if youre confident of them whistling up a platoon of the parachute regiment and sending them down here i have friends pleased to hear it sir any time you need me just call good afternoon mrs gillot good afternoon sir friends and dont forget it no answer the group had already turned their backs on the patio and were on the driveway going to their car she had never been inside the halls where the fair was staged organised by defence systems and equipment international it was a closed demonised place for megs behan she was in the front row those who had penetrated the place in previous years by forging passes or conning a naive exhibitor into verifying an application were the elite on the barrier it had been an early start a little after seven thirty and she was almost alone another hour to go before the first of the exhibitors were pitching up it was now early afternoon and visitors were drifting away but she hadnt seen the bastard what had shocked her most was that two policemen one younger and one older than herself had offered her a sip from their plastic coffee cups and turned the cup round for hygiene one had called her sunshine and the other love those who had been inside top of the tree reported variously the big companies had major stands with videos blaring as they demonstrated their products champagne flowing the small firms were in the electronics world did the titanium plating for an attack aircrafts cockpit or the mounts for machineguns in the hatches of helicopters an american stand manager complained that his governments tighter fist meant mexican humantraffickers out of tijuana had better scanners than the us border guard a south african on a stand exhibiting anything from an armoured personnel carrier to a sniper rifle claimed that trade was flat but that the middle east was still holding up well a british officer in uniform was heard to say that equipment had become so sophisticated that it was easy to forget fighting was done by people and the simplest thing in infantry is man against man someone reported you dont see a mention anywhere of killing a mockedup frontier post is manned by peacekeeping troops the videos shout about fighting for peace one justification rejected out of hand by megs behan was that a hundred and fifty thousand jobs depended on the trade of murder she would have given a right arm maybe even a right boob to insinuate herself inside the death supermarket the bastard harvey gillot had not shown there had been good years when huge crowds had been penned back and police lines had bulged as they defended the entrance to the exhibition centre when arrests had conferred a badge of honour all gone then her ears would have been ringing with the abuse thrown at arriving guests potential buyers and the likes of harvey gillot and the police would have been doing gratuitous violence it was a mark of shame that the picket on the barrier was barely three deep and the placards were thin it certainly hurt that the police were so goddamn friendly she had indeed drunk their coffee one had nearly made a pass at her and had offered to open the barrier links so that she could get more easily to the dlr station if she was caught short a waste of time she had thrown no paint bombs had fired no ballbearings from a catapult hadnt even chucked a shoe there had been a few photographers an age earlier but theyd gone now and harvey gillot wasnt there so there was little point in vaulting the barrier and making an exhibition of herself if nobody had hung around to witness it she thought the policemen would have been embarrassed for her if theyd had to haul her off to a van for herself she felt almost ashamed a reedy voice used a bullhorn to her right and squealed insults at the distant building and the police were smiling she was ashamed because she felt the betrayal of all those kids alive and dead scarred and traumatised homeless and hungry who were the victims collateral was the vogue word of the arms trade their photographs were neatly catalogued in her filing cabinet she had to learn shock and awe she had a rucksack at her feet against the barrier and bent to pick it up then started the struggle to get her arms through the straps another policeman helped her he was smiling off home then your crowd have been damn good today anyway hope a few stay on this is double bubble a nice little earner it isnt like it used to be proper scrap then have a safe journey she headed off humiliated racking her mind for what might represent shock and awe and for something to lift her morale in a hide of camouflage netting on the edge of a covert of birches benjie arbuthnot let a shooting stick take his weight as he puffed a cigarillo beside him his grandson a week back from boardingschool aged fourteen and not yet in the fifth form smoked a cigarette provided for him and together they watched the field that had been harvested the day before the target would be pretty much everything that breathed kicked flew or moved in any way benjie had broken a twelvebore over and under from james purdey worth a fortune his retirement present from deirdre and the sprog was armed with a single barrel fourten of mongrel manufacture a mobile rang he swore had the shotgun under his arm so he used his free hand to tap his pockets and identify where the damn thing was he produced his phone realised it was silent and looked at his grandson the blush spread crimson the boy fumbled through his pockets and brought out his it glowed from under its protective case it was old almost a museum piece in the development of mobile phones all thumbs his grandson answered it yes a pause yes hes with me whos calling please thank you very much its harvey gillot he heard the young voice say that it was a man with the name of harvey gillot and then he heard the older familiar tone a vile oath and a cough it was good to have the number of a marginally senior officer in the secret intelligence service a hotel in kyrenia the north coast of cyprus bits and pieces going from armenia to the kurds in northern iraq in the saddam days long before the old boy had dropped through the trap benjie arbuthnot had taken a call on a phone in the hotel lobby and had given the caller his mobile number which had gone straight on to the skin of harveys hand then hed headed for the toilets written the number on his notepad and scrubbed his skin clean just a number that he might want one day yes benjie here gillot what the hell are you calling this number for i have a problem dont we all prostate inland revenue its almost a vintage phone and its been in a drawer for ten years i gave it to my grandson last week and now you call it wont ask where you snitched the number from but be assured the card and the number will be at the bottom of a dustbin within an hour so whats the problem rijeka the docks a shipment and breaking up harvey and youre leaving me far behind whats the problem make it snappy and its damn decent of me not to have stamped this thing to extinction harvey took a deep breath he was on the patio hadnt moved off it or eaten anything the container that carried the malyutka manpads had been shipped out of gdansk and the cargo in the container was on a manifest as agricultural equipment it was on the final approach to the harbour at rijeka customs were squared there was a lorry on the quayside and men up the line to take the stuff into the cornfields and up to a rendezvous in his room at the hotel there was a plastic bag of rubbish jewellery the deeds of homes that were getting the shit shelled out of them and wristwatches a street trader wouldnt take he had been able to see the ship in a close november fog coming near to the quay and the big man had drifted close and used his given name harvey gillot hadnt seen benjie arbuthnot for seven years hadnt set eyes on him since greens hotel in peshawar and the sending on of the blowpipes bloody useless things a murmur very soft for a big man in his ear about sanctions busting and a little lecture on the maximum and minimum sentences available to a criminalcourt judge when a punter was found guilty of ignoring the will of the united nations security council an aside barely audible indicated a good market a fatter fee if the container went on to aqaba and the start of a very healthy relationship with the jordanians a little smile on benjie arbuthnots face and a slap of encouragement on harveys back he had known by then that the jewellery and house deeds were valueless and the deal would cost him so he had stood the agent down paid off the lorry watched timber unloaded from the freighter then seen it sail he had dumped the bag in a wastebin behind the hotel kitchens then fled fast to the north and into slovenia had supposed it was an act of policy for her majestys government to see that the jordanian military had good equipment and russianmade stuff was always useful in the maze puzzle of the middle east the jordanians had paid well then and later it had been harveys first big deal since solly liebermans death and he had been at the age of twentyeight an international arms broker and had the protection of the intelligence community he exhaled and spat it out the deal you made me cancel in croatia at rijeka its come back at me and did you say made harvey i seem to recall offering advice its come back at me theres a contract out the people who were buying the gear have raised the money im walking dead and he had said on his patio ive accumulated influential customers i have friends christ now it had a hollow ring im out now just another whitehall warrior on a pension if i have anything sensible to say ill call you if not you wont hear from me oh and harvey always remember its swings and roundabouts a bit bleak today but you had some good times off my prompting a blame game and spouting about responsibility arent applicable take care and good luck the call was cut he counted to ten then dialled the number again it was unobtainable take care and good luck he sagged back into a chair it had been the whitepuff smudges on the slopes across the bay at lulworth that had kickstarted harvey gillots brain the firing grounds used by the army for training artillery gun crews and the tank people there was a good chance they were using the phosphorous shells he had supplied he did not supply the ammunition they were using in afghanistan but they needed cheap stuff for knocking holes out of the chalk hills leading to the cliffs at lulworth the ministry of course did not do deals with the new elite of bucharest sofia or bratislava or even moldova and the spivs in chi in u at that distance he couldnt hear the guns but the impact points were obvious the ministry bought from anybody who had stockpiles of the correct calibre and if artillery or armour officers bitched theyd be told it was what they had and where they were the good times were over it had been a useful contract for harvey gillot he had moped through what remained of the morning and into the afternoon two alternatives jostled for his attention quit and run or raise the drawbridge and make a fortress of his home but the firing had put a third dimension on the table go into denial it would never happen and get back to work he started by reactivating a deal that had seemed attractive last year then withered baghdad where else it had been a brilliant marketplace in the couple of years after the invasion then had dribbled fewer opportunities but had seemed last year to pick up the united states flag was being hauled down they were going the government the local people seemed to want equipping but not just from an american warehouse he had detail on the computer that he wouldnt have minded sharing with investigators from an alpha outfit at revenue and customs the stuff had been joshing around for more than a couple of years peoples republic of china small arms and ammunition and harvey gillot knew of three others who were deep into it the stuff had come out of storage depots in albania and hadnt been kept well it was good business to supply to baghdad officialdom tended to give it an automatic stamp and the bulk was signed off by officers and bureaucrats on the take in the green zone it would be a longdead trail by the time some poor bastard at a roadblock wearing a police uniform that didnt fit found out hed a jam in his ak or that the percussion cap wouldnt ignite nothing wrong with harvey gillot getting a bit of the deal upandrunning again the dog slept by his feet he was on the phone a friend reliable and trusted worked out of marbella he was a bit syrian a bit lebanese and a bit german and he was talking with him he wouldnt himself go to baghdad but the agent they all used whose brother was in the inner clique and whose sister had married into influence would travel if the price was right to nicosia for contracts and payment details the albanians still had plenty more than the bulgarians but albanian stuff wouldnt be good enough for a customer such as the tbilisi government he had thought talking and punching keys on his calculator that denial worked well a bloody door slammed the main bedrooms the dog stirred then slumped again he held his hand loosely over the receiver and shouted you dont have to slam doors his friend in faraway marbella asked what the hell had happened and was he all right he said he was fine never better but the energy was draining out of him then the front door slammed this time he didnt cover the receiver see if i bloody care harvey gillot yelled i dont give a in his ear you sure youre all right harvey im sure maybe another time is better harvey you stay well thanks harvey i dont pry into peoples lives we go back a long way anything i should know well since you come to mention it maybe there is something i can share with you im on a death list the past came tripping up on me i wasnt looking and hadnt filled any sandbags too busy selling every other tosser a crate of kalashnikovs to look over my shoulder according to the spooks a shitefaced bastard has agreed what im worth he may be waiting for it to have cleared into his account or its already through and hes hunting or sniffing christ i dont fucking know are you speaking harvey im getting something is it disturbance on the line is there something friend to friend you should be telling me not a bed of roses but nothing i cant handle i watched for you harvey when solly went i wouldnt want to think that youre not telling me what i im fine friend but ill call you back give me some time he put the phone down on a friend and went to the window he could see on to the drive where she was scraping gull mess off the windscreen they hadnt spoken a word since the detective had left when he had gone into the kitchen she had come out and when he had left the kitchen after a sandwich she had gone back in he realised that getting up to go to the window he had kicked the dogs water bowl and a damp stain had spread on the carpet you dont have to slam doors he shouted through the glass you can behave like a fucking adult his wife his josie looked at him contempt rippled at her mouth one of those choice moments he thought when she was not going to dignify his insult with a response she was in the car had gunned the engine and activated the gates he wondered where she was going and whether the gardener figured in her plan she drove through the gates which closed behind her he sat at his desk again the dogs head on his lap and went back to the costs of small arms ammunition and rpg rounds the columns seemed to bounce on the page meaningless a sort of fear new experience clung to him then he shook his head violently slapped his hands on his desk hard enough to hurt and went back to denial couldnt happen wouldnt now sitting up intent robbie watched from the back window and saw the landscape of the isle of portland for the second time they did the circuit in reverse vern drove steadily and allowed other traffic a few holidaymakers and an occasional delivery van to pass them he stayed silent as robbie did and leanne told them the names of the villages down wide street on to weston road and through the housing estate robbie reckoned the place a dead dump then into southwell leaving the turnoff to the big hotel they veered towards the bill he said they could stop neither his elder brother nor his sister would have demanded tea from the cafe or a visit to the toilets they parked he didnt want tea or a toilet and he stayed by the car leaning against the bodywork his elbows on the roof and opened the envelope it wasnt strange for him to see leanne emerge from the toilet at the side of the cafe with the wig in place and shed slipped off the yellow cotton cardigan she always did that vern stirred his tea with a plastic stick but didnt acknowledge her nor she him and they were strangers he lost sight of her there was wind on his face and it snatched at the aerial photographs of the house a big ship loitered past far out to sea hardly seeming to move but was soon lost in a deepening heat haze he memorised the photographs then slipped them back into the envelope gulls shrieked above him it wasnt said couldnt be admitted but robbie cairns depended on the skills of his elder brother and his sister he needed his brother for the driving fast sure and accidentproof and leanne for the closeup reconnaissance of a target location it was warm and the sun came through thickening cloud burned on the roof but there was an involuntary shiver in robbie cairnss body no concrete under his feet no dense brickwork in his eyeline just an open sky above him without chimneys and tv aerials the shiver was not from the wind blowing against him but his uncertainty at being away from the familiar had he known where he was going and what would be the ground might he have turned down the work he coughed and spat wouldnt have he tossed the envelope on to the front passenger seat leannes he could see beyond the car park that a hawk had perched on a fence post robbie cairns knew nothing about birds but that one interested him because it had a wickedly sharp curved beak and he rated it as a killer it was a finelooking bird with intricate markings on its chest he would remember it didnt know what it was called and describe it to barbie when he was back in london he hadnt told her hed be away hadnt volunteered information about schedules and movements hed just slipped away from the flat hed tell her about the bird then it flew great fantastic the bird hovered dived disappeared then rose and he could see the wriggle of the creature it held it was back to the fence post the beak hacking at what it had caught leanne was going back to the toilets he didnt like the wind on his face or the sun on his cheeks most of all he didnt like the emptiness of the place the size of the fields and the open road in his trade the work he did was always at close quarters he had never heard of a marksmans weapon being used a snipers might be fine for the military but not for robbie always wanted to be near almost standing on the targets toes and sure of a head shot with a handgun in his trade there was no call for what the army in afghanistan called improvised explosive devices which the irish had used and the iraqis robbie knew nobody who had the skills to build a bomb that would go into a culvert or be locked by a magnet to a cars chassis on the london streets he could materialise out of a car parked at a kerb or from among pedestrians on a pavement or dancers in a club or from an alleyways shadows it was big money not to be refused leanne was out of the toilets wig off yellow top on and walked with vern towards him she said there are huts up here some are being used today but most arent a guy was telling me they cost up to twentyfive grand theyre just like a garden shed and youre not allowed to sleep in them a chatty guy told me which ones were still locked up and wouldnt be used till the kids come off school which is still a week away as good as anywhere i reckon they left the car park and went back down the road away from the lighthouse and towards the targets home she came back parked the car closed the gates and let herself in he was in his office she could hear the clatter of the keyboard in the bedroom she changed from slacks and a blouse into a haltertop and shorts took a book and went to a chair on the covered walkway outside the picture windows that overlooked the patio later when it was cooler and the sun was further round she would move to the lounger she didnt tell him she was back ask if there had been calls whether he needed feeding or a drink or if a gunman had tried to take his life josie gillot didnt care much whether there had been any calls or whether he wanted something to eat or whether it wouldnt be a detective one who had made a pissawful job of disguising his dislike of her husband and his trade who told her when to leave her home it was towards late afternoon that mark roscoe hit the button and despatched the beast he eased himself out of his chair and suzie pushed the wheels of hers back towards her own workspace bill was already out on the fire escape and would be lighting up suzie had typed and roscoe had dictated then he had taken over the keys and done a polish it had his name under it and he signed it off the small matter of the paper trail and the responsibilities that lay with it itched inside him he wasnt used to having his professional advice chucked back in his face he hadnt reported that the potential target their tango was abusive foulmouthed sneering or the boast of connections with defence and intelligence to have slagged off gillot would have laid roscoe open to charges of insensitivity and possible bullying and if the paper trail was followed at a later stage after gillot was dead in a gutter with a mm bullet lodged in his brain and scapegoats were looked for he wouldnt be holding up his hands when suzie had moved aside and he had tidied up it was a brief document spare of colour emotion and detail it said little more than that the offer of advice had been made that a temporary safehouse would have been available and the tango had declined the suggestions put to him the report would go to the gold commander covert surveillance intelligence and firearms and would have reached the alpha crowd also on the list was the big man with the smart epaulettes at the weymouth police station he stood stretched and didnt know what else he could have done they had been the three of them pretty subdued when theyd driven away from gillots house what else he couldnt have said in contradiction of all orders and laiddown procedures that he would put up a tent by the front gate and sleep there with his glock in his hand or make a bivouac under the kitchen table neither could he suggest that bill and suzie join him to sleep rough in the car at the end of the lane and beside the museum front door he couldnt have put gillot in handcuffs and his wife in a headlock then shoved them into the boot and driven them to a hotel at the back end of nowhere like the shetlands or the orkneys the itch coming on worse and needing a scratch was from feeling he had failed in a basic task the job had been to get the tango out of the line of fire he hadnt succeeded there was a good old story hoary and therefore worth remembering of a protection officer who had done time with the viceroy mountbatten in the end days of the indian raj the greys and wrinklies who had done secretaryofstate security details in belfast during the choice days liked to tell it mountbatten it was said had announced one morning that he wanted first thing after breakfast to visit the bazaar and go walkabout his man had refused to consider it the viceroy god almighty on earth said he was going no argument and was again turned down flat miffed mountbatten had pulled his immense rank and insisted no the officer was adamant he was quizzed and had answered sir im not overly concerned about your safety but am most concerned with the preservation of my professional reputation mountbatten had not visited the bazaar to show the flag it was the area in which mark roscoe felt uneasy they had left a sullen household might have left two people who were scared shitless when they were going the dog had woken in the kitchen and whined probably wanted its food his boss had wandered close you look mark as if youre carrying the cares of the world he didnt answer just handed over a printout of the report roscoe couldnt have said that he had acquired any degree of affection for gillot he didnt admire or sympathise with his wife he had found both of them unattractive to deal with but it had gone beyond neutrality he disliked harvey and josie gillot because both in equal amounts threatened him inquiries would be convened inquests would be launched and the teams of hindsight merchants would be crawling over him if doubletap time came and gillot was down bleeding like a stuck pig but his boss slipped an arm round his shoulders be it on his own head i dont see what alternatives were open to you roscoe didnt believe a word of the saccharine stuff but was marginally grateful his boss said were needing to be mobhanded in wandsworth are you sitting on your hands or are you coming he said hed come with suzie and bill and was thankful for a distraction a jewellery shop in armoury way that a chis had said was a target might just save him scratching the itch till it bled they each had their role vern would now be looking for the lieup where he could stay unobserved with the car leanne would have the wig on again the pullover off and would be holding the folder that contained the brochures on doubleglazing and plastic windowframe opportunities she was good at chatting on doorsteps vern would not be noticed but leanne would be remembered as the pretty girl with the dark hair the glasses and a blouse robbie had come down the track that led from the tarmacsurfaced lane and was beside a high wall the boundary of the targets property that ran on to block off the location of the ruined castle an english heritage site there was a gate off the lane the name beside it was lulworth view and next to the sign was a speech grille he couldnt see over the wall into the garden or the shape of the house he knew the size of the garden from the aerial pictures but that was different from spying out the ground for himself second best or third he went on down the lane leaving gillots home behind and above him there was the shell of an old church and graves and further down the sea and a stony beach a couple watched him now from the shore and kids threw stones into the water he tracked along the sand following a worn path and by now they would have lost sight of him behind their windbreak another woman watched him wearing a wellfilled swimsuit he had no towel no camera no child in tow what was his business he realised he had no reason to be on the beach and didnt fit any pattern no streets no pavements no alleys no shadows he quickened his step and then was gone among fallen gravestones and had started to climb again from the far end of the beach he hadnt yet seen the house but he had shown himself enough stories of the old days tripped off granddad cairnss tongue never any point in telling his grandfather that he had heard them before a favourite was about leatherslade farm near to aylesbury out in deep countryside granddad cairns had been twentytwo when the gang had hit the bigtime and robbed the royal mail train coming south overnight from scotland hed been on remand on a conspiracytoburgle charge and could remember the draught of excitement when news of a twoandthreequartermillionpound heist had spread along the corridors of hmp brixton remand and also the bit he enjoyed most the ridicule at the gangs cockup should have gone straight back to london to their roots and homes and stashed the cash in a warehouse or lockup garage instead theyd holed up at leatherslade farm in a remote corner of the countryside reckoning that they wouldnt be seen among all the quiet fields and hedgerows their presence not noted wrong they were down a long lane that wasnt made up and theyd thought no one in the whole wide world would dream anyone was there wrong enough to get thirty years each it would have been the rope if the driver had pegged a few weeks earlier from the head injuries theyd done him a man was supposed to come along afterwards and fire the place but he hadnt and the fingerprints were over everything and convicted them that man was thought to be holding up a flyover pillar on the motorway at chiswick but truth was locals were queuing up to tell the police of goingson at leatherslade farm granddad cairns used to say finishing up i hate the countryside had my way id cement everywhere thats green go and look over a town house before doing some business there and no one sees anything go and look at a country house and half a village has seen you cements whats needed robbie came up a trodden track and now he could look across the gully that ran down to the ruins the graveyard and the beach through the trees he could make out most of the house and the patio but none of it clearly because of the branches couldnt see whether there were cameras or an alarm system there was a woman on a lounger at the edge of the patio he hadnt seen her before and then a dog bounded close to her he had seen what he needed to a dog by the time he reached the lane again having cut through a caravan park he had established that the house didnt have a back exit on to the path below at the top of the lane opposite the museum there was a bench and leanne was sitting on it she had the wig on the cardigan off and the brochures under her arm she asked him as they strolled up the hill how it had gone he said it had gone all right she said shed done the rounds and gossiped while two couples had looked at her doubleglazing and the plastics the people in lulworth view she was told werent worth a call because they keep to themselves and theyve hardly a word for anyone but she tried the speech grille on the gate and a man had answered shed explained and hed said she could shove he hadnt finished robbie cairns said quietly doesnt matter what matters is that he has a dog how did it go she peeled off her rucksack and dropped it it was pitiful megs behan said surprise how come its like we were part of the scenery like wed be missed if we werent there another year and the policell be giving us biscuits and dsei will be sending out a trolley with coffee tea or hot chocolate we dont even embarrass them let alone get up their noses puzzlement at a sort of heresy not joining the doubters are you megs she gazed at her project manager she saw his concern others in the openplan area at planet protection had their eyes fastened on their screens but would have been wondering whether sunstroke or her period had caused such a dramatic loss of faith she was megs behan and her commitment was legendary others had left to have babies or get work that paid better and some had gone because their lives had moved on and the dedication had frayed not megs behan it was a complete waste of time being there his resolve stiffened perhaps you arent yourself megs we have to be seen there we have to but were not seen thats the problem no photographers the bloody downturn and who cares what british factories manufacture as long as the moneys coming in weapons of war are fine as long as the cheques dont bounce ive focused on harvey gillot he didnt turn up but as regards the fair our response is predictable and therefore goes unreported perhaps youve been stretching yourself a bit far he turned away she swigged water from the dispenser what we need is some shock and plenty of awe and we need to beard those people where it hurts them so ill be wanting a bit from petty cash im going to gillots home ill he spun back nothing illegal megs outside his door in his face where his family and neighbours see me but with dignity ill humiliate him everyone near to where he lives will know what his trade is dealing in death brokering what kills children trafficking in the apparatus of genocide she had no idea what his home was like where the main gate was how close other properties were i want to make him squirm press releases and standing docile behind a barrier dont work any more so please a float from the petty cash there was then an extraordinary moment in the openplan office applause rang out and cheers she stood taller the project manager said i like what i hear megs and as usual youre innovative but dont hazard the good name of this organisation its not to be brought into disrepute we need funds and funds arent attracted by stunts were dependent on areas of government however much we dislike it to help us pay our way and we have beneficiaries who wont tolerate association with anything vulgar wouldnt dream of it she was grinning a cat with cream on its whiskers ill flush him out tomorrow and make his life hell looking up from a wad of receipts he was checking against a column of figures expenditure and inflow lenny grewcock pondered for a moment his hands came together in front of his mouth and nose but it was contemplation not prayer he knew the name of the target but not why a community had condemned him he thought of the young guy robbie cairns son of jerry and grandson of the old blagger how good was robbie cairns as good as his reputation in it for lenny grewcock not the money chickenshit he was taking from the deal was the chance of a link to people in hamburg who had access to deals across europe it was important that he was seen as an efficient reliable friend he wondered whether he would hear of the successful result from a phone call and a coded message from the evening paper or the tv already while he checked the accounts of a club in a side alley off jermyn street in the west end his mind had been ticking over advantages and opportunities that would come his way when the hamburg end kicked in in a workshop at a lathe that shaped chair legs jerry cairnss mind was only barely on the work he knew the name passed to him on a wisp of cigarette paper of the target and reckoned that by now his robbie would be tracking the man tailing him and lining him up he would learn of the hit from the television in his cell he supposed as he worked the lathe that to have a son like robbie a celebrity at what he did was the same as having a darts prodigy or a successful tv actor for a kid a little of the glory spattered on to the father as the money did if the boy had done well and to be under the protection of lenny grewcock was a matter of no little consequence jerry cairns had no fondness for his younger son didnt tell anyone never had not even the boys mother his wife that he couldnt abide the boy his cold eyes but when he came out of gaol hed need a cut of the money his son brought in he worked on his quota of chair legs and waited to be escorted back to his cell where he could switch on his television and watch news bulletins he didnt do it often but granddad cairns savoured sitting at a corner table in the oldworld pub by the plaque that said the pilgrim fathers had boarded the mayflower there his second pint was in front of him about his limit his bladder couldnt take any more he lived off the money that was slipped him by robbie couldnt have managed without the help he had from the boy because his life had involved too much gaol time and thieving wasnt pensionable he liked this pub could drop in for an afternoon and be accepted because the lunch trade was gone and the evening trade hadnt started up he would hear of robbies hit from leanne a fine girl and she had time for him shed call by as soon as they came back from the coast to let him know if it wasnt leanne it would be vern he would stand in the doorway take his grandfathers shoulders in his hands incline his head down and whisper then give him a bit of a squeeze robbie wouldnt come wouldnt tell him granddad cairns knew of nobody who liked his younger grandson knew plenty who were petrified of the little sod and some whod cross the road rather than have to walk past him there was a poster up outside the rotherhithe police station that showed the closed doors of the refrigerated bays of a mortuary one was open with the feet of a body sticking up from a shroud and the caption was carrying a gun can lead you into the coolest places if his grandson was there he knew of nobody whod shed a tear but he liked the money needed it at home he would sit in his chair and wait for leanne or vern to come by each time the money was better the hut was in shadow there was no movement in those at either side of it and the grass in front of the line was not worn down all were well shuttered some had padlocks on the doors and they backed on to a field maybe the one where he had seen the hawk fly and kill while robbie stood back vern used a short crowbar to prise open a window then they lifted leanne and eased her through she was passed the tool and less than a minute later after a squeal of tearing wood the main door sagged open using the crowbar inside minimised the visible damage now they went through a fast routine two pairs of plastic gloves each a shower cap and the days third check that the mobiles were off robbie dumped on the floor the binliner that held the clothing and the sack with the hardware then slumped on to a bench at the back what to do nothing they had closed the window shutters and the door and there was no light inside robbie had the bench vern stretched out on the floor where a rug covered the linoleum and leanne had a chair she asked robbie again if there was anything more he needed to see and he said again that he had seen what he needed to see puzzled did he mean the dog certain because he had seen the dog as if it was his little joke and theyd be told when he was good and ready not before obvious to robbie cairns that the dog was the provider of opportunity but he didnt say how why he did say that when it was dark he would go out with vern for fish and chips then he dozed they waited it was the first time that any of them gathered around the tables outside the cafe could remember that they had not talked of an episode in the defence of the village and its betrayal not even mladen had offered his description of a moment when the line had wavered and he had stabilised it the one with the keenest memory was tomislav but his head was bent low and he offered nothing andrija had the same coffee in front of him as he had had an hour before he had not a drunk a quarter of it petar chainsmoked and did not contribute simun was sitting away from them he was permitted to be close but had no part in the stories of war they waited to be told josip had been there and was now gone the original chain of contact he had told them was now shortened from london word of the hit and the death would be sent to hamburg and from there it would go to an apartment in zagreb to a man of power and influence against whom no charges had been laid in spite of the recent assassination of a prosecutor who had investigated him known in the capital city as the falcon he would call josip and give a codeword to mark the completion of retribution it was agreed that then word received the village would come together at the church would walk in column to the cemetery and flowers would be laid on the graves the principals would go then to mladens house the reward for the outlay of twenty thousand euros would be found in a halfdozen bottles of sparkling wine double gold from ilok none around the tables had thanked josip for what he had organised and probably they would not when he brought the news for which they waited a car came by and slowed as it approached the cafe it was driven by a girl with blonde hair her complexion had been ruddied by the sun it braked it had been a change of mind offthecuff which was unusual for penny laing the light had dropped the countryside had lost lustre and pastel shadows had overwhelmed what had been vivid she had left vukovar behind and taken a side road between strip fields of ripened corn she had gone through bogdanovci seen signs ahead for marinci but had gone to the right and been guided in the failing light by a church tower she had come to the village she could not have said to what purpose it was too late to see anything or to wander and soak up atmosphere or to find someone who would devote an evening to her gratification the pull of the place had broken though common sense she should have taken an early night in her room there was a crossroads where she stopped to left right and ahead the roads were empty the church she could see was incomplete and the walls were of concrete blocks that had not yet been rendered some homes had lights on behind thin curtaining she was about to turn and go back to the vukovar hotel when she saw a cluster of brighter light in front she drove towards it at the edge of the village she saw a group of men sitting on a concrete veranda and braked she was trained to wade into conversations of substance with strangers her job did not permit shyness and a big question needed answering she was watched by old eyes she sensed indifference rather than hostility but no trace of welcome she thought she interrupted she asked the first question that had to be answered please did anyone here speak english she was stared at it was a distant dark corner of europe and there was little reason why any of these older men should have learned her language always a disaster to work through interpreters investigators loathed working through the uninvolved third party she smiled with what warmth she could muster and thought she had blundered she should extricate herself her first contact screwed for a moment she regretted that asif with the pregnant wife was not taking part of the load the voice was clear young and came from the shadows tall wellbuilt with a mop of uncombed hair he emerged to answer her question he said his name was simun that he had learned some english at senior school his smile was friendly she said what she wanted didnt mention harvey gillot the story of the siege of the village it was agreed when she drove away it was not the boy simun she remembered with greatest clarity but the older men careworn with dulled eyes as if experience had dealt harshly with them harvey reached for the phone he had glanced at his watch and done the equation what time it was in marbella didnt think theyd be eating yet the man there had been the first he had turned to after the death of solly lieberman harvey gillot didnt know whether his own father and mother were physically well and his ignorance didnt bother him but when hed heard that solly lieberman boss mentor and father figure had died he had gone down in a crumpled mess and wept could remember each moment of it hed been at his apartment off the marylebone road fancy smart minimalist and affordable because he earned good money from the patronage of solly lieberman he was going out had a date half through the door and a telephone was ringing in the trade nobody answered a phone everybody tasted a call through an answerphone the woman who did reception at the office was calling from her home and pretty damn composed harvey my dear so sorry to call you with this its about mr lieberman very bad news about him from russia the embassy have come through to me i think hed listed me as nextofkin an accident a fatal accident im sure hell be in your prayers harvey as he is in mine could you be in the office tomorrow thank you solly lieberman had boarded the plane in sofia and flown east then he had travelled helicopter and fourwheel drive into the permafrosted russian tundra with a guide and a hunter his host was the designer of the new generation of mm howitzers they had been on the search for a brown bear a male that had terrorised an exploration team of geologists prospecting for a possible platinum mine they had been camping in bollocksfreezing cold and on the fourth day they hadnt found the bear but it had found solly lieberman he had been swathed in clothing on his way to a call of nature the bear had been shot but not until it had got tooth and claw into frail old solly lieberman it had been ten feet high weighed nearby threequarters of a ton and had made a bad mess of the sixtyeightyearold arms broker harvey had helped carry the coffin he didnt reckon much of solly lieberman filled it now was his moment but hed doubted he could tread in the americans footprints he had been told youre privileged to be offered that chance you owe it to solly lieberman a great man and a great ally to take in two hands what he offers you go for it as our friend did when he was little more than a kid he had driven the man from london to heathrow and seen him on to a flight to malaga fifty kilometres from marbella he had paid as the testament stipulated a token sum for the business and known that the money went to a jewish charity for the education of the sons of rabbis then he had sat in the old mans chair and had started to follow the footprints ten months later a phone call from overseas a familiar accented voice a remark about the autumn sunshine in marbella in contrast to the fogs and mists of london and an introduction i dont want it harvey i want nothing to do with the balkans what you should do if you want it is to telephone this man in the defence ministry in he had been given a number had called it and a week later had been on a flight to zagreb now he lifted the receiver checked the number in his book and dialled it was answered its harvey good to speak you are fine now everything is good sorry about earlier now we were talking in terms of had been talking earlier in terms of assault rifles and the ammunition to go with them bulk numbers of rpg grenades with highexplosive or fragmentation warheads he thought it best to be in total denial more comforting robbie watched he had the car door open and through the shops window he saw the woman pour vinegar scatter salt and wrap then vern was reaching into his hip pocket for his wallet he was aware always had been he could see vern with the three portions of fish and chips almost ready and could see too the three kids in the mirror coming near to the car he turned away from his brother who was waiting now for change kids like the ones on the albion estate and the osprey estate the likes of himself his sister and elder brother had not been ever a part of the gangs didnt need to be vern leanne and robbie had been born with authority and had the respect accorded to their name their father and grandfather had drilled it into them that authority and respect were not to be abused that once lost they were hard to reel back he was in the front passenger seat his feet were on the pavement and the door was wide open one of the kids veered off and went round the front of the car hesitated pushed up past the front wheel and extended his foot for a second or so he was balanced on one leg the kid said youre blocking us close the fuckin door the other two laughed the raised foot rested against the open door didnt you hear me close the fuckin door what robbie cairns had been thinking while he watched vern collect the fish and chips hadnt been important he was now feeling the pressure of the door against his shin and spotted a knife kids who thought they ran a street corner not rotherhithe but a corner of what leanne had said was called weston on the isle of portland a man came down the road older than robbies father and younger than his grandfather he had a stout stick in his hand and the streetlamp caught him he would have seen the kids he crossed over to the other pavement as the pressure grew on robbies shin the knife blade was against the wing of the car and started to gouge throaty laughter and robbie saw the line in the paintwork that the blade scratched you going to fuckin move wanker or do i kick the fuckin door shut come on shift the blade came close he saw vern pocket the change and turn for the shop door he had a plastic bag with their food in it he was robbie cairns one of a dynasty the face was above him grinning manically and the light caught the blade kids in rotherhithe carried knives scraped the paintwork on cars had fun and had the wit to recognise a member of the cairns family no one would have kicked the door and scraped the car of a cairns he pushed himself up had to wrench the door away to extricate his leg he reckoned that the skin on his shin was broken and perhaps there was a blood smear inside his jeans he was five feet eight or nine hadnt been measured since he was in feltham young offenders not more than twelve stone or hadnt been then no spare flesh on him the kid had a knife and a stocky build he hadnt looked into robbies eyes the knee came into the kids groin as he jackknifed and subsided a trainer toe followed where the knee had been and he gasped the knife flew lodged in the grass of the verge more kicks went in none to the face the hands that tried to cover and protect the kid were battered aside done fast and clean there was the receding clatter of the other two kids as they ran he had stopped before vern reached him didnt need vern to tell him he was an idiot to fight in the street draw attention get noticed not that vern would have criticised him to his face his right hand slipped up and the forefinger rested on the left side of his chin against his lower jaw the tip could be inserted just into a tiny indentation that most would not have noticed and had healed well a big kid pervert had gone after him in the showers at feltham when told to leave off he had struck out and his ring had cut robbies face it was said in the block that night and hed heard it was said in the prison officers mess that it was doubtful the big kid would ever make babies but his face was unmarked he looked down at a local wannabe hero and heard him choke vomit and whimper with pain he took the bag with the fish and chips and laid it on his knees as vern pulled away from the kerb what would the kid do nothing what had he to show for it not a mark on his face or his upper body and he was hardly going to go down to accident and emergency peel down his boxers and show a nurse that his balls were black and blue should have let the car get a scratch from a blade down the side should have stepped back shouldnt have come to the country and the big open spaces robbie didnt feel good but he said nothing gave vern no explanation his foot hurt theyd go for it tomorrow in the morning because he had seen the dog his supper had been put on the diningroom table the television played loud in the snug he had eaten his supper something from the freezer and the microwave had loaded the plate into the dishwasher and gone back to his office when the television had been switched off the doors had opened and closed and a light had shone under the main bedroom door wherever he went in the house every room he was followed by the dog which stayed close when he was ready to put the animal out harvey switched off the lights in the living room and eased the patio doors open making certain he was not silhouetted against anything bright the silence beat around the walls no voices no clatter of a weapon being armed he heard the sea and thought it restless almost unforgiving when the dog came in he closed the outer doors locked them and drew the curtains then went methodically around the house checking each door and window except those leading out from the main bedroom should he have gone into that room knelt beside the bed taken josies head in his arms and he didnt he kicked off his shoes and dropped on to the settee in the living room best to be in denial the dog had settled on the rug near him harvey gillot didnt know who samuel johnson was but he did knew what he had said nothing concentrates ones mind so much as the realisation that one is going to be hanged in the morning he lay on his back on the cushions and the dog snored the wind from the south and west beat at the roof he thought the waves were fiercer against the rocks at either end of the cove and there were all those gravestones down there broken and toppled they lay beside the ruins of the church and the ruins of rufus castle were close by bloody ruins he reckoned his mind was concentrated and not even denial could block out his anxiety about the morning he didnt know if he would sleep harvey woke there was no rope round his neck but he massaged the skin of his throat as he blinked and tried to get clarity she stood in the door had a silky gown round her held loosely at the waist he thought a bad moment that she had pierrepoints posture a couple of years back hed seen a biopic about the executioner but when she saw he had woken she turned away and was gone he hadnt focused quickly enough to read her face the door closed wasnt slammed it might have been another moment if hed been faster off his backside and crabbed quickly across the room for him to take her in his arms and hold her close he had not the door was shut in his face he didnt follow her he went to the second bathroom and involuntarily touched the robe hanging from the door it was of course dry he considered then what made for a worse cocktail of poison a contract on his life or the gardener shagging his wife he ran the shower letting it warm then stepped under the spray he wondered how his body stood up in comparison to nigels he wetshaved with a plastic razor there for a visitor who had stayed overnight without kit but no one stayed over they lived in isolation he dried hard didnt use the robe as if it was the personal property of another ignoring the principal bedroom where there was a walkin wardrobe that contained his best suits good casuals and shirts he dressed in yesterdays clothes but for the socks he put on flipflops he wouldnt go back into the bedroom to rifle in the wardrobe before hell froze over he looked out of the window the sun was still low peeping over the hills behind the lulworth cliffs and throwing long ribbons of gold on to the water the wind had died and the ferry chugged across his view while a handful of yachts and launches hugged the inshore waters and went to sea it was pretty damn normal he stretched and coughed then searched the trees behind the walls the castles keep to the left and the rock promontories bordering the cove for sign of the threat he saw nothing like a child chastened he bent over the settee and straightened the cushions smoothed them he looked for a friend the dog still followed him as it had the previous day when it had wolfed its food he picked up the bowl to wash it and found in the sink her mug with the dregs of tea she had made some and not brought him any it seemed important he was reeling at the toxic nature of the dislike distrust he realised it would destroy him more selfindulgence and selfpity he wouldnt lie in a ditch and cower he padded back to his office and murmured to the dog that he needed a few minutes tried to explain it was only a quick call that had to be made asked for understanding and found the dog reasonable he flicked through his address book and dialled monty it was harvey here yes harvey gillot you good yes monty was good but monty was half in and half out of the shower and did harvey know what time it was and how uncivilised a call was at a couple of things i need what did he need can you get your hands quick on a bpv supplier yes monty had a stock of bulletproof vests in his own warehouse but were they talking of the ones proof against gunfire or merely knives bulletproof not a problem and what quantity a hundred two hundred three and what delivery date bulletproof quantity of one only only one delivery tomorrow he had the address obviously a discount for bulk orders was harvey aware of the price for a single item it would be six hundred sterling but for a longstanding friend it could be five hundred it would be handgunproof but not obviously high velocity where was he going kandahar bogota gaza he said grimly its for going out here the isle of bloody portland dorset and walking the dog on the coastal path but that is not please for shouting off the rooftops what about sprays there was usmade mace bear pepper spray recommended for campers upcountry in montana or oregon and frowned on in the uk about twentyfive sterling a canister what was legal throughout the uk was a spray that let off a vile stench and marked clothes beyond the capability of household washingmachines at about thirteen pounds whatever you have delivery tomorrow im grateful monty he rang off and told the dog that give or take five minutes they would go for a walk he was alone now robbie thought this time minutes but could be hours was the hardest he waited and watched the gates he had told them back at the hut at first light that he wouldnt attempt to scale the walls because there was too much ground that was dead to him unseen and he didnt know what the alarm system was or where the cameras and beams were he had said he would be close to the gates and would wait for the target to come out vern had queried him he didnt often the gates are electronic and hell come out in his car where are you and what do you do he wont hell be walking leanne had challenged him how can you say robbie that hell walk out of the gates because of the dog both had looked at him confused because of the dog you sure of that robbie he has a nice garden very pretty he spends time and money on it he doesnt want dog shit all over it hell take the dog out and walk to where the dog can shit and he doesnt have to clear it up it had satisfied them the decision he had made was that the target would come out of the gates swing to his right go past the castle wall and the main building then keep going that way till he had dropped down to the graveyard and where the church had been from there he might go right or left but the coastal path was closed in with rough brambles and gorse enough for robbie to get close to him he had worked it through always did he wore overalls had the balaclava in his left pocket and was squatted in a gap in the scrub where the people from a house between the lane and the gates dumped their grass cuttings and garden rubbish it was a useful place but for all of its good points there was the bad one he was hanging around would stand out and no other way he stayed stock still when two men came past him on the path they didnt see him but one of their dogs yapped at him the baikal pistol was in the right side pocket of the overalls it was loaded normally he slept well in the house in clack street he shared with vern and leanne and in the apartment where he kept barbie he had slept all right when he was with his grandparents on the first floor of the block on the albion estate and when he was in feltham he didnt lose sleep on the night before a hit hed tossed all night in the hut nothing to do with the floor or the cushions hed taken off the bench where leanne was and nothing to do with vern in the easy chair feet on the table he hadnt slept because his foot hurt the pain was a reminder that he had reacted to a yobkid had allowed himself to be riled he didnt feel right they hadnt argued with him never did they accepted that the man the target would come out of the gates and would be walking his dog they had to accept it because that was what robbie had said would happen he was hot in the overalls and his hands were tacky inside the lightweight rubber gloves he couldnt speak to vern or leanne their mobiles had been switched off since theyd been on the ringroad motorway south of london before they had headed to the coast idiots left their mobiles switched on when they went to work a phone could be tracked as sure as a bug under the car his father jerry might have left his mobile switched on he was in hmp wandsworth because he was an idiot vern would have the car parked up the street from the museum and the pub and would be sitting somewhere killing time waiting leanne would be on the bench on the open ground grassed on the far side of the street to the museum and the entrance to the lane and would have the wig on hadnt seen him had he knew his name and age had seen his wife and dog didnt know what he looked like would shoot wouldnt he a male aged fortysix who came out of the gates and had a dog with him understood why vern and leanne had queried then challenged him was he rushing it he was never wrong never had been the sun came up and clipped the treetops and he realised there were apples rotten and thrown out with the grass cuttings the wasps found him as he swatted them away he heard a telephone ring far off lunch awaited him at the special forces club and he had an appointment before that with the man who had overseen his hips resurfacing but benjie arbuthnot had taken an early train that had dumped him with the commuter hordes at a london terminus a taxi had brought him to vauxhall bridge cross on the south bank it was something or nothing really if its something id say that gillots on borrowed time if its nothing we just picked up the chaff of a few embittered old men who were doing some wishful thinking benjie and deirdre had been guests at alastair watsons wedding when benjie had run an obscure middle east desk mercifully with no links to weapons of mass destruction his last job before retirement watson had been his personal assistant when they were not in london they were in the gulf putting rather brave men on to the dhows that sailed backwards and forwards between dubai or oman and iranian harbours they had enjoyed benjie reckoned a good relationship as we understand it the village had given their lead man everything they had no item of even trifling value was overlooked the whole lot went to paying for the manpads it was thought they would ensure the successful defence of the village its location was important it guaranteed that the track through the cornfields remained open only at night and only at great risk but the symbol was huge gillot we gather took delivery of the valuables then went down to rijeka put the whole lot in safety deposit while he made arrangements with a shipping agent for the offloading of the cargo when it was brought ashore benjie had a rule and had adhered to it strictly since hed handed in his swipe card he never took access for granted with extreme politeness he had requested the previous afternoon that he be accorded a short and nonattributable briefing on the matter of a contract for harvey gillot he assumed watson had been permitted a glimpse of a resume of the zagreb contact then sent down to an interview room to humour an old war horse for whom perhaps the past had resurrected he did well in a very few days he had located the merchandise had it brought out of poland gdansk where there was customs chaos it was en route to rijeka where you showed up mr arbuthnot well no shipment was landed and nobody managed to get word to those expecting delivery they stood in a cornfield waiting and were zapped it appears that the bodies were treated badly that is badly by balkan standards and then the area was mined last week the mines were cleared and a plough turned up a corpse who had the name of harvey gillot in his pocket youd know better than me mr arbuthnot that memories in that corner of europe are long and hatreds dont diminish our feeling yes hell be hit the coffee had come from a machine was almost undrinkable but benjie had emptied two sachets of sugar into it and swirled the dregs with a wooden spatula does that help yes thank you he stood he was about to ask after watsons parents and why mr arbuthnot did you block the shipment he drew breath and considered he liked the young man trusted him and thought him owed some honesty sanctions busting wasnt it un security council resolution and all that criminal stuff i simply advised gillot a useful asset of the service at that time of the risks he was running and rather quietly nudged him towards the docks at aqaba a jordanian arsenal they might have gone to israel might have gone to syria might have gone to an outfit in azerbaijan you see that place on the danube was doomed only obstinacy and bloodyminded blindness prevented those people bugging out down that track and accepting the inevitable they didnt do the sensible thing and there are graves to show for it well thank you but he reneged on the deal hed done because of your intervention a little black and white alastair in a grey and murky situation nobody will put their hand up and admit to guilt obviously is it because of us sorry you that hes in deep trouble difficult times but i expect gillot will come through the blame game seldom helps towards a satisfactory conclusion in my limited experience he stood and his bloody hip hurt my regards to mrs arbuthnot shell appreciate that im grateful for your time need to know and all that of course i havent asked how you were alerted to this matter nor shall i but you ought to know were told that the recommendations of a gold group have been chucked back in their collective faces it was suggested to gillot that he should move out and do a runner he refused surely hell get a policeman on the door will not i absolutely dont mean to patronise but theres health and safety to be considered i mean what we did in the gulf or up on the border from the basra station well i dont remember you filing a risk assessment mr arbuthnot who guards the policeman on the door who watches the posteriors of the backup squad and theyre twentyfourseven so cash registers ring anyway thats where he is gold group have a headache and gillots planning a george custer moment may i ask were you fond of gillot he said stiffly i did not like or dislike him he was an agent damn you dear boy for asking he was a useful asset do we in the service now sign up to duty of care a bit good to have seen you again mr arbuthnot we acknowledge duty of care today but they were difficult times and pretty bloody i believe i would have thought your man made staunch enemies quote me and ill deny it once he was almost a son but we wanted that gear in jordan do i care about some remote murderous corner of outer europe not a jot do i care about harvey gillot well im here arent i thank you for your time he looked hard into her eyes the first time they had touched was when the boy simun turned sharply to point behind him and his fingers brushed her arm only a trifling contact they walked on a path of caked mud cracked dusty and rutted from a tractors wheels penny had left the car outside the cafe had been careful to lock it and make sure nothing was left on show inside she had realised then that the boy was on the veranda watching her with a slight mocking smile and that the chance of anyone stealing from the vehicle was unthinkable to him her security measures were almost offensive shed murmured flushing that it was force of habit london and sort of goes with the job then hed greeted her formally very passable english repeated what shed said the previous evening about wanting to see the cornfield road hed called it the kukuruzni put hed told her the villagers had named it the way of rescue and that he and she would go on foot he wore jeans that were tight around his waist and hips and a loosefitting tshirt of a band from zagreb who had played a concert the previous summer in osijek he had a mass of hair that reached his shoulders was perhaps an inch more than six foot slim muscled and tanned not quite the looks of a greek god but not far short penny thought they had gone past the cemetery where she had seen the four mounds of earth now they were on the path she thought it at first insignificant but quite pretty one side of where they walked was given over to a crop of sunflowers some as big as soup plates drooping beneath the weight nearly ready for harvesting on the other side of the path corn grew thick and dense the sun beat on her mercilessly the first time he had touched her was when he had turned and pointed back at the great bowl of the water tower she had squinted against the sun and made out the bright colours of the flag that topped it she was in her thirtieth year and he had said outside the cemetery that his mother had been among the first to be buried there after her body had been exhumed from a battlefield grave she had died in the crypt under the church from his births complications so no calculator needed he was eighteen would turn nineteen in the autumn that morning in the hotel she had chosen a pair of lightweight dark brown slacks a sober grey blouse with the upper buttons unfastened it was bloody hot and laceup walking shoes that were comfortable but made her look like a schoolmarm she had swept her hair back into a ponytail and wore no makeup she should have used the sunscreen but it was still in her handbags pouch no not in a relationship currently too busy on alpha to worry about the absence of a guy in her life no not fussed that in the team the men would have thought of her as proper and maybe priggish no she had not gone on a bounce after the breakup with paul and it was a full two months since shed had a postcard from antigua no she didnt feel she was missing out or going short if asif had not backed out on her at heathrow she would have let him walk ahead with the boy would have kept a haughty distance and used her notebook to jot things he wasnt there the second time he had touched her was when she had paused to look at the horizon and they had been level with the end of the sunflower strip where a monster bloom sagged over the path she had taken its weight and marvelled at the detail of the pointed orange petals the core of ochre where bees fed a spider tiny delicate had come on to the back of her hand and scuttled towards her wrist she would at any other time and in any other place have flicked it away and would have done so there if he had not taken her hand and guided the spider to his palm then freed the spider on the upper petals he had talked of the death of his mother and her reburial in the new cemetery had described to penny where defence positions had been dug and she had seen what were now shallow trenches little more than ditches he had called the kukuruzni put the lifeblood route of the village and had spoken of marinci bogdanovci and of the town behind them where the water tower was he had dropped his voice when they came to a newly ploughed strip that was above a gully in which a river flowed there were many tyre marks a flattened area that might have been under a tent and a pit some four feet deep seven feet long and four feet across he had told her of the death of four men three of his age and the schoolteacher who had taught his father then of a great betrayal she had said harvey gillots name he looked hard into her eyes her older colleagues and line manager said she had doggedness commitment and focus before they had reached the cemetery shed shown her id and put a card into his hand which hed pocketed without a glance he asked simply have you come to preserve the life of harvey gillot no you deny that you have come here to save the life of harvey gillot i deny it she said boldly penny laing had made a remark that would have been greeted in the alpha office with disbelief and astonishment bleaker im part of a team that regards him as a target for a criminal investigation did you hear of a contract i did is the contract investigated not by me silence hung he told her she stood where the men from the village had waited in the dark hours for the shipment to come through here they would have taken delivery he told the story simply and well she could almost feel the blast of the artillery shells and mortars almost see the flash of the knives taken from sheaths and experience the fear of those waiting for death the pain before it she almost understood the weight of the betrayal she must have turned as if she was preparing to sit down on the path perhaps better to share what had happened at this place he stripped off his tshirt and laid it on the ground she blushed scarlet and thought that to refuse was to offend she sat on it and got out the sunscreen he took it the third time the boy touched her was when he rubbed the white cream on her hands and lower arms on her cheeks chin nose and forehead and she allowed it to learn more he said she must talk to his father he had his hand on the butt inlaid plastic of the baikal pistol not tight or frantic just resting there to keep his hand on it seemed to drain the tension and help him to relax always important to be calm have the breathing steady he waited and watched the gates he could picture how it would be he had seen it enough times late very late the target was aware that someone was close to him and had entered the protective circle that men imagined was around them might be defiance or fear or just a stunned moment of shock that stopped the function of legs and arms because the target had seen the pistol sometimes if the target froze robbie would do the double tap of two head shots if the man had fight in him could be a rolled newspaper a plastic bag of shopping or a coat on his arm as he came out of a club or a pub or a glass in his hand if he was still inside then robbie did a chest shot to drop him and a head shot to finish him the wasps were worse than they had been earlier and he was surprised that the gates hadnt yet opened that the target hadnt come out with the dog more walkers had used the path but he was still and wasnt seen once hed had to allow two wasps to crawl on his face because he couldnt swat the little bastards while people went by never anything to show from a chest shot other than the hole in the clothing that a schoolkids pencil would slip into it might have a trace of burn round it a scorch but that was hard to see the head shot also made a hole where a pencil could slot the blood didnt come out of the chest or the head until the target was down and dead not that robbie had seen the bleeding he was gone by the time the dribble started didnt run important to walk his dad jerry had done a stretch when robbie was a youngster his mum had said that after a snatch at a jewellers had gone wrong a shop assistant ignored the raised cosh and slung an adding machine then her shoe at the lead guy in through the door his dad had run till his lungs half burst everyone on the street had noticed him and yelled to the police which way hed gone the old fool had still had a balaclava tight in his hand when they found him sagged against a lamppost he thought the dog must have crossed legs and almost chuckled but the bastard wasps hadnt left him he watched the gates and waited the phone call ended it had been a long one and no coffee to go with it because she was in the kitchen he wasnt going to carry his notepad pen and the phone in there and keep talking while the kettle boiled his friend from marbella had rung back to say that mm mortar shells and rg hand grenades could be included in the package did they not have enough of that gear already in baghdad no because the yanks had blown up arms stores the length and breadth of the country did the iraqi police need mortar shells designed for use at battalion level and in an infantry assault they could be persuaded did they need hand grenades with burstradius of up to twenty metres a dark night on the airport road manning a roadblock with most of the grunts gone home any iraqi policeman would be glad of half a box they had talked round it and haggled as friends did and harvey would go back to his people in baghdad and the friend would talk to the contact in tirana then there had been chat about the problems that summer in marbella algae in the swimmingpools time had slipped and he had almost forgotten that his first call of the day had been to order special nextday delivery a bulletproof vest harvey crossed the hall and went into the kitchen the dog was by the door panting tail wagging and she was lifting down the lead from the hook by the coat pegs he still had on his flipflops and his rough trainers were in the cupboard he did the dog walk didnt hang on to much but the fucking dog walk was his he snatched the lead beat her to it she had binoculars round her neck walking boots on her feet and a light sweater hooked over her shoulders the shades were on her hair and would cut out the glare off the sea he had nothing suitable for walking the coast path and going out towards the lighthouse and the great pulpit rock no explanations nothing about a late call coming through and putting him off his schedule he might as well have struck her she his josie recoiled from him almost flinched he didnt know what to say how to say anything had yesterdays shirt on and no hat to keep the sun off his forehead no glasses to keep the brilliance out of his eyes creased trousers and the flipflops that flapped on the kitchen floor as he went to the door opened it let the dog bound ahead of him and closed it he didnt turn to see her face had no interest in her expression he walked towards the gates they were closed the zapper that opened them was on his keyring which was beside the phone in his office he stared at the closed gates yes he could have climbed them but would not have been able to lift the dog over too heavy and too big a drop he was about to go back they opened welloiled they eased away from the post and stopped when there was enough space for him and the dog to go through he looked behind couldnt help himself and she was on the step with a zapper in her hand he thought she mouthed one word pathetic he lipread it he went out through the gate and the pickup was coming down the lane he saw the face and acknowledged a curt hand gesture nigel might have had some pillow talk about the unreasonableness of a husband and harvey swung on to the path and walked away from his gardener josies comforter yes he believed it the dog went ahead jumbled thoughts incoherently put together his wife pathetic the gardener a contract from a village the dog peering into bushes at the side of the track hackles rising the need for grenades in baghdad the requirement for police shia or sunni to have mortar bombs a bpv coming in the morning with a spray the suns strength in his eyes brightness off the water the ferry late the growl of the dog the fucking gardener his thoughts were a mess and then there was a stone sharp under his foot the flipflop was bloody useless he went on past the dog his fingers touched the ruff of its neck and he was too distracted by the pain in his foot the light on his face and every other thing on his mind to stop and check the dogs aggravation pathetic no one had ever called harvey gillot pathetic not in georgia azerbaijan syria the ministry buildings in jakarta beijing seoul or dubai or in an odd little backwater of the pentagon or in a garret on the top floor of whitehalls defence building off horse guards avenue no one who worked from vauxhall bridge cross on the albert embankment had ever called him pathetic a cloud lifted to hell with confusion his mind hooked on to the grenades and mortars the signal he would send to baghdad to the interior ministry and the calls he would make to business enterprise and regulatory reform and the penpushers who issued the exportclearance forms and where was the dog he whistled the path ahead was empty and he could see down the side of rufus castle to the rocks and the beach he turned the man wore overalls his hands pulled the balaclava down over his upper face then came together and the scrape of metal on metal the arming carried to him one hand right side was raised very clear to harvey gillot the hand held a pistol that looked to him like a makharov he knew the makharov had handled the sale of makharov pistols pretty much since the first day hed been with solly lieberman it might not have been a makharov that was coming up to aim at his chest might have been the baikal lookalike came from the same factory and the aim was on him he tried to turn and the twist of his foot seemed to gouge the stone between the flipflop and his sole deeper into the skin and the pain of it came on he bent reflex and the shot was fired he was half down on his knee and his ears rang with the crack of the bullet going high and wide a hanging in the morning concentrated the mind as did a raised handgun when aimed tenfoot range at a guy who had dropped to one knee harvey gillot saw everything with such clarity and the wasps he had never missed before robbie cairns had never failed to drop his target with the first shot he had seen the strike against the old stone of the castle ruin he steadied the target was down on one knee and the dog cringed at the side of the path fucking wasps he had to aim again because the impact of the first shot had lifted his firing arm and destroyed the zero hed taken the fucking wasps were in his face one at the balaclava slash for his nose another at the slit for his left eye one hovering and one crawling on him he had the aim steadied now the man stared at him should have been fear wasnt should have been like the dog but wasnt belly down and didnt cower started to squeeze and fucking wasp in his fucking nose and the other was half an inch from his eyeball it had never been like this before he saw the two wasps one was halfway up a nostril and the other was now on the material beside an eye he had the flipflop right foot in his hand a makharov or a baikal lookalike was aimed at him and in retaliation harvey gillot readied to throw a flipflop the pistols aim was gone and the mans arms flailed and brushed the balaclava he hurled the flipflop ten feet could have been less it hit the upper body not enough of course to hurt or injure but more than enough with two wasps in harness to confuse he ran they said military guys he met that the big decision was between flight and fight it was a response to acute stress a bullet had gone over his head fired from ten feet or less and a goddamn insect had given him the chance of a double play now he did flight but hed done fight with the flipflop he ran and shrieked out loud for the dog didnt realise it was at his knee and belting with him another crack a whiplash in the air and a splatter of bark on a tree ahead and then he was round the bend in the path and cut away into scrub he went down on his elbows and knees and burrowed through thorn and gorse his shirt was snagged and torn but he kept going and the dog came with him couldnt go further was at a drop he had reached a place where level ground ended and he was trapped between rock that went up sheer and rock that went down vertical he lay still hoped he was hidden and held the dog after the exhaustion the hearts pumping and the adrenalin there was a godawful pain in his foot maybe it wasnt clever two minutes or three he waited and listened he thought the dog had the best hearing and would respond but nobody came down the track people came up though a boy and a girl dressed to walk the coastal path they might be going the whole way round the bill he used them as a human shield if they reached the top of the track where it joined the lane he reckoned hed be fine he came out of his lair and stumbled after them his second flipflop fell off and he didnt stop for it but he pocketed the cartridge of the second round fired the boy and girl were laughing stepping out well and sharing a water bottle they didnt look back at harvey trailing them and went right past where the first spent cartridge case had been ejected didnt see it harvey picked it up they didnt have reason to look at the gap in the foliage where bloody devonish dumped his grass and prunings but harvey saw the wasps there angry and swarming he reached the gates he beat on the button with his fist he held it down he yelled at the skies over the gates if you two havent started shagging yet let me in no one answered him and no one came he scraped up a handful of dirt and stones and threw it high over the gate towards the house but knew it would fall short vern had been waiting seemed an age at the car hed endured boredom and anxiety alternately but had known the confidence that came from belonging to a toprated team and his brother was pickofthebunch at his feet there was a small mess of groundout cigarettes selfrolled ones and he prided himself that he had learned in gaol how to make them narrow and firm so that the tobacco lasted longest he had been halfway through smoking the fourth or fifth when they had come out of the lane crossed the road then come up the slope away from the museum and the pub he knew there had been failure body language told him his brothers head and the slump of the shoulders robbie still had the overalls on and dear god couldnt believe it he had in his hand something that looked the right colour for the balaclava they didnt run but leanne was trying to speed him up he could see but not yet hear that she was pestering him with questions and not getting answers how had it been every other time that vern had done the drivers role he had been sitting or standing by the car and robbie had materialised round a corner never panting never with a hair out of place and had sauntered over opened his door lowered himself into the seat slipped on the seatbelt and locked it he had never looked fussed or troubled nothing to shout that he was stressed every other time vern had eased the car away from a kerb or a supermarket parking bay and hadnt screamed the tyres or burned the rubber but had gone off main roads on to back doubles and ratruns where there werent cameras didnt quiz every other time he had let robbie have his space and let him break the quiet in the car and every other time there had been a halfwink a slight nod or a wisp of a smile they were near to him and no reaction from robbie leanne biting her lip and opening the big plastic bag from her pocket and there in the street but behind a tree his brother peeled off the overalls and dropped them in then the balaclava she reached into the boot and had the lighter fuel out was spraying his arms and trying to dab his face with cotton wool nobody came the street stayed empty the museum still had the closed sign up and the pub was shuttered seemed to take for ever it was an untravelled road new territory he was in the car twisting the ignition when he heard the smack of the rear door closing then leanne was beside him her expression dead as if shock had hit her her hands shook where to he was entitled to ask nothing from robbie except the stink of lighter fuel leanne said just get clear how fast needed to know big speed or like nothing had happened robbie didnt speak leanne did out of here he had never peppered questions before because there had been no need was now what happened a little hiss of breath from robbie leanne spoke for him it didnt didnt happen robbie accepted it had no choice like the first time hed been in an interview room aged ten years and four months and his mother was the responsible adult she answered all the questions the big butch police cow had put leanne would be the mouthpiece vern ignored his brother he fired thats why weve done clothing and why weve this bloody smell so what happened he missed she said softly he missed am i hearing right how many shots two he told me when i met him i dont know everything he missed with two shots what range he said it was about three yards he missed with two shots and three yards nine feet not possible how he stood where some grass was dumped off the track there were rotten apples and wasps and she spoke without expression he stood on a wasps nest is that what youre saying he saw the target with the dog came out on to the track after him and the target ducked as he fired first so he missed and the target ducked whats the target supposed to do stand fucking still he was close to losing the car head shaking eyes big hands off the wheel and over his eyes and he missed with the second shot because he had a wasp in his nose and a wasp in his eye vern had control again of the car had bumped the kerb and missed a tree and was back on the road yes so i dont know much more vern he fired twice missed twice and quit vern the target threw a flipflop at him was armed with a flipflop and threw it and hit him with it and vern on new territory milking the moment and maybe reflecting years of resentment at the kid brother who used him as chauffeur and messengerboy never as a trusted confidant said oh thats serious should we go to accident and emergency what a prat a tosser what a an arm came from behind and the hand was at his throat closing on his windpipe the skin on the fingers stank of lighter fuel and he fought for breath he hung on to the wheel and stayed off the pavement and heard her voice soft speaking past him the grip loosened there were no sirens he didnt respond wouldnt have rubbed his neck or showed that it had hurt him he didnt apologise for what he had called his brother a prat and a tosser and could have called him worse he couldnt get his head round robbie standing on rotten apples stirring shit in a wasps nest and missing twice no cairns ever apologised not his granddad or his dad and he wouldnt be the first he turned off at a line of shops and went right heading towards the high old buildings of the prison for young guys he found a narrow entrance to an old quarry he had located when he had done his drive round what he understood was pretty clear his young brother had screwed up big he didnt know if in robbies trade second chances were handed out let him wait shed said let him bloody wait and stew they should have had an hour maybe more if her husband took the dog right up to the bill and had a coffee or tea at the cafe it would be more than an hour if he went the other way took the path past the youngoffenders prison and went all the way to the adults gaol that would be an hour too she had been standing behind the chair in the kitchen and her hands had been on the mans shoulders she had been working the muscles taking the tension from them when she had heard the shots then nothing silence perhaps a little anxiety had eaten at her resolve a couple of minutes had passed and her hands had been off his neck she couldnt have said what she wanted for harvey to walk into the house softsoled shoes and quiet when they were in the kitchen her hitched up on the table or they might have been on the floor in any damn room it was her dream everpresent but she jibbed a little at its fulfilment she didnt know how he would react fine if he was apoplectic scarletfaced broke down in tears or threatened violence grim if he stayed in the doorway watched the hips bounce and asked if there had been calls then went off to his office two shots in the early days she had been with him to arms fairs where there were metre ranges and customers were invited to shoot the prizes champagne magnums there had been a day out fourcourse lunch in the officers mess at the infantry training schools firepower demonstration when blank and live rounds had been fired her gardener did not know that her husbands life was threatened and a contract taken but would have seen him go out of the gates and heard shots she strained to listen a young mans laughter then a young womans from behind the high wall that bordered the driveway and the patio must have been wrong not shots could have sworn they were though she couldnt ring harvey because his phone was within arms reach her hands had gone back to the shoulders the rippling muscles and her fingers slipped down into the mat of chest hair and there had been his voice if you two havent started shagging yet let me in there had been the fall of stones on the drive and she could see the high gate rocking as if someone was trying to force it let him wait let him bloody wait and stew a kiss wet against the salt gathered behind an ear there would be no more she yearned for it but wouldnt have it even though she had a condom in her pocket and knew there was always one ribbed in his wallet a good bet her harvey wouldnt care anyway he used to tell her that in belarus or bulgaria romania or georgia the whores would be queuing in the bar for his attentions skinny girls and heavy girls tall and short natural and artificial blonde patrolled the corridor outside his room in the hope hed weaken and take the chain off the door implants suspenders and hiv would have been easier for her if she could have been the wronged wife because he took tarts into his room she let go of the shoulders from the kitchen she watched nigel go past his pickup and walk to the gates he fiddled with the pad and let them open just wide enough harvey limped might have been walking on coals the dog bounded after him his hair was dishevelled and his knees were scratched shock was etched on his face and his eyes were wild he came into the kitchen and winced as his feet left blood smears on the vinyl he looked into her eyes and said nothing but his right hand slipped into his pocket and he dropped on to the table scrubbed oak planking two empty cartridge cases they bounced and rattled then were still he went on through the inner door and towards his office the sun through the window gleamed on the cartridge cases leanne waited in the phone box heard the ring tone and lifted the receiver she had called a neighbour of her grandfather in the albion estate had given the number of the box and the neighbour would have hurried three doors down the walkway to bang on his door the connection was now via two public phones and the chance of an intercept was minimal it was a reasonable precaution because granddad cairnss home phone was a possible target under the regulation of investigatory powers act and its reference to interception of communications she could not be placed on the isle of portland at the quarry down the road long exhausted and with its tally of burnedout cars a small fire would now be dying and all evidence of a firearms residue would have been eliminated from a set of overalls a balaclava and lightweight plastic gloves the lighter fuel had the dual purpose of speeding the conflagration and killing the remnants of the chemical discharge on firing from robbies face and wrists he had been led half stripped to a puddle where without ceremony his brother had scrubbed him leanne had realised that the relationships had changed that an old pecking order was broken her younger brother had given no further explanation and had not complained at the harsh way vern handled him she barely knew him her grandfather was on the phone she thought he might have been having his breakfast working his way through the flat runners of the afternoon when the neighbour had rapped at his door he would have hurried down into the street and then clutching a slip of paper with a number on it gone to the station and found a phone that wasnt broken he would have dialled and expected the good news she told it like it was she didnt shield her brother but relayed back what she had been told a lieup where there were rotting apples wasps a sudden duck as the first shot was fired which had missed the target a second shot again offtarget because of wasps in his face and a flipflop thrown twice she had had to repeat herself because granddad cairns had sworn and another time there had been a gasp of utter disbelief one question how was robbie she was succinct hes bollocksed on his knees leanne loved granddad cairns and held him in devoted respect he was in his eightieth year had skin the colour of old parchments shed seen as a kid in the library was seldom without a fag hanging from his mouth and coughed in convulsions most mornings but she reckoned his brain was keen she and vern certainly robbie were unused to catastrophe none of them had known how to react other than to shed the clothing and destroy it she heard her grandfather out listened and absorbed rang off and went back to the car to tell them the voice was incoherent roscoe interrupted but youre all right youre not hurt it had been a result a brilliant one the previous evening in wandsworth three officers inserted into the shop via the backyard entrance and two builders vans out the front well loaded with people and the guns were in support they had waited until the bad guys were on their way across the pavement face masks on and pickaxe handles ready to knock out the display windows and theyd done the go go go four on the pavement in custody and two drivers yes mr gillot of course i take this development most seriously two shots yes i confirm youre unhurt one of the bad guys had spun a dancers pirouette then sprinted for the far side of the street and tried to lose himself in the traffic he had gone straight into the arms of mark roscoe who had brought him down and sat on him four hours to write up the reports and afterwards the pub my superior will be consulting with relevant parties mr gillot there is no need to shout at me sir a very unpleasant experience yes my colleagues and i will be on our way no i doubt very much that hes sitting outside your gate i imagine hes legged it try to keep yourself secure in the meantime mr gillot the pub had gone on late the minicab home had lost itself and hed been asleep in the back so he was into the bedroom later than she wasnt pleased shed not woken him when shed gone to work no note on the table but a box of alkaseltzer and the windows were open which meant that the room stank hed come in feeling fragile and was pottering and his phone had rung no mr gillot im not suggesting you dig a bunker under the table thats uncalled for sir and i would remind you that you were offered advice and chose to reject it now if youll excuse me i can get off the phone and start driving he put down the receiver and grimaced bill twirled the car keys and suzie gazed at him with a degree of annoyance as if it was too obvious hed been taking abuse from the bloody man and hadnt slapped him down what did mark roscoe think not repeatable in company but something along the lines watered down that the world might have been a better place if the contract man had aimed a bit straighter and earned his money he would never consider saying to a superior that the tango didnt deserve the care put into safeguarding a miserable secondrate life but he could think it theyd made their bloody bed and they husband and wife could bloody lie on it they hit the road coming out of the first turning the junction at the lights bill turned to him boss dont take any shit from gillot dont dont embarrass me mr gillot dont go near her big talk for a bloody gardener or am i just the last to be told just keep out of the way mr gillot and nobody gets upset as long as we understand that for all your hard work this morning and your duties as protector and baggage carrier for my wife itll be she who pays you not me cheap mr gillot i think shes coming now so please dont interfere did he want a fight nearly did the front door was open also open were the drivers door and boot of her car parked on the driveway beside it loaded with the wheelbarrow and the rest of nigels paraphernalia was his pickup they would leave he assumed in convoy from the portland front line the lulworth view salient the gardener had inserted himself between harvey gillot and the front door it was an hour since shed said she would go he had not begged there had been none of the bentkneeandwellingeyes stuff about his inability to see this through without her he heard the small but shrill squeal of the suitcase wheels the cartridge cases had rolled on the kitchen table which had been sufficient to start them off she was not hanging about to have her head blown off by a gunman who might just next time get to aim straighter with her alongside him he was not about to miss her and did she want some help with her packing she was not considering setting down shallow roots in a godawful safehouse that was vetted by policemen he had no intention of bugging out as rats did she had done nothing but he had brought this on himself through deceit he had worked damn hard to put clothes on her back and food on her table she had called him a cheat whod reneged on a done deal he had tried to laugh with irony but made a poor fist of it and had called her the cheat the deal reneged on her marriage vows which had concluded the shouting match he noticed that the gardener had step by step positioned himself so that he could intervene if his employer had come at her with a knife from the kitchen block she carried one case and pulled another that left a dilemma for the gardener he could do polite manners pick up her bag and lug it to the car leaving her without defence against her husbands potential violence or leave her to shift it harvey revelled in the moment he reached past the gardener took the bag she carried and murmured something about always here to give a helping hand his wife josie started it again it was your greed that did it and you ripped off those people you deserve whats coming to you as long as youre happy and safe i have no other concern dont you realise what a shit youve become harvey having gained that stunning insight im surprised you lasted so long with me and dont go near my daughter your daughter of course never in doubt they were at her car he could have flared into a response about the payment of school fees the cost of holidays the rent for the field where the horse was kept and so much else but he couldnt be bothered nor could he be bothered to get snide about the gardeners ability to keep a woman used to comforts he forced a smile you look after yourself ill be back for more of my clothes you do that nothing about needing a removals van for the job i think youre doing the right thing and ill make it as easy for you as i possibly can he congratulated himself that his voice sounded so reasonable she was in her car and zapped the gates the gardener peered out and up the lane and he thought of the old stories he used to hear with solly lieberman in peshawar about the soviet boys who had to drive their trucks through the mountain passes from kabul to jalalabad and didnt know where the ambush would be this is all because of your cheating correct again as you always were are she slammed the door and will no doubt continue to be she wouldnt have heard the car and the pickup enveloped him in exhaust fumes he didnt hang around long enough to see whether they made it up the lane or whether the mujahideen got had them in a blast of rpg fire she must have done it because the gates closed the dog was in the kitchen dogs understood it was under the kitchen table and looked cowed harvey realised that the moment the gates had closed he had lost a focus against which to fight what to do he paced the length of the house all the rooms were on the ground floor with the exception of their daughters her daughters bedroom which was built into the roof and reached by a spiral staircase he trudged through the kitchen the dining room the snug where the tv was their bedroom hers and into his office on the work surface by the keyboard he saw his pencilled sums of the figures relevant to a contract with the iraqi police he did the grand tour once then went to the kitchen sink poured water into a glass and swigged it so damn quiet no sound from his feet on flooring that was parquet vinyl or carpeted he had anointed his feet with a salve and wore socks hoping they would protect the wounds from dirt he didnt know now what he should do he had never told josie about meeting arbuthnot on the dockside at rijeka it had seemed a minor matter and nothing to concern her in the early days the marriage had pulsed with love and achievement it hadnt seemed necessary to tell her of something small in which he had no pride the silence weighed around him and the emptiness he thought about the pain of walking and the pair of mm cartridge cases that lay on the kitchen table they were beside the days post which josie must have brought in holiday brochures a pack from a knitwear company and a telephone bill everything addressed to her he couldnt escape the quiet without the pain and the cartridge cases it might not have happened she had said she would come back for more of her clothes and he had said he would make it easy for her he set off again new purpose for the bedroom he could recall the man and had a lockdown picture in his mind of the gun he knew it had been a makharov or the baikal imitation he had sold makharovs all over but not the baikal the man had seemed small of almost insignificant build he had not noticed the eyes behind the slits or anything particular about the nose that had poked through a hole above the cut for the lips when he had done business in old eastern europe or the middle east and had negotiated with dealers there had been bodyguards who floated in shadows opened car doors and lounged in villa gardens he would have regarded it as certain that any of them any of a hundred would have followed him down the track until he could run no further then killed him if that was what the village had bought they had not bought well i dont think im going to enjoy this robbie and im bloody sure you arent a time had been arranged with his granddaughter for his grandson to stop on the journey back to london and call a phone booth at the bus and jubilee line station in rotherhithe at his age granddad cairns still had presence a sharp eye and a jaw that could be set firm his voice rasped two minutes or three before the time scheduled for the call he had looked at the woman in the booth he wanted and had asked her respectfully to terminate her call and vacate it shed effed him then maybe had a second glance at the jaw and eyes of the bowed old man who wanted the phone she had hung up and gathered her shopping together funny thing as hed stood and looked at the silent phone there had been a queue of punters behind him but none had cared to hassle him the phone had rung out to the halfminute of the time hed demanded and he had lifted it the voice down the line was subdued and he had to strain to hear it against the voice of the man in the next booth to his what did you say better the second time you werent there you dont know robbie im not concerned about you standing on a wasp hole or about a target ducking or about a wasp up your nose or about how many you let off that missed you want to know what im concerned about do you he wouldnt have said his grandson was lippy he was a kid who was alone ran his own life to his own instructions but he had phoned at almost the exact time he was required to which told granddad cairns a fair amount himself at that age sent a message from a clappedout hasbeen told what to do and when to do it with the weight of a foulup on his back he would have ignored the demand to make a phone call on schedule you werent there quiet you dont know you said that once dont need saying again he had put grit into his tone the kid was on his way back into london he wanted the implications of what had happened that morning embedded in him wanted it to have swirled round the kids head before he reached london hed thought his grandson to be the best had been proud of him and it hurt to have the faith kicked aside and it was too big a matter for him to give the kid a soft response there had been a contract the contract was fucked what im concerned about he have a gun havent heard he did all i hear is that he threw a flipflop at you then ran barefoot away from you why couldnt you catch him up why didnt you go after him finish him i just didnt he would have put his shirt on his grandson he would have bet his last fag on the kid following it through wouldnt have said he liked him but had respect for him and couldnt have believed that a couple of wasps and a flipflop would screw him up im getting there robbie you failed big word failed not a cairns word youre supposed to be hot and people believed the bullshit nobody reckoned that fucking wasps and a flipflop could skewer your reputation what hurts me that you didnt go in after him and finish him whether it was ugly messy but a job done have you finished granddad maybe it was the end of another goddamn era one of those changes in the cairns family fortunes that were bloody volcanoes in their lives himself it had been the cleaning up of the metropolitan police the end of knocking off wages vans and knowing that the squad cars were safely in the car parks behind the stations his boy jerry had faced his bloody brick wall when the cameras were introduced now you couldnt blow your nose in london without it being seen and the spread of the cameras had done for jerry for grandfather and father alike the happy days when hip pockets were wellfilled and women wore big stones on their fingers were gone the mealticket of today was the kid in the family money was not saved but spent when it came in what robbie did paid for granddad cairnss groceries and helped with the electricity jerry and dot lived off the kids earnings vern and leanne too it would have been easier for him if robbie hadnt rung in at all near as easy for him if hed been told to shut his face and badmouthed by his grandson he didnt understand why the kid had crumpled people put their faith in you and have been let down me and your dad were pissed on i like to say in this world you have one chance youve got to hope kid that you have two chances one chance you failed worst is that the money was paid it was the kernel of what he had to say didnt know why hed taken so long getting there he wouldnt have considered going gentle on the kid because of family in the world of granddad cairns the most important factor was money men were paid men did not deliver men went into concrete and always had might be the flyover at chiswick or the foundations of the dome or the support towers of the new olympics site money had been paid and lodged in an account and he knew it because the paper slip from the cash machine had told him so to be paid and to break faith on a deal was a death sentence and to have to pay back the money was a humiliation he doubted hed survive we were paid we had their money i have to tell people you failed also im telling them youre worth a second chance get it in your skull money was paid and needs earning if its not youre in the gutter robbie bleeding bad and the call was cut might have been that the kid ran out of money or that he put the phone down on him she sat on a bench opposite the museum and the lane in front of her ran down past the terraces of cottages the gate to the house was out of sight she could sit there she was just a pretty young girl out in the sunshine she had assumed it was the wife who had left blonde highlighted hair looking a mess through the windscreen driving fast up the lane and turning on to the road without a glance to right or left shed not seen more of her because of the privacy tinting on the rear windows a pickup had followed leanne cairns wasnt a fool might have been as her grandmother mum davies said the brightest of the whole tribe wasnt taxed leanne could register the scale of the catastrophe that had hit them down that lane she wondered if by now without her as a crutch robbie had dragged himself together she was to watch and not attract notice and she was to tell him what she saw she imagined that by now her grandfather would be hyperventilating at the failure that a message was on its way to hmp wandsworth and her fathers cell block she thought a report on the failure would have reached lenny grewcock and would be homing in on some village in eastern europe that it was robbie who had failed amazed her not her father or her eldest brother little robbie she knew where hed be she wasnt supposed to but she did with vern she was the only member of the family who was privy to where hed be and a fat lot of fucking good it would do him she stood up and started walking she went past the museum past a group of walkers in shorts and country shirts with rucksacks past small houses with bright windowboxes she saw the gates and the voice grille and stood rooted a suitcase came over the gates and split open when it landed clothes spilling out and she spun on her heel so his wife had quit on him hadnt told him theyd see this through together she had done a runner and wasnt expected back and harvey gillot with her robbie was in the pits from what you say benjie blowback is apt the trouble with blowback is that every little man with the benefit of hindsight can lob a brickbat stuck in you as a dose of garlic is dont

course we armed the old butcher fed him intelligence empowered him and it all blew back in our faces and afghanistan right again i had a little part in that fourthrate groundtoair kit was shipped in and my young friend gillot did what was asked of him we helped expel the russians and now were up to our necks in that awful place toasted by the hairy blighters we encouraged benjie seldom met anyone in the bar these days whom he had known on the road in the ranks of the sis he had served in pakistan syria argentina the balkans and of course had done time as a cantankerous veteran in iraq there he had not tolerated incompetence and had valued the friendship and humanity of the young man now opposite him you could say benjie they sow the wind they shall reap the whirlwind your gillot sowed then and reaps now the waitress hovered and he indicated that they needed more time on the menu but not on the wine list a nicotinestained finger stabbed on a house white a chardonnay book of hosea jerusalem version of the old testament chapter eight i think verse seven yes in my career god i sound pompous i believe i tried to respond with fairness towards our assets what do i owe him tell me what are the police offering told him to hide in a ditch and keep his head down family stiffening his backbone i doubt it hes a loner all arms dealers are theyre pariahs on no ones invitation list bizarre business this blowback the americans slipped it into the lexicon to highlight the scale of the foulup when they backed the shah of persia and created the monster of modern iran it was clever at the time and theyve cursed it for thirty years the unintended consequences of an operation harvey gillot made a fair profit out of that deal set him on his feet let him walk tall now its the ditch and maybe right into a wet culvert i asked you what do i owe him in his case put crudely id want my hand held figuratively literally maybe both and something more in the way of advice spit it he cant hide for ever agreed cant go into a ditch for the rest of his life with me he waved the waitress forward again think so thank you i make an abominable host can we order i always go for chicken safest i think yes with you i hear what you say it was enough to sap the enthusiasm of a convert megs behan had always found those recently ordained into new branches of the clergy or to the ranks of the antinicotine fascists or the ones making the globe greener nauseatingly saintly in the degree of their enthusiasm herself the prospect of a trip to the coast had roused in her a rare sense of excitement she had a giant canvas bag containing her bullhorn which was loaded with fresh batteries and wads of leaflets describing the evils of the arms trade her enthusiasm drained away with a points failure west of winchester the converts loyalty to the cause suffered as she sat in a crowded carriage and watched nothing much happen outside the coast and the home of harvey gillot who sold weapons that killed innocents was far away and the points stayed unrepaired she had wanted to be there by midday would be lucky now if it was late afternoon the battle raging inside her was fought along familiar lines did she dare to poke her head out of the window and light a cigarette or lock herself into the toilet and puff into the pan she did neither sat on the train and endured her mind was a jumble of statistics on weapons and ammunition exported the destinations they went to the schedules of flights out of ostend the ancient unserviced aircraft that limped across continents in search of conflict and men such as gillot who met cronies and contacts in dark bars and select restaurants none of them knew her name or what she looked like he would though too fucking right he would he would see her at his front gate would hear her anywhere in his home and thinking of the blast of the bullhorn was almost better than dragging on a cigarette a miracle an answer to the faith of the convert the carriage lurched the train crawled forward quite pretty some of them bill said nice choices good styles suzie added to mark roscoe what littered the lane and hung from the top of the gate the thorn and gorse bushes looked too pricey to be dumped as rubbish they were all out of the car but the engine had been left to idle they picked their way among skirts dresses and blouses summer jackets and tweed ones for winter outdoor coats for the city and anoraks for the island there were boots and shoes in most colours and a quality set of leather suitcases the cases were not fastened only partly zipped some garments still bulged out of them while others had fallen clear suzie said looks like she had a full knicker drawer bill said surprised she needed so many id swear there was a washingmachine the knickers made the best show roscoe thought maybe a slight wind had lifted the thinner ones because some were lodged in the lower branches of a couple of ash trees and on the upper foliage of the gorse they made a bright display then sombre do you reckon shes all right boss bill asked as they picked their way through the clothing there had been gallows humour which police liked to peddle when they intruded on personal catastrophe it was the protective armour they had all put on as rookies it helped them through the worst roadtraffic accidents and the deaths in housingassociation flats where the cadaver had lain for a month or two and attracted enough maggots to roscoe had been a constable for less than a year working in north london when he had stood at the rail of a bridge from which a woman had jumped fifty feet or more into fastmoving traffic she was splattered some tyres had gone over her and he could have heaved but a veteran had said did you hear about that bloke who went to the lethalinjection thing in the states they took him into the execution chamber and laid him down and he said never a stunt double around when you want him got it it was a fair question suzie said doesnt look as though hes as rational as he might be boss bill killed the cars engine and flashed the lock he was first over the gates roscoe gave suzie a boost he made his hands into a stirrup and shoved then he scrabbled for a grip clung to the top sweated panted and went over he landed hard the breath knocked out of him good thing about the holster he wore the glock stayed firm inside the front door was open and the dog came out only a labrador and not a threat but it ran at them and barked roscoe reckoned theyd find one of three things she would be in the kitchen the bedroom the bathroom or the living room and her blood would be on the walls and the carpet and hed be huddled in a corner trembling she would be dead and he would be in the garage with the engine running and the pipe over the exhaust or slumped with two empty bottles painkillers and scotch she wouldnt be there and hed be struggling with the broadsheet crossword there was no blood on the dogs coat or paws suzie said he doesnt have a shotgun licence but he does have a firearms one its on the record whats covered by the firearms bill demanded suzie grinned and her glock was out of her bag it seemed too big in her hand he has a deactivated ak and had a usable ak he also has an rpg launcher but not the grenade to fire from it and theres a lee enfield mark rifle a collectors piece he has a handgun too but i cant remember what make i suppose i should have told you upfront but it didnt seem important therell be guns in the house hes an arms dealer right does he have ammunition roscoe asked she said he had permission for limited stocks for the kalashnikov and the lee enfield but had never applied to hold any meant nothing maybe he had ten rounds or five or maybe one and it was in a breech enough enough for the three of them the glocks were drawn armed couldnt estimate what degree of lunacy theyd confront no more humour not even did you hear about the condemned guy who was taken into the room where the electric chair was and he said are you people sure that things safe it always made him laugh but not now bill first then suzie through the front door the dog with her bounding about like it was a goddamn game and roscoe at the back through the hall no body no blood into the kitchen no body no blood but the dog pawed at a big cupboard door opened it no body no blood but a seethrough plastic bucket twothirds full of dried dog food suzie pulled it out lifted off the lid and kicked it over roscoe saw on the table the two spent cartridge cases and the voice on the phone had blurted that two shots were fired dog behind them eating off the floor they did the rush tactic one to each doorway and two covering then one entering one in the doorway and one in a ready position with the glock held high and twohanded the bedroom was empty the bed was made the counterpane smoothed but all the wardrobe doors were wide open and the drawers were on the carpet stripped bare but no body no blood no empty bottles pills or whisky roscoe heard the voice too faint at first to identify or to hear what was said the three gathered at the door of a room that was at the back and led off the dining area all three all straining no im assured the end user isnt a problem the uk has good relations with them frankly we can ship stuff into oman with no difficulty its only communications gear im talking about whatll fit on to three pallets and itll be under a total of five hundred kilos what are we looking at if i get delivery to ostend does the price dip if i get delivery to you at bratislava look friend im trying to push the business your way youre saying then that bratislava isnt as convenient as ostend ostend it is then usual rates which are you using that tristar or the antonov the antonov still gets into the skies bloody amazing yes im fine everythings rosy and thanks its a pleasure to do business roscoe called gillots name and gave his own the door was opened he would have seen the guns and the postures the dog must have cleaned up what had been tipped from the bucket and it came from behind them fast it cannoned into bills legs and he was jolted towards suzie roscoe laughed just for a moment then stifled it he was brusque where was mrs gillot gone quit took the gardener with her why were mrs gillots clothes scattered outside the gates she said shed come back and get the rest of her stuff and thatll make it easier for her the laughter hed stifled was about a hoary anecdote that had run the length of his crowd royal and diplomatic protection special branch firearms in london and most of the provincial forces that supplied protection officers to politicians a minister had had a west country constituency and the sniffer dog had run through the mans home to check for explosives it had jumped on the bed and crapped on the duvet it had been shut back in the van while the team had hustled to the nearest launderette always made him laugh but not for sharing with a tango by dumping her stuff on a public highway was he not making an exhibition of himself not that fussed good enough for you what were his plans in view of the attack to reject the advice youre about to trot out stay put and consider options rising impatience and anger would he show them the location of the attack yes they went out into the sunshine roscoe saw that gillot was limping he had eased his feet gingerly into old sandals both bill and suzie went into a practised routine in which she was at the front and he behind roscoe had slipped in alongside the tango they approached the gates and a smile almost a sneer was on gillots face suzie asked not taking her eyes off the shrubs the gates and the top of the wall whether he had taken out any of his weapons from whatever secure store he kept them in he replied easily that he had not and threw questions back at her did she know that the ak was deactivated did she know also that the ak was not deactivated because it had actually been run over in the panshir valley by the tracks of a soviet main battle tank and the rpg launcher had a halfbucket of sinai sand in its tube had rusted through and would kill anyone who tried to use it last did she know that the lee enfield mark had been buried in a shell blast in the bocage battle of normandy in and not dug up until the skeleton was recovered in it would need more than engineering oil to free up its working parts there was a luger pistol from the great war and the barrel had been drilled it didnt work and she should check why her paperwork did not provide the uptodate situation with the nearhistoric weapons they were kept under the living room in a safe minibunker reached by a trapdoor and hidden from view by the carpet a bit of fear would have helped gillots cause roscoe reckoned the last three cases he had done for his small wing of scd had involved safeguarding an albanian brothel owner a cocaine dealer in west london and most recently a scrapmetal king who had minded the prime proceeds from a jewellery heist at heathrow for ten years until the guys who had done the heist and done time wanted the sparkle back all involving lowlife all with a sense of humour and a degree of dignity and all with respect for the job roscoe had tried to do the albanian was now back in pristina with his nephews and cousins and had dispersed his assets he had offered the team the chance to meet some nice clean girls and young and had sent a postcard via new scotland yard the dealer had wisely returned to jamaica and the scrapmetal king had gone quiet perhaps had been encouraged to find what he had minded in the three cases there had been congratulations from on high men had faced conspiracytomurder charges advice had been taken and shots not fired they were under the castles walls suzie said that the english heritage website stated it had been built in the eleventh century then fought over repaired and strengthened over the next five hundred years more important there was a place where the weathered stone had been hacked away roscoe bent down while the others maintained a guard he found the bullet squashed and almost unrecognisable except to a trained eye which lay at the side of the path further down gillot indicated where he had been as the second shot was fired and pointed to the gap in the undergrowth where the rotting apples and wasps were they did the alignments and saw the mark on a branch where sap oozed and a bullet had lodged roscoe noted the prettiness of the place and the beauty of the seas colours easy to imagine murder on the streets round the kings cross brothels in the dealers estate territory or under the mountains of scrapped vehicles in the yard but not here walkers came past and must have wondered why a man who was unshaven and sweatstreaked was with two wellturnedout younger men and an attractive girl and why the two men wore jackets in the heat and the girl carried a big bag have you seen enough gillot asked roscoe said they had i shouldnt have been left alive if thats the best they could dig out they paid for a bum roscoe said he supposed killing wasnt an exact science i was helpless half down had flipflops on then nothing he didnt follow me a wasp fazed him roscoe said drily that he imagined even contract killers had the occasional bad day at work you taking this seriously he was and tried to muster some sincerity they were walking back up the hill the sea behind them the sun hard on their heads a salesmans smile cracked gillots face crap he was if you say so mr gillot they were at the front gate gillot walked through the clothing as if it wasnt there a family had come down the lane laden with beach kit and little fishing rods and stepped through the mess bill and suzie started to pick up and fold the clothing as best they could then stacked it in the cases gillot didnt help he said he was not open to advice was not going to run was staying in his home roscoe shrugged gillot opened the gates and the dog leaped at him with enthusiasm i doubt hell be back of course he will roscoe snapped he wont have moved till he had confirmation that the money had been paid he has to be back its your privilege to reject advice i suppose you think i was just lucky roscoe interrupted a man once said you have to be lucky all the time we only have to be lucky once that was after he had failed to kill the prime minister its a mantra of ours mr gillot we think its hard to be lucky all the time when he only has to be lucky once he was alone stretched out in a chair the one he always sat in vern had dropped him off and there had been a curl of contempt at his elder brothers mouth that he hadnt seen before another time robbie would have made a punchbag of verns face another time he would have telephoned the extension on the counter where barbie was and demanded that she make an excuse and get back to rotherhithe he felt exhausted and had not before on each occasion that he had fired at a man and seen him crumple he had known only calm satisfaction then the feelings of power had gushed now he had fired and a man hadnt crumpled there was no calm satisfaction and no it played as if it was on a loop in his mind and he couldnt escape it a man walking a dog running wasps around him the man stumbling the shot fired and hitting a stone wall a man down the shot lined up the wasps in the face mask and the shot gone high a flipflop thrown at him the man running hadnt missed before had once shot at twice that distance and done two hits head and upper chest he didnt know why he hadnt run down the track after the target and the target was barefoot the track rough stone caught him and killed him he remembered when a steer had broken out of a wagon transporting animals to a slaughterhouse had kicked out of the tail flap when it stopped at the lights on jamaica road they hadnt just let the thing go but had gone after it and killed it with a rifle shot the elevenyearold robbie cairns had seen it all and with the images were the words spoken by his grandfather on the telephone his eyes were tight shut and the sunlight didnt penetrate he held the pistol in his hand couldnt stop the trembling maybe for failing they would put him in the concrete while he was still alive and it would come up over his knees his gut his chest and his head he held the pistol tight his knuckles white and he heard the key in the door slipped the weapon into his waist band and covered the bulge with his shirt tail a light kiss how was he fine a little hug had his day been good yes where had he been just around nowhere special fingers on his face gentle would he like some tea he would she had dumped her bag was in the kitchen she never asked why he didnt make tea for himself if he wanted it and she didnt question how he spent his time and the fingers had made a little pattern on his cheeks the hands had held his shoulders when shed hugged him and almost he could taste the kiss she had put on his lips it was important to him more important than he could tell her he peeled off the clothes he had worn under the overalls that morning and put the baikal pistol under a cushion on the chair he always used she was at the kitchen door you smell robbie mind me saying that no offence want you to wash these he didnt pick up the tshirt the trousers the vest underpants and socks let her when he was naked she didnt touch him she bent and gathered up the clothes what was it i smelt robbie i spilled some lighter fuel on my arm maybe ill take a shower she went back to the kitchen and he heard her load the washingmachine then it rumbled and the kettle whistled she knew nothing hed wait for the tea then take the shower uppermost in his mind were the people who had paid for his failure and how theyd be why in london should you be interested now in us and our village the boy simun translated the question put by his father penny laing answered him there were regulations in place british laws and we believe that harvey gillot conspired to breach them we have a strict policy in our country for the suppression of illegal trading in weapons and ammunition harvey gillot is a target of the agency i work for and we wish to build a picture of his operations so we begin here penny had often spoken through a third party and understood the pace she should set and the gaps she should leave they walked on the main road through the village leaving the cafe behind them in front she could see the church the crossroads the shop and little else if she had been a holidaymaker driving between two points she would have gone through it in half a minute and registered nothing the man mladen waved an arm expansively you would have wanted us all dead a question or an opinion i havent said i wanted you all dead the boys voice was quiet in her ear you wanted us dead there was a united nations embargo on weapons your government was an architect of it it decided what was best for people in croatia it made decisions on whether we should survive or whether we should be butchered and go to hidden graves if you had succeeded in the embargo my village and i would not be here i dont follow you she was flushed but not by the sun the cream had been smeared on her arms neck forehead and cheeks people didnt challenge her work in chasing down arms dealers searching out crevices in their activities exploiting them and bringing them to court you are intelligent of course you follow me there look there his thin arm reached out and the long fingers bright with artists oil colours jabbed to their right between two homes with flowers in windowboxes there was a low squat concrete shape an entryhole gaping in its side his son translated that was the command post it was where zoran our schoolteacher led the defence of our village and i was beside him we defended the village with rifles grenades and a few bombs for the antitank launcher the rpg most of those items bought in hungary by zoran before the fighting we had very little from the police because vukovar and vinkovci was more important marinci and bogdanovci were like us we defended ourselves and we kept open the cornfield road after zoran was dead i directed the defence from that bunker harvey gillot would have been a criminal to you but to us he was an angel but the weapons did not come it was thought at the time that you knew miss penny what was best for us you were very clever people and we were only simple peasants you knew it was best for us not to have the weapons that would keep back the cetniks i think perhaps you thought it best for our homes and our land to be given to the cetniks and for us to go quietly to refugee camps and not to make a bad smell in the sophistication of europe there miss penny you see the church the walls were concrete blocks and panels the tower beside the porch at the front was as high as the roof but the metal spikes that would reinforce poured concrete protruded upwards she was still stung by the blunt sarcasm with which she had been put down should she ask why the church was still being rebuilt some nineteen years after the siege of the village and twelve after its liberation she let it ride what he had said had hurt but the translation was in the flat monotone interpreters always used simun had not allowed emotion to affect his tone or the message he gave but his fingers had been soft on her skin and they stood in front of the church it is on the site of the old building under the nave there were steps down into the crypt it was used as a refuge for the wounded and the sick and it was where my wife was brought when she was in labour there were complications in the delivery of my son he was in vigorous health but my wife deteriorated the cornfield road was too dangerous for a sick woman to journey over she died there and we buried her in the night we call those missiles by their russian name malyutka and with them we could have kept open the way across the fields we had paid for them but they were not delivered the road was cut and our village could not survive nor bogdanovci our neighbour it was the death of vukovar we remember well what was done to us especially what was done to us for our own good they walked on occasionally a building was still damaged left with weeds sprouting in the cavities and saplings growing through the old floor simun murmured they had been the homes of serbs who had lived in the village before the fighting and would never come back she thought the shop from its window display was pitifully stocked and wondered what horizons were left here after the killing of harvey gillot there was a larger house grander and a fullsized madonna carved from wood and simun whispered that it was the work of the fighter who had led the resistance in bogdanovci it was mladens house simun pointed to the storks that nested on a chimney at the back huge bodies and wings tapering necks and pencil legs and said that they had stayed right through the siege his father coughed then spoke i doubt miss penny that you have fought for anything suffered for anything we have we understand what it is to fight and to suffer most of all miss penny we believe in trust and we are as loyal to the dead as we are to the living he took our money and all that was valuable to us he was given everything we had and we trusted him do you seek to interfere penny laing stood in a backwater of eastern slavonia in a far corner of croatia at the extremity of old catholic europe she was far from london and the mores of her office i do not seek to interfere but to learn it would be bad for you miss penny if our trust in you were not justified there was no cloud in the sky but she was chilled she had crossed a line and could not have explained it to those who shared her work on the alpha team neither could she have made sense of it to a weapons officer on a frigate hunting drugs smugglers in the caribbean she only knew harvey gillot from a photograph and felt shrunken and almost insignificant perhaps she had paled but simuns hand was on her elbow as if she needed to be supported she thought the death of that man was now inevitable the call came from an apartment one of the most soughtafter in the capital city that overlooked a grand square the sun shone with lateafternoon brilliance on the grass the statues and the monument to a great leader of a previous century you josip there is news no no leave the cork josip the news from london is that an attempt was made and failed for fucks sake josip how would i know im in zagreb i have had a message not a halfhour conversation it failed what happens now i wasnt told dont treat me like an idiot its accepted that you paid its on your head you advised suggested you began it youre vulnerable that too i accept what do you tell your villagers you tell them it failed and you tell them that the money they paid will be earned tell them many people in a long chain will demand it he brought the last load of clothes out through the gates he had dropped a few bits and left them in a trail from the wardrobes into the corridor across the hall and scattered on the gravel the shoes were already out in three binbags the handbags in another stacked on top of the suitcases that the police had repacked harvey gillot moved josies possessions with a sort of manic precision he would have brought the same degree of concentration to the preparation of a big deal there was no military list for his wifes clothing and accessories and he needed no enduser certificate to deliver them to the front gate but his mind kept an inventory of what he had shifted and what was yet to come the parked car was in front of him roscoe was sprawled half in and half out of the open front passenger door the girl was perched on the bonnet the burly one with the northern accent was up the lane a few paces hunkered on a stone at the side of it he thought they waited for instructions perhaps to pull out and leave him to whatever hades devils had in store or move in and set up a defensive perimeter the compromise while they waited was to be outside the gates he couldnt see roscoes gun the girls glock protruded from her handbag the heavy fellow was mopping his forehead with a handkerchief the action swung aside his jacket giving a clear view of his weapon in its holster in a different world harvey would have brought them a tray with a teapot mugs a jug of milk and a plate of biscuits they were not friends not allies and he knew they disliked him he was in no mood to placate them as he carried out the last of his wifes clothes on their hangers he made a line of them along the gates to give the effect of a football stadium where the fans had hooked their flags on to the railings harvey gillot wasnt a man to change his mind or compromise he didnt consider whether josie might come back to lulworth view when she had calmed down he knew her well enough to assess that she would not they held memories those clothes a dress she had worn a sort of mediterranean blue when they had entertained a brigadier of the sri lankan army another scarlet closefitting at the waist and flaring out at the hem had gone with a cutaway white jacket and a widebrimmed hat her choice for a hospitality lounge at cheltenham when the guests had been from the procurement section of the kuwait defence ministry a thaisilk twopiece for when they had entertained a gang of guys from belarus who had raped her with their eyes but had agreed the sale of gear that had gone to lima peru they were clothes from the old days when harvey and josie had been a team that tilted at impossible targets and hit most of them too bloody long ago the two skirts he had bought her in milan where they had been for a fair to show off italian air force surplus the winter coat with the fur collar purchased in helsinki where there had been an exhibition of body armour what he did was an act of spite all the clothing he liked had been bought before they moved to the isle of portland before he had isolated them from the world in a place where he had felt safe they watched him free country couldnt stop them he hummed as he lifted the last of the hangers his anthem nobody loves us and we dont care he knew a little of the style and ethics of protection officers perhaps once a year he would be in central london taking a client to dinner at the ritz or claridges busting open the expense account in the hope of rich reward and the guest would have them swarming on the pavement and in the lobby roscoe the girl and the big fellow would have had the training something bordering on arrogance enveloped anyone with a glock who rode in a car with a compartment for a heckler amp koch machine pistol vests and gas in the boot and a list in the front of blood groups religious affiliations and the nearest hospitals he knew these three werent bulletcatchers he doubted they reckoned it their duty to put their lives on the line if it went hard for him there were cardboard boxes in the garage and a stack of old newspapers in the tool shed he would go back in and start on the ornaments glass pottery china vases that she had accumulated over the years theyd be wrapped put in the boxes and come out of the front door across the drive and up to the gates he turned away from the watchers and went back inside he hadnt thought through the matter of his daughter fiona but hed likely lump her with her mother and the horse if he did her room would be next on the list for clearing she saw the door close heard the latch fasten and his tread fade she was short of a friend there were women at work with whom occasionally barbie went for coffee even a drink and a movie but not many the visit to the show in the west end was rare but anticipated with warm pleasure there was nobody at the store in whom she would confide not even the girls she would be with tomorrow evening it made for an enduring loneliness there was family an elder sister lived with two children no husband in lincolnshire and was close to their parents but barbie wouldnt bare her soul to any of them first she thought she would finish some ironing then wash up what was in the sink but she wasnt sure which to attack first her only friend doubling as lover and keeper was robbie cairns he had wolfed a sandwich then had walked naked into the bathroom she had heard the shower run and he had gone into their bedroom she had put his clothing into the machine and had turned the dial so that the wash would be thorough while it went through the system and then into the dryer he had slept on their bed under the coverlet a couple of times shed tiptoed to the door and peeped in there had been a sort of calm on his face she didnt start with the ironing or the washingup but went into the bedroom to straighten the sheets and bang the pillows she had no friend had there been one questions would have been asked who was he what did he do where did the money come from when was he going to out her as his girlfriend and what confused her as much as her lack of knowledge about him was his apparent indifference to her past her age he had never asked neither had he shown any interest in her family he didnt want to know what men she had been with before he had found her in fragrances she had been married her eighteen him nineteen a junior maintenance fitter at the airforce base at scampton it had lasted a week less than six months and the divorce had been through years ago she had no contact coming from the bedroom crossing the living room she paused by the window parted the lace curtains and saw him coming off the pavement and going into the road his hands were deep in his pockets his head was down and there was no spring in the step he went through the traffic and she lost him she had pretty much given up on being close to a man until this one had wandered into her life he had come with certainty had never seemed to consider that he might not be welcome there was little conversation and he might go almost an entire evening and not speak a dozen words he would nod the basics of gratitude when shed cooked and hed cleared the plate no shouting in sex and he didnt expect a grunt chorus from her most often it was television and he chose what to watch nature angling endurance all the bills were paid each week a hundred pounds in notes was left in a plain brown envelope and she was expected to shop with it she wouldnt have called him generous or tight had there been a friend and had honesty ruled between them barbie would have been hard placed to acknowledge why robbie cairns needed her in the apartment the meals were infrequent the sex was indifferent and occasional the conversation was halting but she wasnt a fool and she understood that he could not have found elsewhere the peace she had seen on his face as he slept she paused in the middle of the room and frowned her nostrils twitched petrol paraffin hed called it lighter fuel she never criticised him she wouldnt give him lip for making the room smell and the furniture who was he a criminal probably maybe a fence who received stolen goods and passed them on or a moneylaunderer the smell annoyed her and the cushions in the chair were rucked up what did he do nothing legal but also nothing that hurt because she couldnt believe him capable of that there had been peace on his face on the bed and the same peace when he slept against her his head on her breast then he was like a child she reached for the cushions to smooth them where did the money come from money from pills money from car radios that were taken but covered by insurance well not everyone was white as the driven snow and she had never had a place as nice and she lifted a cushion the light was dropping outside and heavy shadows were thrown across the room its handle was black the grip manufactured with a roughness that would make it easier to hold the trigger lever seemed huge and the hammer was depressed barbie knew little about pistols except that for gods sake the local paper in rotherhithe was full of gang shootings most were black on black most were targeted the material of the chair was cream and the weapon an ugly intruder should barbie have been shocked she was the mistress of robbie cairns who had never explained what he did she was the workhorse of robbie cairns who didnt tell her where the money came from that furnished the flat and bought the food the handgun had shocked her like a blow to the stomach where his hand rested when he was still she bent she allowed her fingers to run on the smooth metal shape and she could see the faint discoloration of the gun oil her knees weakened the cushions were on the floor she sank down and laid the pistol her lap it was a moment of enormity beyond anything she had known in her life before if a man had a pistol not a kid but a man he owned it for a purpose her manager had said in her last annual assessment that she was an employee of loyalty and intelligence did she owe loyalty to robbie cairns who had a handgun when the purpose of a handgun was to kill she was trembling and couldnt prize her hands off the gun the light failed around her she didnt know when he would come back or what she should do leanne stood behind her grandfather her hands resting on his bony shoulders granddad cairns said your sister was there lad when the police came but not uniform what your sister saw was london people and thats most likely the squad they had jackets on and its hot enough to be stripped on the beach so theres guns and the squad carry guns when you was there robbie there was no detectives no squad people no guns but there was fuckin wasps robbie stayed silent for that information your sister had to hang round the street then take a fuckin bus and a train had to show balls and she did good money was paid a good chance of a hit was there but fuckin wasps was in the way and the good chance went what about the good money robbie he didnt answer wasnt expected to a man on the other side of the continent robbie speaks to a good friend and makes a request of him and its passed on came to rest with lenny grewcock and hed heard of you so he came to us you get chosen the deal comes to us and the moneys paid what do i do robbie tell the big men that our kids no good if theres wasps robbie would have half killed vern if hed spoken to him with such contempt would have bloody near broken his fathers neck he heard out his grandfather and his sister saw his humiliation they have a crowd at the yard part of the squad supposed to protect men threatened by a contract whatll they do theyll move him there was a chance but its like the doors slammed you dont know nothing about rifles for distance and you dont know nothing about bombs for under cars what you know about is a pistol closeup in a face hell be protected and hell be moved and then fuckin hell knows how you find him you blew it kid do i go down the bank order up a draft take it round to lenny grewcocks give it him back and tell him our kids shit he thought his sister might have stood in his corner but she did not tell him our kids frightened of a fuckin wasp up his nose its a proud name is ours in rotherhithe its not fuckin laughed at it will be i reckon there are three questions for you listening he stared across the little room beyond the kitchen door a little open his grandmother would be cooking supper mostly it was stew the beef cut small for granddad cairnss teeth nothing in this room had changed since his first memories of it the same picture over the gas fire of hills in scotland bits of china plastic flowers photographs of a man in military uniform who had been his greatgrandfather and was not a great war hero but had spent most of it in the glasshouse the military detention centre at aldershot three you tell me to pay the money back i die of shame your grandmother and your father wont know you nor leanne and vern and you dont show your face in rotherhithe two you fetch the pistol bring it to me and i go and do it because youre not capable i go down where theres guns never fired one in my life and i try to do it one you finish it you go to the end of the fuckin world but you do it so he said hes done gillot is hes dead robbie saw the light come back to leannes eyes and colour flushed her face breath whistled from between his grandfathers teeth as if it had been trapped there and could now be freed he let himself out through the front door and kicked it shut after him he didnt know who had paid for the contract where the money had been raised couldnt see it in his mind not the people or the houses but he had made his call no stepping back hes done gillot is hes dead she stood in the centre of the room and gazed around her the boy translated and penny listened the man was named tomislav and she thought him a prisoner of the eightyday siege that had ended nineteen years before simuns voice was gentle in her ear and seemed to massage the words he used there were photographs of faces some from weddings some snapshots and others the staring type from official identification cards the boy pointed to them individually or gestured to groups those three they had been at the school together lived in the same road in the village worked in the same factory at vinkovci and died together the bunker was at the edge of the village on the little road to marinci and it took a direct hit a mortar they all died there the woman was going between the crypt under the church and her home when a shell from a tank landed in the street and decapitated her they had a marksman on the bogdanovci side of the village good but not as good as andrija and he killed those four men good men brave men his wife was raped after the surrender when they had finished with her she went to her home her husband had made for the cornfields but was found and shot and into the roof where there were still grenades she held one against her bosom and took the pin free penny knew where fourteen men and three women had died in the villages defence and she knew the names and occupations of the nine who had perished from disease abuse and torture in the concentration camps she saw the weapons of the village people and their attackers rifles were pointed to and she was told who had used them there were small mortars a machinegun many grenades and an rpg launcher then she was led towards the maps with the same gentleness in his voice the boy eased her forward back or to the side and turned her his fingers careful on her elbow at the maps she understood why the contract had been taken out why harvey gillot was condemned tomislav would have fired the malyutka missiles that the schoolteacher had bought he had the training from the regular army he persuaded zoran that the village would survive and the kukuruzni put would stay open if we had the malyutkas he was the expert he said the village could be saved they would have changed the battle with the malyutkas the village would have been saved tomislavs wife is in serbia and he does not know where are his children and he does not work he has only this house and these rooms and these memories she felt weakened by the driedout heat in the room the dust that had long settled the weapons and shrapnel the greyness of the paper on which the maps were printed they were near to the door she sensed that the light dropped beyond it dusk coming and the end was near of a day unlike any other in her life more portrait photographs confronted her an older man wearing a teachers gown in a formal halfprofile pose and three youngsters he was a fine and honest man he believed harvey gillot would keep his word that one the second picture he is tomislavs boy he was killed when they waited for the malyutkas to come they took off his testicles and put them in his mouth but we do not know if that was before he died or after the same with andrijas cousin and petars son do you understand i understand do you wish to see more hear more i have seen and heard enough very gravely penny laing shook tomislavs hand it had a steely strength and the lack of flesh on the fingers seemed to dig into her skin she felt almost that he thanked her for her interest there was no life in the house and the door was not closed after them they left behind them silence the sound of the dead the darkness was coming fast the boy still held her arm though she did not need guiding once she had come down the verandas steps she saw no vehicle headlights no streetlights but at the far end of the village the halfbuilt church was illuminated and the cafe showed he asked her whether she would like to go to one of the forward positions that tomislav had marked on the map for the malyutkas back in the alphateam office on whitehall in faraway london they would still be at work with their time difference and wouldnt comprehend what it was to visit a shrine to men and women killed brutally to walk in a field of ripened corn where a grave had been dug up by a ploughshare and to look down into a hole in the ground dug nineteen years before well they werent there and they knew nothing yes id like to she said very quietly there was a farm with low light over a cattle shed and tractors that threw the last shadows from the sun a field of sunflowers and a warm breeze he pointed to the defensive position from which a missile might have been fired against a tank she could hardly see her feet let alone a damn hole and his breath tasted of chewing gum when they kissed she held tight to him felt him against her wanted to kiss and be kissed and she understood why harvey gillot would die her breath slackened and she felt his tongue and those gentle fingers smoothed back her hair touching her neck where the cream had gone in her mind were images of the young who had died here of the gaunt tomislav who would have been crouching in what was little more than a shallow ditch and would have directed a bloody great missile against armour and of harvey gillot he whistled and the dog was at heel close to his leg he went out through the gates it must have been the jolt of opening it or pushing it shut but a trouser suit and a summer dress slid down and into the lane he didnt stop harvey didnt acknowledge them the one from the car roscoe jackknifed clear of the door the girl slid down from the bonnet and the big fellow pushed himself up off the stone harvey saw that roscoes hand hovered inside his jacket the girls was over the zip of her handbag and the big fellows jacket was hitched back giving a good view of the holster he didnt make eye contact as he walked past the car but he heard a stifled curse roscoes he didnt look back walked briskly and the dog too ignored them excuse me mr gillot he didnt turn his head but answered what im feeling like a spare bollock sir its not how my colleagues or i should be treated your sensitivities are pretty much bottom of my list he took a lefthand fork which would lead him towards the coastal path that went south going that way he would not pass the place where the rotten apples had been dumped beside the track he supposed he had achieved a sort of liberation didnt know how long it would last and whether once it had been lost he would be able to summon it again it was as if he had shed fear on the other side of the island in the housing estates of weston once homes to the scientists engineers and technicians of the admiralty underwater weapons establishment now closed a new beirut had been born it was said along with teenage pregnancies topping national charts there was widespread narcotics dealing and abuse harvey gillot had never used heroin cocaine or ecstasy not even smoked a joint he didnt drink to excess either he supposed he was as much under the influence of an adrenalin surge as any of the wan hooded kids who loafed in weston southwell easton and fortuneswell he didnt slow although he could hear the pound of feet behind him bloody good to have given them a finger he didnt know how long heroin cocaine or cannabis would remain in the system but knew the fear would be back not now he had packed two cardboard boxes with josies favourites and there had been a nibble from a saudibased company via email and a code signal to say that a freighter of liberian registration had slipped moorings and was now cargo aboard in the international waters of the black sea at that moment he didnt imagine that a contract killer could wound maim or kill him it wouldnt last but it was good while it did mr gillot he came through trees past high boulders and was on the path that overlooked the sea there were yachts and launches inshore and further out the car ferry heading for france beyond a couple of bulk carriers would have been going into southampton and the docks the gulls were over him circling and shouting he met ben parsons who bored for britain on the subject of a supermarket for the island listened to him and showed interest even bent to tousle the coat of the mans spaniel and after parsons and the supermarket the disaster it would be came george wilkins obsessed with the islands history harvey heard of a plan to commission a plaque commemorating jack mantle a twentythreeyearold leading seaman who had died heroically seventy years before while firing a mm antiaircraft pompom at stuka divebombers he had been awarded the victoria cross and was buried in the military cemetery overlooking the old naval base he heard wilkins out and told him it would be a valuable addition to portlands heritage normally he would not have given either man the time of day he didnt do dinner parties or christmas drinks he belonged to nothing and appeals that came to the letterbox beside the gates were shredded unopened when he walked he heard the footfall behind him when he stopped and listened to newfound friends he could hear the detectives rasped breathing and fancied the frustration burgeoned the path was open and flat and a kestrel fluttered over a field he stopped at a gate and the footsteps came close the breathing had an edge you could cooperate mr gillot should i prepare myself for another lecture on the subject of luck needing to be lucky every time and being lucky once are we winding up for a repeat performance i have a job to do and probably sergeant you would do it more effectively if your tongue stopped flapping you make it hard for me mr gillot but harder for yourself which sounds rather like something my wife might have parroted maybe read it on an agonyaunt page i am sergeant an arms dealer i buy and sell the weapons of war i have good years and bad years but i stay afloat i pay believe it or not the taxes that make up your salary your pension scheme your freebies perks and overtime rates it could be said that i own a damn great part of you sergeant through my personal efforts i have bought a big piece of mr roscoe you are a public servant get that into your head and scrub out of it that i owe you a bunch of flowers and a basket of gratitude it was as if another dose of the narcotic was flowing through his veins he closed the field gate after him and set off across the dried ground sparse grass towards the water trough where the horse was might have been a pony for all harvey knew it might have been a donkey or one of those mules highvalue animals that had lugged the crates protecting the blowpipes over the mountains and through the passes of afghanistan in the good old days whatever his daughter loved it more fervently than she loved him and it cost a mint in veterinary fees and fodder it had a foul temper and was likely as not to bite him its name was norah he was unsure of its age and it lived in this rented field in the summer months and at a livery stables in winter it was brown with white patches and eyed him as malevolently as he reckoned the detective did but it wore a headcollar the leading rope was hooked on the fence by the water trough and he unfastened it felt quite pleased with himself a shortarm lunge and he had the halter attached to the headcollar he reckoned he was now on the way to saving the rental on the field he left the gate open behind him the dog went ahead he led the horse or pony and the detective was behind the gold group was gathered at a table phoebe bermingham gold commander would have hoped for a consensus would bite and kick to avoid making the decision herself on her pad she had doodled around the name harvey gillot what to do and resources and budget and options options options were fiercely underlined she sensed correctly that few medals were on offer in the case of a man showing pigignorant obstinacy she would use a pencil to indicate who should speak next it pointed at the covert expert from scd the answer i have checked rosters put simply we dont have what it would need i have people away on two narcotics scenes on the south coast and unrelated and i have to supply antiterrorism with most of the rest the property in question has a front and a back and is close to a caravan park it would require more bodies than i have its properly done or not at all sorry but i cant help the pencil moved on to intelligence scd we dont have a line as yet maam to an individual i have no names and no organisation we need much more before we can make an identification negative cant be anything else and on the sharpened lead aimed at firearms co i have a flat refusal from the natives at the seaside not prepared to get themselves into an openended commitment to do the job from london would require a deployment of sixteen officers a command structure and a communications setup were not in the marketplace for that apologies maam but we have to live in the real world she came to the inspector from the specialist squad the one that had a workload so narrowly defined that it made her nervous we have roscoe in place and two others there has regretfully been something of a breakdown in communications and theyre outside the propertys boundaries as is pretty much routine theyre carrying hand weapons but not heavier stuff and they dont have backup i have to say that the report of the attack indicates an unprofessional approach i dont understand why i would suggest a very limited time span of protection perhaps twentyfour hours no more the pencil was directed at the leader of the alpha team our penny laing is on the ground in croatia everyone is very frank and upfront with her yes there is a contract an expensive one money has been paid and they believed theyd hired a good and efficient man harvey gillot is condemned because he took an initial bagful of money quasivaluables and property deeds he didnt deliver and didnt return what hed been paid which would have been difficult as the village was virtually isolated by a murderous enemy and its defences were about to collapse the pencil tip rapped on the table the sharpened lead broke off phoebe bermingham gold commander said im having difficulty getting my head round the situation that existed there where exactly the place is what they were fighting about ive asked around too many shrugged shoulders and too many thats the balkans isnt it i find this matter irksome and timeconsuming do i need further contributions heads shook there were no offers a reason for her rapid advancement up promotion ladders was her ability to read a situation and judge an audience in summary then we do not have the resources here or locally to mount close protection on this man he has been offered expert advice and relocation help and has with stubborn consistency refused it so as has been recommended and not disputed he should be warned that after twentyfour hours an armed guard will be withdrawn she breathed in hard she might have taken the most momentous decision of her fasttrack career a reputation for being handsoff and avoiding responsibility for unpredicted events was in shreds if a body bled from gunshot wounds on a pavement a roadway a drive or in a living room she would be called to account have it made plain to him that after a day and a night the twentyfour hours we are not beside behind and in front of him hes on his own roscoe took the call he said into his mobile encrypted hes along with the best for rude boorishness about as unpleasant as it comes full of shit but im thinking this is a show thats being put on for me where am i now on the coast path and were doing a scenic walk the dog has just crapped and the sea looks fantastic and the whole place is a postcard were bringing a horse back from a field i dont know why we went to collect it or where were taking it im not in the loop and im unrated as a needtoknow friend we dont talk yes fine shoot it im telling you itll be a somewhat abrupt response twentyfour hours yes and the clock starts ticking when i tell him yes is the plan that this staggering piece of information will knock him so far off kilter that hell be begging for protection guvnor i dont want to be a pooper but ill just get an earful no guvnor im fine and itll be done he put the mobile back in his pocket they turned off the coast path into the lane the hoofs rattled and gillot hadnt turned seemed to have forgotten roscoe was there ahead was the car suzie beside it and bill behind in front of it was a woman a huge bag slung over a shoulder quite a goodlooking woman but not dressed for the coastal path or for an office casual clothes that tried to make a statement and she was burrowing in the bag he thought it peculiar that neither suzie nor bill had reacted roscoe flicked back the jacket by the top button and the weight of the keys in his pocket took it far enough not to snag him as he reached for the glock she brought out a bullhorn not an rpg a kalashnikov or a baikal firing mm softnose bullets he was confused he didnt understand why suzie and bill hadnt gone for their weapons he didnt think harvey gillot had noticed her it came with a blast as if the volume was tweaked up harvey gillot is a merchant of death harvey gillot is a merchant of death harvey gillot is a merchant of death could have woken the dead in the chapels ruined graveyard megs behan shouted on harvey gillots hands is childrens blood on harvey gillots hands is childrens blood on harvey gillots hands is childrens blood she gagged for breath she had been on picket lines her hips pressed hard into crash barriers by the weight of bodies behind her and she had bawled the same slogans different then there had been a cacophony of sound in her ears and around her the true believers harvey gillot trader in misery harvey gillot trader in misery harvey gillot trader in misery she was level with him might have been five or six feet from him the horse he was leading shied and he hung on to the rope fastened to its headcollar the dog should have lunged for her maybe it was deaf because its tail wagged and its tongue hung from its mouth in a lather of saliva when she was shouting she heard the perky little cries of songbirds the wind in the trees above the lane and distantly the rush of broken waves on rocks stones whatever was there shame on you harvey gillot killer of babies shame on you harvey gillot killer of babies shame on you harvey gillot killer of babies she had arrived had parked her bag by her ankles she had gazed mystified at the clothes draped over the gates and the piled suitcases it had been later than she had intended but the delayed train was followed by a cancelled bus then a traffic snarl after a road accident a little of her enthusiasm had dribbled away and she was hungry thirsty tired and in need of a shower she had rung the bell at the gates and had not been answered then the girl had wandered to her from the car had flashed the id card and asked what business brought her here she had expected then to be given the boot with defiance she had been chattering about legal and peaceful protest and the rights of the individual on a public highway the policewoman had grimaced and her lips had moved in near silence she might have said please yourself sunshine the stage is yours the guy big heavy built sweating rivers had called across the road that gillot had taken the dog for a walk the police attitude further flustered her they were from everything she rated sacred in alliance with the dealers in death she had asked of course why the clothing was on the gate smart jackets and dresses and blouses and coats far beyond her range and inclinations but it might have suited her two sistersinlaw there had been grim smiles and she had not been enlightened so she had steeled herself and waited and had heard the rhythmic beat of a horses hoofs she had seen him filthy looked as if he had slept in those clothes lost his razor looked pretty bloody ordinary or like a derelict from hackney pentonville or the caledonian road now he stared at her as if she had come from under a stone she lifted the bullhorn harvey gillot dealer in murder guilty harvey gillot dealer in murder guilty harvey gillot dealer in murder guilty she hammered it into his face but he didnt blink the horse strained and the dog sniffed her jeans she felt anger rising because she had won no response felt cheated too that the police had not intervened to protect him and shortchanged because there was no crowd at her back and her denunciations had gained no audience she was asked her name she spat it at him and that of the organisation she was proud to belong to his voice was calm as if emotion had drained away through a muslin cloth right miss behan where you fit into this game i havent a clue but probably nowhere its a bad day for me my wife has left home after eighteen years of partially successful marriage and will be back shortly to collect her stuff she has left home because i accused her of getting herself fucked by our jobbing gardener and also because she drowned him full volume harvey gillot merchant of death harvey gillot killer of babies harvey gillot trader in misery harvey gillot dealer in it was a fast short jab from a stubby fist it was not aimed at her face but at the side of the bullhorn the blow was strong enough to break her grip it would have been a triumph major proportions if the fist had caught her chin lip or teeth but she was denied it the bullhorn fell on the lane bounced settled in nettles she saw that the police had straightened and knew none would intervene in defence of a dropped bullhorn still quiet still a voice that sounded reasonable my wife was fucking the gardener which was one reason she thought it right to leave home but she wanted to go too because my life is now out to tender got me miss behan theres a contract and a mans been hired to do the business which is to kill me simple enough for you miss behan to shoot me he tried this morning while i took out the dog and my wife did the foreplay with the gardener tried and failed sorry and all that miss behan i expect it would have made your day to get down here and find police tape and a tent with my feet sticking out under the side half the worlds snappers and me cold stiff and dead he fired twice and missed twice bad luck for you miss behan she didnt bend to pick it up her voice was almost reedy pretty pathetic without the amplification but she cupped her hands over her lips for the megaphone effect harvey gillot merchant trader dealer in death misery do us all a favour go down to the beach and keep walking you are a dealer in evil a purveyor of destruction you are a man came here to my home and waited outside my gates he had a pistol i thought it a baikal mm a conversion job it starts off as a teargas gun on the same lines as the makharov the conversion is done in lithuania and hed have used softnose bullets thats dumdum and he was at pointblank range i was half on the ground and a wasp went up his nose he missed twice youre small beer miss behan less important to me than the wasp you want to stand out here make an idiot of yourself do it see if anyone notices you miss behan and i doubt they will for me getting shot at is higher up the ladder of my concerns than you are youre not even on the first rung she remembered he led the horse away from her and the dog gambolled at his side the policeman who must have walked with him hurried past her and chased gillot towards the gates she remembered a phone call her hammering the keyboard stressed at the pressrelease deadline harvey gillot im a freelancer have you an address for him to get me started remembered it well no contact name or number excuse enough that she had been busy she shouted dealer in death harvey gillot trader in misery harvey gillot blood on your hands harvey gillot the gates closed on them her throat was hoarse she didnt know what a baikal pistol looked like or indeed whether a bullet wound in a body was clean or messy bloody or of geometric precision to bring purpose to her life she must crouch put her hands on the bullhorn lift it and use it roscoe said were prepared to give you twentyfour hours mr gillot to put your affairs into some sort of order and then to move out have we not had this conversation you will have protection for that number of hours theyve started and then protection will be withdrawn am i permitted to comment why not the woman was on the bullhorn as repetitive and tedious as before and as lightweight roscoe would have admired a silent protest one without the bucketload of cliche he had done enough publicorder events before he went to cid and then the flying squad to recognise that most protesters were brimful of passion and ideology just short of good scriptwriters he had no objection to her being where she was only wished shed freshen up her text its bullshit thats neither sensible sir nor rational bullshit and thats polite he didnt argue he supposed he should relay what the gold group had passed down he suzie and bill would do relays of sleep and observation from the car he looked at his wristwatch twentythree hours and fiftyseven minutes remained he wondered if an officer with greater seniority would arrive to read a riot act towards the end but thought it unlikely he would have liked to say from our brief acquaintance mr gillot i see you as a man of stubbornness and rudeness without decency manners or concern for others your money is earned from a trade that most rightminded folk would regard as disgusting bordering on immoral dont expect me to volunteer for duty standing in front of you and if youre going to get yourself shot would you please ascertain that im off duty at the time not on my watch he didnt say it his tone tried to placate you leave us with very little option but to if my wife comes you can help her with the clothes and tell her that her junks in the boxes the horse will be inside the gate and hopefully itll find a good feed off the roses thank you but no i can manage her boxes the gate was opened a winter coat and a summer jacket fell from their hangers the horse was taken inside let loose and the dog ran towards the house its movement activated the security lights roscoe couldnt recall when he had hated a job as much as this one chrissie used to say it would take bubonic plague to keep him off work gillot carried a cardboard box through the gates the size a houseremoval company would use when he dumped it roscoe heard china break the woman megs behan was still bawling her message a second box was brought out and put down heavily he would have liked to say i tell you mr gillot its not easy to be lucky every time and you as a broker in weapons will know what they do to the human body that they dont kill as prettily as the films would have us believe it hurts and its ugly as youll find out if you stop being lucky but im sure you know all that mr gillot he waited till gillot was pulling shut the gates well see you in the morning sir the man smiled did it well a good day dear not bad thank you drunk too much some but not too much it was a ritual deirdre had driven the land rover from their home to shrewsbury station and met benjie off the train she asked the same questions as she pulled out of the forecourt and received the same answers then moved on to the business particular to that day the hip what was the verdict not too bad quite a good prognosis the visit to the monstrosity as she always called vbx had that been satisfactory alastairs done very well and sends regards hell go a long way he told me the story and the opinion is that our sad asset is now in considerable manure sort of business where the past comes along fast in the outside lane when least expected hes not going to have protection and denys foster the lunch guest had he been able to oil the waters i think so yes he did we talked of blowback something exploding in your face and then we did a bit of old testament they sow the wind they shall reap the whirlwind and i think denys stiffened my spine quite successfully he told me what i should tell gillot ill call him in the morning youre at the heart of this benjie yes sadly my dear you are correct your suggestion to him that he should move the stuff on dump those villagers in line with policy and putting more money in his pocket but correct again and it bothers you a little lets move on they discussed back to their more normal routine the grandchildren that nights supper and which bottle theyd open to drink with it in the hotel dining room william anders and daniel steyn had a view from their table that took in the river the snaking barges going upstream the illuminated white cross the hotels lawns and patio where a few still sat and gossiped the car park and the glass doors at the rear of the building anders chuckled a very serious lady and no doubt behaving out of character steyn grinned grimaced shell make a good feed for a toyboy they saw the woman blouse and jeans head down shades worn in spite of the darkness she came across the patio and between the tables using a route that skirted the lights a boy held her hand but was led miss penny laing i believe far from home and further from the worlds realities that daniel is pretty judgemental and expresses bill my acute jealousy of the boy who i seem to recognise as the son of the capo of that village and a pusher of pills on a minor scale he is i wager doing a good job of guiding people get caught up here strangers and all about a feeling of guilt correct werent here didnt know the ignorance makes guilt and opens the legs they were both laughing coarse from the belly and daniel poured more wine good from the ilok vineyards his mobile rang and he answered it listened impassive he thanked the caller and shut his phone that village the process you started bill they did the contract and bought the hit there was a target this morning in england it failed not the end of the story who told you funny old place this hear all sorts dont ask not the end of the story because money was paid hell go again has to you know about the first battalion of the ninth marines bill who had the heaviest casualties of the entire corps during the vietnam war got themselves called the walking dead thats a good name for harvey gillot and its a bit down to you but dont lose sleep are you suggesting id lie awake because some weapons peddler gets zapped and i helped the process along if the hit screwed up then im sorry and its that which might affect my sleep i hope they go again they drank and the woman and her boy were gone the peal of the alarm clock was followed by a jabbing elbow that broke into benjie arbuthnots sleep deirdre said youve a call to make would he argue with her at thirtyone minutes past six in the morning would he request tea first yes dear of course and dont prattle tell him straight he crawled from the bed slipped on an old dressinggown cotton light bought at a street market in buenos aires when hed been building bridges in the mideighties and shuffled out of the bedroom early sunlight streamed through the windows of the old gamekeepers lodge to which he was now in retirement banished his son daughterinlaw and grandchildren lived in the big house and farmed the land it was a long time since he had stood on the quayside of a harbour in croatia as a freighter had edged closer to shore responsibility he had always fought tooth and claw to avoid the suffocation of it but he had had a bad night and deirdre would have recognised it so he was pushed from his bed and sent to clear his very slight conscience he had the number in his study not quite a trophy room but there were photographs on the walls of the young benjie in a sports team at school another of his class at the royal military academy and a couple of him in camouflage fatigues with his troop and their ferret scout cars on the inner german border and in south armagh more of deirdre and himself in the argentinian capital in damascus and peshawar but little that gave an indication of life after the cavalry did he do responsibility barely a small photograph hung discreetly almost out of sight behind the curtains the swiss had made an excellent mm rapidfire antiaircraft weapon the oerlikon and it had been thought useful in the early s to get a few down to the sultanate of oman without the stigma of overt uk association a tried and trusted conduit had been used he stood beside solly lieberman the former cavalry officer and the former invasionlandingbarge crewman the muscled and wellproportioned briton with the nearemaciated american the photograph had been taken by deirdre at the factory gate in zurich and stop faffing about and get on with it she shouted from above responsibility the word was a stranger to him benjie arbuthnot had employed many assets and some would have died after interrogation and torture by hanging or firing squad most would now have drifted into old age and eked out their remaining years some would have been handed on to new station officers and remained active now he would be hard put to name the majority but solly lieberman had a place of honour in his memory he had been at the funeral interdenominational and sparing with religion had stood at the back and slipped out before harvey gillot the lady who ran the office a bank manager a solicitor an accountant and a landlord had made their way down the chapels aisle what had he admired most the sheer brass and anarchy of little solly and the harvey gillot had had solly liebermans accolade old habits died hard he unlocked a drawer at his desk opened it showed a shoebox full of mobile phones payasyougo and disposable flat battery of course he plugged one into the mains then dialled when it had been used it would be thrown into the depths of the lake in front of the big house and allowed to settle into thick silt me here no names friend what sort of bloody time is this its a fine morning and late enough i thought youd call me last night been fretting yes and im entitled to how are you on taking advice i have good days and bad three police outside the gates are offering me advice wrapped with ribbons that im declining to them im obstinate stubborn an imbecile and theyre probably right from you im open to advice he was already dressed yesterdays clothes and had washed but not shaved the house empty but for the dog had seemed a cold desolate place during the night did he want her back it was empty and sad he held the phone to his ear stood in the living room and watched the horse i take it as read that you wont be crawling into a hole hiding there no and cant wait around at home do the funeral arrangements and check the will the police say theyll withdraw protection this evening and what do you say im working on it ready for advice the horse grazed the lawn not that the gardeners mower had left much for it to feed on the geranium beds were wrecked and it had tugged at the low branches of some shrubs there were a couple of minimountains of its business on the patio and the neatness outside was history not going to gild it i doubt you ever did harvey gillot thought his irony was wasted you have to face up how you have to confront it where do i face up and confront it there has to be what do i do there sorry i dont know but if you dont go there youll be a fugitive for the rest of your days im not big on religion and doubt you are but bits stick from childhood st john the baptist said bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance the big word repentance a gesture from matthew three verse eight are you with me i seem to remember from schooldays that john the baptist at the behest of a dancing girl had his head chopped off and served up on a salad plate and i dont do penance im saying you have to go there and sort out your goddamn problem because the alternative is the hole in the ground and looking over your shoulder face it and confront it is that for real for real you dont have a rucksack of options where would you be not too far behind you for my sins there and thereabouts how was it last night pretty bloody it would have been the horse but the outside security lights had been on for most of the time the beast had moved through the shrubs wheezing and there had been its hoofs on the patio and the dog had been restless hed hardly slept big in his head awake or dozing were the balaclava and the dark shape of the gun the aim as it tried to lock and it will be as bad as bloody or worse you have to face it and confront it ill just harvey paused his mind was deadened and he couldnt summon the clarity to think and decide he still held the phone to his ear but his attention was on the sea the expanse of it typical he thought from what he remembered of arbuthnot that there was no interruption no nagging for him to speak he didnt know what would be there or who he did know that life as a fugitive was not acceptable there was a man hed met at british aerospace whose wife had had terminal cancer shed been offered the big treatments had reflected and declined she had died sooner but with her own hair and without the pain of the chemo sessions face it and confront it i dont know how it will be harvey gillot said into the phone time enough to find out he said he would try to start out that night and was now stumbling over the words the enormity of it hit him and benjie arbuthnot was muttering on a bad line about blowback and gillot had as little idea of what that meant as he did about penance but he saw a head taken off at the neck on a salver with lettuce cucumber and tomato the gate bell rang he ended the call how did it play deirdre asked will do what he was told advised to do she gazed quizzically at her husband she had been thought by those who knew her as a service wife to be devoid of sentiment are you killing him i might be i dont know i hope im giving him life the arrival of the delivery van and the opening of the gates would have woken the woman outside shaken her and she stood with the bullhorn raised the package was handed to gillot he checked the identity was satisfied and wrote his name with the stylus offered him he saw that roscoe was close behind the detective had the flushed look that came from tiredness and his trousers were creased but he had shaved the deliveryman walked away and gillot thought he must have been puzzled to be greeted by an armed police check and a lone demonstrator he thought that they would have kept a battery razor in the car and the girl detective would have a spare pair of knickers at the bottom of the bag under the glock he was asked if he could identify the packages contents and told roscoe he had ordered a bulletproof vest he didnt mention the sprays he expected it and was rewarded a dry smile from roscoe arid as the desert in saudi the woman was shrieking same hymn book same slogans through the gate and up the lane gillot saw denton the neighbour the man stood in a dressinggown and made a theatrical pose of holding his hands over his ears gillot thought that others would be behind their kitchen doors or their front window curtains listening to the din she made and taking in her message he left the package by the front door walked towards the gates and saw the other two detectives clamber fast from the car he went past them past the woman trying to ignore the noise and up to denton i just wanted to thank you a snort im hardly about to express gratitude to you that noise half last night and now again its intolerable its i wanted to thank you because i think you saved my life did i he had never been into dentons house denton had never been invited into gillots he smiled sweetly the salesmans smile you dumped your rotten apples beside the track and couldnt be bothered to compost them yourself im so pleased you were too lazy to dispose of them properly if you ever used the track which you dont youd know wasps have nested alongside a good food source a man stood there yesterday morning with the intention of shooting me dead sadly for him happily for me he disturbed the nest and as he aimed and fired a couple of those horrible things were crawling round the slits of his mask indirectly denton you saved my life well done and thank you he kept the smile locked on his face the sincere one he saved for signing contracts and flattering ministry people was he taking the piss was there a word of truth in what hed said that woman kept georgina and me up half the night calls you an arms dealer is that true does it matter true then we never knew we didnt know that a man in that trade lived beside us in our church weve collected for the victims of conflict in central africa and others caught up in wars that are virtually sponsored for the financial gain of individual arms dealers have you no shame very little i see that mrs gillot has understandably had enough of married life under the same roof as you and gone what youve done with her clothing is a disgrace he didnt do the old routine about if i dont then someone else will or everything i sell is quite legally handled or i pay my taxes just like you do or i bring the chance of freedom to many oppressed people who have the right to lift off the yoke of dictatorship and can only do it by putting their lives on the line and fighting he turned his back the bullhorn barked behind him he was stained with childrens blood a trader in misery a killer of babies and a dealer in murder he wondered if she too had clean knickers to slip on and if she did not would the detective have an extra pair to loan her at the gates gillot told roscoe of his plans for the day first a walk with the dog then to weymouth then to a school then he saw astonishment crease roscoes face i was about to think mr gillot that you were going to do something forgive me sensible wrong again and something rational doomed to disappointment he heaved the package inside and saw that the horse had now destroyed the prize display the bedding plants that had to be watered every twentyfour hours and were nigels pride and joy he kicked the door shut and went to feed the dog news travelled roscoe called his boss had him dragged from the shower and told him what hed learned the boss messaged the coordinator of gold group some on their way to work some still at home some already at their desks all learned what harvey gillot had said to mark roscoe some would shake their heads in astonishment others would ejaculate an obscenity at his idiocy a few would hear it in silence and feel relief at the potential to lose a problem the line manager of the alpha team was among those the coordinator rang he tapped out the numbers for a call to an encrypted mobile penny laing reached across him allowed a breast to brush his face a nipple against his lips grinned then lifted her mobile she depressed a key and listened the grin was wiped the boy wriggled into a position where he could nip her but she swatted him he must have caught her mood because he lay back on the pillow she made a silent gesture prodded him and pointed to the bedside fitment where a hotel pad and pencil lay he passed them she had the pencil poised over the paper he giggled and she reached out her free hand to stifle the sound that almost assured him of his momentary power over her and he wriggled some more was almost under her pushing at her legs parting them then would have seen the panic on her face and came out from under her he took the free hand and laid it on his belly what to do her line manager was at home about to leave for the alphateam office she left her fingers where they were and worked the nails into the hair they would sack her if they knew she could fight it and have the detail of her stand with a lover barely out of school laid out before a tribunal or she could go quietly and have a career blown it had been good she listened and wrote one word on the pad gillot and asked the obvious question why had she known about a failed hit of course not her line manager told her of a shooting a murder attempt close to the tangos home then the road to damascus business and the decision as relayed to a police protection team to travel she expressed astonishment at news of the attack gulped at news of the journey and the boys hand wandered over the equivalent part of her stomach so good penny laing didnt tell her line manager that the previous evening she had skipped supper had stripped naked showered had been with a boy on her hotel bed and the first of the two condoms she always kept in the zipped pouch of her bag had just gone on him when his mobile had rung and the stroking teasing kissing had been on hold while he had answered the call from his father he had been told had rung off she had opened herself wide for him hadnt for months not since a frigate had sailed from portsmouth dockyard and he had whispered it in her ear then thrust was she achieving anything she let her teeth grate her line manager waited for an answer her hand was around the boy and his finger was inside her and her breathing was harder to control and she said she believed she was moving towards better understanding of the events of november she was asked to report more fully within an hour by which time her line manager would be safely off his train and in his cubicle alongside the alpha work area she ended the call they squirmed together and she stopped him two condoms ribbed already flushed down the toilet and she had no more she wondered if he would sulk he pushed her head down so that her lips went over his chest and ribcage the hard stomach and into the hair and so good had he learned this from a peasant girl a teenager or from a widow or divorcee with experience she should have felt at least ten years older than him control and domination and did not when they had finished and she had gone to the bathroom rinsed her mouth brushed her teeth and lost the taste of him she said that gillot was travelling to vukovar incredulity spread on the young face with the perfect skin he went limp and was off the bed picking up his scattered clothing and starting to dress penny laing watched him and thought she grasped the enormity of the step she had taken he always had breakfast none of the subordinates who had ever worked under the direction of william anders on a gravesite could claim to have seen him vomit what he had eaten some starved themselves before work whether it was at excavation stage or merely the search with the geophysics for the telltale signs of disturbed soil he ate heartily rolls coffee a cake and an omelette filled with chopped ham he saw his driver and waved then wiped his mouth and saw the couple almost furtive not having the cover of dusk that had aided their discretion the previous evening they came past him if the woman the english customs officer had recognised him she gave no sign of it he chuckled he sat at the side of the patio and had a good view of them in profile and would have liked daniel to be beside him for a psychologists pitch on a relationship that would be for her fraught with danger william anders knew plenty of the culture of law enforcement had worked with the men and women engaged in it often enough to understand what made them tick he had heard it expressed frequently that friendships and relationships should be tribal that straying outside the reservation was neither clever nor satisfactory god what a boring fart he was becoming the woman had the look of a wellbedded female and her head was ducked but even so she had the defiance streak daubed large the boy well he shambled beside her would be going home no doubt to a scout knife and would carve a notch on his bedpost next time he met up with daniel he would put battlefield romance on the agenda he admitted it to himself came clean he was struggling to contain raw jealousy she was a finelooking woman and strode ahead of the boy who now had a mobile phone at his face to unlock a little hire car she would have thought it anders reckoned an uncomplicated fling he doubted that what had been the pillow talk always was pillow talk he watched them go then went to meet his driver who would take him for another days digging and searching he believed in what he did thought the past should not be permitted to fade from sight it was accountable as men were for a lifetime and not for a day no time limit on retribution should be handed out whenever as long as it damn well took at his home in the village josip answered a call from simun he wrote rapidly took down an itinerary he felt like a swimmer failing in open seas until a rope was thrown he who was listened to but unloved had created the idea and sent the principals of the village to the banks money had been withdrawn and perhaps had been squandered he ended the call lit a cigarette poured more coffee and reached again for his phone josip called zagreb he spoke respectfully to a man who lived in an apartment that overlooked the trg kalija tomislava through the trees the man would have had a view of the statue of a nineteenthcentury king all powerful in his time as was this man today the tentacles from zagreb flexed reached out and a call was made to a man of influence in warsaw who spoke to an associate in the german port city of hamburg through the tentacles news was passed that harvey gillot on whom a contract was taken and a man hired to enforce it would travel from london to a town on the danube vukovar from the blankenese suburb of hamburg where another man of authority and wealth oversaw an empire a message was sent in partial coding to lenny grewcock who took a healthdominated breakfast in a north london hotel grewcock said the little bastards lucky to get a chance and hell take it if he doesnt his familys history and hes set in hardening concrete he took the money there was talk between them of the importance of munich in this matter but also of a fallback further down the journeys line then chat about the weather eventually before he returned to his yoghurt and cereal lenny grewcock made a last call and the chain was complete all done fast and done because men had trusted each others judgement and recommended the last call forging the link was to the grandfather of robbie cairns through the night he had watched over her he had laid her on the bed and removed some of her outer clothing as if that might make her more comfortable then he had pulled up a chair the one on which he usually laid his trousers shirt and underwear when he went to bed with her he had held barbies hand at first it had been warm but the flesh against his had cooled only when it had chilled had robbie cairns laid it beside her leg the dawn had come up and light had pierced the halfdrawn curtains then robbie had seen the pallor of her face the cheeks the angry colours distorted red weals and purple bruising at her throat there were no scratch marks on his face she had not fought him he had come into the room and she had been sitting on the settee with the pistol in both hands the barrel pointing at the ceiling the trigger guard below her fingers she had seemed bemused almost in shock by what she had found the questions had come with persistence and her voice had grown louder with each of his refusals to answer why was it there what did he have a pistol for it smelt when had it been fired if it had been fired who had it been fired at robbie could have lied could have said it wasnt a big deal and shrugged it off minding it for a friend getting rid of it in the morning could have said he was doing a friend a favour a shortterm one he hadnt lied and hadnt answered he had reached out his hands intending to take it from her but she had shoved it behind her back and his hands had kept coming she had said i dont ask questions gods truth i dont but this is too far how am i supposed to turn my back on a loaded pistol thats been fired and youve that stink on you petrol i read the papers robbie so i know that petrols used to block gunfire traces on skin i thought you might have been a bit well a bit dodgy but not guns im going sorry and all that first thing robbie im going to lower road im going to the police and hed thought she meant it it would have been for her a fiveor sixminute walk down the road and past the station past the old dock offices that were now a training centre then the left into lower road and past the pub be up the steps and at the front inquiry desk hed thought she meant it because her voice wasnt raised his hands had gone forward to her throat he wasnt sure then now if he closed his fingers to stop her going to the police station in the morning or just to stop the flow of what she said she might have kicked might have tried to bite his hands didnt use her nails as if she didnt want to save herself or didnt want to hurt him it had taken three or four minutes would have been longer if shed fought him he had killed men but always with pistol shots he had never knifed or manually strangled someone he had never slapped kicked or punched a woman he had thought in the night as she had gone colder and the marks on her throat did not dull that leanne would turn her back on him vern would spit at him his dad would strike him and his grandfather would raise devils against him the phone in his pocket had rung it had been a long night and the quiet was broken now by the traffic on the roundabout at the bottom of needleman street and at the top of surrey quays road he had answered the phone listened cut the call he went about his business took trouble to wipe down the surfaces and use damp cloths with the stuff she had to wash the basin the toilet the sink and the cooker he did it in the knowledge that his dna would linger he didnt know where he could go to gain an alibi for that he needed a friend he left the curtains as they had been through the night but light settled on her face it couldnt quieten her throats colours the pistol went into his pocket and he closed the front door behind him walked from the block and headed for the albion estate behind him the front door was open he looked once at the horse it was still foraging among the garden plants and waved the dog back towards the house they had been for a walk together almost together roscoe had been a couple of paces behind gillot and the dog and bill had been another twentyfive paces back there were uniforms now at the lanes approach to the house he had thought it a pretty walk not taxing enough for himself and chrissie but there had been stretches where the low cliffs coves and narrow beaches had been good to look at twice as the kestrels had hovered over cropped grass he had had to give himself a mental kicking and remember what his work was no threat on any horizon suzie in the night when they had done the stag together had had her laptop open and talked to him about the history of the island from what shed read so roscoe knew which ships from previous centuries had been wrecked on those reefs and on the pebble beach how many had drowned and which quarries had supplied the clean white stone for the cemeteries in flanders fields away to his right as they had walked towards the lighthouse he had seen the former naval research base where harry houghton and ethel gee had stolen secrets and he knew the histories of the various lighthouses the first one erected close to three hundred years before they had walked to a great overhanging stone at the extremity of the bill the pulpit rock almost at the house gillot had turned and made a hand gesture as if to summon roscoe to his side roscoe had to bite his wellchewed lower lip to stop himself erupting in protest or ignoring the bastard he had been told the tangos movements for the day and had thought them imbecile when there would have been a threehour flight direct into osijek the word penance had been used with a loose grin and some sort of gibberish about a blowback but that hadnt concerned him he had written the itinerary in his notepad then waved bill forward the big fellow had jogged to his shoulder and they had done the tandem thing roscoe had called in had given the times and the connections they would go straight into the lap of the gold group coordinator when they came round the corner the woman had started up quite a good soul actually nice funny warm shed spent part of the night with suzie in the car stretched out on the back seat practically a hanging offence as far as metropolitan police service regulations went he had no quarrel with her none of them did and shed made them laugh with good anecdotes of protest lines theyd done a tradeoff megs behan would have part of the back seat and shed close down on the slogans so they could doze and she was up harvey giliots nose no call to pick a quarrel with her he knew the saying might have been arabic or chinese that went the enemy of my enemy is my friend the door was open behind him he was called back on the mobile and was given his instructions he was too tired to bitch and said what time he thought theyd be in london he went to megs behan and she lowered her bullhorn hed thought from the last blast not that it mattered now that the battery was flattening mark roscoe committed a worse offence than allowing an unauthorised civilian to snooze in the car but the discipline culture had never burrowed into his guts he told her where gillot was travelling to and saw her face lighten he didnt tell her the schedule then he waited harvey gillot wolfed another chocolate biscuit he had removed the hard drives from his computers in the office had made the bed neatly in the spare room where he had slept had left the carpet rolled back in the principal bedroom so that it was easy to see the floor safe was open and empty had poured some dog meal into the tin bowl then had hitched up the rucksack of his clothes and what little he would journey with there was a mirror in the hallway and he checked himself clean clothes the dirty ones dumped in the bin good shoes for offroad walking he was wellshaven no cuts his hair was combed and he had dabbed on a little aftershave larger of course heavier in the chest and the upper stomach a few who were familiar with him would have thought harvey gillot had binged maybe food maybe alcohol maybe steroids he wore a blue shirt a silk tie and a lightweight jacket in his mind was the list of things he had to do the dog the travel agent the solicitor the school and the text he sent it a last look at the mirror was satisfied lifting the dogs lead down from the hook when the call came charles the sales manager how was he doing very nicely thank you all looks pretty sunny from where i stand what can i do for you charles did he remember what they had talked about remember it very well charles you about to tell me that the tailgate on the lorry wasnt fastened properly did he not know of the global ravages of the credit crunch cancellations had he not heard of them i think id be interested at a decent price charles told him we might have to do a bit better than that charles difficult times and all that they haggled the sales manager flogging military communications equipment suitable for a brigadesized force in the field and with total encryption came down two per cent and harvey gillot came up one per cent it was a nice little deal he could put out of his mind the dog the travel agent the solicitor and the school and focus on brokering already his head was filled with the possibilities of where that equipment would be wanted where conflict was about to flare where there was money and demand he did a little dance a few steps then called the dog he waved to the horse he thought the garden was too destroyed to be repaired for the rest of the summer the lawn would have been in better shape if it hadnt been for the automatic sprinkler system fitted the previous year it had softened the grass table so the hoof indentations were deeper the flowerbeds were buggered and it was a vigorous wave for the horse he took the audi out of the garage drove up to the gates and zapped them then went out into the lane some coats and a couple of dresses would have gone under the wheels gillot didnt acknowledge his onlookers the woman with the bullhorn wasnt there but the three detectives were close to their car the engine running and the doors open he left his own turning over and walked back to the dog closed the gates on the horse then crouched down and ruffled the fur at the dogs collar he said some quiet things and got his ear washed by the tongue that had been scooping up shit on the walk he walked the dog on the lead to dentons house pretty as a postcard with climbing roses opened the gate to the front path pushed the dog in dropped the food bag beside it and bawled towards an open window that josie would be along soon he had gone before the door opened he drove away he fiddled with the dashboard turned up the airconditioning but was still sweating who loved him nobody who was his friend nobody there was a bus stop on the far side of the road to the museum and the woman was there quite attractive if she did something about herself he didnt wave and didnt consider offering her a lift roscoe and his people were behind him and further back a marked police car good riddance theyd be thinking saying good riddance to bad rubbish a teacher way back at the grammar school had told the class it was from dickens ahead of him immediately was the travel shop the lawyers place fees school and then the unknown harvey gillot had a good feeling he always had it when he believed he had control of a sort but didnt know where destiny would take him he went past the top point of the island and the mainland vista stretched to far horizons if he didnt come back would anyone care no she swore a bad morning illusions broken woken from a dream romance fled not even lust remained swore loudly and repeated it with her suitcases she had gone to the big hotel on the high point of the island and had endured a rotten night the dentons were at the little wicket gate on the lane and had her dog on a lead in front of her were the gates to her home and the debris hed left she swore louder nobody there an empty lane the lead was loosed the dog freed she opened the gates many justifications for her curses the gardener hadnt offered to drive her back that morning and she fancied he would be looking for fresh employment to fill the hours he had spent at lulworth view indoors and out the clothing on the gate and on the lane with tyre marks was an act of crude vandalism the horse came to her across the drive and she felt tears well she had seen the state of her beloved and expensive garden a little regret which fuelled curses too long on her own in the isolation of the island and no one to know but the retired the traders she met had never had the guts to get off the place and find a life she was too bored too cut off from his work because he no longer seemed to need her support and too lonely hadnt even been proper sex on the side had been gardenwork sweat that nigel had washed off in the shower more was the pity just a bit of touching and fondling a quick dart inside and her saying she was on the pill and him recoiling at the mention of it hed gone soft on her afterwards not during and followed her round with eyes that longed like the dogs did when its food was due hadnt even done it properly the telephone rang as she crossed the drive but had stopped as she came through the door she didnt care good reason for the oaths curses when she was inside josie went to the bedroom where the open wardrobe doors mocked her the carpet was turned back at a corner and the safe box had its lid off empty the necklace hed bought her in riyadh after his first saudi contract following the wedding the ring from jakarta that had celebrated a deal for a paramilitary police weapons update the bracelet with the emeralds that had been the best thing in a hanoi shop amber from lithuania jade from thailand and the gold chain from johannesburg when hed sold a pile of junk to the mozambicans and all of it had been bought by him and all of it had been given to her sometimes in gift boxes with wrapping and ribbon passed across a candlelit table sometimes coming off a dawn flight and her still in bed a neighbour taking fee to nursery school before they moved and the wrapping stripped off as fast as his clothes all gone the bastard there had always been cash there dollars and euros and sterling empty she took the ring off her finger dropped it into the safe and put the lid back but didnt fasten the lock then kicked the carpet into place she went to the other safe in his office opened it with the combination and saw that her passport was there not his the insurance policies and his will the computers had been opened and she assumed the hard drives were gone at the gates when she was collecting armfuls of her clothes the dentons came close and she was told of armed police officers who had maintained a vigil on her home through the night and more police who had been at the top of the lane she was told also of the inconvenience caused by a woman with a megaphone who had kept them awake till the small hours the couple felt betrayed they said hadnt known her husband dealt in arms she stomped away with another armful of clothes said not a word of apology or remorse just bloody well ignored them josie gillot thought her life had been destroyed as her husbands had when she had cleared the gate had picked up the coats and dresses she swore some more and took the boxes of carriage clocks ornaments and glassware back across the drive and into the house next she had to return the horse to its field but before that a drink or three not midmorning and ice cubes tinkled on crystal nobody helped her the bastard she didnt know what he was doing or where he was and didnt care to he had been turned away he had arrived at the school had thought he was doing his daughter a favour and gone down empty corridors hearing the chirp of young voices from behind closed classroom doors as he had reached the headmistress suite a bell had clamoured he had been made to wait not offered coffee or a biscuit your wife mr gillot came last night saw fiona and briefed us on the irregular situation in your life currently she expressed an opinion that you were capable of quite irrational actions so my colleagues and i have decided it better that you do not see your daughter please leave mr gillot he had been aware then of the male pe teacher in a tracksuit at the open door did he want to be grabbed and put in a headlock he had driven away there had been girls limbering up for netball tennis or athletics on a distant playingfield but he could not as he drove recognise his daughter among them the escort car picked him up at the outer gates and tailed him back into town the dutiful father had done his best he had the tickets from the travel agent and the envelope given reluctantly and signed for in triplicate from the solicitor the senior partner the suspicious beggar had asked if this had mrs gillots approval then had stepped into an adjoining office and made a call that had not been answered he had the tickets and the envelope and what had been in the safe was in a plastic bag at his feet he would have broiled if not for the airconditioner the car followed him into town he parked at the station in the shortstay bays he didnt know if he would be back so the prospect of his car running up a bill and getting clamped or towed away seemed unimportant he boarded the train they didnt come with him before the train reached poole its schedule was dislocated the announcement said there had been an incident on the line and the guard coming through the carriage during the halfhour delay said a guy topped himself off a bridge jumped in front of a train on the down line sort of put things into perspective harvey thought when the train started up and they inched forward at a place where the line ran through a cutting he found himself thinking about the village where he had never been and what it had been like a long time ago she had been told the mans name was andrija and then simun whispered that he was disturbed in the last week he had attempted to kill himself by lying on a hand grenade but his wife had taken it from him penny laing had been given a stool to perch on the boy sat crosslegged on the veranda and the woman introduced as maria stood behind her husband and held the back of his solid chair she was without expression and wore shapeless drab grey and brown clothing he had a wooden hospital crutch and propped it between his knees he talked and his wife never interrupted or prompted simun translated penny learned of the raising of the payment that had been given to harvey gillot how the wife had refused to accept excuses and she imagined the woman gliding in darkness through the village as shells exploded and there were skirmishes at the defence lines then in a bunker or a cellar under a house or below the flagstones of the catholic church she had filled a bag with bagatelle ornaments lowquality gold rubbish jewellery and the deeds of properties that had no value everything that went into the bag was of the highest importance to those who gave it they did not know in the village the name of the dealer whom the schoolteacher had met in zagreb but zoran had come back and reported a meeting most satisfactory with a person of honour and integrity the night they went to collect the weapons they had thought they would meet the man of honour and integrity maybe linger long enough with him for a cigarette the glow shielded there would have been the embrace of brothers cheeks kissed and he would have gone on his way as they ferried the missiles towards the village andrijas cousin had come from vinkovci had not been pressured to fight but had done so he was a lion in the village they had heard as they waited for the shadows dragging the cart and the pram from the corn the sudden concentration of explosions the rattle of the machinegun penny laing wondered if the greater hatred was directed at harvey gillot who had taken their possessions and welshed on a deal or on the paramilitaries simun called cetniks who had killed the four and had ultimately overrun the village the translation went on andrija was skilled as a sniper he would have fired his dragunov rifle to drive the enemy into bunkers and into armoured vehicles tomislav would have used the malyutka missiles the village had bought a malyutka would destroy a personnel carrier which might have fifteen cetniks inside it if the missiles had come they would have held the village it was said with certainty she felt now that she was merely an intruder and couldnt read the boy well enough to know whether or not he still respected her no missiles ammunition exhausted and in the final hours andrija had left his wife with the wounded in the crypt under the church and gone into the corn he had been twentythree and his wife two years older it was estimated he had killed twenty cetniks during the siege and had he been caught in the corn he would have died a slow death on the second day walking crawling alone he had detonated an antipersonnel mine that had shattered his leg virtually severing it he had used a shirt sleeve to tie a tourniquet then dragged himself on his stomach the last two kilometres the limb pulled along after him by a thin weave of muscle ligament and skin his wife maria had been taken from the church by the cetniks and raped repeatedly before she had had fine long black hair but by the second month in the refugee camp after repatriation it had turned grey and she had had it cut short simun said they had not had sex since they had been reunited she would not have permitted it and he would not have wanted it penny felt washed out and exhausted by what was said almost timidly she asked a question what did harvey gillot mean to andrija he said through simun that he had not had the will to live since he had recovered in the hospital ward because he was crippled life had so little meaning for him that he had refused to go for fitting and training in the use of prosthetic limbs now he wished to survive long enough to hear it announced by mladen on the cafe veranda that harvey gillot had been killed his wife was suddenly animated nodded vigorously and penny saw savage beauty as if a shadow had lifted would you thank them please and tell them of my gratitude what will happen to harvey gillot should he come here she could see it in their eyes no answer was necessary the same death that had awaited andrija if hed been captured in the corn slow and hard he was met at the terminal he had not known it but he reckoned then that he had been tailed off the train from the coast and shadowed across london an officer plainclothes introduced himself as mark roscoes senior he decided the sergeant had snitched on him because there was dislike at the mans mouth and in the eyes the others were uniform and carried machine pistols he was escorted through the checks and past immigration people staring at him because of the company he kept nobody spoke other than the first exchange at the introduction the inspector did not have a word for him he sat down in the coffee section didnt have long to wait because of his late arrival and roscoes chief stood arms folded a few paces away while the guns patrolled he had coffee and a cake then bought a newspaper when the departure was called he hitched up his rucksack walked to the travelator the platform and the allocated carriage harvey gillot didnt look back and he thought theyd stay until the train had pulled away it was harvey gillot accepted an eccentric route to take he had come to paris had walked from gare du nord to gare de lest he had eaten at a fastfood joint something tasteless but filling and had drunk mineral water ignoring the wines he had sat on a bench among a small army of young american backpackers there had been police on the station concourse but also patrols of armed troops who carried lowslung automatic weapons he had taken in effect a fugitives route the onward ticket had been waiting for him at a booth he had paid cash for it and it was as though a link had been broken in a chain he was used to it practised it with frequency skill and would have wagered good money that the bastard with the balaclava and the wasps couldnt have had his eyes on a trail or his nose on a scent he thought himself free but maintained basic security procedures which were second nature he had not done the courses but knew enough people who had and had done middleman negotiation for former army officers to lecture heads of state on personal protection he had stayed outside the conversations of the americans around him and would barely have been noticed as he sat among their massive bags but the troops with their assault rifles stirred the memory of the attack and of the contract panic had swept through the backpackers harvey gillot didnt know where it had come from but word said that the couchettes were double booked and that late arrivals might have to sit up through the night big bloody deal bigger for the americans than for the refugee who travelled on a penance and didnt know what it was when the train was called there had been a stampede and he had been carried with it and the panic a false alarm he had his own cubicle and in the morning a cold breakfast would be brought to him with coffee he didnt take off his jacket or shrug out of his shirt until the night sleeper for munich had cleared the station he hoped he would sleep wasnt sure that he would always useful harvey gillot reckoned to have a topic of conversation analysis if sleep came hard he had chosen the potential in armoured cars he lay on his back the curtains drawn and rocked with the motion he pondered on salespitch talk ballistic integrity durability quality control and on the mercedes benz range of saloons and suvs price tags of a quarter of a million euros for starters their suitability for the streets of baghdad moscow or shanghai what a package what value and there was the jaguar range he didnt see fields of ripened corn and sunflowers or the great river against which a town had been trapped squeezed and devastated when a village on the only path into it had been defeated he walked into departures he didnt turn and wave to vern and hadnt reached into the front passenger seat of the car to kiss leanne they had taken him to the airport pulled up at the dropoff bay and he had been out of the car had slammed the door and walked nervous apprehensive the great turmoil of the concourse buffeted against him he headed inside and gazed at the flickering boards he hadnt been back to move her she would still be on the bed colder and paler he hadnt settled on an alibi it was in the bloodstream of the cairns family that care should be taken to destroy technical evidence and to line up a witness who would put them at another location pub club restaurant at the time that mattered he had done nothing after the cleanup because he had been summoned to his grandfathers flat he could have turned round walked out and headed for there was nowhere else couldnt go to the flat because the bed was taken and the hands of the woman who lay on it were frozen she was silent and her skin was white except for the bruising he had nowhere to go no other life to lead one thing was clear he would be on that flight time and money had been invested in him two contact numbers were in his pocket and he shouldnt fuckin think of coming back till its done enough for him to be nervous and apprehensive and more robbie cairns feared hitman and taker of bigmoney contracts had travelled outside his country only once before three years ago he had been on a weeks trip to marbella with his mother and sister because there was talk of investing in a villa a little along the coast at puerto banus he had hated it had been burned by the sun then had peeled like a bloody snake he had not been abroad since because hed had no call to and because money in the cairns household was tight the big heist that would pay for luxury vacations was always the next one like a little boy lost he scanned the board and cursed his sister for not coming in to show him where he should go then he saw it probably his eyes had gone over that part of the board a halfdozen times munich on the board a lufthansa flight and its number it would be the last flight of the day and there was a surge of businessmen and women who had shoulder bags that held computers robbie cairns had only a football kitbag small and scratched given him by his father fifteen years back he didnt play football might have taken out a guy whod tripped him the bag was black with red piping and had the clubs crest of a fist gripping an upright sword he thought his father had probably been given it free in a pub it would have been easy enough to get to see charlton down evelyn street from rotherhithe to the top end of greenwich park over the blackwall tunnel road then another mile wouldnt have taken more than a halfhour but it would have bored him and he had no friend to go with in his bag were spare socks a razor and a soap dish two sets of underwear a shirt and a pair of faded jeans he showed his passport the guy flicked through the empty pages then wiped it over a light set into his desk that made more of the nerves and more of the apprehension he was given back the passport no smile or thanks and the eyeline had already moved behind him he knew that his barbie hadnt been found there were other kids at school who had shown signs of brutality they had been slapped down in front of the councils psychiatrists robbie cairns was not among them there was a kid an elevenyearold who had crucified a cat nailed it to a fence there was a girl aged seven who used to stay beside a bush a pretty one that attracted butterflies she had caught them and pulled their wings off nothing abnormal about robbie cairns he had never felt the need to hurt just went about his work took the money and slipped what he had seen and done to the back of his mind couldnt now she was cold and silent but she gnawed and nagged in his head like a rat would but she hadnt been found a group of women sat in a corner of a lounge bar near theatreland they had seen les miserables not for the first time and were having a drink before going off in their different directions what they had in common was that they worked in fragrances at a department store also shared was their irritation that one of their regulars was not present had kept them hanging about in the theatre foyer almost until the curtain rose had wasted a seat that someone would have filled had behaved so out of character shed better have good explanation if she was sick or something theres telephones and there was staff training this morning its not like barbara she lives in one of those new places by canada water i saw it on some pension stuff we both had im coming from catford so ill catch the earlier bus and check on her as you say its not like barbara they had time for one more round and talked of the wonders of the show which they knew almost line by line and next morning melody who specialised in eau de toilette would break her bus journey in canada water i want to go simple as that if you didnt know it megs im talking to a select committee in the morning if you also didnt know it members of parliament have not only influence but also dosh to dole out im here tonight as a reflection of the importance of the mornings session the windows were open and the breeze was up shivering over the papers spread in front of him the window had to be open so that his cigarette smoke drifted outside and the smell was erased before dawn sorry and all that but i need to go im only here at this godforsaken hour because of tomorrow im not here to hand out travel vouchers and petty cash first want now need you push your luck megs i ask for very little what hurt most she liked him might have fancied him but he had a girlfriend a teacher in a comprehensive and was touchingly loyal to her they were the oldest two in information and support earned a pittance though more than any of the younger others but he was megss senior and demanded that she remember it you are undeniably an important and valued member of our team i can do a cheap flight maybe via astana or wheres that its the capital of kazakhstan or ill go via anchorage whichever is cheaper to reach croatia she had been joking but there was too much paper on his desk and his humour was stifled is there nothing else megs that would more valuably employ you i mean sleeping in police cars and driving a rural community half insane with a loudspeaker isnt winning hearts and minds please leave me alone itll seem better in the morning is that it believe me megs that should have been it five minutes ago look a field trip such as you propose would have to go before the finance people maybe a board member for sanction i have neither the time nor the inclination go away sod you was that offensive would a bloody great argument help her cause he was smiling at her had the look of a man who longed to get his teeth into forbidden fruit but wouldnt grope im sure youve been told often enough that youre prettiest when youre angry and its true we love you its no bullseye no money for an airfare and no subsistence youve failed to explain to me what harvey gillot is going to do in some village west of vukovar how his visit and your presence there will enrich our work christ he didnt sell we vilify arms brokers for selling are we saying megs and getting ourselves into an acrobats contortions that we condemn harvey gillot because he did not flog weapons to a croat community when to have done so was in defiance of an enforceable security council embargo megs its late im tired i have a bloody mountain to climb before im due at the palace of fun truth and hope go home and if i said i was resigning it would have sounded like a big card played but she was grinning maybe he didnt notice the grin or was too tired to care these are difficult times and were crunched to the bone looking at every possible economy measure you dont give us easy options i wont be in tomorrow where will you be probably refuelling at astana or anchorage and likely sitting on the wing at takeoff im using days in lieu goodnight megs and close the door after you she went out the end of the world well there was an account she had promised herself she wouldnt chip into her aunts bequest it seemed important enough to break rules to be there but she couldnt explain why she just had to go she had to see how it played out in part she was responsible for the chaos now sitting in harvey gillots lap didnt mean she was sorry for what shed done but perhaps she had a stake in it like she wanted to see a horse run when shed cleared her purse to back it sympathy of course not she closed the door went to her cubicle and started to surf for flights and deals youll need something for your head itll be up in the nineties there yes dear the linen or the straw i think the straw is more suitable it was a ritual played out between benjie and deirdre arbuthnot she always supervised his laying out of clothing and necessary items before they were packed into his scarred leather travelling bag the bag had history had been beside him in circumstances of luxury and extreme hardship he couldnt have imagined being away without its reassuring presence at the foot of a bed or beside a sleepingbag the label hanging by a frayed strap to the handle named him as benjamin c arbuthnot consultant engineer there had probably been a team working for a week on the service payroll specifically to discover what employment cover gave the greatest protection in the field he had never met a suspicious official when working in covert mode who had thought it necessary to quiz him on dam building or bridge construction the straw hat went on the bed in the spare room beside his washbag and pyjamas the socks and underwear youll want some good shoes yes dear the pair you had in spain i think theyll be suitable yes he had worn them last year in spain walking a little and watching for eagles oxpeckers and vultures in the parque nacional de donana but had broken them in new in the hindu kush foothills when the mujahideen had been supplied with the wretched blowpipes each time he wore them and brought them home hed clean and polish them then insert the shoe trees they had kept their shape since the days he had spent with the perspiring solly lieberman and the young harvey gillot he felt linked to the past its all about policy you cant have strategy if you dont have a policy aim he said almost wistfully of course benjie im concerned about the mosquito repellent four years beyond the sellby date worked in that park will work again men such as lieberman and little men such as gillot only survive because of policy requirements you have to decide which jacket to take the cotton is probably best right the cream one that sort of person isnt going to exist let alone prosper unless it suits the policy aims of those at the top table pretty much every deal thats done has an assumed advantage to us or solly and little gillot would have been stamped on at birth people at revenue and customs dont understand the requirements of policy will four shirts be enough its only two or three days isnt it four shirts two slacks she ticked off items collected the clothing from drawers and wardrobes and spread it beside the bag he could reflect that under a ferocious exterior she cared for his safety she could have echoed what hed said about policy he needed in his mind and perhaps his soul to justify the events that had taken place many years before on the quayside at rijeka advice given only advice his own business done he had driven hard for ljubljana through torrential rain that his wipers had barely coped with he had managed a late flight out and gillot in recent years had heard along the extended communication lines so prized by the service that other officers had been able to use him to advantage before he had slipped under the radar didnt mean that afterwards little gillot had been a loose cannon a rogue whatever but that he didnt fill a useful slot in the policy requirements of the day she folded the items briskly and packed i dont suppose youll want to take your library book youve gone quiet benjie not an attack of the dreaded ethics i hope i was reflecting on the creed of deniability she laughed a little growled chuckle and touched his arm briefly i think that weve thought of about everything thank you deniability was always the key agreed hardly worth doing if wed had to own up and be in the publics glare it suited us so much better to have those damn missiles on jordanian soil than shoved upcountry in croatia to some battlefield where the result was already determined it was the equivalent of throwing good money after bad but it was grand to get the stuff to aqaba and no one the wiser on our involvement ethics ill admit to short spasms of feeling responsible for what denys called a blowback but more important will be the theatre you with me dear are you taking your pen of course i fancy it will be spectacular he closed the bag buckled it and carried it with the straw hat out of the room he took them downstairs and put them on an old chair close to the front door covenient for carrying to the land rover in the morning and her driving him to the train station she called from the landing a whisky i think benjie youll be a voyeur wont you not going to clash with any scant sense of morality he laughed with her bugger the morals im banking on a fine show and of course youll play the universal idiot and do it well theyre the clothes im comfortable in at the gold group meeting there was little enthusiasm for extending the session further into the late evening bizarre circumstances agreed but not entirely unwelcome from scd surveillance i would have to say maam that we were not happy with declining an invitation to mount the sort of job that was required just dont have the people if we were to have put in a covert rural observation point we would have had to pull a very expert team off secondment to box or to one of the narcotics scenes important down on the south coast were singing and dancing if the tangos done a runner from co firearms we too have box commitments but the whole vip scene is a killer in resources we have an obligation to the target to protect him however obstinate and daft he wants to be him going gives us a chance to reassess and hope he keeps moving and doesnt turn round from scd intelligence we dont have a line on the identity of the guy who took the contract itll sneak out always does but at this moment i have no idea who this village bought from scd the inspector i have mark roscoe back from the coast he knows the tango better than anyone yes i am concerned about our dutyofcare obligations my suggestion while the tango plods across europe we put roscoe on a flight first thing in the morning he can liaise in zagreb then go on to vukovar what hell do there i dont know but itll give our shoulderblades some cover from hmrc a line manager we have there already in place penny laing and shell be able to brief roscoe shes an experienced highly capable operative and the inspector flared my man roscoe is quite capable of crossing a road on his own and will not need his hand held the line manager said evenly i wouldnt want heavy police boots blundering over the sensitive ground that our investigator is looking at time for phoebe bermingham to call a halt and she did it had always astonished her that separate departments went on to a war footing when cooperation was called for the concept of a detective from the flying squad working with an investigator from hm revenue and customs was obviously built on shifting sands im sure theyll do very well together and create complete harmony in their professional relationship the tangos gone and we should be thankful whatever happens to him is to be laid squarely at his own door safe home gentlemen she shuffled her papers together pushed back her chair it was an afterthought and she had forgotten herself sufficiently for a puzzled frown to gouge her forehead i cannot imagine what he thinks he can achieve and its all so long ago i mean do i look back to what happened in my life nineteen years ago and allow the past to dictate my present arent memories fogged by time its europe the twentyfirst century and blood vendettas should be consigned to history classes is nothing ever forgotten no maam the intelligence man said softly never forgotten and never forgiven hell probably get the top of his head blown off simun touched her arm to attract her attention then pointed you see penny no wedding ring and there was no ring on the finger of maria the wife of andrija and my mother had no ring when she was buried she has no ring no gold chain with a crucifix or any earrings everything she had went into the bag that was taken by harvey gillot yes it was late she had been brought to a farmhouse she was sitting at the kitchen table hewn wood and the chair was old its legs uneven she had been offered and had taken a glass of tap water the eyes of the woman opposite never left pennys face she could see where the house had been rebuilt the beams were exposed some charred and the walls were not plastered in one there was a big hole like a bite from an apple filled with different bricks and newer mortar he went to the bank and took out a loan for five thousand euros that was his share for the payment on the contract yes their boy went to the place where the malyutkas were to be delivered the delivery was not made and their boy was identified by his size and the scraps of his clothing that remained his testicles were in his mouth they will not speak of the siege and the death of their son she had been told that in the days between the loss of their son and the collapse of the villages defences their home had taken a direct hit from a tank shell if the malyutka missiles had arrived the tank would have been destroyed simun had said that their sons room was sealed now the window bricked up the wife had been in the kitchen if she had not been close to the table and able to crawl under it as the floors above collapsed she would have died too she had been unhurt except that her hearing had gone she lived in silence they were separated simun had told penny her company was the quiet and his was the anger at what had been done to them the focus now of the anger was harvey gillot and it was as if a man crouched by a fire blew on its embers and flames reared he farms a hundred hectares that he owns and another hundred and fifty that he rents he could be rich but is not all the money that the farm makes goes to the association for the support of war veterans he is a pauper look at his clothes how she dresses he is a fine farmer but is now in his sixtyeighth year soon he will drop and his farm will be sold maybe to businessmen in zagreb or to expatriates living in america for now he stays close to his sons room his son should have farmed this land and lived here do you understand yes she was looking at her hands on the rough table and imagining the woman under it the dust cascading with the beams and bricks when her mobile rang she answered it brusquely was given a name asked for it to be repeated then spoke it aloud mark roscoe sergeant scd she remembered him sharp and abrasive she had called him patronising and had thought him stereotypical of the average specialisedunit policeman he would have thought the sun shone from his backside and the rest of the world was second rate she was given a travel itinerary and rang off simun queried but she shook her head and stood they went outside into the night she sensed then that time was short that a world created for her in this village with its history would imminently fracture she thought that the son who would now have been in his late thirties with a wife and a clutch of kids would have gone with a village girl to the barn behind the house where the winter fodder was stored perhaps the boy with her might have been there with a new generation of village girls penny laing thought herself absorbed into the life of the village the alpha team and her bedsit were almost blown away they went towards the darkened hulk of the barn and she could hear animals maybe pigs goats heifers and a truth smacked across her face had harvey gillot broken the law of his own country flown in the teeth of a security council resolution and supplied malyutka missiles to this community there would now be a statue in his honour in front of the church and a street or the cafe would bear his name she thought of the great and the good in whitehall and the alpha team who made their policy decisions they had not been here had seen nothing and were ignorant but harvey gillot had failed on the deal and was condemned they climbed bales she helped him to strip and felt the prickly warmth of hay against her skin he had brought his own condom and was shy when he gave it to her she split the packet and rolled it on to him then arched took him and felt a liberation a cord cut a link broken she had never before belonged not even with her naval man and she clung to him he cried out to his animal audience gasped and sagged she held him clung tight into his ear kissing him she whispered when he comes here who when gillot comes here yes will he be killed the boy slipped wetly out of her why not if he comes here of course he will be killed the train had halted and was lodged in a siding he didnt know how far they had travelled but he estimated from the time that they were outside cologne the longdistance trains travelling overnight needed places to park so that they would arrive at their destination after the world had woken he lay on his back earlier he had washed and scraped off the sweat of the previous day he hadnt really slept but the project was still forward in his mind armoured cars the big new market area could be mercedes he had a smattering of german enough to ingratiate himself with the sales force of this particular specification which was important because he would be looking for exclusivity in the territory agreed and also for decent profit margins could be jaguar there wasnt much in price between the german and british vehicles both around a quarter of a million euros and he could hear his patter a bargain actually only thing that comes cheaper than this vehicle is a funeral yours some customers would look for a german product on principle and others had to have britishmade of the jaguar his line might be at a quarter of a million its a snip i predict itll be the preferred transport for heads of state business leaders celebrities the diplomatic corps such fine lines he buried himself through that night in the thicknesses of armourplating systems the depth of bulletproofglass windows the cost of runflat tyres a global aftersales service to check the continuing effectiveness of kevlar plates the armourdriving training course for a big mans chauffeur there was a low throb of airconditioning he did not think whether for mercedes or jaguar that prospective buyers would be russian he would look for the fringe markets where he was better known romania bulgaria moldova or belarus the czech republic slovakia and hungary in their literature jaguar said dealing with real security risks in our everyday lives is becoming commonplace too right he felt strangely better for being alone anonymous tucked away in a sleeper carriage safer than if he had been behind the wheel of a massive car that was low on the road from the weight of its armour plating the bed shook the carriage rocked and the glasses above the washbasin rattled the train edged forward he felt relaxed not frightened the aircraft had come down fast had hit hard and the landing had shaken robbie cairns it had taken him almost half an hour to find the right platform for the train into the city and the journey then was another fortyfive minutes he had emerged at the hauptbahnhof where he had followed his instructions and rung the first number on the contact list he was supposed to be the cool guy fazed by nothing but his hands had been shaking when he had dialled the number in a phone booth and waited while it warbled it had been answered and robbie had blurted english words then he had heard an aloof distant voice accented that thank christ he understood he had thought of her had done all through the flight on the train into munich and at the station on the concourse and at the call booth had thought she would be colder paler he was told what he should do the taxi driver grinned at him lewdly as he gave the address he was driven away from the main streets not far from the station and into darker roads the destination was a bar a doorman stepped forward waved robbie towards the entrance and settled with the driver he was led inside music blasted and there was a girl on a stage but they went past her past empty chairs and tables the girl danced but still had clothes on robbie did not go to strip or lap clubs and kept his eyes on the tired carpet they went to an office two men were inside he was asked for identification and showed his passport they looked at the photograph then at him and a light was tilted to shine full in his face he was asked the date of his mothers birthday he gave it one of the men stood and the other sat in a desk chair of upholstered leather trays of invoices and receipts in front of him a drawer in the desk was unlocked pulled open and a cardboard box taken out the top was lifted robbie knew the walther ppk the butt had a black plastic inlay while the barrel and mechanism were dull grey the weapon rested easily in his hand he looked first at the safety lever then cleared the breech hearing the smooth sound of metal on metal which told him the weapon was wellmaintained satisfied it was empty he aimed at a photo of a girl on the wall pulled the trigger and learned the degree of squeezed force required robbie cairns noted the camera it was high in a corner the lens would have been the size of his littlefinger nail and was aimed downwards it would have covered him from the moment he came through the door he realised no one would ask him to sign for the gun there was a television screen beside the desk and the girl who danced on the stage was now naked the hair on her head was blonde but black below her belly as barbies was the man at the desk said it was a polizeipistole kriminalmodell and the calibre was mm the magazine held seven rounds and the range was he didnt need to know the range the calibre or the size of the magazine it would be close and it would be what the police called double tap he was given two magazines then a silencer attachment the camera eyed him he couldnt escape it he thought himself stripped they had achieved power over him and he didnt know who owned a tape that could convict him he wanted to be gone he was not asked for payment he assumed down the line of whatever conveyorbelt now operated behind him theyd take a cut from the second payments due on delivery of a body he had no doubt that when the train came in the next morning and harvey gillot walked down the platform he would be close and would fire the double tap the first shot to the body the second to the head and that he would earn what was still outstanding she was in his mind and he couldnt scratch her out he took the pistol the magazines and the silencer he asked for a taxi to be called did he want to drink in the club and watch the show he did not he preferred to wait on the pavement for the taxi and the night settled on him i wouldnt daniel steyn had a grin on his face more mischief than malice im packed the bags are inside the door and the cabs booked in the morning i check out it was a game william anders realised and he must play it out just that if it was me i wouldnt i have daniel a lecture the day after tomorrow in stockholm and then im committed to a fourday seminar in helsinki it would take a powerful argument to enthuse me to scrub whats been in place for six months i wouldnt leave here not now it was supposed to have been a farewell drink the end of the day and the little party for the professor given by those he had worked with on the ovcara site was over and his hosts had dispersed the quack daniel steyn had stayed up late driven over to the hotel and theyd worked over a few malts anders had planned steyn knew to be gone before eight and would be on an early flight out of osijek for a german hub frankfurt or berlin and then steyn had a network of informants a call had come he was not an intelligence officer or a police source over the years he had recognised that knowledge was power which he needed if he wanted to stay in decaying forgotten vukovar to do good work in psychotherapy he needed power over the local politicians who would dearly have liked him silenced because he spoke truths the town and its community were a monument to failure reconciliation between serb and croat was at lipservice level there was addiction to drink and antidepressants and the treatment of combat trauma was underfunded and inadequate without the knowledge that gave him power daniel steyn would have been forced years back out of the town that he remained was a tribute to his dedication and his mental filing cabinet of informants tales his parent charity was as susceptible as others to cutbacks but he had lowered his standard of living and he lingered he knew also that anders bombastic domineering and furthering a personality cult was a good kindly man who bought the meals and paid for the drinks probably a small box of scotch would be delivered to his door the day after anders had gone late at night daniel and ive shipped a fair bit of juice can we quit spoiling whats left of the evening tell me there was a hit attempt that failed history the latest i have is that harvey gillot on whose head you facilitated the dropping of a contract is currently en route to vukovar that is a goddamn joke why is that the original death wish do we have a kind of suicide factory like the place in zurich why would he do that why not dig a hole climb into it and stay down could be an attempt to confront what he did the big gesture and you reckon itll be played out in public not the sort of matter where theres a privacy clause attached i quit my flight i wouldnt be leaving i can offer you my connections my sources a seat in the grand circle am i sure i want to be there i dont queue outside huntsville gaol to watch lethal injections be a lynch job wouldnt it not sure that you set it in motion bill and thats why youll be there they didnt get round immediately to the matter of cancellations quite a number there would be a taxi the two flights a little white lie or a big black one to the organisers of a forensicpathology gathering in the swedish capital and the seminar in finland steyn could see he had set a cat among the canaries and that his friend was weighing options he knew which way the balance would go william anders professor of the science of digging up longburied bodies was a prime mover in the efforts to kill the britishborn arms trader hed stay the lovers came back slipped through the door off the patio daniel steyn nudged his friend whose jealousy had become a deal more acute there was straw on the girls back and in her hair anders said its because of what they put in the water i might just take up your offer of the seat another day another start dawn broke over a sleeping hotel where a boy lay in a young womans arms and the first light reflected off the river and fell on them the same sunlight spread easily over fields of corn and a farmer was already up checking his crop and the sunflowers he decided that within the next week he would begin the harvest he saw a fox edge past him and stay close to the riverbank but he didnt know if it was the vixen still hunting her buried cubs or if a new life had reached that territory on the vuka river the same light came into the rooms where a former electrician stirred and where a man who might have fired an antiarmour wireguided missile slept alone because his wife had gone nineteen years before it lay on a man who had been a brilliant sniper and now had only one leg and on the man who was divorced from the inner clan because he had run from his home as the war had come closer the day would start when the storks screamed on their nests flapped and took off to forage but until then there was quiet and the same sunlight pierced a dull window and fell on the whitened face of a woman lying on a bed and light also was reflected up from the metal roofing of a fifteencarriage sleeper train that was south of ulm north of augsburg and heading slow and noisy towards munich he finished his coffee and there was a knock on his door he was fully dressed or he would not have called for the attendant to enter he was given back his passport and slipped a tip to the man gratitude was expressed and it was hoped he would have a pleasant day he was told the train would reach its destination in seven minutes robbie cairns was on the bench in the station and had been there through the night the concourse had crawled with police and railwaysecurity people after midnight there had been light music over the loudspeakers and no train movements between one and four he didnt know what the great london stations waterloo victoria kings cross st pancras or euston were like through the night had never experienced them one coffee outlet had remained open and the toilets but the place had been quiet after six it had woken after seven the pace of a new day was around him the first commuters suits briefcases severe skirts laptop bags powered past him the food stalls were opening other than to go to the toilets and take a fast shower he had been on the bench the loudspeakers bayed cheerful instructions on train arrivals he assumed and departures the big boards flickered new information if vern had been collecting him from the address in the short culdesac street below the albion estate and they had been going to work to a hit then he would not have eaten or drunk anything he thought food and drink before a hit would dull his sharpness most of the night hed had only his own company worse then because her face lived with him better later a vagrant had sat near to him and indicated he wanted money robbie had gazed into the mans unshaven scarred face and he had taken flight after him a stream of people had used the bench sometimes crowded close to him and sometimes giving him space he had learned as the pace of the station quickened that the trains came on time to the minute nothing chaotic about the movements at munich station he saw which platform would be used by the train bringing in the sleeper traffic from paris and knew where he would stand and for how long he would wait after leaving the bench while he had had the bench to himself when the area around him was deserted and there were gaps in the patrols hed kept the sports bag charlton athletic on his knee he did it by touch hands inside the bag robbie cairns had screwed the silencer to the barrel emptied one of the magazines into the bottom of the bag and refilled it he had been told by the armourer that jams came from dirt and from bullets left too long in a magazine always he had been drilled he should empty a magazine then reload it he inserted it back into the walthers stock looked again at the board saw how long till the train came in and finally stood his legs were stiff so he stretched his muscles cracked and his joints loosened he couldnt avoid the cameras a railway station would be covered by camera angles and lenses would have picked him up discarded him found him again handed him on like postal baggage to the view of an adjacent lens he was used to cameras expected them he walked to the news stand and bought a paper the suddeutsche zeitung he didnt understand any of the words printed on the front page or recognise any of the men photographed he dropped it into the top of his bag he was poorly equipped and accepted it he didnt have overalls gloves lighter fuel and subsequent access to a washhouse he didnt have leanne spotting for him or vern to drive him away he walked out of the station disjointed feelings of selfpreservation were alive in him and the whipcrack voice hoarse sneering and angry of his grandfather shared space in his mind with the sight of her the whiteness and the cold the instinct for selfpreservation led him outside the station and he pressed himself into the angle of a great supporting buttress of stone he shed his coat stuffed it into the bag and took out the widebrimmed baseball cap and dark glasses he put them on placed the walther inside the folded newspaper and draped a shirt seemingly carelessly over the bag to hide its colour and logo he was ready the crowds welled past him and he slipped among them and was almost propelled by the weight of movement into the station on to the concourse he checked again last time saw that the train was not delayed and noted again last time the platform it would come into he sidled towards a doorway set back in a wall that would be level with the back of the engine from the sign above it he thought it was the entrance to the stations chapel from there he could see up the tracks that merged separated and came into the platforms he had the pistol gripped in his hand and hidden in the newspaper he could find the safety and eased it off the big clock on the platform digital figures told him how long he must wait he had on a jacket lightweight from bond street because it was easier to wear than to hold and his shirt was outside his trousers and bulged the train had slowed now crawled he didnt know exactly what he would do at his journeys end but had an idea couldnt be certain because he had no comprehension of what he would find except that a path had led through cornfields couldnt say whether there was still a path and cornfields better to let his mind rest on other matters the armoured cars for the great the good and those who feared shadows he had decided after the train had pulled noisily clear of the siding and hammered through augsburg that baghdad and kabul would be awash with armouredcar salesmen and had determined that the better market was where careful men and women took precautions what they called in the trade event insurance a businessman in ireland an actress in italy a politician in greece anyone who could fork out the money in colombia ecuador bolivia guatemala no shortage of clients and the prospects put jauntiness into his step he could see the outskirts of the station the marshalling yards and did a final check around the cabin to make sure he had left nothing a shudder a lurch the train stopped he unlocked and opened his door the corridor was filled with the americans the floor space wedged high with their luggage he had more than ninety minutes until his connection and would get some coffee to pass the time harvey gillot had been here once flying into the old airport had carried bags for solly lieberman the old american had met up with germans of his own age and they had talked in that language which cut out the young guy and later past four in the morning when the veterans were showing no sign of exhaustion and harveys head was lolling he had been given numbers to note on the pad and hands had been shaken he had hoped for bed but it was denied a car had taken them to a shapeless modern block of flats and the sign had said connollystrasse the germans and his mentor had lectured him on the attack by palestinians in at the olympicfest and had pointed out the israeli house they had walked past it and he had ceased to understand the significance they had been brought to the airport no sleep for the days first flight and solly lieberman had chirped they allowed others to take responsibility for their security mistake a lesson in life young man is that you look after yourself no one else will the israelis died because of that mistake and faith had been put in the germans who fucked up fucked up big in your own hands remember it hed slept all the way back on the flight to heathrow but reckoned solly lieberman had done checks on balance sheets the train was halted and the excitement of the young people round him was infectious none of them had time or inclination to look at the sturdy man among them and wonder what was his business and why he travelled harvey gillot was the last off his carriage far ahead of him stretched the lines of marching passengers as they headed down the platform for the centre of the station he had forgotten solly lieberman and pretty much the question of which brand of armoured car was suitable for which damn market he had almost forgotten where he was and why when he seemed to see his dog he missed it hed been gone twentyfour hours a day and a night and already he missed the dog and its wet tongue his bag swung loosely on his shoulder and in it was what he had brought from the floor safe under the livingroom carpet and the solicitors strong room yes he missed the dog and maybe already the open land of the island the bare brown fields the shallow cliffs the storms on the rocks and there was a board ahead of him but it was too early for his connection to have reached the display he would get the herald tribune and maybe time and they would see him through he would have nine hours on the eurocity mimara to work at the detail of the village and the people to remember zagreb a man he had met there and the start of what benjie arbuthnot called blowback and an announcement was in midstream the platform from which the ice express to berlin would leave he walked briskly not because he needed to hurry but because of the crowd in front of and behind him squadrons of wheeled bags snagged at his ankles and he nearly fell a blow struck him he had an image of a metal pipe heavy against his back on the line of his spine it caught harvey gillot unawares and he spiralled forward staggering he flailed to keep his balance the second impact hit him again in the back lower than the first and a little to the left where he knew his kidneys lodged a huge blow and a massive impact he felt himself collapsing and realised he had been shot twice he tried to get hold of a womans shoulder but she swatted him away he was going down faster had lost control at the knees he scrabbled for a grip on a case pulled along on its wheels but its owner wearing a fine suit and polished shoes glanced at him and jerked it forward he was sprawled on the platform they didnt break their stride they went to the right of him and to the left they charged past him no hand reached down to help him two women came out of a door that had a cross above it would have been the stations chapel but neither paused to bend over him did they think he was drunk or had overdosed he was prone and helpless he waited for the third shot and waited shock first made numbess then pain in his spine and over his kidneys he could do sums a pistol bullet had a muzzle velocity when fired of around feet per second maybe the two shots had been fired at a range of five feet he had heard nothing above the sound of a womans voice telling him in what cities towns the ice express to berlin would stop it was the helene weigel and he heard when it would reach nuremberg and leipzig and the gears of his mind crashed at a bullet taking madness fucking madness of a second to go from the barrel and impact into the bulletproof vest it didnt come he was helpless on the ground his eyes closed it wasnt that people laughed or swore at him they fucking ignored him they didnt disapprove of criticise or mock him they didnt fucking see him he didnt hear the beat of feet and the squeal of little wheels pass his head and the announcer had given the arrival time in berlin zoologischer garten and was quiet harvey gillot felt a moment of emptiness and dared to look he saw nothing except the closed door to what would be the chapel and the emptiness ahead he dragged himself to his knees he turned his head slowly expecting that a man with or without a balaclava slight built would come into his peripheral vision and take a firing stance there was no man and no pistol he hadnt thought it could happen here he hadnt reckoned on danger beyond the island and his home had thought himself rid of it when hed left the armed police and strode off to get the eurostar he hadnt believed that danger had survived while he travelled he had to use all his strength to prevent himself subsiding on to the dirt left by thousands of shoes his target was a trolley he reached and hung on to it at first from each shot there had been the sledgehammer shock wave and the numbness the pain racked him he moved unseen and unwatched along the remaining length of the platform using the trolley twice to turn the full threesixty and look for the man he failed to find him he pushed the trolley far to the left on the concourse past the row of platforms and past the great trains and saw the whitepainted ice express nudge from its berth and start on the run to berlin ahead a flight of steps led down to the toilets he had to leave the trolley there was a handrail to cling to he went down the steps he gave the attendant money and saw the guy look curiously at him but he would have been a turk or an albanian and wouldnt push his interest to impertinence he went into a cubicle couldnt imagine that the goddamn head with or without the balaclava would poke over the door and sagged on to the seat it was agony to get the coat off then the shirt there were holes in the coat two neat but for the mess of singed material round them he put his index finger through each one waggled the tip and was almost stupefied then did the same with the shirt the holes were the same size as those in the jacket but had no burn marks he undid the stays that held the bulletproof vest close and shrugged out of it so heavy and so strong there were two deep dents in the material that held the plates in place and he could see where the softheads had disintegrated sending the shock waves that the plates had absorbed the worst pain was when he twisted his hand behind him and groped for the places where the strikes had come he felt bruising but there was no blood he was hunched on the seat in his mind harvey gillot began to compose a text message he wouldnt send it on his own mobile but would find a payphone in the station hi monty think u shd know that bpv fantastic brill have tested amp no angst works what chance me for franchise best harv had lost the pain and had the salesmans smile felt the patter melting on his tongue would i try to sell you something sir that is crap i know about this product and i can tell you with utter sincerity that it does the business look sir at this jacket now look at this shirt neither washed from the day it happened i never saw him but i estimate the range was five feet and he used a silencer now look at the vest damaged but not holed cant say the same about old titanic can we sir i was wearing it believe me nearly knocked me over but i wasnt punctured what im saying sir im not one of those flash lads in a west end security company who knows damnall about a real situation ive been there the bruising has gone but i can strip off if you like

the evidence and met a man who can vouch for this product i look forward to hearing from you he was laughing couldnt help it harvey gillot dressed again and reckoned he hacked the pain he put the damn thing back on let himself out walked awkwardly but reached the steps and went in search of a coffee he needed them and didnt have them there was no elder brother or younger sister but he reckoned hed done well and hadnt panicked could have done too damn easy it was only afterwards that he had understood the taxi dropped him at departures all the time during the journey walking into the travel agent and out and going to the taxi rank he had waited to hear sirens then a command in a language he didnt know but which would have its authority big in the shout and to see guns pointed there had been no noise and no aimed weapons but there had been no blood the target had stumbled almost fallen and the drilled hole was in his jacket and his head was ducked as if his chin was against his chest and the double tap had had to be into the back he had fired the second time and the impact had pushed the target forward and prone but there had been no blood the target had not screamed writhed twitched but had lain still there had been a babble from the big speakers and crowds hurrying coming from behind and surging away and theyd seemed not to notice the target maybe because there was no blood the art of what robbie cairns did was to go in fast hard and be gone he had walked on past and his feet would have been no more than a yard from the head of the target he had not looked down but had carried his bag in one hand and the rolled newspaper in the other he had not understood why there was no blood only two holes regular shape of a calibre round he had kept walking and had left the man on the platform there should have been blood when he had waited by the doorway into the chapel he had concerned himself with the chance of blood arcing up if he did a closerange head shot and of the bubbles landing on his face and clothes right up to the time that he had seen the target one of the last off the train and from one of the furthest carriages it had tossed in his mind a head shot or a spine shot the man had walked easily had seemed unaware decision taken a spine shot he hadnt looked round him or checked for a tail had passed the doorway as if swept along in the flow as robbie had been when he slotted in behind five feet back no more than six he had held the bag away from the rolled newspaper had done the trigger squeeze and no one had reacted as the target had stumbled and sagged it had been a long time before he had understood why the target was not dead and did not bleed he had stopped by the window of a travel agent beside the costa and algarve posters and gazed back at the platform he had not seen a felled corpse and had known what he must do in the travel agents by the main entrance to the station he had had to control his breathing almost panted as if he had been running big deep breaths and it was the start of the day a girl was free to hear his order an air ticket from munich to zagreb one way he couldnt get his head round where he would bug out to afterwards he bought a ticket from franz josef strauss to pleso and said he didnt know what his plans were in the next few days he paid cash for the ticket which confused the girl so he acted dumb and she did the transaction but said next time he should use a credit card two items tracked a man one was a credit card each time it was used and the second was a mobile phone the whole time it was switched on he had gone back to the edge of the concourse and stood close to the big bookshop and near the stall that had more sorts of buns and bread rolls than hed known of and he had looked away up the platform to confirm again what he already knew he had known where to look because the sign for the chapel was high and easy to see nothing there well an old woman pushing a trolley he had sufficient elevation on tiptoe to note that there was no blood there should have been and sceneofcrime tape a cordon a sheet with feet sticking out from under it but there was only an old woman he had gone to the taxi rank the understanding hurt he had never worn a vest or shot a man who had worn one he had never seen one demonstrated it hurt because now he could recall that his target had seemed broader in the body more solid and substantial but he hadnt registered it there was a burger king at the entrance near to where the taxis waited outside it were big industrial rubbish bins the sort that were hoisted by lorries and tipped it was a fast movement the walther ppk went in with the silencer still screwed in place and the spare magazine he couldnt have cleaned it enough to remove dna but he thought the rubbish would go to the tip and if he was lucky be buried he didnt know of an alternative it was a new airport luxury it had worked well about all that had a flight in ninety minutes to zagreb he couldnt telephone rotherhithe the albion estate had no one to lean on robbie cairns was pushed forward through departures and towards the gate was a driven man pressured by failure almost standing in the boarding queue he had been about to congratulate himself on responding well to a second fuckup not recognising the bulk of a vest but two women were in front of him smartly clothed smoothskinned and smelling of scent and he remembered because the women who worked on that counter in the department store were closeknit and subject to small confidences melody knew a little of the supposedly secretive domestic life of her friend and colleague barbara she had come off the bus her diversion would make her late into central london had waited at the entrance of barbaras block until a resident had emerged then used the opportunity to slip inside and beat the selflocking system she had climbed the stairs and knocked firmly on a secondfloor door no answer while she had waited for someone to leave the building she had checked the postbox set into the wall beside her friends name without the key she couldnt get at the post but could ascertain that the box had not been cleared the previous day not at work not at the theatre habits of reliability broken so unlike her colleague to stand them up and waste a ticket for les miserables the little she knew of barbaras life was the past an old home long left behind old relationships long discarded old parents and there was no possibility that barbara from fragrances could make her salary stretch to a flat on the second floor of this block on canada water even the downturn or the crunch had not abseiled the prices of properties that far and that fast she knocked again harder then put her finger on a bell and heard it ring behind the door across the landing a baby had started to cry she tried there the babys cry came closer and a door was unfastened a chain removed a woman accused melody its taken me two hours to get him to sleep and my husband does nights and youve woken him and melody said its my friend her across there didnt come to work yesterday no explanation im sorry i woke your baby and your husband she shrugged its just not like her are you sure shes not there the two women and the baby walked across the landing melody rapped at the door and the mother pressed the bell there was an echo from the interior i didnt hear her all yesterday im sensitive to noise my husband being on nights he does the computers for one of the newspapers across the river has to be there all night every night but its work and it pays and hes dead on his feet when he comes home and its a sod when he cant sleep i didnt hear her but he left yesterday morning he the boyfriend its his place she lives there and he visits dont know his name he left yesterday morning and i heard the door but i didnt see her melody apologised she went out of the block she walked purposefully and skirted the bus station where there was also the underground either of which would have taken her into central london but she went on she took the sharp left turn into lower road and reached the police station melody was not a woman who took lightly such a course of action but she was anxious for her colleague and it irritated her that barbara had never talked about her boyfriend she was sharp with the desk officer to the point and indicated that she wanted reassurance retirement and the decanter set with the crystal glasses didnt dull the awareness of an officer with thirty years in the service it was a complaint of deirdres that when they took holidays flew on budget lines he had a persistent near irritating tendency to create biographies for their fellow travellers more often than not if the people he had stripped bare were staying at the same hotel the italian lakes or under the swiss matterhorn she would find he had been pretty damn right in his assessments not that he ever received an apology for her criticism of his habit or for the doubts expressed but she wasnt with him and he could feel free they were up they had climbed they cruised she had taken him hours before to the early train driving there he had called vbx a privileged number and spoken briefly to alastair watson at the station on the platform she had asked triumphantly what he had forgotten damned if hed known what hed left behind she had produced then from a cavern of a handbag his pen the one from pakistan and the frontier and they had chuckled then hugged she hadnt waited for his train to arrive saying the dogs would be needing their walk just squeezed his hand an apology for tenderness and muttered something about take care of yourself and do nothing daft and gone he had acquired the pen manufactured in a back alley of the village of darra adam khel some thirty miles to the south of peshawar when he had supervised with solly lieberman the delivery of the blowpipes and had met young gillot he had selected two passengers as being of interest they would like him have made late bookings the woman was across the aisle from him in a gangway seat as he was and the man three rows in front of where he sat boarding had been uneventful the pen had gone into the little tray of loose change with the rheumatism bracelet and his house keys and had aroused no suspicion he had noted the two at the security checks didnt need the insight of the baker street fellow he reckoned the lastminute flyers were dumped in the same section of the aircraft nearest the engines the noise the toilets and the smell the womans bag had the planet protection logo benjie arbuthnot did not know shyness and stared at her with frank interest a rather pretty woman might have been elegant or beautiful if shed patronised a hair salon and a decent boutique he had no complaint rather liked the rawness of clothing skin and eyes he knew of planet protection the organisation had figured briefly on that list of ngos that was fed to embassies in the globes odder corners so that station officers could under the usual cover of second secretary trade sidle up in a bar buy large gins and lubricate a tongue if its owner had been upcountry or had met an elusive personality those ngos were regarded as friendly and were in receipt of central government funding he doubted that another passenger in the cabin had heard of planet protection and no chance that any would know what they did it was the arms trade he didnt need to be holmes or require the prompting of watson to marry up harvey gillot and the woman whose name was on a tag attached to the strap of the bag with the logo he assessed megs behan a love of the cause and therefore no man with whom to share the tedium of fighting an unwinnable war a woman with devotion and maternal love but all channelled towards some dreary little bolthole in a building that should have been condemned and was benjie arbuthnot a cruel warped old warrior he wouldnt have admitted to such charges he would have said that the glory of the cause would dull and she would become a barren lonely and boring old trout she had good bones in her face strong at the cheeks and the chin and he liked the way she sat upright good too that she wore no cosmetics and there was only a fine gold chain at her throat and studs in her ears good studs which told him they would have been a present perhaps for her twentyfirst from a family of affluence so megs behan had rejected the comfortable and conventional and had opted for the loneliness of the protest line but her redeeming feature was he identified a feisty glint in the eyes he enjoyed always had the company of women who had balls big ones and believed that might be true of this weaponstrade campaigner interesting that she knew harvey gillot the condemned wretch was heading for the cornandsunflower country inland from vukovar was on a bucket flight to be there as a witness perhaps as a tricoteuse he played the game and had kept as good a piece as he possessed to the last she had pale skin going through the security checks she had caught the eye of the man and both had looked sharply away but megs behan had blushed they had not glanced at each other since were in avoidance mode he had much to reflect on the trolley went past and he smiled at the cabin girl took three small plastic beakers from her and smiled again old and sweet and not to be argued with he poured from the hip flask he carried a nip for each beaker up from his seat he passed one across the aisle saw the shock and ducked his head as a form of greeting then went forward three rows and when the man looked up he was handed the second beaker it was done and he was gone back in his seat and had fastened his belt megs behan and the man looked at him was he a bore who couldnt mind his own business someone they should know an avuncular smile and he ignored them downed his own drink tenyearold talisker and refilled the man another who travelled to be a spectator when harvey gillot confronted his past and perhaps was killed by it a policeman he had shown his warrant card at the security check before boarding he had a policemans haircut a detectives severe but not the bald chickensarse effect tidy presentable in any company a suit that was standard dress grey and quiet a decent shirt and tie a serious face it had looked up at him when he had put the beaker on the tray and now twisted to glance back up the aisle but benjie offered nothing and didnt meet the eyes not a senior policeman too young for that a foot soldier his judgement over and above the appearance of seriousness the policeman displayed a sort of solid determination which in matters of life and of death was always valuable not a barrel of laughs he remembered the first call coming through on the phone consigned to his grandson and a scared voice theres a contract out the people who were buying the gear have raised the money and he had answered loud and comforting harvey take care and good luck he had ended with the sort of thing deirdre said when he was off to london for a day and taking a guest to the special forces club the detective would be the right sort of age with the right lack of seniority to brief the man on what waited in a shadow was behind him and always would be they were bound together on that flight the three of them he loosed the belt again and leaned across to replace the earlier tot in her beaker then went forward to do the same and never spoke a word then he dozed he thought it would be a good show and also that he was obligated to be there and to give the occasion his best effort he was thankful that deirdre had not forgotten the pakistan pen above all it would be a show not to be missed by a man playing the idiot seemed to see a mans back sharp corners and dark shadows and death had a smell that clung to his nose maybe he had wanted friendships maybe his work had denied them to him she stood back there were two police officers an older woman and a youngster and they had brought with them a maintenance man who had a mass of keys on a ring screwdrivers in a box and a drill prohibitively priced apartments melody thought but the locks on the doors were crap the man did it with the keys and didnt need his tools it opened there was a light on in the hall melody sensed stillness the woman with the baby said defiantly as if she believed her word was challenged i always hear her when she goes out but i didnt yesterday i only heard him when he left the policewoman shrugged and went inside the floor at the gold group belonged to scd intelligence harry said sometimes these things move fast and sometimes its tortoise speed this ones fast a caucasian female is found in a secondfloor flat in a new block canada wharf area shes been manually strangled the cause of death is not yet confirmed but it was obvious to the officers who attended no sign of sexual assault or interference fully clothed no evidence of burglary forcible entry the indication would be that were dealing with a domestic so far so good he had his audience hooked as if he used a barbed treble in a pikes mouth we have a name because the complainant who reported her away from work was present at the location the victim works at a department store in central london a neighbour says she moved in thirteen months ago the property is in the name of robert cairns the interventions of intelligence were rare in gold group meetings and sometimes there was scepticism at his conclusions not in that session he was heard in silence were at a basic and very early stage of an investigation there were traces of oil on the victims hands also there are similar marks oil again on the upholstery of a chair in the living room we infer that she handled an object that had been hidden from view under the chairs cushion not yet confirmed in laboratory conditions of course but the first response of an experienced forensics man is that the characteristics are of anticorrosive silicone gun oil were saying that there exists a probability that a handgun was in that chair later ending up in the hands of a woman who was subsequently strangled were getting there all of them firearms surveillance scd and hmrcs investigation unit acknowledged the importance of intelligencegathered material and knew that in its absence they were buffalo blundering in the undergrowth its all coming in i repeat myself no apologies very fast its the pedigree of robbie robert cairns that interests me his father jerry cairns is an old blagger you know what i mean maam of course armed robber with an arms length of convictions his grandfather the first of the dynasty was a villain a thief but is now too old for serious playing robbie has an elder brother with convictions for robbery car theft fencing theyre a criminal family on sheets of paper laid on the table or in personal notebooks pencils pens and ballpoints wrote cairns harry saw recognition flicker on the face of the detective inspector like memory stirred things fall into place they go into the big machines and stuff spews out first no one in that family works in a legitimate trade or has since the ark grounded but the only one who has achieved a serious degree of wealth is robbie aged twentyfive a chis says that robbie cairns will kill for a fee the chis might be lying through his front back and side teeth but it now has better relevance two more items of interest if im holding you he was he didnt often have a big moment harry milked it and thought of it as one of his finest hours what happens really quick now are the airline searches the murder squad soon as they had a name robbie cairns would have tapped it into the ticket traces had a twentyfourhour start has he used his time he flew to munich he was in munich last night and thought himself clever because he paid for a ticket onward one way to zagreb with cash but his names on the ticket and it has to be his name to match with the passport details taking that flight hes already down there is loose in zagreb thats about what i have a silence as if breath was held but a clock on a wall ticked faintly phoebe bermingham harry realised would feel it necessary to say something interesting but hardly acceptable in the central criminal court he responded and had a grin almost patronising across his face different worlds and they were cast from different moulds i like coincidence and circumstantial ive already put penny laing on the ground from the alphateam man and a sharp response lest he be forgotten from the detective inspector about now mark roscoe should be touching down weve done the appropriate grovel and the dirty raincoats will meet him when hes there whats his job description phoebe bermingham asked nothing too specific a watching brief he asked chippily the same question went on at length about not being a bullet catcher not able to do a serious job and i think he and his girl had something planned together a hike along the thames path thats as maybe i didnt do a request i ordered him on to the plane pulled rank and told him repeated twice that he shouldnt stand too close should merely observe and report back simple stuff and of course he understands that i cant see that he has a problem i can see that weve fulfilled what would be expected of us maam done whats right for gillot in his predicament i dont think maam if this should end up as an inquest and an inquiry that with our man on the ground offering advice on personal safety and liaising with local enforcement we can be found at fault and criticised it was emphasised to sergeant roscoe personally and forcibly that he should not endanger his own life thats where we are thats very fair she said rather more than gillot deserves granddad cairns had his granddaughter monitor radio stations and the rolling television news bulletins and she swore to him that if an englishman had been shot dead in munich it would be carried as breaking news or a newsflash nothing was reported until they knew the words by heart from frequency and repetition they heard of the new wave of fighting in southern afghanistan the falling level of the pound sterling the rise in unemployment the marriage of a party girl to a man three times her age a cricket score and nothing came from munich granddad cairns said it would be like the death of the family when respect was lost and she was at the radiogram working through the stations he knew that two contact numbers had been given to robbie one for munich and the other for zagreb he didnt know which fuckin country zagreb was in or where it was on a map but he realised that munich had failed because he was told so by the radio and the television neither he nor leanne was facing the window on to the walkway so they were not aware of the crowd outside until the knocker was smacked he turned sharply in his chair more years than he could remember since the police had been mobhanded at his door it was a journey like no other in harvey gillots life he was the man who had lived a dozen years on a rock promontory jutting out to sea blessed with the majesty of stunning views he hadnt seen them he found himself now to be locked to the window beside his seat as the train wound along a track sandwiched between gorge walls cliffs tumbling rivers mountains and pastures he had been to austria before on flights into vienna and would have had his nose in papers pamphlets and brochures that he needed to speedread so that he was on a level field with a customer or supplier vienna was a fight always because the germans had the bigger foothold but he had most recently bought the steyr aug armee universal gewehr mm assault rifle direct from the factory and had the enduser paperwork in place for shipment to bolivia and ecuador he had sold vests to the austrian police which was a champion deal against the competition and had once been close with a consignment of brazilianmade sniper sights that undercut the german competition but was ultimately squeezed out he had been near with a communications contract before he had flown into the capital of an evening done dinner meetings and breakfast meetings and been back on the airport train from the city centre by midmorning and in the air by noon the beauty entranced him and he had no one with whom to share it no wife no child no best friend and no business partner it had been the promise of harvey gillot to himself that he would use the quality time on the train to think through the problems of what he would do when the train bucked to a halt and he was pitched out on to a platform within a hirecar ride or a final train journey of his destination the sights from the window distracted him and he saw toytown castles perched on sheer rock stumps and heavy cattle in meadows where flowers bloomed as if it was impossible to find an answer best put it off and he did later some time he would work out the detail of the plan what he would do and why but and it nagged in him would he fight shit yes would he roll on his back with his legs in the air and submit hell no he was harvey gillot the salesman with the smile he walked his own road and made his own bed nails and all he would sort the problem just didnt know who would be waiting for him what they would say to him when he stood within spitting range it was me who did it i demanded it outside at the front a barechested boy mowed her grass at the back through the kitchen window penny laing had seen a man middleaged hoeing a vegetable plot the men didnt know what they should do i did she was again at a kitchen table and simun was beside her and behind her a woman ironed freshly washed black dresses black skirts and black blouses the certificate of clearance for mines was given and the men gathered to drink as if they had reason for celebration too many times too often they find a reason to drink or to take pills i said to them that instead of drinking they should be searching they disgusted me the translation aped her simun almost spat with her penny thought her tiny the woman might have been sixty seventy or even eighty her face showed a fretwork of wrinkles and there was the walnut brown to her cheeks that meant penny had learned a lifetime of exposure to the elements weather war and heartbreak we had found the body and the professor had given us a name i told them the men that it was owed to those who had died and to those who had suffered and survived the defeated to search for this man without me they would only have drunk more taken their money from the government and talked they would have done nothing should she curse dermot her line manager for sending her should she shriek oaths at asifs wife the woman whose natal complications had dictated penny travelled alone had done a twonight stand with a teenager and betrayed her work ethic here easily everything was certain she was familiar with the worlds of criminality that flowed around the narcotics trade and could stay aloof from it could remain detached with the status of an observer as a war in central africa was played out within a days journey for a fourwheel drive there she had been part of the lawenforcement tribe here penny laing was alone and the boys voice bitched in her ear as he translated i said to them that the man who was responsible should remember my husband to whom he gave a promise he harvey gillot should know of our agonies and should suffer punishment for them the men in the village would have done nothing but i refused to allow that she felt as if a curse had been uttered and sensed its force they found difficulties which were excuses to do nothing difficulties and problems i said we would buy a man you tell me gillot comes here you tell me that the man we paid has failed twice but he will try once more here if he doesnt earn the money we have given him our men will do it my husband died after torture my husband in this kitchen on the floor under this table told me he would trust his life to harvey gillot he did and lost his life if the men will not do it i will and so will maria and any woman who was here who had her legs forced apart who back at alpha would understand who would not criticise her in her mind were the fading photographs of men and women long dead abused and mutilated now living only in pictures in a shrine made by a broken man god where were the old rules of her life gone the womans voice was quieter now almost matteroffact and simuns tone reflected it penny could pass no more judgements but could imagine the darkness the noise of shellfire and then the dawn coming the men not back from the cornfield the depth of the loss the spectre of defeat then the flight of the men and the women staying because the wounded in the crypt could not be abandoned the advance of an enemy who had taken many casualties and the revenge she wanted it over and stood up but the crow woman would finish if he is still alive if he comes gillot shouldnt think he can smooth us with good words we dont listen to talk if he comes it is to die here they our dead demand it and so do we he will never leave here i promise that the train ground out the kilometres beyond salzburg carrying harvey gillot towards fields where the harvest had not yet been gathered and where graves had been unearthed he had settled into the rhythm of the train there would have been any other day the sense that his time was wasted that he should have flown not today harvey gillot was satisfied with his smooth slow progress through the austrian mountains the vistas exposed to him castles and valleys and little communities on hillsides surrounded by sloping meadows he could acknowledge the failure as he had frittered each hour he had promised himself that when the next one started he would begin the process of examining prospects options what he would do why he would do it when he would do it and where he would make the gesture that had brought him this far difficult to find answers when the train rolled rocked almost made a lullaby sound the windows were sealed and the airconditioning was set for comfort the effect was soporific he could have snoozed could have forgotten his destination hours slipping away and distance covered he spoke to no one not even the polite ticket attendant and when he went through to the restaurant carriage he ordered with his finger jabbing at the menu he remained aloof and alone as if he was not a part of the life and times of any other person on the train no man woman or child was the same as harvey gillot he could have gone to any highstreet bookie in england and put a hundred pounds and his shirt on the bet with good odds that no other passenger on the eurocity mimara express was under sentence of death from a community that had taken out a contract if that shirt had been put with the cash stake there would have been two neat bullet holes in the back to prove his case he could have gone into any square mile casino put a thousand in notes and one dented vest on the table and wagered that no one on the great train could share with him know how you feel harvey in the same boat so he kept his silence ignored the slow pace of life around him and failed to answer the questions posed by his presence on the train he had forgotten now about deals the buying and selling of weapons ammunition and communications equipment he no longer considered whether the mercedes or the jaguar was better value as an armoured car harvey gillot sat in his seat the sun beating against the tinted window in the bulletproof vest and the holed shirt if he came through this if he had not done games at school unless he had been subject to a threeline whip and it was only by an accident that he had once strayed into a sports pavilion and seen faded shirts in display cases worn by kids who had been picked for a national schoolboys rugby team and donated them if he was still standing walking hadnt had his head holed his guts torn open his lungs sliced and his bones splintered he would take that shirt a sort of soft lavender blue to one of those trophy places off piccadilly and ask for a case of polished wood to be made with a velvet background and his shirt pinned inside so that the bullet holes were on view hed have a little silver plaque screwed to the woodwork herbert harvey gillot pupil later arms dealer and survivor might take the thing swathed in bubblewrap down there himself and dump it at the head teachers door so that the cocky little buggers who thought a rugger pitch was bigtime could marvel at it and wonder where the blood was but he didnt know whether the old boy would return to the royal grammar school then again there might be another message on the little strip of silver herbert harvey gillot pupil later arms dealer and loser and there would be blood on the shirt which would make it more interesting he had no music to listen to he had read the magazine and the herald tribune and he never did crosswords or brain teasers he could gaze through the window see the sights and rush past people who waited at level crossings worked in fields were in cars on country roads or waited on platforms where there was no stop and know that nothing and nobody was relevant to him he was separated from them and had a rendezvous to keep did it hurt might find out and might not he didnt know if it would hurt to be shot might learn and might not he was more frightened of the pain than of the black emptiness supposed of death the option had been to live in the hole to shudder at each shadow moving each footfall behind his back and never be free of it some things were clear in his mind he wasnt going to hide for the rest of his days he would try to offload the issue of the cornfields he would beg and plead if the hair shirt had to be worn then it was for costume necessities and if he had to show penance it would be laid on with thick greasepaint he was good on the big picture but as a man had once said the devil was in the detail this was the only way he could think of to rid himself of the problem the train carried him on and its wheels made a drumbeat relentless as they went over the joins in each section of rail as if the end of the journey was inescapable a bus dropped him close to the railway station the sun beat down on him but he didnt notice it the girls walking past him were slim wearing halter tops and shorts but he didnt see them he went inside the station and found a phone booth robbie cairns had the scrap of paper in front of him the number he had rung in munich was scratched out he dialled the one that remained and waited dragging air into his lungs when he was answered he gave his name and said where he was he was told english language crisp and accented that he should come out of the station cross the road go into the park and where he should stand he walked he was never alone in rotherhithe anywhere between albion street and the disused docks of canada water he felt comfortable not alone no one would have caught his eye and smiled at him it was his familiarity with the fabric of the place that meant he didnt feel isolated there almost he yearned to hear voices not the bloody automatic ones at the airport in germany not womens voices barking at him in talk he didnt understand like a hole in him he couldnt fill no leanne no granddad cairns no vern whom hed always treated as wet shit but who now he would have grovelled for and no barbie it might be that the hole was barbie not to be called back he walked the length of a path with lawns and trees flanking it the buildings beyond were old and fine had been renovated and had flowers on the balconies he walked because he had been instructed to if a wasp had not gone up his nose if barbie was on her bloody counter and if the fucking target hadnt worn a vest he would have told anyone where they should meet him robbie cairns didnt know how he might find a friend he was in gardens now carved heads sat on squares of stone or pillars he couldnt have named a famous sculpture or sculptor birds sang from the trees so alone there was a narrow inner pathway between the mown grass and the hoed beds and he walked round it the first time would they have found her the second time would she be on a slab in the mortuary at guys the third time would the paper trail have dug up that the apartment where she lived was in the name of robert cairns the fourth time because of her was he now subject to a manhunt the fifth time because of her was he now fucked finished and isolated it is mr cairns yes he turned saw a heavybuilt man who wore a suit had good hair and a tie he thought himself tired and dirty he nodded could hardly speak the stranger a friend said follow me please mr cairns the journalist ivo gathered his papers into his laptop bag picked up his son little more than a babe in arms and kissed the small almost hairless head then hugged his wife youll be all right youll be careful always at these times she asked the same questions when he went to work and always he gave the same answers ill be all right and ill be careful better than her he knew of the bombs the shootings and the beatings that had targeted the zagreb media who didnt write about the breast implants of wannabe movie stars the girlfriends of tv gameshow presenters or the croatian footballers playing abroad but specialised in investigative reporting he knew of the danger associated with exposing corruption in the political elite and the scale of organised crime in the capital city twice he had received a single bullet through the post at his magazines offices the police the special unit the prime minister had created had assured him that discreet undercover protection would watch over him he knew of no other life he said at what time hed be home they would eat together because he couldnt afford restaurant meals he couldnt resign go elsewhere because no openings existed to a writer familiar only with corruption and criminality a last kiss and a last hug at the door ivo went to work a busy day because that evening the weekly magazine went to print twice he looked behind him and neither time did he see anything that threatened or evidence of discreet police protection it was a good landing and they were quickly off mark roscoe presumed that the speed of disembarkation was due to lack of traffic no other plane just in or about to get up and go he paused at the top of the steps the sun came up off the apron and reflected into his face and he blinked almost blinded he groped for the dark glasses in his shoulder bag and squinted around him a new airport no passengers to speak of and no visible trade he assumed some government from old europe or the imf the oecd or the world bank had dumped down a packet of cash regarding an airport at osijek as a valid investment it was shiny new like a shoe that had yet to be scuffed there had been a map on the plane in the pouch in front of him and without it he would have had trouble in working out where he was he walked into the arrivals hall his ignorance was like a blister on his heel and he cursed quietly that he hadnt made time to learn about the region and vukovar which was down the road from here the river and megs behan was close behind him he had told her harvey gillots travel plans but the breaking of an official confidence had seemed a small matter on an overnight vigil outside a high gate on the dorset coast fun being with her there here it was different he turned she was shuffling towards him shuffling because her footwear was lightweight holiday gear a floral print skirt flowed from her hips the cheesecloth blouse was thick enough to hide what lay beneath the hair was a mess he thought her a greatlooking woman and about as different from his chrissie as chalk was from the older man was behind her and came slowly as if his feet knees or hips gave him trouble he had no idea why two minuscule nips of whisky had been planted on him just enough to savour and enjoy a taste right there was not here and he had not expected that megs behan would buy the ticket her presence undercut his professionalism a little he let her reach him i just wanted you to know miss behan that this is a serious investigation were at a difficult stage in the inquiry any degree of interference would be regarded with she had that gaze mirth and a degree of like him being pompous was a letdown he ploughed on what happened in england completely different picture to now i want to stress most important that i wont tolerate any stunts you may be considering try anything and ill get the locals to throw the book at you a croat cell is rather less friendly than one in west end central as i go about my business i dont want to see or hear you he cringed at his tone chrissie would have yawned the woman megs behan looked at him and winked bloody winked so that half of one side of her face was crinkled then stepped aside to permit him to go before her to the immigration check he showed his passport no smile he assumed that the tanks had advanced this close to the city of osijek he had never seen one on the move only in newspaper photographs on television or in a cinema he had been thirteen when the tanks might have come this close and he remembered nothing of it his father hadnt talked about it and there had been no mention of it at school it would have been worse in vukovar of which then he had known nothing that ignorance roscoe reckoned had made him pompous he was given his passport and waved through a man advanced on him balding in a shortsleeved shirt with a tie drill khaki slacks and burnished shoes had to be embassy could place him but not the old beggar who had given him the whisky turned once fast and raked the queue of passengers behind he saw megs behan and the old guy their desultory conversation and couldnt make the links a hand was held out another man stood a dozen paces behind the embassy guy mark roscoe yes he was given a name didnt catch it then a card was offered but his attention was on the one who had held back and watched an envelope was produced from a briefcase and handed to him it had come through he was told on secure communications he should open it he saw a face plate or portrait size of a teenager photographed in a police station then the same face but in marginally different levels of artificial light the back of the second picture carried the stamp of feltham young offenders there was an email printout he read hi mark we believe contract for our tango given to robert robbie cairns of rotherhithe he is also wanted for questioning re murder of woman believed mistress found strangled in cairnss property talk soon cheers guvnor life had a kickback no more crap about where tanks might have been or about him being the complete newage prig real stuff real talk he shook the hand thanks very much for coming this far appreciated the local police when do i get to liaise a slow tired grin welcome mr roscoe to eastern slavonia confused im sorry i came to liaise with local forces and to lets go and have a cup of coffee mr roscoe it was explained the coffee was passable he mark roscoe was coming into the territory of the famous few its where the defence in was epic its where untrained and inexperienced men and women of the war which enabled a free state to be born fought and died at any level of public life in croatia it is political suicide to take on the veterans of vukovar they are sacred a man as i understand from my brief cheated a village of just about its entire wealth and for nearly twenty years remained anonymous to the living he has now been identified has a contract on his life for reasons beyond my comprehension that individual is now travelling here god knows what his intentions are the police locally will not protect him or cooperate with you are you following me mr roscoe if he intended to make a somewhat melodramatic gesture behind a cordon of policemen and be safe in their protection he has made a total error of judgement he is on his own should he be daft enough to come here and there will be no shield to hide behind i would also remind you mr roscoe that you have no jurisdiction on this territory to believe otherwise would be to invite comprehensive embarrassment to yourself me my colleagues and our government well as you understand im sure its a long drive back to zagreb and id like to get on good luck to you mr roscoe a final thing if this man gillot should show up i wouldnt stand too close to him life still comes quite cheap here the diplomat grimaced and shrugged as if imparting disappointing news was a necessary role of his life then backed away he stopped beside the other man who had shadowed them when they met and roscoe realised that the whisky dispenser from the aircraft was with them and seemed to share a joke and that megs behan was close to them he was on the job going at it hammer and tongs and the hereford gun club charged in through the front door and up the stairs and the joker went out from under her over the windowsill and straight into the air he landed in the garden and she was left there gagging for it and a dwarf glaswegian corporal whod reached the bedroom said in his best vernacular serbocroat madam would you like the benefit of any help i can give in finishing off what that shitface started she chucked a chamber pot at him and knocked him stone cold wonderful days hard place fo a mr arbuthnot still is just a little memory of good times the joker for going out of the window did the medial ligaments of his right knee was given twentytwo years at the hague a war criminal the corporal had concussion for a week anyway time to press on it was almost done by sleight of hand not up to a magicians or conjurors standards but expert enough as a brush contact in sokolniki park to have been missed at thirty paces by an fsb tail the package came from the other mans pocket was never fully visible and dipped like a relay baton into benjies hand then was sunk into his leather bag the man who gave him the package was the station officer from zagreb an uncle by marriage to alastair watson and old links lingered the joker with the bust knee had been a major in the yugoslav national army a regular and indicted for the killing of muslim villagers during the ethnic cleansings around srebrenica and gorazde he had been tracked down to the hateful small town of fo a where he would have believed himself safe until the reaper called but had been wrong he wouldnt have known that an intelligence officer with an impressive pedigree was in bosniaherzegovina looking to round off a career with trumpets and triumphs benjie didnt know whether megs behan understood a word of it i dont think theres much else i can do for you mr arbuthnot already its more than id dreamed possible and you say bill anders is in town excellent we can drink wine eat dinner and ill hear about dissections and autopsies on rotten meat perhaps he had played the buffoon his supreme art long enough his voice dropped its because he was an asset a useful one quietly said not a problem the voice boomed again ill tell alastair i met you couldnt get sense that you were drunk as a marquis ill tell him soft spoken what you asked for and what ive given you were authorised at vbx i have to hope there wont be disappointment go carefully chuckled laughter handshakes and they were gone benjie arbuthnot had been a big enough figure in the service to warrant a little attention when he requested it that a station officer had driven to osijek a little more than a hundred and thirty miles each way and had delivered a package was proof of the esteem in which he was held and his ability to play the bombastic idiot was undiminished with the idiot there could be an oldworld charm consideration for others a matchbox was attached to the package with sellotape and he removed it pocketed it separately he advanced on the detective i gather from miss behan that youre headed for vukovar ive a hire car booked can i offer you a lift the names benjie itll take about half an hour he liked to organise when he organised he controlled megs behan didnt consider herself a fool thought herself sharp enough to realise that benjie arbuthnot had a razor mind and decided he probably gathered up people like her and the detective it would have been a habit she fancied also that she could recognise a lie or an evasion he drove well but near the centre of the road he seemed to have confidence in overtaking lorries tankers and took no hassle from blind bends she didnt share it and twice from the back shed let out a sharp gasp roscoe had asked where did you learn speed driving mr arbuthnot fairly limited opportunities id have thought police military antihijack course a lie nowhere actually just sort of comes naturally foot down on an open road and then roscoe had asked so what brings you to vukovar mr arbuthnot an evasion a sweet smile oh just some loose ends in an old mans life that need tying before the curtain call they passed mile upon mile of fields where the corn stood tall and the sunflowers had ripened she thought that lies and evasions killed the art of conversation and wondered where in harvey gillots life this man had walked and whether he had been central to it how near was it to this road that a village had come together to pass a death sentence he was unlike any of the other men of the village that penny laing had met he waved simun away as if the boy was a dog to be put back into a kennel he had said his name was josip he had a pudgy face but it showed humanity he was shaven but wore a frayed cotton shirt with a disintegrating collar and appeared to be uncared for he gestured that she should follow him she looked back but the boy had already turned simun lit a cigarette and his face gave no indication of annoyance that she had been taken from him she gritted her teeth and scurried after josip he didnt have the same worn scarred tiredness in his eyes or the lines acidetched around the mouth or scrawniness at his throat she had seen the scars on simuns fathers body and had stared at the folded trouser leg at andrijas knee then there was tomislavs shrine and she had been in the kitchen where petar and his wife lived but couldnt speak to each other there was a light in this ones face i am not one of the heroes miss laing i am not of the three hundred and was not at the pass at thermopylae i ran away it was good english fluent idiomatic and a little sad mischief played in the eyes about as late as possible i loaded a car and went with my wife and our children i left my dog behind i am ashamed of that leaving my dog not everyone i promise you miss laing was a hero he led she followed they went up a path that was overgrown the weeds and grass brushing against her knees branches bounced off him and against her she used her arms to protect her face we have made an industry of playing victim the defence itself was truly heroic and i cannot comprehend how men and women survived so many days in such hell i could not have in zagreb where i had fled with my wife and children there were occasional snatches of film blackandwhite soft focus of the battle around vukovar longlens pictures from far across the fields we saw only smoke rising in the distance and climbing through the rain how men and women stayed alive and sane i do not know except that i was in the gaol in zagreb afterwards you should know it was for fraud not violence nothing sexual i am respectable and it was not easy but it was nothing compared to the existence here and what happened afterwards the men in the corn the women taken anywhere that a serb could drop his pants and not get his arse wet in the rain it was awful and myths were born she could see a building ahead walls that had once been white and realised then that among the grass and nettles the thistles and cow parsley were felled gravestones but they had been toppled as if vengeance had been wreaked on them the building had a roof of naileddown corrugated sheets and graffiti on the lower walls the door at the back of the porch hung crazily only the croats were victims how far back should i take you miss laing they do not speak often here of the excesses of the croat regime the ustase in the second world war the massacres at the concentration camp of jasenovac the burning of villagers inside their churches and the throwing of orthodox priests over cliffs and they do not speak often of the early stirrings of the croatian state in that spring and summer of the homeland war the creation of two tiers the second and lower for serbs it does not justify what happened here in vukovar or at ovcara but no one is only a victim you should know that miss laing they went inside what had been a church enough light came from broken windows and gaps in the roofing she listened but her eyes wandered should she feel superior she doubted it churches and chapels had been firebombed across northern ireland when the poison there as here had burst out it was only a matter of degree the painting on the wall to her left was faded but she recognised a white horse rearing a man astride with a plunging sword a dragon snarling penny laing had not expected to be in this shadowland and find a symbol of her england st george was busy dragonslaying the croat police came into serb houses and looked for the young men if they did not find them they shot dead their fathers grandfathers and uncles it happened but is not in the stories of the victims here nobody comes a few of us have in the past brought building materials and paint and made this interior respectable so that we are not ashamed we come only at night the icons were looted the murals are past repair and the roof does not keep out the winter no serb lives here and has need of a church no one wishes for a reconciliation and no lessons from conflict are learned who was she to stand in judgement a village broken shells and mortars falling snipers at work the dead not properly buried and the wounded without morphine in a cellar yet the church of the enemy was clean and polished and of course it had been broken into trashed she would have done it herself she had few certainties to lean on they went out into the light he looked at her seemed to decide whether or not she was worth sharing with and shrugged the ultimate claim for the cult of the victim is that the delivery of the malyutkas would have saved the village perhaps the town as well it is a myth i did research when i came back here the malyutka has a minimum range of half a kilometre too far it is not effective below five hundred metres it is very slow and the controller must guide its flight with a joystick his signal travelling on an unravelling wire if he is fired on and flinches he loses control the manual says that a controller of a malyutka must to be proficient have achieved more than two thousand simulated firings then fifty more every week to maintain his skill we had one man who knew a little of the weapon and no one else who had ever handled one it was for nothing there could have been a hundred malyutka missiles and the defence here would still have failed there was exhaustion hunger and too many wounded with no drugs the myths grew flesh and the legends added skin i tell you truths but no one in the village would hear them he stopped took her hand and held it he bit his lip and breathed hard i should tell you also miss laing that it was i who set in motion the process for the killing of the arms dealer i made the contacts and paid over the money given me in this small matter i take responsibility the birds sang close to them and a shadow flicked over his face she looked up in time to see the wide wingspan of a stork there was coolness in the shade of the trees and wild flowers grew among the weeds she needed certainties but she had few left to support her and you should miss laing take responsibility he let her hand fall it hung against her thigh she wanted to run and could not each word of your pillow talk your privileged information from london that you gave to the boy when you loved him and thought he loved you went to harvey gillots killer into that chain of communication from the village to him he knew today to be at munich station almost miss laing you told him yourself and he fired twice the dealer was blessed and still does not join the angels he was wearing a bulletproof vest he will come here and the killer too because you were told of gillots journey and whispered it in the sweat of loving to the boy we are told everything we are told you are a good fuck miss laing but that you are noisy you too have responsibility what will i do a small voice a husk and no certainties left she swayed is there anywhere with no myths and no legends have you heard of such a place he laughed in sadness she walked away from him quickened her stride at the end of the path she found the boy smoking she passed him ignoring him she went to where her car was parked she had been ignorant and was devastated she did not know herself ignorance granddad cairns sat on a hard chair in a dreary interview room at the back of rotherhithe police station a window barred faced on to a car park and a high wall he had been enough times in that station in that room on that chair but had never felt stripped naked what ignorance did a policeman said hes looking at a charge of murder not the attempted murder of harvey gillot on the isle of portland but the actual murder of an innocent young woman who is was not a part of the criminality your family feeds on her only guilt as we understand it was to associate god knows why with a very cruel psychopath your grandson we can do you with obstruction probably aiding and abetting maybe with perverting and if were on a bonus we might get into the area of conspiracy youd die inside mr cairns the alternative lets use language you understand mr cairns is to grass on robbie what hes done in the past what else we can nail to him everything full and frank when you think about it remember that from your dick has come a quite horrible creature he had been ignorant of his grandson never had a cairns hurt a woman never had a cairns as much as smacked a woman hed done a jewellery shop in surbiton snatched some trays and a woman had started bawling and blubbering two days later flowers had been delivered to her no one in the cairns family had ever hurt a woman he was left alone by now he reckoned in another room on the same floor of the building the same stuff would be fed into the ear of leanne loyal as they came the only one who liked the little bastard robbie but a woman had been strangled his granddaughter would have been as ignorant as himself and vern who had done a runner successful he thought of jerry banged up but hearing fast enough of what the kid had done he too would have been in ignorance it was not about thieving not about working not about dealing and fencing it was about the bastards hands round the throat of a woman he had never grassed in his life the disgrace of it grassing would kill him if nothing else did and hed be marked by it every day of his life in the albion estate he murmured at the ceiling light do me a favour kid get yourself slotted he sat on a settee only the low rumble of traffic from the street far below drifted into the room through the opened balcony windows to break the quiet robbie had been offered coffee had declined and had been shown a bottle of water an ice bucket and a glass beside a plate of biscuits he had been told that the man he should see was unavoidably detained on urgent business that he should call if there was anything he wanted and the door had been closed he sat on the settee and ignored the water and the biscuits there was a tray on the low table he ignored also the view through the open window which looked out on to the square he had walked through and the statue of the guy with the spear on the horse robbie didnt like to touch the guns on the tray but all had tags attached to them on which was written their make there was a zastava mm parabellum and beside it a ruger p then a browning high power the vigilante model last in the line was the imi jericho they had been laid out with care and made the form of a cross with the barrel tips together a filled magazine nestled alongside each he assumed he would be offered whichever he chose it would be between the americanmade ruger which appeared heavy and solid and the israelimanufactured jericho but he wouldnt be certain until he had touched them let each lie in his hand the room was furnished with quality his grandmother would have gawped at the weight of the curtains the comfort of the chairs and the polished age of the furniture while his mother would have gaped in disbelief looking at it heightened the sense of isolation as if he had no business to be there so far from the albion estate and clack street se a world away he didnt know how he could belong or how ever again he could return to rotherhithe it would be good if he had the chance to testfire as he had with the baikal then footsteps the door handle turning looked like a fucking banker from the gherkin building on the thames mr cairns welcome you have been looked after i hope you have everything you needed i apologise for asking you to wait he thought it all bullshit the journalist ivo typed at his keyboard a girl a trainee brought coffee for him he had a source in the national office for suppressing corruption and organised crime who had supplied a grainy surveillance photograph of a meeting between a minister and a bigtime player he had pictures of the former innercity school that had been sold low authorisation had been given for forty luxury apartments to be built on the site he had another photograph from a paris agency that showed a horserace winner being led towards an enclosure with the ministers wife and the criminals mistress in the background his story was authenticated and could not be killed for any reason other than the selfcensorship of survival his editor paced close to his shoulder and the stress mounted for fucks sake it was the material the magazine existed for the coffee cooled and beside it a sandwich curled his fingers danced on the keys in front of him a little to the side of his screen was the photograph he treasured of his wife and baby but he had no time as he typed to linger on them and the mood of the room changed same curtains same furniture same sunlight same people but everything had changed he had the jericho and said it was good to hold not as heavy as the ruger the zastava was not as easy in his hand he would go with the jericho the man full of bullshit who had been late smiled warmth not an old yob and not a middleaged thug but wellturnedout and his appearance ratcheted the discomfort that robbie cairns felt he reckoned his armpits would smell in the heat and maybe his crotch did clothes crumpled creased as if hed been pulled in off the street or maybe from sleeping under the arches he wanted to please and tried to look grateful he said again that the israeli one would be good there had been difficulties he was not asked but told there had been robbie cairns did not deny it a smooth gentle voice but the threat lay in it there had been failures twice there had been not disputed money had been paid and doubts now existed he accepted that but would earn what he had been paid the sun had gone and the mood had swung and there was an edge to the smooth voice the suggestion that he was rubbish his reputation built on sand he should be tested nothing wrong with him the voice was not raised he should be tested to see if he knew how to handle a weapon and how to fire he did honest not a problem and tested to see if he had a killers nerve or if he had it once but had lost it his nerve was good he swore it he heard low laughter behind him turned sharply he had not known that three men and a woman were in the room lined against the wall beside the door the sweat ran down his neck and his back trapped at the waist by the trousers and belt the laughter was not with him but at him robbie cairns understood he was a toy to them and they made sport of him the man said we must wait then you will show us mr cairns whether the nerve holds or is lost whether you can still earn what you have been paid the tray was taken out and the room emptied he was again alone he wanted a beer then a shower and he came into the hotels bar a day used up a schedule further damaged and he hankered after the action that had caused him to cancel and rearrange his itinerary the day had not been wasted four hundred metres east of the massacre site further away from the ovcara agricultural sheds they had discovered three more cadavers could have been half a dozen reasons why those bodies had not gone into the deep pit dug for the two hundred theyd slaughtered always liked a beer after excavating a body and before the shower and he saw them a hippietype woman another who was more formal and had her head down a man in a suit and the old beggar himself the lion of fo a who was holding court with bottles and glasses the smile split his face he called across the bar heh arbuthnot what brings a hasbeen spook to these parts let me guess it my god the purveyor of fine meats himself still well hung anders im guessing youre going to sign up as a probationer candidate for the vulture club that i chair free membership good to see you youre still full of shit arbuthnot and i assume are still pulling strings wouldnt be right here without you they hugged the shower was put on hold introductions were made and for new recruits the vulture club would be explained the editor told him it was good the journalist ivo knew that this edition would sell and that powerful men would find cause to curse his name when they read his copy the editor slapped his back no reason for him to stay longer and wait for the first editions to come off the presses he preferred to be with his wife eating at his own table he realised the importance of what he had written his country was a democracy sought entry into the european union and was dogged by the ravage of corruption and organised crime it was bankrupted by the global downturn and needed a hole in the head to be regarded as a haven for gangsters and fraudsters he sensed the nervousness around him because of the enmity of influential men the whole office was aware of the cover dominated by the single word corruption he rang his wife told her he was leaving and would be home in half an hour out on the street under sparse pavement lights he looked warily in each direction then stepped out he saw the figure first as a shadow a whistle followed from far down the street the shadow disintegrated under a light became a man not an old man but young and walking purposefully not running from behind robbie cairnss arm was squeezed light steps edged away from him and he was again alone in front of robbie was the street that the man would cross then a parking area for the highrise block behind him where his guide had stood had spotted for him and squeezed his arm was the entrance to the block the lobby area and the lifts he took the jericho from his inside pocket they had told him when he had signified his choice that the weapon was considered by many to have an equal only in the glock and they had patronised him with congratulations it was all shit and he had nowhere to turn nothing had been said of the man who approached one hand in a pocket and the other holding a cigarette he had no name no occupation and robbie had not been told why this man was condemned and he was condemned or robbie might as well turn the bloody thing on himself shove the barrel into his own mouth feel the gouge of the sight against the ridges above his tongue and pull the fucking trigger not just squeeze it as he did when he needed accuracy but yank it down no other way and there hadnt been since the wasp had gone into his nose he cocked it the man came to the road hesitated predictable natural to look to the right before stepping off a pavement and to the left but he did not look either way for traffic but instead twisted half turned and glanced behind him he would have seen a deserted road and thought that danger didnt exist the man crossed the road the gun was in his hand cocked and the safety was off a mm shell was in the breech and he knew nothing of the man who came towards him and maybe would look ahead and try to strip darkness and cover from the angled corners of the entrance into the block and did not there was a shout not a warning robbie didnt understand the words knew they were a greeting who called to him with love barbie hed forbidden it never leaned from an open window showed herself and blew him a kiss it was a welcome from above and the man no longer looked for movement in dark corners he thought himself home secure robbie took one step forward and the man hardly seemed to see him robbie fired did a double tap it was a killing to perfection both shots to the head and life extinguished by the time the body had fallen to the pavement he was going away briskly when the screaming started above and behind him he didnt run he thought he ruled again and that the past was gone robbie cairns reckoned he had done well had proved himself lights came on all around him and men moved slowly frightened towards the blocks entrance and he walked as if nothing had happened that involved him he went to the corner of the block and ahead of him a cars lights flashed recognition he came off the train there was noise around him and harvey gillot heard the garish accent of the north of ireland a couple of dozen from the province were on the platform yelling their presence and he saw their football scarves power to you he murmured he heard sirens wailing he had the strap of his bag over his shoulder and walked well though stiffly past the food outlets then out into the evening and on to zagrebs streets the football people went another way and he lost them then it had been raining and there had been sleet in the air he had walked from the smart hotel a great cavern from a century before gone out through the swing door and hitched up his collapsible umbrella the doorman had been solicitous about its effectiveness against those elements it was a damn good hotel and had once been home a sleeping place and an interrogation unit to the gestapo it was to his left and he thought it had been cleaned but the lines hadnt changed he struggled to remember what route he had taken that night there was a straight street with hotels and embassies boutiques closed with subdued lighting on womens clothing a restaurant and he came to the square where a soldier rode a horse and waved a sword fountains played trams rumbled and more memories stirred twice he looked behind him and checked for a tail but didnt see one had there been one had he been in a box of six men and women had he been tracked by motorcycles he wouldnt have been surprised there was a dark street at the end of which there was a sculpture of great blackened marble balls fused but harvey gillot didnt know that he had walked past the doorway of an intelligence agency and that each step he took was followed there was a small square paved with bricks where a fullsize figure in darkened bronze leaned against a pissoir and a little beyond a bookshop still open he went inside he had no business buying books in croatian perhaps it was to talk that he crossed the threshold but the buds of memory ripened again he had been here a man greeted him and a cigarette hung loose from the upper lip harvey gillot told the man he had been at the shop in and there was a smile english spoken he had been here harvey gillot said at the time of vukovar and the mans smile was wiped it is a dark corner we believe there was a treason vukovar was sold it was the deal that was done he was sure he remembered the shop and pausing at its window rain sluicing on to his umbrella he climbed higher and reached as he had then the cathedral a wider square and a christ figure that was floodlit high on a plinth and fountains he had stood on a slab in front of the cathedral and killed three minutes or four had allowed the quiet of the place to play round him now that evening he walked into the gift shop beside the doorway and a nun greeted him would have recognised his englishness and told him firmly she was about to close he said that he had been there in at the time of the battle for vukovar she was tiny he might have snapped her apart with two hands broken her it could have been stopped the west could and should have they were betrayed and the government did nothing it was allowed to fall and the people were allowed to die it was deceit the nun was no more than five feet tall and waved him away with an imperious gesture harvey gillot couldnt have said why he had spoken the name of vukovar to strangers or what he had hoped to learn he knew he was close and old memories returned the flower fruit and vegetable markets had closed and the last of the stallholders were washing down the slabs under their pitches but that night the rain had done it for them he saw the cafebar in the sidestreet there was a brighter light shining from it than there had been on a november night and tables and chairs were outside he was drawn there a bloody moth he was confused the counter had been ripped out replaced stained wood had given way to plastic and chrome an old man had been behind the counter guarding bottles glasses and a display cabinet of tired sandwiches now two girls were there hanging out with bright lipstick and heavy eyeshadow and the coffee machines were new he went inside and asked for coffee did he want latte or cappuccino if they had been born then they would have been carried in arms there was bright light bright music from america and brightfaced girls looked at him with a growing impatience latte cappuccino or perhaps mocca from yemen he cited the privilege of the customer changed his mind and asked for a beer he was given no choice a budweiser bottle was opened and passed to him he drank it from the neck as he had that night and then a neat scotch the man zoran a schoolteacher had hollow legs he had worn oncedecent grey slacks that had no shape and were mudspattered and a foul filthy shirt a tie a sweater with earth smears an overcoat and muddy shoes he had thought then that the man had dressed to impress he had come from the conflict zone and sought to keep up appearances he was unshaven and his eyes were hollow sunken but had rare life in them drank beers and chasers talked about the deal and shook hands on it a plastic bag was passed then set down on the vinyl flooring worn almost through by his feet what was in the bag everything we have enough to pay for fifty malyutka kits it has to be enough we have no more to give how was it where he had come from we survive we exist with the malyutkas we will survive better exist longer subject closed he had drunk with an educated middleaged man who had walked through a cornfield with a plastic bag but had no war stories no derringdo crap how many times with solly lieberman had he sat across a table or perched on bar stools and listened to men telling herotales and thinking the world should stop and listen what did the guy want to talk about a wembley win for tottenham hotspur in the spring how they would do under the new owner and they talked about football and harvey gillot knew nothing about it and didnt like to tell the man that football bored him they had drunk some more then gone over for a last time slower because of the drink the arrangements for ferrying the gear across the cornfields and into the village one budweiser and a couple of whiskies then out on to the cobbled street then he had held the plastic bag the man zoran had caught his face in two hands kissed him on each cheek and was gone he had seen the man pause near a streetlight and turn to wave the rain cascading off his face then he had lost sight of him it was a bright night a good piece of the moon showing and the stars were up and clear he was glad he had climbed the hill and found the bar and he started off down the same street as hed used that night on which the schoolteacher had walked away his chin shook and his cheeks were wet as they had been then when it had rained he went to find a taxi and negotiate a price neither of them had spoken to him the guy who had come into the park found him by the statue heads and walked him to the apartment was in the passenger seat he had been with him when he had chosen the jericho he was still in the suit his tie not loosened not a hair out of place the driver was the same size and dressed in the same way theyd talked among themselves quietly in their own language but had not addressed robbie it was a bmw a black sports utility with tinted windows robbie assumed it was armourplated the bossmans wheels his personal driver and personal muscle they had been for the last halfhour on side roads with deep potholes that had made it lurch not that he would have slept when they had stopped at a fuel station his door had been opened and the muscle had pointed to a lit sign at the side of the building the toilets when hed come back hed been given a bread roll spiced ham and a bottle of coke hed thanked them and they hadnt responded there had been heavy traffic tankers and lorries with trailers on the main highway but the road they used now was deserted they made good speed and on bends the headlights speared across fields of highgrowing corn miles of it the last place they had been through hed seen the name was marinci a onedrag place with a crossroads in the middle and a church a shop few lights and none of them bright they had come to a road bridge and robbie had seen the signs in an overgrown field a white skull and crossbones on a red base they bumped hard going over it and he was still wondering what the sign meant when the vehicle swung hard left didnt follow the pointer to bogdanovci there was a new nameplate but it came too fast for him he thought it was near to the end of the journey the road they went on was narrower further to his left and sometimes picked up in the lights there was a high treeline as there had been at the bridge and the surface was poorer there was a dull glow of lights ahead they came into the village if he leaned forward he could see the satnav screen built into the front panels now the cursor closed on the red arrow that would be end of the road the destination a man had stepped forward from the shadows and was caught in the headlights he was supported by a crutch and his right trouser leg was folded short at the knee a woman followed him and robbie saw a face with no emotion her arms were folded across her chest the driver braked words were spoken robbie cairns couldnt understand them his door was opened he stepped out ground his fingernails into his palms did that to regain his concentration who am i what am i he was robbie cairns from rotherhithe he was top man he had taken a contract had been headhunted was big important this it then he said this where were going he took a couple of paces forward the man on the crutch didnt move towards him and the woman kept her arms tight across her chest he realised that the driver had kept the engine ticking over and now the muscle slammed the door at the back gave a sharp wave towards the darkness then was back in his own seat and closing his door the bmw did a threepointer backed on to the grass in front of a house and spun its lights were in robbies face and he blinked then all he saw were the taillights going away fast for fucks sake dont you wait he shouted after them dont you take me back where the fuck am i the brightness out of his eyes robbie cairns saw the faces of those whod waited for him they were on a veranda with a dulled interior behind them then he saw the chrome of the coffee machines at the back and the poster adverts for coke and fanta there were metal tables and lightweight chairs all taken eyes peered at him where it had started did they own the contract had they hired him better clarity on the faces and most were mens but a few were womens only one was young and smoothskinned robbie held tight to the charlton athletic bag and in it was the tool of his trade not a fucking hammer or a plumbers wrench or a spirit level or pliers or a spanner but a jericho handgun he was in the back end of nowhere right so what happens he called defiant what happens now that im here he heard the scrape of the chairs then the hissed breathing of those with smokers chests there was the flash of a match as a cigarette was lit and the faces seemed old worn and weathered they made a circle about him they moved he moved the young one said they think you are shit they have been told they wasted money in buying you they believe now that gillot is coming they could do the job for which they paid you they say that this is when they see whether you are shit or whether you will earn their money they are veterans of war the money paid to you was from loans advanced against disability pensions they are poor people if you fail again they will kill you and they will kill gillot and they will bury the two of you together it is not far that we have to walk he was alone the young one had slipped away from his side and seemed seamlessly to rejoin the cordon ring around robbie they had only the moons light to guide them they left the village and went by a high wall there was a gate in it and above the gate in silhouette a cross he assumed it to be a cemetery would they bury him there or in the fucking fields that closed in on them big crops rising to above their heads they walked men women and robbie cairns in the watery light along a path that led through the cornfields and far ahead an owl screamed she wrote her message finished it revised it was satisfied and read it back for a last time to dermot team leader alpha from penny laing location vukovar croatia subject harvey gillot message i find no evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of harvey gillot arms dealer in connection with alleged sale of weapons to a village community near vukovar the events of remain confused and few opinions can be considered objective also the passage of time has dulled memories the only individuals other than gillot who were party to a deal if indeed there was one were killed that autumn and neither left a written record i recommend that i observe matters here for the next twentyfour hours in accordance with gold group requirements then pull out and return to london regards etc she pressed send the bar beckoned shed noted that refugees from hmrc turned to alcohol when a career went turnip the same when a police officer realised his job might be crap and she had seen it with a diplomat at the embassy in kinshasa who had lost faith in finding anything worth nailing a flag to the thought of hunting down harvey gillot turning up at his door at dawn and the guys having the battering ram to break it down a dog barking a woman screaming and the power of stripping away dignity had thrilled her the experience of lying under a teenage boy or on him letting his tongue and fingers roam free had been as brilliant as anything she had known they were gone sod it nothing special about her not blessed and drink beckoned she snapped off the laptop and let it power down touched her hair applied a light coat of lipstick switched off the light locked the door and went down the hotels stairs penny laing heard i fancy i see another recruit this rate if were to stay exclusive well need to blackball a few he saw her look at him wouldnt have known who she was had not the hippiestyle girl little miss megs murmured the name and then a limited biographical sketch god her from revenue and customs alpha team and hunting bloody gillot penny laing be standing room only to watch the bastard show himself benjie grinned he ruled he had before theyd adjourned to eat when he had taken the central chair at the long table in the dining room bill anders on one side of him and the truculently amusing steyn on the other back in the bar he still held his audience enjoyed himself and kept the staff busy arbuthnot thought her a woman in need of humouring she looked as though she had just walked into a bloody great brick wall dont think were going to have room for many more i understand youre miss laing please join us come along and ill take your application for membership he would have appeared he knew it and rejoiced a buffoon who had drunk too much but he had extracted from each of them everything concerning their presence at the groundfloor bar of the lav hotel in vukovar which was in the far northwest of eastern slavonia a glass was brought for her local wine was poured she wasnt offered a choice and didnt seem to resent it he thought she looked ready to do damage to the bottle and to anyone who interrupted contradicted challenged her did she know everybody she shrugged did she know miss megs behan campaigner extraordinary against the evils of the arms trade and representing planet protection did she know detective sergeant mark roscoe of the metropolitan police a firearms officer without a weapon and an investigator without authority did she know professor william anders forensic pathologist from california and did she know dr daniel steyn general practitioner dabbler in psychology and resident in this town and himself im benjie arbuthnot long put out to grass i just happened to be passing through these parts and was able to give a lift in a hire car to cheers miss laing could have been aussie lager on a hot day barely tickled her throat and the waiter was back with the bottle he sensed the enormity of her failure i understand that harvey gillot is the cement that binds us and what happens tomorrow i have all these excellent people signed up miss laing for membership of the vulture club probably well have a tie designed for sergeant roscoe and myself bill and daniel and maybe a square silk scarf for you and miss behan does that appeal there was chemistry now and volatility the links were known to him roscoe behan laing anders and steyn all were tied to harvey gillot who had been not only his asset but something more than a friend i thought the vulture club with an emblem of the griffon type would be appropriate you see miss laing the vultures hang around and wait for a corpse to feed from they dont have much of a life if there are no corpses available they spend a fair part of their lives sitting perched or flying high waiting for a killing i think they have a sense that tells them where to be when to be there what sort of dish might get served up fascinating isnt it to be waiting and watching for a death so that one is on hand while the meal is still warm you must give me your address miss laing so that when were back in london i can send you a scarf when theyre really hungry and the corpse is big enough they get right inside the carcass and feed there we dont need that we all had an excellent dinner well thats enough about that so welcome miss laing to the vulture club and ill consider your subscription paid he took her hand shook it with a certain formality then gave her the floor another bottle was brought she knew them all and he was the only stranger among them she said that two attempts had already been made on the life of harvey gillot that he had survived an attack that morning because he had worn a bulletproof vest that a final attack was planned for the morning and benjie arbuthnot saw in her eyes that his image of a griffon vulture perched in a dead tree or wheeling high on the thermals had struck home itll be a good show he said better than a hanging or a stoning in iran because of the unpredictability he chuckled thought he knifed them he chaired the club and had the right to his responsibility was the greatest of all he laughed again brayed the voice came from far back in the lobby last time hed heard the man there had been a stammering whine in it not now good evening you have a reservation for me the name is gillot harvey gillot just one night no thank you i dont need help with any bags please can i book a call for six benjie arbuthnot did not twist in his seat and stare opposite him megs behan god there was fire rank animosity a blaze of enmity stiffened he said slowing down are we cant have that in the rulebook the vulture club keeps going all night before a killing and a feed he clapped his hands above his head and the waiter scurried to him when he came away from the desk his key in one hand plastic bag in the other a town map squashed under his arm he saw the waiter going to a group no eye contact but he recognised roscoe didnt remember meeting the taller and smarterdressed of the women but of course he hadnt forgotten the maniac the obsessive the crusader with the bullhorn there were two older men who peered at him as if captivated by his appearance and he saw benjie arbuthnot recognisable unforgettable from years back make a halfturn in his chair and reach up to scribble on the receipt pad that the waiter had brought with the bottle couldnt have said that hed expected him to be there the big man was obviously holding court and in control he grimaced and left the desk he gave no sign of recognition to arbuthnot nor was rewarded with one so all of them in place and a few other camp followers tucked in for company he thought across the bar space and the lobby that roscoe tried to touch him he gave nothing back and no response to megs behan the bullhorn woman but there was hostility in her and triumphalism none of them could have said he had gone towards them with arrogance or something craven to go to the stairs he needed to turn his back on the group good move brilliant he went slowly took time with each step they would all have seen the drilled holes in the jacket over his spine he recalled that he had been told he couldnt sit around make funeral arrangements and check his will he went up the stairs hed been told hed be a fugitive for the rest of his days unless he travelled he came out on to the firstfloor corridor the alternative was looking over his shoulder for the rest of his days he checked the rooms numbers and kept walking the instruction had been that he should face and confront it he found the door put in the key and turned the lock he thought a promise had been kept he had asked benjie arbuthnot where he would be not too far behind you for my sins there and thereabouts one promise made and another kept he closed the door behind him the only one he would trust was benjie arbuthnot no one else he didnt know if in the morning he would be pickled and hungover or sober and clearheaded there was no one else he could trust the curtains were open and the moons wash flecked the river the ripples from its current made silver threads in a direct line from his window to the river a land spit divided the marina of pleasure boats from the tributary that flowed into the danube and at its end was the white cross of carved stone maybe it had been a private quarrel maybe he had no business there maybe the wrong was too great for penance he dumped his jacket on the chair stripped off his shirt and threw it over the jacket the holes looked big and black he slipped the velcro straps and shrugged out of the vest letting it fall at his feet he thought it had done him well had brought him there his body ran with sweat from the day in the train the walk in the city and the ride to the town he slipped out of his underwear and kicked off his shoes and socks he flopped on to the bed he didnt know where else he should have been he hardly knew the place from the taxis windows he had seen a high water tower with holes in its brickwork and a few collapsed homes but had gained no sense of life here nineteen years before nor had wanted to near to midnight a small breeze came through the window touched the curtain drapes and played on his skin he shivered they showed contempt for him he had been brought to where the cross was rough wood planks nailed together no craftsmanship beads on strings chains id cards and football pennant flags hung from it and photographs in sealed frames that might have been waterproof it had been made clear to him that this was where he should wait he had subsided onto the ground recently ploughed he still sat there had not moved except to shiver it was not the cold that made robbie cairns shiver he was near the treeline and could hear running water the swirl of a slowmoving river rounding snagged treetrunks the shivering was from what else he heard not the river the owls shrieked it had started with one which had been joined by a throatier bird then a third one had flown past him low and big and silent and had been within a few feet of him hed flinched and flung up his arms to cover his face the fox had come near there had been a scouts group at school in rotherhithe and the cubs had met in a hall one evening a week twice a year for the scouts and once for the cubs they went camping somewhere in kent hed never gone near it hadnt envied the few whod joined he hadnt slept outside under the skies clear or cloudy in his life when he was young and his dad wasnt away they had gone to a guest house on the south coast or to a caravan depended on the familys finances he hadnt liked the caravan and undressing where his brother his dad or mum or leanne might see him the fox had come within six feet of him closer than the owl had flown had been wary robbie cairns quivered he was frightened a stalking fox and a swooping owl were beyond his experience he could look back on the last days hours and recognise that the fear had been in him to different degrees since he had come out of the bedroom and seen her with the questions in her eyes and the baikal pistol in her hands he had been free of it only for those moments when he had been on a step to a highrise apartment block a whistle had sounded and the target had come what was left to him respect he didnt think he would ever walk again along albion street lower road gunwale street or needleman street wouldnt see again where brindle had been shot by the hitman where george francis had been dropped or where he wanted to be left with respect theyd say in the pubs of rotherhithe bermondsey and southwark that robbie cairns had been a top man had been chosen for a top job with all the international links big stuff for a big man hed followed his target half across the world and had done what he was paid for and didnt imagine the end just did the talk in the streets he knew and the respect he had earned there he shivered and leanne would walk tall and be pointed out as his sister and shed have pride in him because of respect nothing would stop the shivering and then the fucking fox moved again he thought of leanne clung to her she said to the detective thats it all the dates thats what hes done she pushed the paper across the table a denunciation in her girlish uneducated handwriting thank you leanne very sensible he hurt a woman didnt he strangled her he should be taken out to epping and hung in a tree slow so hell dance late on past midnight moths floundered against the cafes dimmed lights and the principals of the village determined the day ahead they knew where gillot would come from and where he would walk to and expected that on the way he would attempt to smoothtalk them or bluster because that was what the woman had told simun they knew where the hired man would be had left him there to be decided where they would be some sat some stood some paced in the street below the veranda all would have recognised that the village faced a huge moment mladen was the leader but there were no bureaucrats to rubberstamp what he told them each suggestion he made faced contradiction dispute argument and he would let marias opinions counter tomislavs he would hear the grated complaints of the widow while petar claimed that the spilled blood in the cornfield his sons gave him precedence and simun brought his father a bundle of paper the order forms from the cafes wholesale supplier and petar tossed him a stubbed pencil he wrote the words boldly kukuruzni put he drew sharp strokes fast sketch lines recalled old memories the winding path of the river the vuka and the village of luza which he did with a squiggle of house shapes they had come off the street below the veranda and the widow maria and petars wife had chairs at the table mladen used the rest crowded close to him hemmed him in his boy gave him a redink ballpoint the route was drawn the cornfield road lived again for all of them she said where she would be would she be able to walk that distance back she demanded it on the paper mladen drew a tiny square to mark the position of the sixtyfiveyearold wehrmacht bunker the place where the track began and wrote the name of zorans widow he drew the route its angled turns and where it went close to the trees that had hidden the snipers andrija said he would be there and past the house with no roof where maria would be tomislav chose a place close to her the line went to the north of the scribbled shapes that were homes in bogdanovci indefensible once the village had been overwhelmed and he found a place for petar who would be with his wife and wrote their names he took for himself the place where the hired man had been left where the cross was planted when the village principals had been allocated their places he allowed others who pressed close to him to say where they wanted to be some jostled him jogging his writing memories were stirred on the map at either side of the red line mladen wrote the names in pencil made an avenue he spoke gravely the places awarded were to be held there should be no stampede in pursuit of the man he should be followed until he reached the place where the widows husband petar and tomislavs sons and andrijas cousin had waited where they had died and had been buried then it was work for the hired man a query was raised and a growled wave of approval followed it why did they need the hired man an outsider he answered that complications might follow that investigations would inevitably be started that consequences might include arrest and trial that payment had been made and that it was cleaner thus he looked around him there was one man only from whom the leader would accept advice where was josip he searched the shadowed faces for the onetime fraudster with connections in the dark corners of organised crime and saw him far back and against the counter the face was impassive and the eyes showed neither support nor criticism as if josip disowned himself they shuffled off into the night like him many would go into their homes or down their gardens to sheds or into bushes where a pavement slab was almost obscured and bring out or dig up the clothing they would wear and what they would carry walking with simun mladen could reflect that his planning for the morning would give the village what it craved a spectacle it was necessary for a leader to satisfy such cravings but he couldnt comprehend why gillot would come she thought him undeserving of charity and herself without mercy she was tipsy but she could take a line on the carpets pattern and walk straight along the corridor when she had left the group she had gone past the desk and had asked mr gillots room number she had been given it and then had gone to her room what she would do was uncertain that she would do something was not first thing a hard knock on the door repeated twice she stood her ground and listened heard a muffled voice who was there megs behan was there what did miss behan want to talk with him to see him a clearer voice what did she want to talk about about you mr gillot to see how youre facing up to whatll happen in the morning she supposed the threat was implicit that she would stand four square in the hotels corridor shout slogans as she had outside the house on the isle of portland and wake every guest not still in the bar she had the slogans clear in her mind and the alcohol had loosened any inhibitions she would bawl them well he was going to be killed in the morning and she had no compunction about making the last night of his life awful she gathered her breath readied herself and the door opened no warning hadnt heard a footstep just a sheet round him almost a smile a gesture she should come in definitely a smile she stared into it the smile was on his lips but also in his eyes and it mesmerised her there was halflight in the room from the moon the sheet was loose and she couldnt say how secure it was on his hips tried to sound casual just wanted to know how you were you know because of whats happening in the morning theyll kill you no talk just kill you no fucking about what i thought mr gillot was she paused gave him the opportunity to rail at her nothing what i thought was this how many men women and children in africa the middle east central america afghanistan pakistan and iraq are going to die tomorrow having been killed by weapons that you supplied still the smile no answer come on mr gillot have a sporting guess how many tomorrow how many the same day that they kill you for cheating a drink miss behan the sheet was lower at his waist less secure and he moved across to a cabinet opened the door revealed the builtin fridge and bent down she said i suppose the defence of people like you is if i dont sell the guns someone else will thats pathetic or are you going to say its not guns that kill but the people handling them its got mould on it how about i never do anything outside the law and i pay my taxes with ice or water both or straight dont you try and divert simple enough question its a disgusting trade and anyone with half a degree of honesty and decency would acknowledge she had barely realised it the drink was in her hand she thought that if he took another step the sheet would fall to the carpet but he sat on the end of the bed she hovered above him and launched in again but its not often that the biters bitten and its you looking at the end of a barrel she swigged felt the whisky raw in her throat she edged towards him as if that would help her dominate and destroy and maybe therell be a second two seconds when youre in the same place as all the victims of those guns you sold knowing what it is to be she tripped the scotch flew up the glass tipped in her hand and she was half on the bed she saw what shed stumbled on a dark mass he reached forward picked it up and he held it where the silver moonlight came through the window he said it was his vest he pointed at the black blotches and said a handgun had fired twice at short range without it he would at worst have been dead and at best a quadriplegic you lived what of those who did not killed by your guns any answers the sheet was off him he took the glass from her crouched once more in front of the cabinet tossed another miniature into the bin and gave it back to her he sat on the bed and didnt cover himself have you seen what your profits achieve have you actually been to war yourself or do you just hide in luxury hotels and never ive never heard a shot fired for real except at me otherwise weapons are a commodity for me miss behan that is disgraceful disgusting and she hesitated didnt know what else would insult him i buy and sell and most of those i sell to ordinary people not governments and army generals are pretty grateful for what they get just despicable that was the word she was irked because he sat still and naked on the bed in shadow and didnt respond she drank and wondered how it was to wear a vest and have two shots fired into your back ive never been in a battle sorry and all that the smile broke through again broad and almost affectionate you have im sure been in more battles fights conflicts lowintensity stuff insurgencies border skirmishes than ive had hot dinners you wouldnt lecture me on the evils of arms dealing if you hadnt known warfare at first hand utterly irrelevant this isnt some sort of interrogation miss behan you can decline to answer and keep your fingernails ill try again she flushed might have been the sight of his body or the scotch youre serving up bullshit clever crap you good on freedom miss behan what does that mean more bull and crap freedom you could say that i deal in freedom miss behan his head was down and his voice was soft that is ridiculous ever had a guevara tshirt doubtful not knowing where it led and brittle once and wore it until it fell apart washingmachine fatigue great face che guevara great symbol a freedom fighter miss behan heroically standing against fascist dictatorships and military juntas great guy what did he fight with miss behan might have been a toothbrush might have been a hammer from a hardware shop might have been a scouts knife or it might have been the weapons that he was sold likely at cut price via the cuban government you cant say that she didnt know what he could or couldnt say the whisky burned in her beyond the window the river ran silver and the stone cross was proud clean and brightly lit and the smile on his face was for her the mujahideen in afghanistan were fighting soviet occupation and tyranny and i was arming them ive had gear brought on the backs of mules through the chechen mountains from georgia because people wanted the freedom you take for granted in your book i suppose there are good guns and bad guns justifiable bullets and murderous bullets i dont make such judgements i dont have a check list and tick off boxes because the newspapers and your organisation tell me that one side in each conflict is good and the other bad the majority of the trading i do is in the interests and aims of hmg her majestys government uses taxpayers money to shift firepower around where its needed in the furtherance of policy didnt you know that she bridled youre confusing me not difficult i dont think youve ever been to war i think youre just a keen paperpusher but i think also youre too old to be messing with jargon posters and placards i think you know small things only because from big things comes doubt she finished the glass she stepped over the vest on the carpet and was close to him he made no effort to cover himself she thought she recognised fatigue but the smile came through and lit his face of course his responses were rubbish and insulting to her intelligence of course without the scotch she could have stood her corner and argued him to the floor what derailed her certainties was that he seemed so indifferent to her attacks and so relaxed in his answers he didnt fight her and an image came into her mind the man in her picture had dark hair most likely dyed and a warriors moustache he wore a heavy black overcoat against the night cold and was pushed forward by masked men until the noose came into the phones lens voices were raised and abused him that new years eve she had been in a hackney pub tanking with friends before a party the television had blared the insults thrown at the fallen president as he was pushed on to the scaffold she had choked at the sight of it and had looked away from the execution of saddam hussein she had thought the transmission obscene and frankly it had buggered up for her the supposed night of celebration the deposed dictator had not cringed had not shown fear she felt then ashamed the idea of an argument on the evils of the international arms trade with a man who would die in the morning seemed to her to degrade she could have argued and won but he would be bloodied broken battered dead before the sun was high ill see you tomorrow maybe maybe not i expect ill see you tomorrow miss behan its what im aiming towards she didnt understand and didnt know how to react she could turn and head sharply for the door slam it after her she could sit on the bed beside him and talk the politics of universal disarmament she could stand by the window and wait for the sunrise or she could have another drink roll a cigarette and do the vigil she thought then that he slept she fetched red wine vodka gin and a tin of tonic went back to the bed took one side of it careful not to wake him and settled without touching him she pondered which bottle she should open first as she made the cigarette and lit it they would kill him in the morning before they did so he wouldnt beg or plead she supposed it would be a release from the burden of being condemned the drink slipped down well and he slept cleanly his breath regular she knew what time the phone would ring with the call but thought dawn would be with her first it was still dark when the party broke up and the last stragglers headed for bed backslaps and minor hugging from william anders for benjie arbuthnot roscoe watched he thought their embrace ostentatious and that they shouldnt have behaved as if this was an alumnae reunion but their talk had been heavy with nostalgia where they had been whom they had known which warlord had slaughtered what community and where the soviets had fouled up he thought the occasion had merited some solemnity he had been told why the forensic pathologist was on site but the matter of arbuthnots appearance had not been dealt with he couldnt imagine what brought a retired spook to the backwater of vukovar but his time would come and anderss sidekick dan steyn had left an hour earlier in a pretty awful state roscoe had seen his headlights traverse the bar windows hed liked him and thought the man gave a decent appraisal of the town and its atrocity but it had been blackedged and without optimism the woman from revenue and customs had been late leaving them but little megs behan had gone early he rather envied her common sense in heading for bed before the others had hit the heavy drinking funny old world but he reckoned megs behan was the pick of the bunch she had a cause and made sacrifices for its integrity hed liked her all that irked him was her blatant satisfaction at having booked a seat for the mornings show he had almost admired her onewoman stand at the house mark roscoe would have claimed he could recognise a fraud at fifty paces and the honest people who had principles worth sticking with he rated megs behan in that slot he didnt know about revenue and customs he had found her monosyllabic in her answers on the detail of the village unhelpful there was obvious to him some disaster in her recent past but he had neither time nor the inclination to probe and he stood to shake anderss hand after the clinch had been broken and wished the man well for whatever sleep was still available he refilled his glass with flat mineral water from a bottle it was three hours minimum since he had drunk wine and he thought benjie arbuthnot had shown similar abstinence and done it cleverly others glasses filled and him passing the bottle round but not topping his own they were alone roscoe wondered how long it would be before a woman came round with a vacuumcleaner and how long before the waiter asleep on his arms at the bar would shudder and wake roscoe was good at missing sleep could survive on catnaps but he admired the older mans stamina should i know mr arbuthnot why youre in vukovar i mean all the crap about the vulture club and the grandstanding doesnt tell me why a hasbeen from spooksville is here he had hoped that provocative rudeness would rile it didnt tying loose ends a shrug a grin a gesture of the hands that was a proconsuls bogus helplessness ive heard that before from you its garbage what should i assume sergeant assume what you wish for reasons best known to himself harvey gillot will walk the cornfield road this morning will you be alongside him i doubt it then when he welshed on the deal and the men who waited for him lost their lives were you with him beyond your remit sergeant is he your stalking horse should you be doing the walking this isnt an interview room sergeant roscoe for want of something better mocked will you walk in front of him and do something heroic no not the man of the hour does tying loose ends not mean intervention listen to me for a few moments sergeant my wife knows a girl who used to work a zoological society grant kept her alive on the serengeti plains of tanzania her expertise was with cheetahs wonderful animals in their natural habitat can do a sprint of up to three hundred yards at seventy miles an hour magnificent plenty of them there but that doesnt make their survival certain theyre vulnerable lions come and eat their young the girl my wife knows used to sit in her land rover and follow them the adults would sprawl on the roof above her tough if she had a call of nature and the young ones had the names of chocolate bars dairy milk or fruit and nut which the girl used to dream of but no matter how attached to them she felt she lived by a rule that couldnt be circumvented she couldnt intervene she might have followed the life of a female cat through conception gestation birth of her cubs then the upbringing of the little ones them being taught to hunt kill and survive but the lion pride comes close and the young ones are doomed she cannot charge the pride with her land rover or blast on the horn she must sit and watch the massacre its a rule in any jungle any wilderness that events must be permitted to take their course harvey gillot looks after himself not good enough for me has to be sergeant i have no jurisdiction here no police liaison no backup and no weapon correct on all counts but i do have a duty of care jargon sergeant from a bit after my time what im saying mr arbuthnot is that im obliged and wouldnt have it otherwise to show as much care because this is a duty towards a reptile character as i would towards an upright citizen we dont differentiate between saints and sinners hes a sinner a reptile arms dealer could be for all i care a crystalmeth dealer involved in a territory fight if the silly bastard had done as he was told and and bolted dug a pit and squatted in it and had listened to advice taken the help offered him instead im in this godforsaken hole and i have a duty of care when he walks why is he going to do it i suppose he has something in his mind about facing up or confronting his problems itll sit well with duty of care sergeant the packet must have been wedged down in benjies chair it was wrapped in plain brown paper and slightly larger than a paperback book he gave it to roscoe and for the first time the detective felt almost shy he had his fingers under the sellotape and was about to rip it open i wouldnt do it later tomorrow dont forget it bring it ill be leaving at about six fortyfive if youd like a lift courtesy of the vulture club a membership perk roscoe watched as arbuthnot stood up and walked straight might have been on a paradeground heading for the stairs what did he know about the morning not enough what did he know about the man to whom he owed a duty of care too little he crawled off the bed silent gillot didnt use the bathroom but dressed he wrote a note and propped it on the dressingtable he opened the door and eased it shut behind him the dawn came slowly and made a mist over the river the town was buried in silence a smear of light a softer grey in the east and it came with stealth from the far side of the danube the little brightness travelling in the dawn highlighted no cloud there would be no rain no storms lightning flashes or showers it promised to be a good day hot and dry a few people were on the move when the grey became tinged with pink a man was at the marina checking the ropes holding boats at the pontoon quays and a woman was scrubbing the upper deck of a small launch beyond them unnoticed an angler crouched to study his rods tip no surprise that an apparent obsessionalist had come in search of carp catfish or pike at that early hour that another sidled close to him and squatted beside him their conversation was however far removed from suitable bait the breaking strength of lines and whether it was best to fish close to the bank or out in the main current a villager who was on the register of the political and security police as a reliable source and had a handler whispered in the anglers ear the preparations for a killing where it would be done by whom and what should happen in the aftermath he was answered and the angler was left to the peace at the start of the day but would soon tire of it come up the bank and use his mobile phone where he could get a better signal so at first light matters were already in hand men and women emerged from two bell tents that had been erected near to the site of the ovcara mass grave they stretched yawned laughed and already their chef was lighting charcoal under the barbecue grill and would be starting their breakfast they were the team of volunteers and university rookies who hoped to win enrolment as fully fledged pathologists and came from most of the countries of central europe time in the ovcara location would read well on their cvs there were still some sixty corpses all murdered most by a gunshot to the head to be found and they had lain undiscovered for nineteen years but that day an attraction was denied them their leader the charismatic american professor would be leaving and much of the dynamic would go with him the crop was round three sides of the tents and hid its secrets a handyman raked up the leaves that had been blown in the night breezes on to the grass and the walkways where the dead were now reburied and at the heart of the garden there was a memorial of bluetinted stones between which a perpetual flame burned bullied that morning by the gusts he was always at work when it was light enough for him to see the blown debris or a weed but fewer came now to see the place where the war dead lay mostly it was only relatives who visited the garden for others it had happened too long ago the low sun caught on shell holes in the buildings of the town that had not yet been repaired and the pockmarks made by machinegun fire or scattered shrapnel a street sweeper bypassed such buildings but tried to keep clean the pavements and gutters in front of renovated properties offices and shops he would have told anyone who asked that the money for further repairs was exhausted that donors had dried up and the window of opportunity that had been open when vukovar was on peoples lips was firmly closed he could have said that the town was forgotten by those outsiders who had once cared but time marched on as surely as his brush removed litter from the drains that same light eased a path inland from the river beyond the town the gravesite and the memorial garden and slid over the endless rows of ripened corn and soupplate sunflowers that were ready for harvesting songbirds hovered over them and wild creatures scurried at the roots in the dry earth another day started the sun caught the roofs of the village and nestled on one church tower that had been almost rebuilt and on another that had been almost destroyed it threw a long shadow over the entrance to what had been a command bunker and was now a home for rats it lay across the cafe tables still loaded with dirty coffee cups beer bottles and rakija glasses and rested on the ash and butts in the tinfoil trays the storks clattered off their nests and flew in search of food the day began like any other she supposed she would have blinked first then tried to keep her eyes closed then opened them the sun was shining through the window off the river she was awake but megs behan had no idea where she was she was not at home in her bedsit not in her office and sprawled over her desk not in a room at her parents home which was still supposed to be hers teenage wallpaper still in place or in an airport lounge she was in a hotel room she looked around there was much to take in and complications to assimilate a crumpled bed a sheet pulled out of place two pillows dented she pushed herself up and rested on her elbows a decent enough hotel room and there was a print of a watercolour showing a tugboat pulling a line of barges upriver good clue the danube the town of vukovar a hotel of which she was a resident not her room the sun would not have hit her windows and there would not have been two messed pillows her head hurt when she moved again an empty miniature bottle slid on to the carpet she sat up her back against the headboard the movement dislodged another bottle also empty she could smell the cigarette shed rolled stubbed out and abandoned on the bedside table her head ached hot pins against the skull it was a long time since megs behan had woken and not known where she was more important in whose bed she was she was fully dressed a hand went under her top and another below her skirt and she came to a definite conclusion underwear in place at the party for the christmas holiday last year sophie from midwales a fervent campaigner on disarmament and a plain jane had been detached from the main swing of the celebration and woken in some cleaners cupboard with brooms mops and buckets shed found herself short of her knickers some bastard had not only lowered them but taken them as a trophy hers were in place but needed changing and she looked further memory returned raw and uncensored the vest was on the floor where she was and whom she had been with came back to her and she let her shoulders slacken two bottles on the floor and a tonic can there might be others under a fallen sheet and half of a bulletproof vest megs had not seen close up a vest such as that before had seen them on policemen in the street on soldiers on television and in photographs of vip celebs who went to guest in war zones had not seen one dumped on a floor like a pair of dirty socks she could see the makers logo the two holes and in one skewed at an angle the shell the bullet she gagged thought she might throw up she looked further a lightweight jacket was hooked on the back of the chair in front of the desk two holes neater well punctured she could have reached beside the telephone taken the pencil and slipped it into either hole and the fit would have been exact she had never been to war and he had not no bullshit and no bragging but each had quietly admitted her halfpissed and him sober that they had never been to war it had sounded like a bigger confession than admitting to virginity because she had never been to war she would not have known what marks were left on a jacket when two shots were fired at it from close range or the effect of the two shots on a bulletproof vest she saw the note the slip of paper was against the rim of the dressingtable she came off the bed stepped over the bulletproof vest stood by the chair on which the jacket was slung and read miss behan perhaps we could meet for dinner tonight if mutually convenient on me or dutch if you prefer dont know what time or where so wont have a table booked hope its possible regards harvey gillot she read it again her head hurt was it supposed to be funny did he have an idiots optimism should she regard it as a cheap sentimental effort at attracting sympathy was he hooked on a fantasy of not walking to his death she swore too much to drink last night did she want him dead would it be fun to watch did she want the smile wiped off an arms dealers lips had to answer no a whole adult and working life at stake hers a bagful of principles also hers held over a rubbish chute and she had not stood her corner well had permitted arguments to end with her defending her position and him attacking with rubbish about freedom she had not had the clarity of mind to chop him down at the knees she swore because he had bested her she snatched up the note read it once more and studied the handwriting as if it revealed elements of his personality she did not tear it up but put it into the pocket of her skirt then she took out her room key and turned for the door the phone rang she checked her watch on the hour his wakeup call he had slept beside her and hadnt touched her he had risen dressed and left her behind with the vest the jacket yesterdays socks had written his note and gone she answered the call was told the time put the phone down megs behan went back to her room to shower change and face the day she didnt know what it would bring and under the deluge of hot water she cursed the uncertainties that teased her the brush of whiskers against his hand woke robbie cairns and as he opened his eyes a tongue licked nervously exploring at his fingers he jerked upright and the fox backed away perhaps it had watched him half the night and now had come close enough to learn about him any other time any other place robbie would have shouted to frighten the animal would next have scrabbled for a stone and flung it and hoping for a yelp of pain not at any other time and not in any other place robbie had been on his side his body hunched his head resting on an outstretched arm his hand almost flung clear of him that hand had been the one the fox had nuzzled before it licked him he sat straightbacked very slowly he folded his legs tight together with the knees sticking out and looked into the foxs face he could smell its breath foul like air from a sewer he had nothing to give it as a bribe in the hope it would come closer to him it breathed hard almost panting and he realised it was near famished he could see its ribcage the mange on the back legs and at the base of the tail he thought the fox was as hungry as he was when he had fished in kent on the banks of the old military canal any fox passing by would have skirted him regarding him as an enemy he thought this one was young hungry and alone he wanted it to come back to feel again the whiskers and the tongue on his hand he thought it had a face of beauty would like to have touched it feel the texture of the fur he was hungry and thirsty cold from the night and shivering there was damp on his clothes from the dew the fox might not have eaten for days but it could drink it looked at him deep brown eyes and the mouth was slightly open there were scars in the fur and old wound lines as if creatures had hacked with their back legs to break the killing hold of the jaws it was thin but the teeth were clean and polished they would rip apart a prey when it had killed he needed a drink he felt a surge of anger at the people who had treated him with such disrespect he had been dumped in a bloody ploughed field without food water or a blanket the anger was muted by the sight of the fox which watched him past it was the wooden cross and beyond it the grass and the trees beyond the trees was the water it read him the fox did it stretched and coughed then turned its mangy end towards him and went towards the trees and the river robbie cairns pushed himself up he wouldnt have known what delirious meant and wouldnt have understood the story of the pied piper from hamelin he would have been outraged at the suggestion that his mind was blown by a fox the fox had gone into the trees and he saw a slight trail as if it had made a narrow track and walked towards it the yell was an order stop stop right there he did he heard the thud of heavy shoes behind him and began to turn the man had shouted at him in english with only a light accent as if he was educated a big man overweight with a pallid face far behind him there was a car with a door open and now he could hear the quiet throb of the engine the man carried a plastic bag robbie said emptily as if he needed to justify himself i was going for water the man came close to him do you like to gamble what the fucks that got to do with anything i dont gamble you left me without food or water it would have been a gamble to go for water high odds if its roulette the gamble begins when the wheel spins and when you take a first step off the field into the undergrowth do you not have landmines antipersonnel mines where you come from he understood he was laughed at he bit his lip and hung his head the man squatted and said his name then opened the plastic bag took out a thermos a beaker sandwiches made with thick bread and an apple he gestured to robbie that they were for him he wolfed the sandwiches ham salad and tomato gulped the hot sweetened coffee and was told why he had been about to gamble this corner of the field was mined the cetniks would have put down the mines after theyd killed four of our people and buried them here the four were those who waited for the missiles gillot had taken money and valuables for that is why you were paid to kill gillot he took the money and did not deliver only very recently did this small village receive enough priority for a mineclearance man to make this part of a field safe it was done we have the certificate and the farmer petar ploughed it for the first time in nineteen years the bodies were found where you are now is clean if i had gone down to the water he spoke through a mouthful and crumbs dropped from his lips you would have gambled the priority for the clearance was the field not the banks perhaps there are mines there perhaps not he had trusted the fox it would have led him down the bank and gone lightfooted to the pool where the water from where robbie had seen it seemed fresh and without pollution the fox would have killed him and he had given it his friendship he was told that his target would be driven along the cornfield road to this place would be herded here the man spoke of the hunters going after wild boar and how they beat the beasts into the path of the guns there would be no police in the fields or the village he was told that here by the cross he would earn the money already paid to him and what happens if you fail if you fail i believe you to be an intelligent man so you know very well what will happen if you fail dont fail he said he would be there and ready the man walked away from him where else would he be if the fox came back robbie would kill it it would have led him down a riverbank where there were mines when the target came he would shoot him he stamped his feet on the earth made dust puffs and slapped his arms on his chest to get warmth into his body he would shoot him then start to live again he had run away before and could again he turned once near to his car and saw that the man paid to kill had taken the firing posture and would not have realised he was watched josip no longer wanted to be a part of it before coming to the field he had moved his car to the side of his house the back door into the kitchen was not overlooked and he had stripped his home of all that was important to him had loaded the boot and the back seat and his dog was in the front he assumed that the corpse of cairns would go into the same pit as would be dug for harvey gillot and that the secret of that grave would remain inside the village all those years before he had run from the fight and could run again in the car he ruffled the dogs neck eased the ignition key bumped along the track that led to the metalled road and turned away from the village he thought it a place of death condemned and wanted no part in its future the dawn was coming quickly and it would be a fine day warm there were defining days in mark roscoes life some he had recognised as the dawn had advanced others had been flung without warning into his lap not many and they had shaped him on the most recent twice he had been a voyeur like a pavement gawper a stakeout in west london in chiswick the firearms had been in place and the bad guys on the pavement about to go into the building society but one must have had a decent enough villains nose to sense the trap about to be sprung he had grabbed a woman held a handgun to her head and backed all the way to the van she and he would have been in the marksmens telescopic sights so they hadnt fired the woman had been thrown aside as the gang had piled into the van and disappeared round a street corner in a scream of tyres all had been taken into custody three hours later a defining moment when not to shoot when to be patient when to wait for a better opportunity another such moment was outside a highstreet bank in a nothing little town in the northern suburbs of southampton roscoe had been with the gun team in the public lavatories when the gang had hit a cashdelivery guard was looking down the barrel of a handgun and the team had thought it right to fire had done so had taken the life of a serial robber nunes killing him outright with an accomplice a defining moment when it was right to shoot and extinguish a life at ruthless speed big moments but as big had been the session in the policestation interview room when he had faced harvey gillot across a table and when in harvey gillots lounge he had seen the stubborn refusal to submit to a threat it was the nature of mark roscoes work that he was an observer of defining moments not a participant he had had a shower which had cleared the tiredness from his head and now dressed fast he didnt catch bullets in his teeth the bible as taught to protection officers on the courses stated that he could do precious little protecting when he had no firearm no backup no cooperation and no liaison he had only a package when he was ready suit buttonedup shirt collar tie clean reasonably robust shoes he swilled his teeth again and drank some tap water then he put his thumb into the package and dragged it open he found inside a canvas pouch with a belt strap he unzipped it there was a list at the top with a mass of items stowed beneath it analgesic pain relief immodium intestinal sedative penicillin antibiotics potassium permanganate steriliser surgical blades various butterfly sutures general plasters minitampons bloodloss suppression condom can carry a litre of water in the flying squad they had regular updates on what to do in a medical emergency before the professionals arrived hed never taken it seriously because hed always believed there would be an ambulance team just round the corner or someone on the team who had specialised in gunshot and stabbing injuries the previous evening there had been a doctor in the bar who had talked politics and psychology roscoe undid his trouser belt slipped on the pouch and refastened his buckle he thought of what he had said the previous evening or earlier that morning on duty of care he would have given much to be wearing a holster with a weapon inside it the kit was a poor substitute he made a call explained how the situation seemed to pan out there was an expletive and he wondered if his guvnor had nicked his chin while shaving he was told at what time the gold group would meet and like an afterthought he was wished luck he shoved his night clothes soiled socks and washbag into his duffel and hitched it on to his shoulder what did duty of care mean easy enough to trot out at the gold group harder when the kit was a condom minitampons little blades sutures and a canister of antiseptic the medical teams on the scene when nunes and his associate were dropped in hampshire had brought vast cases of gear with them and had set up half a field dressing station on the pavement in front of the bank he had agreed in the small hours that gillot was a sinner and a reptile now checking that he had everything those words seemed cheapening and duty of care a crap commitment big breath best foot forward he took the stairs down he saw penny laing she avoided his eyes showed him her back he thought her a snapped reed and couldnt get his head round what had happened to her at this place in london she would have been resourceful and conscientious probably pushy with it or she wouldnt have made it to the airport a snapped reed had nothing to contribute anders the professor who cut up decomposed corpses was paying his bill at reception the voice boomed at him good to see you looking so chipper mr roscoe there was a little bit roscoe reckoned of the music hall about benjamin arbuthnot he wore green corduroy slacks a lightweight jacket from which a polkadotted red handkerchief ballooned an impeccable white shirt a tie that looked ancient and military heavy brogues well buffed and a frayed straw hat askew on his head almost a costume from the good old days of the hackney empire or the collins music hall on islington green a clatter down the staircase and megs behan reached them she was still damp from the shower and wore last nights clothes as she mumbled apologies that were ignored she was carrying a crumpled jacket that was holed in the back with a bulletproof vest that had twin indents he hadnt expected to see harvey gillot in the hall but looked anyway i think its time mr roscoe for coffee before the vulture clubs charabanc departs follow me please he wondered why megs behan had the jacket and the vest but it was too early in the morning to come up with the solutions what about mr gillot he asked long gone but well catch up with him at the desk he stood beside megs behan as she shovelled cash towards the girl when it was his turn roscoe scrawled his name on his account and followed them into the dining area where coffee steamed on a table and there were plates of rolls he thought that the old spy had successfully tied his loose ends and now ran the show he was unsure what duty of care meant what obligation it required they gathered at the cafe it was not a parade they had never stood in lines in the mornings or evenings before taking up shifts in the trenches they wore the uniforms again but did not salute now and had not then old zoran of course had been respected by the villages younger men when he commanded them but not for his selfappointed military rank it was from his history as the village schoolteacher mladen had commanded them after zorans death and led them now they were a cussed crowd but accepted the need for a spokesman mladen had said they should find something close to a uniform then they had not worn the uniform as an indication that they were part of the vukovarske brigade that defended the town to the west but because the camouflage pattern made it harder for the enemys snipers to kill them his own tunic was the one he had worn when he had broken out through the cornfields large enough for him to put the baby boy under it and still draw up the zipper it fitted him well andrijas was too tight and the front was stretched grotesquely tomislavs hung loose petars still had mud on it from having been buried before the breakout then dug up on his return seven years later it had not been washed in the last twelve years mladen carried his assault rifle as he walked among them in front of the cafe andrija had his prized sniper weapon the dragunov svd with mm calibre and a maximum range of metres with a telescopic sight its butt rested against his crutch tomislav held upright an rpg with a loaded grenade and petar had brought a heavy leather shoulder holster that carried a zastava m pistol taken from the body of a serb officer all their weapons had been buried in the hours before the breakout simun had no firearm one could have been found but that would not have been correct he thought the boy sulked many were there and all were armed only one man from the village had not come to the cafe he felt a small breeze of irritation that josip was not there he had delayed his address until the widow was with them and now he saw her in the low sunlight hobbling towards them on a stick maria was with her would have helped her dress all the women already at the cafe wore black maria had on a black anorak a black kneelength skirt and black stockings and the widow had chosen a long black dress and a black overcoat that would have been right for a winter funeral today the temperature would climb to the high eighties but it would not last long in the cornfields it would be over by the time the sun was high and the heat had built he drove carefully it seemed right to daniel steyn that there should be no alarms for his passenger the car had been past the command bunker from which the towns defence had been organised steyn talked quietly thought it necessary but his passenger fiddled with his mobile and the doctor realised that the phone was being checked for the first time in hours perhaps days a low surrounding wall of concrete shielded the padlocked trapdoor to the hidden steps steyn said then around here it would have seemed like stalingrad now it is merely a sunken stairway in a pretty garden what was done here and in the villages on the cornfield road was heroic just want you to know that what you did was disgraceful pathetic and criminal you stole those papers and what was in the safe like a common thief whatever happens to you itll be too good for you and fee thinks that weve scrubbed you out right out and youre a bastard were well rid of hed pointed to the irish pub made a weak sort of crack about the liffeys water being cleaner than the danubes and passed the hospital steyn said the wounded from the fighting were brought here it must have been dantes inferno too dangerous to bury the dead so they were wrapped in soiled sheets and dumped outside the entrance to the bombshelter basements the staff and patients had retreated into there was a fantastic woman who ran the place through unimaginable times and it was her good fortune that she was too highprofile to be butchered the wounded men and a few staff were taken out of a back door while peace envoys were at the front and they were massacred that is the war crime the atrocity of vukovar and it leads to the accusation of betrayal the name of this town today is the same as that of treason nothing is forgotten and nothing is forgiven they see you mr gillot as part of the treason and part of the betrayal to confirm harvey that the shipment is on course and everything in the world is good warmest greetings from burgas the road had opened out and they were clear of the buildings a concrete bridge crossed a river and they were close to the quays where lines of barges were moored there was quiet and peace steyn said the bridge was a key point in the defence of vukovar its open ground except for the docks and the grain silos until you reach the shoe factory then borovo it was a weak point to defend and was exploited the enemy came across the river and cut the defences into two then resistance was impossible the men who were here had the best chance in the breakout those in the centre the least why am i telling you this mr gillot there was phenomenal bravery here but those imposters treason and betrayal gnaw at the pride of the survivors they wallow in hatred you are a target for the hatred this is aleksandre in the ministry from tbilisi and i confirm that cargo is delivered to us tomorrow and we are satisfied with all arrangements you have made a pleasure to do business with you as always all good wishes steyn changed gear the lights were red in front of him a bus alongside a petrol tanker behind and the first kids were out on the streets with footballs women were hoisting washing lines and old men sat by their front doors smoking many of these homes were pocked with bullet marks and the pavement was dented steyn said were nearly there mr gillot nearly at the start of the cornfield road that is what you want charles here sunshine what we talked about over lunch and on the phone harvey yes can do that and at a better price than i quoted you itll have come back from the province but should still be serviceable i suppose youre on holiday fine for the leisured classes while the rest of us are labouring for the public good and to keep the old country afloat call me when youre back steyn said not for me to intrude mr gillot but my advice is wellmeant these folk wont be impressed by a grand gesture there was real suffering here and on a level that people from the socalled civilised corners would find hard to appreciate worth considering they have the same nerve ends same ability to suffer as you or me i dont gild it you want to go further were nearly there near the beginning monty here my friend the bpv arrived i just wanted to bounce at you that i can do a hundred and there would be a per cent discount on what youre paying for one i can assure you harvey that the makers give very solid guarantees on their product let me know if you want a century but dont hang about bestest there was another bridge and steyn eased on to the side of the road a little short of the span behind there were ribbondevelopment bungalows and detached houses with flowers in the gardens steyn said this is pretty much where the cornfield road started dont harbour an impression of busy traffic going up and down it every night it didnt very little ammunition could be brought in because of the artillery and mortar fire a bit along the track the trees were close to it and serb snipers in them wounded couldnt be evacuated along it of course a few werent cut out for hero status theyd money put aside and paid heavily for guides to bring them through but thats not much talked of mr gillot this was a place of extraordinary courage which is why the survivors have little tolerance for betrayal and treason calling from marbella my precious old mucker were making progress and i dont doubt itll all turn up rosy where are you rang home and had the phone slammed down on me trouble with the secretarial staff get a grip suns shining here and im about to pop the days first cork wherever you are enjoy it steyn climbed out of his car damn near clappedout but the supporting charity could run to nothing better there would be no tears shed when it failed and he finally took the train out not his tears and not theirs damn you were missing you the dog is fee is and i am and were frightened for you too much said and done probably for it to be easy to put a plaster on it dont get the top of your head shot off dont we bloody miss you whatever damn fool ideas in your head and wherever you are make it through and well try something the dog cant and fee cant and i cant live without the wretched old rogue who is owner and father and husband dont touch anyone there because youll destroy them if you do look after yourself do please im not interested in this house or the knickknacks but i want you and fee does and the damn dog does dont break anyone else like youre breaking us god why did i marry you would have been for your bloody smile love you the phone was switched off steyn saw a man who had learned where his life stood had listened to others and was now prepared to walk on and away steyn thought he knew where it would end and how and that a wifes mayday call would help him not at all what to do nothing to do there was a vineyard beside where the car was parked and a man stripped to the waist drove a tractor along the lines of almost ripe grapes peaceful a damn fraud gillot came out of his seat arced his back and a most captivating smile split his face to himself steyn admitted that he would have bought anything off this guy might even have bid for the eiffel tower if the guy had offered it cut price and discounted the plastic bag was in his hand there was a murmur of gratitude and gillot was gone he could still see as the distance grew and a firm stride took him further the holes in the shirt where the bullets had punctured it steyn crossed himself he didnt make a habit of it the plastic bag not much in it seemed to bounce against gillots thigh the heat of the day came on and the road had started to shimmer and distort is there anything we should be doing phoebe bermingham asked dont think so maam from steve covert surveillance scd maybe not out of mind but certainly out of sight from where im looking at it from harry intelligence scd mark roscoes a big boy and id bank on him being sensible enough to look after himself do what hes paid to do and not stand too adjacent from donny firearms co the inspector from scd roscoes boss reported the earlymorning call the state of play the assessment and reprise on the expected course of the morning and repeated something about a fucking club of vultures that had gathered in the town and now headed for the cornfields dermot ill at ease when exposed and isolated among the police reported that his penny laing had found no evidence of criminality that would stand up in a court of law from the alleged events of nineteen years earlier and had told them she was booked on a flight out in the early afternoon phoebe did the summary i cannot see that we could have achieved more we were faced with an obstructive and obstinate tango who refused the advice of experienced personnel and safe accommodation i dont go so far as to say that gillot made his bed and therefore can lie on it but i believe weve acted honourably and adequately in this matter and the fact that he has transferred the threat to himself to a foreign location is quite simply to be regarded as a blessing in view of the extraordinary refusal of the croatian authorities to grant liaison facilities i would suggest that sergeant roscoe returns to the uk on the first available i think our hands are clean comments none time then for phoebe bermingham with a smile on thin lips to let the detective inspector roscoes man and the one from revenue and customs penny laings collect their papers finish their coffee make their farewells and get the hell out not sorry to see them go the gold group in relation to harvey gillot had been an unsatisfactory frustration three new men and women took their places another gold group was in session better stuff and straightforward an albanian brothel owner from kilburn had kidnapped a star girl who worked for a kosovan pimp if the kosovan and his chums found their albanian cousin he was dead wherever they could reach him with a knife or an uzi submachine gun the man was refreshingly grateful for the protection offered she did not expect that as a gold commander the name of harvey gillot would again cross her table a difficult man and without gratitude benjie arbuthnot marshalled them with the same skill as a cumbrian collie would have employed on a flock of herdwicks he had his own bag behind his heels and the soles of the brogues crushed the matchbox now empty given him at the airport along with the medical materials mark roscoe was waved into the front passenger seat and william anders his grumble ignored was told to dump his bags in the boot then get into the back with the women last into the boot flung there without ceremony were the jacket and vest then the hatch was slammed down so that the vehicle shook on its chassis it was only a hire car at that stage of developments he didnt believe he could have done more it was arbuthnot who had arranged for steyn the doctor to be in the hotels forecourt from five thirty am wait for the emergence of gillot and offer the man a lift to where he needed to be dropped a small thing but it had seemed important best also for young roscoe to have the more comfortable place alongside him he liked the detective sergeant and thought he might be the only one among them who had a code of ethics that would stand up to any rigorous examination he had assessed him as a decent man dedicated and rare because he seemed to make no judgements on his fellows he was about the only one benjie was interested in not interested in anders he would greet the californian with apparent affection enthusiasm but thought him egocentric he believed the trade of digging up putrefied corpses merely kept alive vendettas and stultified reconciliation at five thirty on the forecourt steyn had told him that the villagers knew gillot intended to cross the cornfields and that the hired gun would be waiting where the bodies had been excavated that would have come through the woman laing he could see from her thrustout chin lowered eyes defiance and backtothewall defensiveness that shed been humped rotten by a man who was both unsuitable and outside her supposed loop he wasnt interested in the woman behan she would have gone to his room with the intention of hectoring lecturing and gloating and the salesmans smile would have flashed at her maybe a little of the salesmans pitch given her and she had ended up destabilised certainties wrecked carrying a jacket that was not needed and an inappropriate bulletproof vest only roscoe interested him and he had seen that the pack was stowed on the detectives trouser belt he wouldnt tell roscoe where the hired gun would be placed to do so would be intervention and would break the law of the safari he turned the ignition and was about to murmur a further inanity about the departure of the vulture club but stayed silent reached inside his jacket and touched the pen that was clipped to the inside pocket at that moment he felt old sad exhausted and the past with skeletal hands seemed to claw at him it had been a damn long time ago that he had stood on the dockside at rijeka it would be over by lunchtime and then they could guaranteed get the first flight of the afternoon out of this damn place he said sprightly right ladies and gentlemen the weather seems to be top hole for the day so lets get the clubs excursion on the road mladen was efficient it was expected of a leader he had the sheet of paper in his hand and for the last time he repeated where each man and woman should be one exception had been made he could not have prevented it the widow had decided where she should be and had gone earlier maria with her because the heat rose and it was a long walk for an old woman from the rest he demanded discipline he walked at the front when they left the cafe turned at the nearcompleted church headed for the cemetery and was on the track that would bring them to the kukuruzni put behind him were many rifles the snipers dragunov and the rpg some of the men had only shotguns and women who were without grenades carried kitchen knives far ahead they heard a single shot perhaps fired from a pistol none could identify it or think of a reason for it but they pressed on hurrying one shot fired he had needed only one he had fired and killed as cleanly as he had in zagreb when they had tested him the man in zagreb had slumped to his knees and gone prone the fox had been bowled over by the impact of the bullet which would have gone into the heart because there was barely a spasm it lay now on its back its legs erect and stuck out he made the pistol safe and pocketed it then bent to pick up the cartridge case he threw it bright and flashing in the suns low light towards the treeline and saw it fall where the grass was long beyond ploughed ground it had looped high over the cross there was blood at the foxs mouth rich dark it came slowly in a dribble from in front of the incisors a little flowed over the whiskers and some went into the nostrils he looked at it for a long time the preparation for killing the fox had taken more than an hour he had laid out the last of the sandwiches some crusts and a quarterslice of ham with the core of the apple on the ground near enough to the undergrowth at the treeline to tempt it hunger had won the animal had come out by the little track that led down to the water he had seen the fur at the mouth that had brushed against his hand the tongue that had licked his skin obvious to robbie cairns why he would kill the fox it would have taken him down the riverbank to the pool he would have walked and scrambled over the grass and weeds of the incline the fox had small light padded feet and would not set off a landmine it would have tricked him the fox had nuzzled and licked him to deceive he was pleased to have shot it and had done it well no one deceived robbie cairns and walked away from it he had forgotten his yearning to be loved by the fox he stood then walked to the animal and took hold of its tail above where the mange infected it he threw it hard and high heard the body break through the branches and then the splash it had tried to lead him into the mines the sun was higher and beat on him far down a track that ran off through the corn he could see the movement of men and women but they were hazed and indistinct sweat ran on him and was in his eyes it was the path where the movement was that his target would take he came off the road and ahead of him was the small squat pillbox in front of the pillbox was the shrine with the painted statuette of the virgin and behind it the pole the flag fluttered dismally in the heat harvey gillot crested a small hill dirt and dust skidding out from under his feet and realised there had been no rain for many weeks the ground was baked dry he passed the flag then the shrine and assumed it to have been built as a memorial to those who had died using the cornfield road on the pillbox he could see the marks of war and the exposed lengths of steel wire on to which the concrete had been poured long ago the ground in front of the shrine was covered with white chippings and weeds grew freely among them he wondered why if the past lived so strong a man or a woman did not come here with a hoe and tidy it then the flag the pillbox and the shrine were behind him from the top of the slope he looked forward to his left distant was the water tower which peeped above the corn crop to his right nearer was a farmhouse among mature fruit trees there was scaffolding on one of the walls as if an attempt was made to move on from the past ahead was an expanse of fields corn and sunflowers and above the corn chimneys that were difficult to focus on in the bright sunlight in places between the corn stems he glimpsed redtiled roofs it was the village that had paid him it was why he was there no reason to mess around time to step out and confront it it was a gun a balaclava a hammer blow on his spine then repeated could have hidden and flinched at his own shadow harvey gillot started his walk the plastic bag in his right hand had little weight the slight wind that blew on the open plain and was sucked down the path riffled it making it flap against his leg he wore a pair of creased lightweight trousers should have been washed and pressed and the shirt had been on his back since he had left the island he was unshaven which didnt bother him he had soft trainers on he would have chosen them for a quiet day on the patio with his mobile for company he hadnt tidied his hair he had dressed fast moving on tiptoe around the hotel room hadnt showered or washed or swilled his teeth and had looked often at her fully dressed sleeping well her face calm he hadnt woken her he had written the note had done the smile the rueful one then gone out of the door and closed it with care he murmured well mr lieberman they say that if youre stuck in a pit its best to stop digging so ive dumped the shovel im walking because your good chum mr arbuthnot offered that piece of advice would be grateful mr lieberman if youd watch my back could have done with his dark glasses it looked a long walk and he thought it would take him near to the redtiled roofs the jutting chimneys and maybe skirt a treeline but everything was indistinct the light reflected up from the path and seemed to gouge at his eyes he hadnt gone far yet and the path stretched ahead the corn grew high and a car door slammed behind him faint it would have slammed on the road near to the flag the pillbox and the shrine the sound of the slam carried well and there was no noise on the path other than that of leaves moving and songbirds up higher a buzzard soared should have had his dog with him if it had been a choice between the dark glasses to protect his eyes or the dog head beside his knee he would have chosen the dog had the dog noticed hed gone always made a fuss when he came back but he wouldnt have bet good money on the dogs loyalty if it were just a walk that was on offer the dog would follow the food she gave it food and it might turn down the chance of a walk in a cornfield that led to a village a grave and he heard the stamp of feet running behind him he quickened his step thought of the gun the balaclava he didnt know whether he should walk faster trot jog or sprint the tread closed on him gillot didnt want to turn he could picture the slight spareshouldered shape of the man and thought with that build the man would be close enough to him to have the right range for a handgun twenty feet a difficult shot ten feet a reasonable shot five feet certainty couldnt stop or turn and the sweat ran on his back the wind eddied in the bullet holes of his shirt and cooled the wet on his skin for gods sake mr gillot can you just slow down gillot shouted at the corn on either side of the path go away cant the man heaved panted and the footfall thudded closer gillot stopped turned he stood his full height and tried to claw together authority he and spoke with a harsh growl words of one syllable get lost the sergeant was in front of him dressed in a suit collar buttoned tie knotted the polished shoes were now dustcoated his hair was wrecked and the sweat ran in rivulets off his forehead a gasp cant i dont want you put frankly mr gillot theres a thousand places id rather be be there then any of them harvey gillot turned no smile and no shrug he did it like a dismissal told the lamb to stop trailing and get back to its own field and flock he walked stretched his stride cant he was followed repetitive boring get a handle on it i have to do this on my own he thought that reasonable only an idiot wouldnt understand that the business of the day was personal to him they were in now an avenue of corn that was densely sown and made a wall to either side of them a man a devil a killer a bastard could be two yards into the corn and there would be no warning of his presence he would only have to extend an arm and aim and the voice bored back at him lapped at his shoulder sorry whatever your personal preferences mr gillot im not able to turn away from you its the job get behind me dont crowd me gillot said quietly he wanted this argument dead wanted to know what was ahead of him and round the twist in the path wanted to know what was beside him and two paces into the close corn behind you yes but with you he thought they played with words to gillot behind was fifty paces back and detached merely there to observe far enough away not to distract him from his own survival chances to gillot with you was a couple of steps off his shoulder and alongside him too near to give him a cat in hells chance hed reckoned hed solved a problem and had had it thrown straight and hard into his face the sun beat into his eyes and the sweat stung there temper broke are you looking for a fucking medal thats insulting get off your high horse sergeant and stop moralising its called duty of bloody care he let his shoulders heave with derision but the man hung in there at school there had been kids who fancied crosscountry running was a joy panting and heaving and throwing up and the teacher said that the lead kid had to drop the chasers or hed not bloody win he hadnt dropped roscoe never heard of it doesnt play big in any street ive lived in and it hangs like a bloody millstone around my neck but its there and i cant lose it thats duty of care what was new anger as if roscoe had forgotten he was the policeman the public servant as if it was true hed rather be anywhere else and weighed down with the duty he remembered the man in his living room punctilious in his politeness demonstrating neither sympathy nor personal involvement he couldnt offload the care i walk on my own correction you walk with me behind you you armed no you have a stick pepper spray mace do you have anything no a stork flew over slow and ponderous and gillot told him what he thought then youre goddamn useless useless leave me alone i go about my business and youre an obstruction to it lose yourself you wont be alone no chance theyll be there got me its like theyve bought tickets for a tyburn job seats in the stands penny laing of revenue and customs shes there she tried to nail you with a prosecution but gave up on it megs behan the woman who blasted you out of your home with a bullhorn is there a local doctor hell be there but dont regard him as useful because he didnt bring the box of tricks him im carrying it the forensic scientist who exhumed the bodies the deaths that put you in this shit and found a phone number scribbled on paper in a pocket and shopped you hes down the track with an old spook who acts the fool and isnt hes there and has taken on the transport he calls us all vultures circling watching and waiting for a corpse you wont be alone sorry about that back off and the villagell be there they put up twenty thousand sterling its a humble place and it lives off war pensions with disability allowances wellmilked but that was a pile of money to them and they took it in bank loans it was sliced off down the line as the contract was passed on and the guy on the trigger gets ten out of the twenty i dont need to know im not running i have nowhere to run to his name is robbie cairns hes from rotherhithe southeast london slotting is his work he kills to make a living ive seen him faced him smelt him hes waiting for you at the end of the path get back from me ill look after myself stuck with you and not from choice it would not have been true to say that harvey gillot snapped truer to say that he had exhausted every other tactic for shedding himself of roscoes shadow he hit him surprised roscoe and himself a clenched fist not the one that held the plastic bag but a leftarm jab he had never in his entire life hit anyone before not at primary school or at the royal grammar school he hadnt thrown punches in the officeequipment trade or when he was trying to sell weapons he had never hit josie the blow caused roscoe to reel but not to go down gillot watched almost fascinated as blood came from roscoes nose and was wiped with a sleeve and then more from a split upper lip roscoe stood lifted his head and would for a moment have weighed whether or not to beat ten shades of hell out of gillot gillot nearly laughed it wouldnt have fitted the duty of bloody care to return the punch gillot walked on reckoned hed won space for himself they were squashed into the car dropping off roscoe and giving his place in the front to the longlegged anders had made little difference to the lack of comfort but it had been bearable when they were on the decent road surface out of the town he was guided by penny laing who directed him at junctions where narrow roads branched off with no signposts a quiet had fallen on them and benjie arbuthnot rated it an inappropriate time to lift the mood with humour now he drove the hire car off the road on to a track didnt slow and allowed the vehicle to bounce he followed penny laings directions through the village with a brief commentary by anders on the number of casualties suffered in the siege past the church and the cemetery he saw through the open gate the fresh graves no one spoke and all were thrown about inside the car he did not slacken his speed there were markers ahead he could see as dust piled on to the windscreen bobbing heads that wound in a slowmoving line above the tips of the crop he had been once in south america when a pope had visited and could remember the huge crowds moving in crocodile formation towards the rendezvous where mass would be celebrated he recalled taking his elder son to a music festival and again seeing trudging queues heading for campsites beside the thames something magnificent and emotional about columns on the move in the early morning and a great event expected the army ahead of him however wore neither the uniform of the faith nor their culture the women were in black and carried hand weapons and the men were in camouflage fatigues with firearms on their shoulders they were strung out along the length of the track anders said i dont want to be a pooper arbuthnot but i dont see our presence being welcomed megs behan said i cannot believe now in the rule of the mob we have to go on penny laing said we owe him nothing were not in debt to gillot he made no reply he could have tucked the car in behind them and crawled at their pace could have dumped it turfed out his passengers and walked he heaved the wheel and went through the corn the mass of green closed around the windows he made a bypass then swung back towards the track he saw that the village people formed little clusters ahead and understood penny laing murmured to him which was tomislav who had made a memorial of his home and would have fired the malyutka missiles if delivery had been made and which was andrija who had been the sniper and had lost his leg in the breakout when the women and wounded were left behind she indicated petar who farmed this land whose wife was deaf and whose son had died when the consignment had failed to come and mladen who led the village and his son who had been carried out as a twoweekold baby through the cornfields always a witness always an observer arbuthnot noted and squirrelled away her blush and the tremor in her voice as she spoke of the boy goodlooking kid he saw ahead that steyn waved to him and beside him were two crow women he had seen enough so he did a threepoint turn that flattened more of the crop and began his dropoff it was megs behan who asked the question it would have been in all their minds but she posed it can we save him no we cannot arbuthnot said but its possible he can save himself steyn was the first to see him he knew maria wife of an amputee she had consulted him on a possible infection of the ovaries hed thought her a pitiless woman but he knew what had been done to her when the village had fallen he had seen also once the elderly widow who played that part with enthusiasm had painful arthritis and a great bagful of bitterness at the loss of her husband he thought each lived in the days and nights of an autumn turning to winter when their lives had depended on the lottery of where a shell landed or where a sniper aimed his bullet he thought each lived through that day and night of an enemy unzipping his fatigues lowering filthy underpants and tearing down knickers he stood by the women and saw him come over a low hill crown of the head the full face and then the shoulders he knew well the history of the kukuruzni put could imagine how it had been to sprint or crawl between the rotting crop rows he saw that gillot carried a white plastic bag in his right hand he walked briskly but without bombast no trace of a swagger or the hesitation of the intimidated daniel steyn fancied himself a reasonably skilled and caring general practitioner of medicine but more as a psychologist the man did well struck a good posture once an american specialforces officer had come to vukovar to examine the ground and the strongpoints and to learn of the battle they had talked late over whisky about bluff the officer if the holding cells of the lebanon hostages of the s had been positively located would have been on the rescue squad and he had spoken of one a briton who had successfully played the bluff game on visits to beirut simply by his bearing and understated confidence he had created a safety cocoon around him until the bluff was called then he had had no battalions behind him only a pistol pressed up under his chin on the cornfield road bluff might play well and might not the policeman was behind gillot fifteen or twenty paces more opportunity for the psychologist would have been dutydriven would not have had the flawed personality to claim the right to a tenhour break many would and hands washed of a problem steyn saw the dried dark blood the stains on the suit jacket the smears on the shirt understood that too the bluff factor was not compatible with a bodyguard in tow gillot closed on him no eye contact nothing resigned nothing fearful and nothing confident no recognition the women were in the middle of the track and the corn grew high at either side of them the widow had her stick and maria a grenade bulging in a pocket a knife in her hand he thought it the sort of a knife that would be used to cut up a slaughtered pig in a shed behind a village home they blocked gillots way genius he reached them and stopped he looked into the faces would have seen the emotions that could kill him he did that little smile apologetic but without a cringe he offered no defiance and stepped to the side perhaps they expected argument might have expected explanation or gushing apology he was past them cleverly done at a price the stick was thrown after him which must have hurt the widow because the arthritis ravaged her it caught gillot on the back of the head but he rode it then maria hurled a stone which hit gillot square in the back by the bullet holes in his shirt he staggered but didnt go down steyn thought that if he had he would be gone he would not have risen again more stones and earth clods rained on gillot but he stayed upright steyn walked with roscoe in front where the path bent he saw his old friend bill anders who was maybe the architect of the whole damn thing and in the group with him was tomislav who held an rpg his wife had quit before the heavy fighting had started and gone to the enemy he understood the hate a stone cut the back of gillots head and blood matted his hair roscoe could not have put himself into gillots mind he thought he should have been on one side of the tango and the doctor on the other they should have walked beside him but the stinging ache in his nose and the swelled lip told him where he was wanted and where denied the women were behind him there were shouts curses sometimes the doctor almost with embarrassment translated what was yelled at gillot so roscoe broke ranks he jogged a few paces and came near to gillots shoulder one stone jarred his back low down while another hit gillot and glanced off the angle of his neck he did it from the side of his mouth i dont want you i dont need you you have no place here youre not a party to this argument get back i dont ask you gillot didnt have to finish it would have been a stone that a plough had turned up too heavy for the old woman to lift and throw so it must have been the younger woman who had hurled it a good aim it hit the detective somewhere at the back of the head then bounced on to the track and corkscrewed into the corn roscoe yelped then took two more steps or three and subsided gillot left him there would have been another tedious futile debate gillots needs against the other mans sense of obligation he didnt look back it wouldnt have helped him to see the detective he didnt want to know whether the man was stunned out cold or had merely gone down and then pushed himself to his feet again he went forward what he did and how he acted made curiously good sense to harvey gillot certainly he would not look back and probably not to the side his focus was in front of him the corn was an aisle further on ahead he heard a rumble of voices but they were indistinct and he understood only a choir chorus of hostility he heard a cry croaked for fucks sake gillot turn round and lets get the hell out he did not of course not he could have turned on the island when two shots were fired or at the hauptbahnhof and any time in zagreb after he had gone to the rendezvous cafe and revisited where he had met the schoolteacher he could have turned at the hotel that morning when hed settled his bill best bloody foot forward it was a bigger group that was waiting for him they had trampled down some of the corn and he saw the rusted frame of a harrow or a plough abandoned the thin sculpted shape of an rpg held high a grenade loaded poked above the heads of the women and the shoulders of the men how many of those had he sold good one harvey gillot began the mental arithmetic of the numbers of rpgs he had flogged he started with the middle east and the ones that had gone to lebanon for use by the army against hezbollah and the palestinian factions up in tripoli and a load had gone to cyprus for a paramilitary crowd and the jordanians had had some and the syrians had stockpiled more anywhere that had no oil had had rpgs from him he didnt do many contracts with oilproducing countries because they could more easily buy government to government with brown envelopes attached they had gone to georgia azerbaijan and armenia all the fledgling places that were un newcomers and had broken free from the old soviet union he was doing well counting high beyond hundreds and into thousands and shit they were baying he thought they looked for blood he saw women bend and pick up clods or stones some waved knives rifles were pointed then the launcher was lowered rested on a shoulder and aimed at him right an rpg at close quarters he knew it had at two hundred metres the ability to penetrate mm of armour he was inside that zone and some and had no armour of any thickness just a vest and a shirt that was already holed the rpg could splatter him there were aks too and the pitch he would have used said that ak assault rifles could kill at damn near half a mile and a granny could hit with a mm bullet at less than two hundred metres he tried to hold his stride no escape who in this world did harvey gillot trust would have been twenty years before solly lieberman but a bear had had him when hed gone for a comfort break now only benjamin arbuthnot he had caught a glimpse of his head hair a little longer voice a little louder shoulders a little lower in the bar when he had checked in at the hotel roscoe had referred to an old spook who acts the fool and isnt he set himself that target arbuthnot would be along the track maybe a mile away maybe five and if he could reach him he would be he had faith about all he bloody did have he had not come to do penance most certainly had not come to die he had come to get the weight of the contract off his back he went towards the cluster of men and women the voices rose in hate chants the rifles stayed aimed at him and the rpg but he thought they teased him and tried to break him he walked into the range of the bestthrown rocks and clods he was in the avenue couldnt divert and wouldnt while he had the sosmall chance of walking clear all the places that william anders went to work where he supervised the digging there were men like the guy who carried the rocket launcher no colour in his face and the past sat across his shoulders like a lead weight the launcher acting as a nudge to the memory he would not fire but it was the gesture and the second was in the military tunic that seemed two sizes too large anders reckoned it would have been the guys own that his body had shrunk over the years the investigator girl had identified him as tomislav and had said he would have directed the malyutka missiles he knew about them he had flown into cairo more than thirty years ago a rookie in his trade and had been in the sinai where the egyptians had started well with them but the operatives had been massacred when the israeli defence force had mastered a tactic to employ against them theyd called them saggers anders had heard then it was not easy kit to use not important now he appreciated that his old friend the spy who had shared many of his stamping grounds might just have done enough to save the life of a longterm asset and might not in the gods laps with each step he took anders despised himself more for being there booking a ticket to watch a man die he walked well they had stones rocks and clods as solid as bricks and chucked threw heaved them at gillot anders realised well enough the need for release understood the torture a community would have endured after nineteen years without a scapegoat to skewer bombarding the man with stones might be sufficient to ease that long pain and it might not might be the knives that did it did he care william anders professor of forensic pathology at the university of california santa barbara was a feted expert witness at international criminal courts from the witness stand he had frequently enough given the testimony that would consign a mass murderer to a lifetime behind bars an arms dealer was no friend of his but he could nod in grudging admiration admiration that was not freely given the man walked well had touched all of them a chancer and had manipulated them he despised himself for being there would not have been anyplace else for a sack of gold coins there was now blood on gillots face and bruises and mud had disintegrated on the front of his shirt some of the blood scars were from grazes and others from skin punctures he seemed to ride the impact of what was thrown at him but didnt do a boxers ducks and weaves if the aim was good he was hit if it was poor the stone went past him anders thought he went slower that the injuries were sapping him he passed them anders looked into his face and read nothing from it not defiance or remorse but deadness the one with the launcher tomislav spat a good accurate aim the spittle was on gillots cheek and he didnt see who threw the next stone a glancing blow on the forehead and gillot dropped down for a count no he was on his knees then up in the moment he was down the crowd around the guy with the launcher had surged then swayed unsteadily and held an unmarked line around gillot it was as if a perimeter would not be crossed if he stayed upright their discipline held anders joined his friend steyn and the detective and the three of them were behind him not a pretty sight is it a vigilante mob is damn near as ugly as it comes you kind of forget maybe too easily what bred the blood lust he walks well there was no pain neither were there thoughts of home and green fields warm beer and safety he was past pain he didnt think of his wife and daughter or his dog he didnt think of the gulls that wheeled above the lighthouse at the tip of the island or the kestrels that hovered over the scrub there was numbness in his body and his mind he didnt think of friends in the trade the men he had worked with those he had settled deals with or the pilots who had shipped his cargoes the freighter skippers who had ferried his containers he did think of old solly lieberman what they threw that hit him buffeted but there was no pain he could just about manufacture a picture of solly lieberman mentor not in the decrepit office in the day heat of the peshawar bazaar the airconditioned cool of the bar or in any bloody place they had been together he saw solly lieberman veteran of the normandy landings survivor of the blackmarket gang feuds in occupied germany the guy who had walked away from the risk of covert assassination condemned for selling firepower to the arabs or weaponry to the jews he saw solly lieberman maybe already had his pants down when the goddamn bear had had him he didnt think he would have felt pain just the numbness what an idiot place to die the one solly lieberman had chosen the tundra forests what an idiot place to go to a cornfield path in east slavonia he was on his feet and went forward he held the plastic bag tightly fucked if he would back off and fucked if hed be anything other than stubborn pigstupid he clung to the belief that benjie arbuthnot had planted in him that this was the only way he might live he was hit more often but he didnt go down again there was sweat in his eyes and maybe blood it was hard to see the launcher was now behind him gone new voices were close a cacophony deafening and he was trapped inside the avenue made by the corn a man held a sniper rifle and the woman was beside him the good old dragunov could do a good price on a hundred svd dragunov mm sniper rifles and a better price if a pso telescopic sight was included with each weapon deg field of vision and integral rangefinder good kit and per cent hit chance at metres he could have rustled up a warehouse full from bulgaria romania or who fucking cared he saw the man with the rifle and megs behan was beside him he jostled her then seemed to stumble and megs behan from instinct reached out to steady him she realised that the rubbertipped end of the crutch had slipped and hed lost its support and the rifle barrel wavered in front of her face then regained the aim they would not have understood no one she knew family friend work colleague hack on the paper who had binned her press release would have understood what it was like to stand on the crushed corn and witness a death march she had no doubt that that was what it was there was little spring in his walk no smile as if he had nothing left to sell she didnt know what was in his plastic bag he had gone to sleep before her and she had watched over him had seen his back and the bruising two impact points she could have touched him and had not could have held him and had not could have woken him up turned him over and suggested that he do the business for the last time and had not she watched the crowd around him was now too close set for stones and clods to be thrown he was no longer pelted instead was jostled and bounced fists reached out and snatched at the shirt on his right arm on his left and other hands pushed hard at him a woman swathed in black kicked his right shin and a man tried to trip him more spat all jeered under his nose was the barrel of the rifle with the big sight clamped to it megs behan had seen photographs of similar weapons and they were in the hands of warlords drugs barons and bodyguards around despots it was the world of smoke and mirrors she could remember most clearly standing at the gate of the house overlooking the coast enjoying the tolerance of a police team a seat in their car at night and what she had yelled into her bullhorn with the volume switch at full now her throat was dry parched from the dust kicked up by many feet and she had nothing to shout they would not have understood she supposed there would be in half an hour or an hour a rag doll of a body with more cuts on it than there were now and more bruising that it would be flat out and the crowd would stand around it as they did in the photographs when the mob had turned against yesterdays man saddam ceau escu or any african tenminute dictator she would go back into the office probably tomorrow and they would gather around to quiz her and she might just tell them to fuck off her bag was slung on her shoulder zipped inside an inner pouch was the note she reckoned shed go hungry that night behind him were the detective the american gravedigger and the doctor theyd linked arms and forced their way through behind them was the crowd that had already had its turn at abusing throwing spitting his progress was ever more erratic and the hands grasped his clothing tighter but he did not retaliate or try to fight them off what are they shouting roscoe was between the american and the doctor and they made a wedge to push forward when necessary they kicked to clear the way ahead and keep the contact with gillot the doctor steyn shouted into roscoes face the one who had the launcher accused gillot of killing his son his eldest many of the others just babble hatred the one with the rifle the sniper who needs a crutch accused gillot of killing his cousin his wife was raped you want more roscoe demanded is this real not just manic theatre their lives were destroyed death torture fear the days of that autumn are as clear now as if the artillery was still firing on them the knives were over their testicles they were being herded into the cages and their women entertaining a platoon at a time it is real enough to bring him to the end of the path the hired gun robbie cairns is at the end of the path if we get that far one moment megs behan was among the crowd and beside the sniper the crutch embedded in her stomach by the press around her and the next roscoe had taken her arm yanked her free and she was among them he saw tears on her face and the clamour was greater the violence more extreme and his body swayed as he was shaken the bag was no longer at his hip but gillot had wedged it under what remained of his shirt and behind his belt buckle steyn said nothing can be done get involved and hes dead and we may be a pace closer to him with a degree of protection and we end any minimal chance he has to survive small chance he has to be alone roscoe didnt know how the man stayed upright and walked he couldnt see the end of the path steyn again they are even in croatia appealing for serbs the enemy of centuries to come here for holidays here they beg the serbs to come with the little they have money at last preaches rapprochement so gillot is precious he makes a very decent target which is rare for them hes convenient penny laing was close to the wizened petar who had a shoulder holster across his chest he smelt of manure and beside him was the deaf woman she remembered a home that had been rebuilt piecemeal without the help of craftsmen and a door that had been boarded up on the first floor the image of a son who had gone away into the night and not returned and the devastation of a battle she remembered being fucked in a barn and could reconcile nothing of the last week with what her life had been before a policeman she had met on a narcotics importation stakeout had talked about northern ireland and a local politician he had guarded from a provo attack the politician had come out of a meeting with military commanders laundered uniforms polished boots and certainties as to how their war should be won he had remarked anyone who thinks he knows the answer to northern irelands problems is illinformed bullseye she would have said on her back in the barn that she knew the wrongdoing criminality and worthlessness of harvey gillot arms broker she would have been illinformed she saw him pulled right and left spit on his face cuts and bruising his shirt nearly off his shoulders and more cuts on his chest she swallowed hard he came towards her setting the pace behind him was the small group from the hotel which the spybuffoon had called the vulture club linked elbow to elbow the girl from the ngo was in the centre and they took the pressure off his back but he had to walk into the teeth of them some shook fists at him or waved knives and others jabbed him with rifle barrels his shirt once blue seemed the only colour on show against the drab olive base of the army tunics and the womens black what had she wanted easy enough she could have spelled it out before she had taken the plane she knew where the house was the layout of the garden its size and position overlooking cliffs coves and a seascape she knew there was a wife a teenage daughter at a private school there would be a spoiled family dog and smug comfort what had she wanted she had wanted to exercise the power of the alpha team hmrc arrive at the outer gate at count to a hundred while the cars were parked break open the gate with a portable battering ram then a brisk trot to the front door count to ten repeat with the battering ram pour in shout loudly and have the family spill from bedrooms at she would have wanted control of the house could justify breaking down a gate and a door by the need to prevent the destruction of evidence one guy big laugh had shredded his incriminating paperwork but theyd wanted to nail him badly enough to stick the shreds together and had won the conviction the joy of it would have been him in shock babbling half asleep the wife screaming the kiddie sobbing and the dog whining then to a custody suite would have been brilliant his jaw would have been slack and his dignity down the drain the chin was out not ostentatiously and she thought his dignity was intact was she as big a casualty as him not in the same league she told herself but a casualty he came past her she had to hold her hands clasped together or she would have reached for him and let her fingers brush his face she thought his eyes were empty as if nothing more could be done that would shock or hurt wrong she was illinformed because robbie cairns who had taken the contract was further down the path where it ended at the gravesite her wrist was caught she struggled to free herself then realised anders had hold of her he dragged her from the crowd into the bosom of the vulture club and she was one side of roscoe and megs behan was the other they held the crowd back from pushing against gillot toppling and trampling him she saw above all the heads the straw hat perched rakishly past and above it was the treeline by the river it was close now near to the end the day was barely launched and the sun was still low i think i begin to think that he will walk through this across the customs woman the detective and the peacenik steyn said hes unarmed back then in him being unarmed wouldnt have saved him just made him easier to kill could be today that him being unarmed keeps him alive i dont know irrelevant the word wheezed out of anderss mouth as a surge from behind knocked the breath out of him its like the sting has gone now its parrot stuff could you prevent this daniel no do i have the weight wouldnt have thought so im supposed to believe in the rule of law not a rope chucked over a branch emotions run deep bill you have no place but to hold your peace if he broke and ran went into the corn cut or shot to pieces within a minute is sympathy squeezing in your gut he has balls and a guy waits for him up the path heroics tend to finish with posthumous awards their voices lapsed and the crowd had swelled round them steyn saw anders glance at his watch and reckoned he checked to see if hed make the scheduled flight likely he would likely also hed write a paper on this morning and read it to an august body he was getting closer to the high straw hat and beyond it was the hired gun they had come into benjie arbuthnots view he had a clear sight of the scene and that section of the path was straight he thought gillot had the position of fulcrum was at the heart and centre of them and his shirt showed up clear against the blur of the uniforms and the womens weeds there was a stork overhead wings languid and flapping but no vulture higher up a buzzard rode the thermal two hundred yards from them the crowd advanced and gillot led them a haze of dust hovered and danced in the earlymorning light very pretty he turned the path went on and the corn was close making tight walls to it and he could see the lone figure who waited there but couldnt make out the features as the sun was in his face even the brim of his hat couldnt deflect its brightness up to now they had barely spoken silence was a commodity arbuthnot valued highly and he sensed that the man beside him with the rifle and the old camouflage tunic begged in conversation to be given the status of chief he knew that the boy was simun and that the man was mladen who had led the village in the last days of the siege and was the undisputed headman he judged the moment right for the overture from the inside pocket of his jacket behind the pen he produced his hip flask and passed it to him thanks were translated the response gruff and noncommittal arbuthnot said its tenyearold irish bushmills a favourite of mine a good swig was taken then a dirty hand wiped the top and passed it back what is your purpose here sir the boy played interpreter for question and answer just happened to be passing he drank sparingly then pressed the flask again into the broad hand of the man and was refused i think it is enough no go on something wonderfully refreshing about whiskey before breakfast you were the commander here i congratulate you those bastards in the ministry and the presidents office wrote you off abandoned you you fought as lions would what was it at the end exhaustion as the flask was returned to him arbuthnot shook his head pushed it again towards mladens chin an answer came through the boy some of us at the end had not slept for four days and four nights ammunition was finished we had none you were a man of ability a good leader which you were must also be able to recognise reality see that arbuthnot pointed to the crest on the side of the hip flask engraved in the silver that grinning skull with the crossed bones clamped in the teeth and the legend or glory was my crowd the thst lancers light armour for reconnaissance i did time in the mountains north of aden in a wretched corner of ireland and of course germany a long time ago never faced anything of the intensity of the attack you withstood for so long proud to have met you sir he shook the hand offered him he thought gillot at that speed would reach them in a couple of minutes little of what benjamin arbuthnot did was casual or without the benefit of assessment analysis planning again he proffered the flask and murmured something about a presentation on his leaving the regiment he said of course in the cavalry with armour we learned about the various weaponry on the market this one we called it sagger the nato code name a smile that was defrosting to us it was malyutka very difficult to use i think it was the decision of the schoolteacher to try to bring in the malyutka weapon he could hear the shouting and make out individual voices the deeper harshness of the men the shrill hatred of women the knives flashed god forbid the thought came it was not an arms dealer an asset of the secret intelligence service but a christian martyr being dragged to a death of barbarous cruelty he thought perhaps he had used up a last vessel of goodwill at vauxhall bridge cross he had been given the medical pack and the rattling matchbox he couldnt expect to be welcomed back again even into an anonymous interview room on the ground floor and would not again be afforded the privilege of receiving help in any form new men and new women in slacks and shirtsleeves trousers and severe blouses would chime in chorus only an arms dealer wasnt he only a onetime asset but now well past his sellby date isnt he whats the big deal history who cares benjie arbuthnot did one man wanted it it had been successful in vukovar but they had no more he told the teacher what he wanted friend how many of your men had experience of using it one it is at best very difficult for a trained man to use impossible for a novice you did not have men with the skills to make it effective we did not it wouldnt have saved you not the village or the town perhaps if id said that then i would not now be the leader his wife deirdre always remarked that her husband had the persistence of a polecat she would have meant the persistence the murderous little creature showed when it was hungry and needing to feed young stalking a rabbit or closing on a nest where there were fledglings he thought this man both cunning and careful a poor education but the stature of one who would be followed arbuthnot had chosen his moment and had allowed the silences to build as the column had approached where they stood on the path between the corn now he played the final cards in his hand poor education yes but common sense and caution the sort of man who would have risen easily in the british army of benjies day to the rank of senior sergeant and would have been trusted implicitly by any officer depended upon and at vinkovci or nustar where the crates went on to the cornfield road would the senior commanders have allowed a delivery of such importance to go to this village alone it would have been a problem but it was the teachers problem would they in fact have been taken by more senior commanders for more important sections of the defence of vukovar my friend would any of the missiles have reached here i do not think so i never thought so it cannot be said the teacher promised it would come to us in his shoulders arbuthnot mirrored sadness and in his voice there was regret so it was for nothing collecting everything of value sending young men with the teacher to the rendezvous believing in the weapons you are a commander proven in combat you know it was for nothing what i know sir and what i will say are not similar my friend no not for me you have it wonderful yes the bushmills whiskey of northern ireland the hip flask was again offered and arbuthnot again insisted quite the best thing to come out of the place what is happening is nonsense you were the commander you are the leader end it i cannot it is barbaric medieval it drags you back when you should step forward look for the future not the past end it i say to you i cannot the cry is for leadership it was the last card of the deck he seemed to slap it down on green baize as if he was with deirdre in shropshire and among other dinosaur friends not here the shouting was deafening and they came close the hip flask was rammed back into his hand you are wrong sir the cry is for blood if i do not give them blood i am not the leader the whiskey is good thank you sir as the purveyor of a trade where deceit obfuscation halftruths halflies and deceptions were praised he found rank honesty interesting when it was shown him almost deflating he couldnt disagree with the man level with him not half a dozen feet away gillot staggered seemed to pause and reached down into the waist of his trousers he dragged out a lightly filled plastic bag it would have come from any highstreet supermarket and threw it at benjie the old spy scrabbled for it dropped the flask and had to crouch to pick it up he saw the engraved skull and the crossed bones the words from the capbadge or glory he might have said fuck all glory here my old cocker it might have been anders who grabbed him or steyn but his eyes had misted he clutched the plastic bag and was swept along with the herd had he been recognised he didnt know no greeting had been offered him he had expected none he had said that gillot must face and confront and he now did so at a cost they came together a trip a push from the side a knife brandished in his face and a womans spit on his cheek he lost his balance harvey gillot went down darkness closed around him and the brightness of the sun went so many of them pressing shoving knees jabbed into his chest and elbows no room for them to swing their fists or use their feet he tried to curl up protect his privates and face the bedlam above him was indistinct and he heard roscoe as if roscoe took control a little pool of light first it lit faces and he saw the beards on the men the gaps of missing teeth and smelt the breath he saw the lines at the mouths of old women and the crows feet and roscoes hands had hold of his shirt and the back of his trousers at the belt he was lifted more light came was in his eyes his phone deep in his pocket rang its chimes might be charles or monty or the good guy in marbella or his wife and daughter might be longdistance international from seaside bulgaria or tbilisi or might be someone who sold armoured saloon cars wouldnt be a salesman from a personalinjury insurance company peddling he stood might have been down for five seconds no more than ten the phone stopped gillot kicked out his right leg to make the first step and go forward his eyes squinted and were wet he had taken that first step then cannoned into a man and damn near bounced back off roscoe he tried to pull roscoe away and hadnt the strength abused him dont want you dont need you saw up ahead the gunman near to him a cross was strewn with ornaments and pennants planted in a ploughed stretch of field behind it were green grass and a treeline roscoe had his arm and used his other hand to push men and women back he sensed but didnt turn megs behan behind him the doctor who had driven him and benjie arbuthnot there were others who meant nothing to him roscoe had hold of him shepherded him and halfshielded him he didnt know what he meant but he shouted i can do this myself almost a sneer right now you cant even piss on your own dont want need youve got me and the great plan you got that a hesitation a pang of uncertainty working on it which meant and harvey gillots dulled mind saw it that mark roscoe the detective who had come to his home to plead a future life in a safehouse with a panic button beside the bed and been rejected now had nothing more in his knapsack than the thought of walking in front of him acting out the part of a fairground coconut would he have survived if hed stayed down on the path and the crowds hands and boots had been at him with the knives and rocks that were about to follow probably not would he have survived if roscoe had not pulled him upright possibly not he was now in debt to the detective i owe you nothing just keep walking walk right on past him and what do i do you walk hes mine robbie cairns watched them come gillot the target was at the front looking like a derelict who slept rough in southwark park on the far side of lower road he didnt think the target could have walked if he hadnt been held up by a policeman the man would have had to spend a couple of hours being made up and costumed to disguise himself obvious he was a policeman they were coming closer to him he stood with his legs a little apart his weight on his toes and the sunlight was across him not in his face the policeman wore a suit but had been on the ground and was dusty there was mud on his face his shirt was messy and his tie askew the target robbie cairns saw very clearly tried to free himself from the policemans grip and wriggled was a fucking eel which rucked up the suit jacket if a shoulder holster had been worn robbie cairns would have seen it if there had been a pancake version on the belt he would have seen it they were fifty or sixty paces from him and he saw now that the great crowd behind and alongside had thinned and that most of the people whether they were in fatigues or wore black had drifted into the corn and trampled it but they gave him space there was a knot ordinary clothes and ordinary people except one idiot in a straw hat with a bright handkerchief half out of his jacket pocket of two women and three men a couple of paces behind the policeman and the target he had the pistol out of his jacket pocket and had been satisfied with his shooting early that morning of the fox he could justify it as a test firing and he had almost forgotten the eyes of the animal the mouth and its tongue the man the idiot broke clear of the people who followed and split off into the corn he had a moment a sight of the hat then lost it and his eyes were back on the track they were going to fucking bluff it not many did a few thought they could walk past as if he wasnt there as if the pistol wasnt aimed at them not many he cocked it and the bullet went up into the breech robbie cairns thought that maybe he would have to shoot a policeman unarmed and didnt feel it mattered to him he had shot a fox and that mattered more and had strangled his girl with the hands that held the pistol and that mattered most they came on and walked at him curious but he felt a sort of calm almost as if he was at peace he smiled he walked better now no longer fighting against the detectives hand on his arm he didnt try to squirm clear of him maybe another twenty steps and they would be close enough for a hired man to shoot maybe another twenty steps beyond that and they would be clear of him and out of his range forty steps to walk best foot forward harvey and when he was clear he was free when he was free it was over start of the sunlit uplands harvey boy new world a new life forty steps away no more looking over his shoulder chasing shadows running because the wind hit the roof or a tree cracked above a pavement what stood in the way of the forty steps was the slightbuilt man short and forward on his toes like a boxer ready to fight in the way was the gun in his hand he kept the smile he recognised the gun as one from the factories of israeli military industries but couldnt recall whether it was the desert eagle or the jericho which seemed to matter to him they were fast thoughts a drowning mans views of life and took him through three or four steps roscoe murmured you keep walking i lead and youre covered by me just go on by him not your fight just fucking douse it why are you here time for one more question and time perhaps for one more answer not for you dont go getting an ego surge on that my badge my job enough had to be the gun came up was held in both hands and the foresight wavered wobbled then steadied roscoe had the voice of authority maybe he needed to piss his pants but he did it with quality a firm voice not a shout i am a police officer mr cairns from scd you are identified a warrant is out for your arrest lower the gun mr cairns and accept that further violence is stupid pointless i am coming past you and mr gillot is coming with me its over they kept walking harvey gillot remembered the hammercrack sound of two shots fired on the track where he took the dog and the two thudded blows of the bullets hitting the back of the vest at the hauptbahnhof he kept the smile in place what would you buy from me sir any damn thing you want sir i can do for you best price and goods of the highest manufacturing skill only the best and near to perfection discounts available for favoured customers whats it to be sir harvey gillot did the smile and realised that roscoes body had edged in front of his that his knee hit the back of roscoes and that the man was shielding him didnt fight it im relying on you mr cairns to be sensible youre a long way from everything you know and youre involved in something strange and confusing put the gun down drop it then turn and walk i am unarmed mr cairns be careful and be sensible the barrel had locked he knew what it sounded like and knew what it felt like when a man wore a vest he had no vest roscoe wore no vest there should have been a curled lip on the hired mans face and something of cruelty should have been the sign of the beast harvey gillot thought and the man was just so bloody ordinary he would have walked past him on an airport concourse on a train platform on a highstreet pavement and not noticed anything other than a sort of deadbeat concentration like that of a carpenter worrying with a spiritlevel or an electrician with a wiring puzzle or a plumber called out when the central heating had failed trying to do a job well just a damn job the barrel had locked and concentration lined the face no hatred there and no contempt he felt alongside him that roscoe had coiled it was all show and bullshit he smiled and roscoe did the bossman act he heard nothing around him no other voices but a bird cried high above and the wind ruffled the corn and their feet shuffled and they came on he could see it very clearly the tightening on the trigger bar the whiteness growing on the knuckle and the thoughts were of a lifetime at the time of drowning a little wizened man in an office who had survived the carnage on the beaches being offered a job the smell of mule shit at the edge of a bazaar and sweet tea in thimble cups perched on the crates that contained the blowpipes standing in a north london crematorium while a poor soundtrack played the exodus theme and an unbelievers coffin slid jerkily from view sitting on a hard chair in a register office beside josie holding her hand and feeling blessed in the rain on a dock watching a freighter nudge towards the quayside and hearing the booming voice dumping a bag of baubles hustling going for deals a man alone the interview room in a police station and couldnt remember when love had last figured in his life remembered them all and then roscoe went went like a bloody cat pushed off one leg might have had half a dozen paces to close all bluff and all bollocks as if roscoe had never believed the crap talk hed given with authority went fast with athleticism harvey gillot had felt the hand wrench off his arm and the detective was launched the hired man reacted roscoe was struck midair and without balance by the swinging weight of the pistol the desert eagle or the jericho and caught the blow across the side of the face cheek and chin gillot recognised then that cairns mr cairns was not crude ineffective without talent at the job he did the response had been so fast like a cobras strike like he had seen up on the north west frontier in a village market roscoe fell the arm swung back two hands locked so harvey gillot what the fuck to do heard sounds now heard the moan semiconscious of the detective heard oaths and shouts from the men behind and reckoned one voice was that of his chauffeur on the morning ride as dawn came through the town and to the start point of the cornfield road heard a gasp from the girl who was revenue and customs and a squeal from little megs behan whom he hadnt touched who had slept on his bed and who had blasted him with a bullhorn he hadnt heard an oath grunt gasp or squeal from benjie arbuthnot he faced the pistol roscoe was down not prone but on hands and knees he wouldnt beat any count and wouldnt stay on any field what the fuck to do he kept the smile in place he did the smile that might have sold ice to an inuk in greenland or sand to a bedouin in the sinai the bastard was not inuit or bedu and stared through him harvey gillot could see the narrow little eyes over the two sights the v and the needle die well or badly did it matter one more step he took it quite a good step and again the silence drenched him he heard the slither of his own foot then the heave of the bastards breath as if he would draw it in deep fill the lungs then let it out when he let it out he would fire guys he knew guys he had a laugh with guys who bought his stuff told him that a marksman took in breath held it let it seep and fired silence gone an explosion in his ears and his head he saw a sharp moment that the gun kicked hard went up was coming down fast a delayed spasm then the impact against his chest no pain but the shock of the impact his knees buckled he didnt want them to fold and was confused didnt understand where the strength had gone one good step assured and strong not another and the ground a dirt path and squashed corn rushed to meet him his eyes never left the gun and the face behind it no reaction from the face the gun had kicked up but now was down aimed he knew they called it double tap many thoughts the great irrelevancies of the last macroseconds of a life double tap was from british policemen in shanghai in the s the aim was on him and the finger whitened as pressure pushed away the blood he couldnt have moved or shouted harvey gillot didnt think it was his choice whether he died well or died badly couldnt shift from the aim and had no voice the breath bubbled in his throat the miserable beggars had allowed him one shot only small miracle that one had been allowed packaged in a matchbox he could get the pen through the metal detectors but not the bullet for it he had needed it to be given him at osijek airport he had emerged from the corn as the shot was fired had seen gillot go down and the detective pistolwhipped so that his mouth bled his face was discoloured and he was dazed his orientation gone he had seen also that the members of his vulture club were either hunched at the side of the path or flat on their faces the pen was in his hand he had twisted it aimed it along his forefinger and the next finger was against the pocket clip no one saw him a damn great wraith that had risen from beneath the corn and his hat was awry and he remembered everything he had been told as the contract killer took his final steadying aim he must have been some four or five feet to the side and out of peripheral vision he aimed the finger at the little space behind robbie cairnss left ear which had been identified to him as the mastoid process he pressed the trigger down violently crushed the pens clip into the recess the recoil blistered back down his arm into his elbow and up to his shoulder he had been shown what to do where to aim on a courtesy tour of the police specialoperations training centre outside jerusalem the timing of his visit as a friend and therefore confided in had seen the early development of tactics to be used against suicide bombers wishing to gain a legup to paradise by detonating themselves inside israel there was a critical shot opportunity when the bomber approached his target but the policeman soldier or armed citizen who confronted him or her had to consider the nightmare scenario of the explosive belt being controlled by a dead mans handle and that the death spasm would as a reflex the principle of the running but decapitated chicken indent a pressure switch he could have fired into the lump the mastoid process behind either ear or down the bridge of the nose there was no second shot the one bullet available of calibre dropped robbie cairns as well it did no chance was open for another firing cairns fell subsided fast no shock on his face nothing that betrayed a moment of anxiety only the concentration of aiming and focusing on the fallen target harvey gillot lived with the hired man the path the bullet would take had been amply explained to benjie arbuthnot by a dedicated instructor when might he have needed such expertise he couldnt have said but he had never willingly passed over an opportunity to learn the blackart skills of his chosen profession how to kill and leave not a single muscle flapping the bullet would have gone through the mastoid process and on into the medulla oblongata the brains stem and on impacting into it would have created an instant flaccid paralysis and the instructor had grinned grimly but i have to hit it and how big is it how much would i need lady luck it was about the size of half a sausage and it had been reached through the ear canal and the bullet would have driven along a mass of splintered bone ahead and it worked he knew the tactic as explained was successful because no muscular flap post mortem tightened on the trigger bar of cairnss pistol he slipped the pen back into his pocket blood oozed from cairnss ear spilled out and ran on to his neck he went forward at that moment the only man standing on the cornfield road was benjie arbuthnot he towered above the men and women who crouched low was he in time he didnt know had his intervention breaching the rules he had preached been too late they were matters beyond his experience quite hard he kicked roscoes ribs a smack in the face nothing more i gave you kit can he be saved or can he not be saved he heard arbuthnots voice gillot did not know where he lay or why he couldnt see anything more than distant shadow shapes above him there was a bark in the voice that demanded attention come on dont just bloody look at him do something for him you had the kit on your belt sergeant so use it steyn off your knees so that you all understand there will be no more shooting robbie cairns is as dead as yesterdays mutton god knows who did it but hes down and dead we have to be grateful to someone but i dont know who no more shooting so can we please see if gillot can be saved doesnt look too bright does he worth saving i think so hes been quite useful to the mother country over the years not exceptional but useful probably was more sinned against than sinning in the matter of the missile delivery hes owed the effort my opinion not that its an important opinion these days the pain was bad in the ribcage and in his chest not unbearable but bad the voice clearest to him in the babble was that of his driver who had called himself daniel the accent was midatlantic and mideuropean unique to the group who had followed him through the corn give me the analgesic morphine ok how i dont need a vein just in through the trouser leg there that one ease it in takes a bit but itll keep the pain within limits i appreciate you guys have put time and cash into this joyride coming here to stand on the pavement and watch but i dont think were into happy endings looks grim to me theres no exit wound so a slugs lodged in there probably wedged against the backbone and itll have taken rib with it fragments like shrapnel about all thats good is that the bullet entered right side of the chest left would have been the heart but i have a collapsed lung and hes breathing and theres air in the cavity that the lung should be filling do we have a field dressing what do we have thatll block that hole get too much air in and its pressure will screw up the veins going into the heart so they twist and get a blockage guess you dont need to know that do we not have a field dressing yes maam the blouse will do just get it off seemed quite a decent sort of guy but arms brokers can put on a deal of shit when they want to i suppose he knew what he was doing take a look bill im not feeling good about it the pressure built on his chest the pain was ebbing but he could feel a great weight there and thought hands pressed down on him there was drowsiness and just maybe the need to sleep the voice was american i reckon youre right not to feel good about it looks to me like you could be losing him not my expertise though put him under the earth for a couple of years then call me shit girls if i want to make a joke i make a joke but dont damn well pout at me hes almost said was an arms dealer they come in busloads they summon up excuses for what they do sometimes even plausible ones but societys better off without them i wont be shedding tears except except it was gutsy to come here and look them in the face just didnt work out the way he must have hoped it would do the form thing and swab him with the potassium permanganate get some steriliser round it but my bet youre losing him a womans voice rose above the others must have been the customs womans but the need to sleep grew and the pain had drifted so damn tired hes sinking isnt he isnt that what you say but he fucked us all up didnt he im wrecked sos megs and sos mark roscoe i wish hed never come into my life and the sooner hes out of it the better ill be pleased how does it end and where in this damn place that nobody wants to know about everything about this thing and the people involved me everyone is so bloody ordinary god look at the colour of him megs giving up your blouse was bigtime a wasted mercy mission he wasnt worth it he drifted further warm from the sun and knew that sleep was near megs spoke and her voice was clearest is that what you all do wring your hands weep to start with and then slag him then mutter about sinking and bloody losing and him going dont you do anything or should it be slipped and lost and gone is he actually breathing now very faint and hardly heard but identified as roscoe i failed him wasnt paid to stand in front of him but was obligated to after all that i failed him and ive lost about half of my front teeth did no one see who zapped the hire bastard well gillot was a nothing man and this is a nothing place so i suppose its fair to say that nothing fucking happened no bright lights no cameras no bands and no grandstands it hurts to have failed he felt himself lifted and it was the last harvey gillot felt steyn drove and gillot was across the back seat his head in roscoes lap benjie arbuthnot bumped off the track drove past the cemetery gate and headed into the village in front of the church he braked leaned forward and lifted the plastic bag that had been at his feet he passed it to megs behan and suggested where she should leave it she crossed the road but didnt turn to face the men and women gathered on the cafes veranda they gazed at her as if shed come from a different world and was alien to them as she was and as harvey gillot had been her blouse had gone with gillot so her shoulders and chest were covered by a skimpy tshirt she wouldnt have cared if shed been naked she hooked the handles of the bag as arbuthnot had said she should over the pointed top of a post in front of the halfcompleted building still they stared at her none waved or wished her a good journey home arbuthnot had said before they were off the cornfield road that the bag contained some trinkets and baubles and some legal documents and she imagined he had cleared out his wifes jewellery boxes maybe fifty thousands worth or even a hundred and also included the deeds of the house that overlooked the sea with views to die for she climbed back into the car and seemed to hear each shout of abuse that had been thrown at him and to suffer the blow of each rock stone or fist she turned her back on them and asked arbuthnot where they were heading for she was told that a brisk drive would bring them to osijek in time for the flight and the connection to london roscoe called in from the airport hed found a quiet corner of the car park he was finishing his report to the gold groups secretary i cant say who shot robbie cairns after id gone for him and hed belted me and after hed fired pointblank at gillot well ive told you all that and im half out and down well theres a shot and cairns is slotted dont know where it came from not sure it matters if youre looking for an investigation youll be whistling in the dark and get nowhere ive the impression before dark tonight that cairns will have been buried off that path through the cornfields therell be no cross and no shrine but a minefield warning sign might be plonked on top of him as i see it that means we wont have to endure one of those mawkish bad boys funerals black horses and all that crap as far as im concerned for officialese i know nothing saw nothing and heard nothing thats about it theyre calling us roscoe joined the queue at the departure gate he stood with megs behan penny laing william anders and the preposterous benjie arbuthnot all members of a club for which he fancied he had life membership mladen his son and tomislav had each shouldered a heavy spade what they would have used to clear out a blocked ditch and set off along the kukuruzni put to dig a hole the burning sun was high above them minimising their shadows ahead was the rumble of machinery as petar started to bring in the harvest and scalp the fields of the corn for the rest of the summer autumn winter and spring the landscape around the village would have changed far behind them a plastic bag flapped in the light wind from the railings in front of the church untouched it was the start of a day of fierce sleet as predicted by the forecaster and the post van came warily up the drive to the cottage where they lived they had to be woken by the doorbell because the package required a signature as proof of delivery benjie arbuthnot wished his postman well offered him a nip against the weather which was declined and carried the padded envelope into the kitchen after breakfast bloody bran and skimmed milk in the coffee he attacked it with his scissors and tipped out the contents he checked them six ties and four headscarves a flash of mischief from deirdre i suppose benjie youre going to play that silly game of yours i am indeed the ties went on to one pile on the kitchen table and the scarves on to another between the piles were more padded envelopes and his notebook of jottings and addresses he saw his wifes face screw up in mockdisapproval whats the matter with them only that theyre hideous but then vultures arent wonderfully pretty tough my old darling because ill wear the tie and i hope youll wear the scarf because youre sort of an ex officio member so the daft game can begin he wore that morning because it was ballsbreakingly cold in the cottage a thick sweater and a heavy twill shirt with a curled collar but he slung the tie round his throat and knotted it loosely the main body of it hung down across the knitwear and the representation of the vulture was big bold and pretty bloody ugly the head was large grotesque and done in a scarlet stitch over the blue of summer skies his wife had her scarf on her shoulders so both of the vulture heads were well displayed the game daft was an old favourite of benjie arbuthnot he would meet people at a local drinks evening in london on a train or on holiday chat with them for a few minutes and draw them out because that was a talent afterwards he would play the game of creating lifestyles histories and a future existence for them he did it sometimes with dry wit and others with a fortunetellers sadness at predicting pestilence and famine he could be a conjuror bewitching children so they didnt know if they watched sleightofhand or true magic few who heard his game played out would believe his guarantee that his insights came from imagination not fact right one each for us no envelope needed dont know about you i see a cold war veteran and a man long dispensed with but who one last time punched high above his weight was given favours by younger colleagues and returned a small measure of them but is now at grass his usefulness is exhausted beyond the ability to teach his grandson how to shoot and fish hes unlikely to be invited by any future director general to take a drink and chew over old times took too much and gave back too little pretty clapped out but its my club and its attraction is that the membership is made up of ordinary people no celebrity is allowed to join and we discourage the puddles of light that the high and mighty like to walk in we were there and we walked the bloody path were blessed a happy few i enjoyed the company of that man when he was young and i was still on the road they were good times but theyre gone i never want to hear gillots name again after today he had addresses and poste restante locations he would give her each name and she would write on the envelope then slip inside either a tie or a scarf with benjies visiting card she wrote daniel steyn md and the name of a shop behind the kudamm in berlin he was involved to stay in vukovar he would have needed a profile as low as a lizards he stood up at the end to be counted and too many loathed him there because of his innate ability to speak truths that were not wanted reconciliation rehabilitation he gave them the excuse to turn a difficult life his into an intolerable one i think he had a cat and im assuming that when hed found a decent billet for it he would have loaded his car and driven away i imagine he now practises medicine on behalf of immigrant groups on the fringe of the city earning a pittance and living in poverty but he wasnt a pharisee and didnt cross to the far side of the road that day hell wear it with pride but he lost because he moved away from the one place where he believed his work was valuable everyone touched by gillot in this business is scarred by him a rogue with a smile and he sucked people in burdened them with involvement the sole purpose in steyns life was to be in that community to work damned hard there gillot broke it an envelope was loaded and sealed the next name she wrote in the bold copperplate hand taught in convent education was professor william anders department of forensic pathology university of california santa barbara ca she reached for a tie and her husbands card a man of importance and stature used to being heeded he was confronted with a situation that he had been central to creating but which then had a momentum of its own he became an ignored nonentity i believe he will not return in the summer to vukovar but will permit pressure of work in angola rwanda congo or mozambique anywhere as an excuse for his absence that aura of conceit almost that of the bully is off him a plucked cock turkey and he will never have spoken of the events of that morning in the cornfield he was a loser stripped of the certainties of his life at the very end he was a useless passenger for him that means he was which will have hurt a major loser another and there are more who carries the scrapes on his skin of contact with gillot a pillar of his life has been snatched away she pushed that filled closed envelope across the table and took another a tie and a card wrote another name and address det sgt mark roscoe mps great victoria street london he seemed far away from her gazing at a whitened frozen landscape through the window an epic almost heroic loser a man of great honour and integrity a footsoldier with a backpack loaded down by a sense of obligation he lost out at first submitting his reports he would have been praised for his dedication and his response to the dutyofcare principle not for long the bloody bureaucrats from health and safety would then have fastened talons into him he went far beyond the remit of the job and was way outside the limits of his training went to the extremes of mission creep he never liked the target which made his commitment all the more praiseworthy where now probably on a burglary squad in hackney or hounslow or doing community liaison in cricklewood or camden he actually put himself in the way of harm they wont have liked that i would hope hell wear our tie and rejoice in the membership that it wont serve only to remind him of what he was in terms of his career a loser his disaster was the day he was assigned to gillot most officers would not have been within a hundred yards of the target that morning on the cornfield road and their careers would have survived intact not an ordinary man and damaged by gillot but perhaps he discovered himself in those fields and is the better for it they didnt know the full name she wrote mladen the villages name and vukovar croatia benjie arbuthnots mood lightened hes an old hooligan knows how to milk the system to the full and is also a lion of a man he and many like him fought tooth and claw to save their village and bought time whether intentionally or not is immaterial the time could be used to rush weapons into the runt of croatia every arms dealer in europe worth his salt was dealing except that our illustrious government had a policy of nonsupply and worked to prevent such shipments i was an agent in the fulfilment of that policy regardless of our efforts the state survived on the back of the sacrifices of that village and others and of that town and survived on the back of the profits of weapons brokers he was and is a magnificent fighter and his community has an excess of fortitude and courage i want to think theyll have moved on i want to believe that gillot would have provided the spur as he walked the cornfield road before he was shot for that community under mladens leadership to take a step forward and not always be going back into history or merely sideways there was something extraordinary and emotive about the walk gillot did he faced a problem confronted it and made the village do the same as if he dragged them out of their past and shamed them i think under that mans influence the village will now go forward not forget and not forgive but live without the aid of alcohol and pills of course gillot brought with him all the family valuables and the deeds of his home we left them at the church where are they now the church has cellars where the wounded were treated where mladens son was born and where his wife died and i believe they prised up a flagstone cleared out some earth and made a space large enough to dump gillots bag then resealed the stone and would have grouted it in maybe one day well go together and hell come well out of gillot not many others do id like to take you there and hope youll walk that road with me would have been his age not often that benjie arbuthnot was prone to emotion he shook himself a sort of shudder then his voice boomed the next name penny laing and the address was in yorkshire she chose a scarf to go into the envelope with his card loser sad but inevitable went native to the extent of putting on the warpaint and taking her clothes off hugetime loser and its a merciless world she had neither the training nor the coldness to confront it she lost her place on her alpha team and now works with a team dedicated to obstructing value added tax carousel frauds which is important for the national exchequer and about as dull as waiting for paint to dry her place of work is in the centre of the west yorkshire town of halifax and i have no doubt she cries herself to sleep each night a nice girl but the water was too deep if gillots file had never landed on her desk she would be a capable investigator with a good future and there would have been a nice young man around the next corner but the file was slapped down on the desk the scar on her back is deep he pulled at his chin was pensive for a moment as if he could cast his mind towards an old memory he recalled a face that was handsome yet could flash anger and also had emotion passion brightness he said the name megs behan pulled a face and for a moment his control was near to slipping the address was north london but he coughed and wiped his mouth with a napkin i liked her hugely a rather lovely girl ferocious but caring and destroyed utterly i remember her as being very quiet on the plane spoke to none of us refused a drink and bolted as soon as we were down didnt waste her time because he gillot had captivated her she came back to london and worked the phone knew the contacts for dealers and brokers and passed the word of where he was and the circumstances a hospital jet went down and collected him while he had one foot through deaths door but not quite the other and his fellow traders stumped up for treatment in switzerland he pulled through she left that ngo it was going fast down the sink hole as funds from charities and government dried up the credit crunch squeezed out the generosity of individuals and ministries consciences and aspirations tend to be put on the back hob in recession she would have been out on the street shed have thought that what shed done for him gave her rights of possession and was wrong again shes now with one of those legal firms that chases humanrights litigation midlands asians banged up for trying to blow us all prematurely to our maker and shes a duck in a driedout pond gillot won her over and the casualty was her loyalty to the campaigns against the arms trade shes nowhere and i think shes sad if shed never met gillot and had never gone to the cornfields of that damn village her life would still be ticking over not exciting but stable life can play very cruel even to rather nice people she must curse his name he scratched hard at an ear an inflammation caused by decades in fierce sunshine in distant corners and grinned the old blackhumour way and theres robbie cairns not that hell have call for a tie quite a pleasantlooking boy he reminded me of the young fellow who gardens at protheroes pleasant but ordinary must have been aware of me but had discounted any threat i posed which was a mistake the bigger mistake was going after gillot and never accepting that this wasnt the usual trade he did different quality and different challenge the worlds a better place as they say but he had a good face and lost big one envelope remained on the table propped against the marmalade jar one scarf one tie and one of benjie arbuthnots cards he grinned as if the years had dropped from his back there was a flash of saucy mischief in his eyes he told her the names of mrs josie gillot and mr harvey gillot the name of the pansion and the street that led out through the historic old town of sozopol that was a halfhour drive south of burgas and ended at the beach happy as a pig in shit i predict made his compromises and can live with them but she has also she let him set up shop then came out to bulgaria found the behan girl status not quite explained on site and saw her off i wouldnt be surprised if she brought the dog in a crate to further her cause i fancy that gillot wisely avoided intruding into that cat fight id imagine that facing a woman whod decided to stick with the joys of marriage as youd know my dear miss behans feet wouldnt have touched the ground she was out and on her neck the gillots run a bedandbreakfast in that upandcoming resort and would have bought it dirt cheap when the green shoots start to sprout itll be a good place to have invested in his compromise he looks after the laundry and the catering and might sell communications equipment but nothing that goes off with a bang his hands can stay clean while hes a conduit for contacts in bulgaria and moldova belarus and ukraine everything he does from bookings to dinner orders and the paperwork of what he buys and sells is bounced off her first id say that vauxhall bridge cross has limited contact with him keeps him on a minimal payroll the daughter is at an international school in sofia and lodges midweek with an embassy family whod have reckoned it hes alive and well and smiles with a winners confidence she looks after him with something approaching devotion and partnership funny the way it all works out did she believe a word he told her she wrote his name on the back of each package and their shropshire address code the postman would be the proof of his games credibility if no tie or scarf came back benjie arbuthnot had read it well he said ive learned things are seldom what they seem to be she said never are and never will be a bitter chilled morning snow had fallen on the fields in the night and lay almost virgin around the wooden cross there was peace and calm and buzzards soared on the winds clouds scudded and a pair of young foxes were wary as they padded past the cross leaving trails of their paw prints the wind soon would have covered the tracks with blown snow from the drifts and already the signs of the path that ran close to the cross were gone smoke from the burning of damp logs climbed from the distant chimneys of the nearest village but no mourners came to this place tramping through the impediment of the snow to grieve and remember the cross its lengths of rough wood held together by nails and the items hanging from it placed there with love protruded above the carpet blanketing the ground only the cross gave an indication that it was at this point harvey gillot had cheated death and robbie cairns had not and that here a schoolteacher and three young men had waited too long for a rendezvous and been trapped in another winters first dawn light a lonely place cursed where the dead and their ghosts kept uneasy company
