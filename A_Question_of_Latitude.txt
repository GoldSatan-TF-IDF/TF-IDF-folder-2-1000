a question of latitude by richard harding davis of the school of earnest young writers at whom the word muckraker had been thrown in opprobrium and by whom it had been caught up as a title of honor everett was among the younger and less conspicuous but if in his skirmishes with graft and corruption he had failed to correct the evils he attacked from the contests he himself had always emerged with credit his sincerity and his methods were above suspicion no one had caught him in misstatement or exaggeration even those whom he attacked admitted he fought fair for these reasons the editors of magazines with the fear of libel before their eyes regarded him as a safe man the public feeling that the evils he exposed were due to its own indifference with uncomfortable approval and those he attacked with impotent anger their anger was impotent because in the case of everett the weapons used by their class in striking back were denied them they could not say that for money he sold sensations because it was known that a proud and wealthy parent supplied him with all the money he wanted nor in his private life could they find anything to offset his attacks upon the misconduct of others men had been sent to spy upon him and women to lay traps but the men reported that his evenings were spent at his club and from the women those who sent them learned only that everett treats a lady just as though she is a lady accordingly when with much trumpeting he departed to investigate conditions in the congo there were some who rejoiced the standard of life to which everett was accustomed was high in his home in boston it had been set for him by a father and mother who though critics rather than workers in the world had taught him to despise what was mean and ungenerous to write the truth and abhor a compromise at harvard he had interested himself in municipal reform and when later he moved to new york he transferred his interest to the problems of that city his attack upon tammany hall did not utterly destroy that organization but at once brought him to the notice of the editors by them he was invited to tilt his lance at evils in other parts of the united states at systems trusts convict camps municipal misrule his work had met with a measure of success that seemed to justify lowells weekly in sending him further afield and he now was on his way to tell the truth about the congo personally everett was a healthy cleanminded enthusiast he possessed all of the advantages of youth and all of its intolerance he was supposed to be engaged to florence carey but he was not there was however between them an understanding which understanding as everett understood it meant that until she was ready to say i am ready he was to think of her dream of her write loveletters to her and keep himself only for her he loved her very dearly and having no choice was content to wait his content was fortunate as miss carey seemed inclined to keep him waiting indefinitely except in europe everett had never travelled outside the limits of his own country but the new land toward which he was advancing held no terrors as he understood it the congo was at the mercy of a corrupt ring in every part of the united states he had found a city in the clutch of a corrupt ring the conditions would be the same the methods he would use to get at the truth would be the same the result for reform would be the same the english steamer on which he sailed for southampton was one leased by the independent state of the congo and with a few exceptions her passengers were subjects of king leopold on board the language was french at table the men sat according to the rank they held in the administration of the jungle and each in his buttonhole wore the tiny silver star that showed that for three years to fill the storehouses of the king of the belgians he had gathered rubber and ivory in the smokingroom everett soon discovered that passengers not in the service of that king the english and german officers and traders held aloof from the belgians their attitude toward them seemed to be one partly of contempt partly of pity are your english protectorates on the coast then so much better administered everett asked the english coaster who for ten years in nigeria had escaped fever and sudden death laughed evasively i have never been in the congo he said only know what they tell one but youll see for yourself that is he added youll see what they want you to see they were leaning on the rail with their eyes turned toward the coast of liberia a gloomy green line against which the waves cast up fountains of foam as high as the cocoanut palms as a subject of discussion the coaster seemed anxious to avoid the congo it was there he said pointing the three castles struck on the rocks she was a total loss so were her passengers he added they ate them everett gazed suspiciously at the unmoved face of the veteran who ate them he asked guardedly sharks the natives that live back of that shoreline in the lagoons everett laughed with the assurance of one for whom a trap had been laid and who had cleverly avoided it cannibals he mocked cannibals went out of date with pirates but perhaps he added apologetically this happened some years ago happened last month said the trader but liberia is a perfectly good republic protested everett the blacks there may not be as far advanced as in your colonies but theyre not cannibals monrovia is a very small part of liberia said the trader dryly and none of these protectorates or crown colonies on this coast pretends to control much of the hinterland there is sierra leone for instance about the oldest of them last year the governor celebrated the hundredth anniversary of the year the british abolished slavery they had parades and teafights and all the blacks were in the street in straw hats with cricket ribbons thanking god they were not as other men are not slaves like their grandfathers well just at the height of the jubilation the tribes within twenty miles of the town sent in to say that they also were holding a palaver and it was to mark the fact that they never had been slaves and never would be and if the governor doubted it to send out his fighting men and theyd prove it it cast quite a gloom over the celebration do you mean that only twenty miles from the coast began everett ten miles said the coaster wait till you see calabar thats our exhibit a the cleanest best administered everything there is model hospitals barracks golf links last year ten miles from calabar dr stewart rode his bicycle into a native village the king tortured him six days cut him up and sent pieces of him to fifty villages with the message you eat each other we eat white chop that was ten miles from our model barracks for some moments the muckraker considered the statement thoughtfully you mean he inquired that the atrocities are not all on the side of the white men atrocities exclaimed the trader i wasnt talking of atrocities are you looking for them im not running away from them laughed everett lowells weekly is sending me to the congo to find out the truth and to try to help put an end to them in his turn the trader considered the statement carefully among the natives he explained painstakingly picking each word what you call atrocities are customs of warfare forms of punishment when they go to war they expect to be tortured they know if theyre killed theyll be eaten the white man comes here and finds these customs have existed for centuries he adopts them because one moment interrupted everett warmly that does not excuse him the point is that with him they have not existed to him they should be against his conscience indecent horrible he has a greater knowledge a much higher intelligence he should lift the native not sink to him the coaster took his pipe from his mouth and twice opened his lips to speak finally he blew the smoke into the air and shook his head whats the use he exclaimed try laughed everett maybe im not as unintelligent as i talk you must get this right protested the coaster it doesnt matter a damn what a man brings here what his training was what he is the thing is too strong for him what thing that said the coaster he threw out his arm at the brooding mountains the dark lagoons the glaring coastline against which the waves shot into the air with the shock and roar of twelveinch guns the first white man came to sierra leone five hundred years before christ said the coaster and in twentytwo hundred years hes got just twenty miles inland the native didnt need forts or a navy to stop him he had three allies those waves the fever and the sun especially the sun the black man goes bareheaded and the sun lets him pass the white man covers his head with an inch of cork and the sun strikes through it and kills him when jameson came down the river from yambuya the natives fired on his boat he waved his helmet at them for three minutes to show them there was a white man in the canoe three minutes was all the sun wanted jameson died in two days where you are going the sun does worse things to a man than kill him it drives him mad it keeps the fear of death in his heart and that takes away his nerve and his sense of proportion he flies into murderous fits over silly imaginary slights he grows morbid suspicious he becomes a coward and because he is a coward with authority he becomes a bully he is alone we will suppose at a station three hundred miles from any other white man one morning his houseboy spills a cup of coffee on him and in a rage he half kills the boy he broods over that until he discovers or his crazy mind makes him think he has discovered that in revenge the boy is plotting to poison him so he punishes him again only this time he punishes him as the black man has taught him to punish in the only way the black man seems to understand that is he tortures him from that moment the fall of that man is rapid the heat the loneliness the fever the fear of the black faces keep him on edge rob him of sleep rob him of his physical strength of his moral strength he loses shame loses reason becomes cruel weak degenerate he invents new bestial tortures commits new unspeakable atrocities until one day the natives turn and kill him or he sticks his gun in his mouth and blows the top of his head off the coaster smiled tolerantly at the wideeyed eager young man at his side and you he mocked think you can reform that man and that hell above ground called the congo with an article in lowells weekly undismayed everett grinned cheerfully thats what im here for he said by the time everett reached the mouth of the congo he had learned that in everything he must depend upon himself that he would be accepted only as the kind of man that at the moment he showed himself to be this attitude of independence was not chosen but forced on him by the men with whom he came in contact associations and traditions that in every part of the united states had served as letters of introduction and enabled strangers to identify and label him were to the white men on the steamer and at the ports of call without meaning or value that he was an everett of boston conveyed little to those who had not heard even of boston that he was the correspondent of lowells weekly meant less to those who did not know that lowells weekly existed and when in confusion he proffered his letter of credit the very fact that it called for a thousand pounds was in the eyes of a palm oil ruffian sufficient evidence that it had been forged or stolen he soon saw that solely as a white man was he accepted and made welcome that he was respectable few believed and no one cared to be taken at his face value to be refused at the start the benefit of the doubt was a novel sensation and yet not unpleasant it was a relief not to be accepted only as everett the muckraker as a professional reformer as one holier than others it afforded his soul the same relaxation that his body received when in his shirtsleeves in the sweltering smokingroom he drank beer with a chef de poste who had been thrice tried for murder not only to every one was he a stranger but to him everything was strange so strange as to appear unreal this did not prevent him from at once recognizing those things that were not strange such as corrupt officials incompetence mismanagement he did not need the missionaries to point out to him that the independent state of the congo was not a colony administered for the benefit of many but a vast rubber plantation worked by slaves to fill the pockets of one man it was not in his work that everett found himself confused it was in his attitude of mind toward almost every other question at first when he could not make everything fit his rule of thumb he excused the country tolerantly as a topsyturvy land he wished to move and act quickly to make others move quickly he did not understand that men who had sentenced themselves to exile for the official term of three years or for life measured time only by the date of their release when he learned that even a cablegram could not reach his home in less than eighteen days that the missionaries to whom he brought letters were a three months journey from the coast and from each other his impatience was chastened to wonder and later to awe his education began at matadi where he waited until the river steamer was ready to start for leopoldville of the two places he was assured matadi was the better for the reason that if you still were in favor with the steward of the ship that brought you south he might sell you a piece of ice matadi was a great rock blazing with heat its narrow perpendicular paths seemed to run with burning lava its top the main square of the settlement was of baked clay beaten hard by thousands of naked feet crossing it by day was an adventure the air that swept it was the breath of a blastfurnace everett found a room over the shop of a portuguese trader it was caked with dirt and smelled of unnamed diseases and chloride of lime in it was a canvas cot a roll of evillooking bedding a washbasin filled with the stumps of cigarettes in a corner was a tin chopbox which everett asked to have removed it belonged the landlord told him to the man who two nights before had occupied the cot and who had died in it everett was anxious to learn of what he had died apparently surprised at the question the portuguese shrugged his shoulders who knows he exclaimed the next morning the english trader across the street assured everett there was no occasion for alarm he didnt die of any disease he explained somebody got at him from the balcony while he was in his cot and knifed him the english trader was a young man a cockney named upsher at home he had been a steward on the channel steamers everett made him his most intimate friend he had a black wife who spent most of her day in a fourpost bed hung with lace curtains and blue ribbon in which she resembled a baby hippopotamus wallowing in a bank of white sand at first the black woman was a shock to everett but after upsher dismissed her indifferently as a good old sort and spent one evening blubbering over a photograph of his wife and kiddie at home everett accepted her his excuse for this was that men who knew they might die on the morrow must not be judged by what they do today the excuse did not ring sound but he dismissed the doubt by deciding that in such heat it was not possible to take serious questions seriously in the fact that to those about him the thought of death was ever present he found further excuse for much else that puzzled and shocked him at home death had been a contingency so remote that he had put it aside as something he need not consider until he was a grandfather at matadi at every moment of the day in each trifling act he found death must be faced conciliated conquered at home he might ask himself if i eat this will it give me indigestion at matadi he asked if i drink this will i die upsher told him of a feud then existing between the chief of police and an italian doctor in the state service interested in the outcome only as a sporting proposition upsher declared the odds were unfair because the belgian was using his black police to act as his bodyguard while for protection the italian could depend only upon his swordcane each night with the other white exiles of matadi the two adversaries met in the cafe francobelge there with puzzled interest everett watched them sitting at separate tables surrounded by mutual friends excitedly playing dominoes outside the cafe matadi lay smothered and sweltering in a black living darkness and save for the rush of the river in a silence that continued unbroken across a jungle as wide as europe inside the dominoes clicked the glasses rang on the iron tables the oil lamps glared upon the pallid sweating faces of clerks upon the tanned sweating skins of officers and the italian doctor and the belgian lieutenant each with murder in his heart laughed shrugged gesticulated waiting for the moment to strike but why doesnt some one do something demanded everett arrest them or reason with them everybody knows about it it seems a pity not to do something upsher nodded his head dimly he recognized a language with which he once had been familiar i know what you mean he agreed bind em over to keep the peace and a good job too but who he demanded vaguely thats what i say who from the confusion into which everetts appeal to forgotten memories had thrown it his mind suddenly emerged but whats the use he demanded dont you see he explained triumphantly if those two crazy men were fit to listen to sense theyd have sense enough not to kill each other each succeeding evening everett watched the two potential murderers with lessening interest he even made a bet with upsher of a bottle of fruit salt that the chief of police would be the one to die a few nights later a man groaning beneath his balcony disturbed his slumbers he cursed the man and turned his pillow to find the cooler side but all through the night the groans though fainter broke into his dreams at intervals some traditions of past conduct tugged at everetts sleeve and bade him rise and play the good samaritan but indignantly he repulsed them were there not many others within hearing were there not the police was it his place to bind the wounds of drunken stokers the groans were probably a trick to entice him unarmed into the night and so just before the dawn when the mists rose and the groans ceased everett still arguing sank with a contented sigh into forgetfulness when he woke there was beneath his window much monkeylike chattering and he looked down into the white face and glazed eyes of the italian doctor lying in the gutter and staring up at him below his shoulderblades a pool of blood shone evilly in the blatant sunlight across the street on his balcony upsher in pajamas and mosquito boots was shivering with fever and stifling a yawn you lose he called later in the day everett analyzed his conduct of the night previous at home he told upsher i would have been telephoning for an ambulance or been out in the street giving the man the firstaid drill but living as we do here so close to death we see things more clearly death loses its importance its a bromide he added but travel certainly broadens one every day i have been in the congo i have been assimilating new ideas upsher nodded vigorously in assent an older man could have told everett that he was assimilating just as much of the congo as the rabbit assimilates of the boaconstrictor that first smothers it with saliva and then swallows it everett started up the congo in a small steamer open on all sides to the sun and rain and with a paddlewheel astern that kicked her forward at the rate of four miles an hour once every day the boat tied up to a tree and took on wood to feed her furnace and everett talked to the white man in charge of the wood post or if as it generally happened the white man was on his back with fever dosed him with quinine on board except for her captain and a finn who acted as engineer everett was the only other white man the black crew and woodboys he soon disliked intensely at first when nansen the danish captain and the finn struck them because they were in the way or because they were not everett winced and made a note of it but later he decided the blacks were insolent sullen ungrateful that a blow did them no harm according to the unprejudiced testimony of those who before the war in his own country had owned slaves those of the southland were always content always happy when not singing close harmony in the cottonfields they danced upon the levee they twanged the old banjo but these slaves of the upper congo were not happy they did not dance they did not sing at times their eyes dull gloomy despairing lighted with a sudden sombre fire and searched the eyes of the white man they seemed to beg of him the answer to a terrible question it was always the same question it had been asked of pharaoh they asked it of leopold for hours squatting on the iron deckplates humped on their naked haunches crowding close together they muttered apparently interminable criticisms of everett their eyes never left him he resented this unceasing scrutiny it got upon his nerves he was sure they were evolving some scheme to rob him of his tinned sausages or possibly to kill him it was then he began to dislike them in reality they were discussing the watch strapped to his wrist they believed it was a powerful juju to ward off evil spirits they were afraid of it one day to pay the chief woodboy for a carved paddle everett was measuring a bras of cloth as he had been taught he held the cloth in his teeth and stretched it to the ends of his fingertips the woodboy thought the white man was giving him short measure white men always had given him short measure and at a glance he could not recognize that this one was an everett of boston so he opened everetts fingers all the blood in everetts body leaped to his head that he a white man an everett who had come so far to set these people free should be accused by one of them of petty theft he caught up a log of fire wood and laid open the scalp of the black boy from the eye to the crown of his head the boy dropped and everett seeing the blood creeping through his kinky wool turned ill with nausea drunkenly through a red cloud of mist he heard himself shouting the black nigger the black nigger he touched me i tell you he touched me captain nansen led everett to his cot and gave him fizzy salts but it was not until sundown that the trembling and nausea ceased then partly in shame partly as a bribe he sought out the injured boy and gave him the entire roll of cloth it had cost everett ten francs to the woodboy it meant a years wages the boy hugged it in his arms as he might a baby and crooned over it from under the bloodstained bandage humbly without resentment he lifted his tired eyes to those of the white man still dumbly they begged the answer to the same question during the five months everett spent up the river he stopped at many missions stations oneman wood posts he talked to jesuit fathers to inspecteurs to collectors for the state of rubber taxes elephant tusks in time even in bangalese to chiefs of the native villages according to the point of view he was told tales of oppression of avarice of hideous crimes of cruelties committed in the name of trade that were abnormal unthinkable the note never was of hope never of cheer never inspiring there was always the grievance the spirit of unrest of rebellion that ranged from dislike to a primitive hot hate of his own land and life he heard nothing not even when his face was again turned toward the east nor did he think of it as now he saw them the rules and principles and standards of his former existence were petty and credulous but he assured himself he had not abandoned those standards he had only temporarily laid them aside as he had left behind him in london his frockcoat and silk hat not because he would not use them again but because in the congo they were ridiculous for weeks with a missionary as a guide he walked through forests into which the sun never penetrated or on the river moved between banks where no white man had placed his foot where at night the elephants came trooping to the water and seeing the lights of the boat fled crashing through the jungle where the great hippos puffing and blowing rose so close to his elbow that he could have tossed his cigarette and hit them the vastness of the congo toward which he had so jauntily set forth now weighed upon his soul the immeasurable distances the slumbering disregard of time the brooding interminable silences the efforts to conquer the land that were so futile so puny and so cruel at first appalled and later left him unnerved rebellious childishly defiant what health was there he demanded hotly in holding in a dripping jungle to morals to etiquette to fashions of conduct was he the white man intelligent trained disciplined in mind and body to be judged by naked cannibals by chattering monkeys by mammoth primeval beasts his code of conduct was his own he was a law unto himself he came down the river on one of the larger steamers of the state and on this voyage with many fellowpassengers he was now on his way home but in the fact he felt no elation each day the fever ran tingling through his veins and left him listless frightened or choleric one night at dinner in one of these moods of irritation he took offence at the act of a lieutenant who in lack of vegetables drank from the vinegar bottle everett protested that such table manners were unbecoming an officer even an officer of the congo and on the lieutenant resenting his criticism everett drew his revolver the others at the table took it from him and locked him in his cabin in the morning when he tried to recall what had occurred he could remember only that for some excellent reason he had hated some one with a hatred that could be served only with death he knew it could not have been drink as each day the state allowed him but one halfbottle of claret that but for the interference of strangers he might have shot a man did not interest him in the outcome of what he regarded merely as an incident he saw cause neither for congratulation or selfreproach for his conduct he laid the blame upon the sun and doubled his dose of fruit salts everett was again at matadi waiting for the nigeria to take on cargo before returning to liverpool during the few days that must intervene before she sailed he lived on board although now actually bound north the thought afforded him no satisfaction his spirits were depressed his mind gloomy a feeling of rebellion of outlawry filled him with unrest while the ship lay at the wharf hardy her english captain cuthbert the purser and everett ate on deck under the awning assailed by electric fans each was clad in nothing more intricate than pajamas tonight announced hardy with a sigh we got to dress ship mr ducret and his wife are coming on board we carry his trade goods and i got to stand him a dinner and champagne you boys he commanded must wear whites and talk french ill dine on shore growled everett better meet them advised cuthbert the purser was a pinkcheeked cleareyed young man who spoke the many languages of the coast glibly and his own in the soft detached voice of a wellbred englishman he was in training to enter the consular service something in his poise in the assured manner in which he handled his white stewards and the black kroo boys seemed to everett a constant reproach and he resented him theyre a picturesque couple explained cuthbert ducret was originally a wrestler used to challenge all comers from the front of a booth he served his time in the army in senegal and when he was mustered out moved to the french congo and began to trade in a small way in ivory now hes the biggest merchant physically and every other way from stanley pool to lake chad he has a house at brazzaville built of mahogany and a grand piano and his own iceplant his wife was a suppergirl at maxims he brought her down here and married her every rainy season they go back to paris and run racehorses and they say the best table in every allnight restaurant is reserved for him in paris they call her the ivory queen shes killed seventeen elephants with her own rifle in the upper congo everett had seen four white women they were pallid washedout bloodless even the youngest looked past middleage for him women of any other type had ceased to exist he had come to think of every white woman as past middleage with a face wrinkled by the sun with hair bleached white by the sun with eyes from which through gazing at the sun all light and lustre had departed he thought of them as always wearing boots to protect their ankles from mosquitoes and army helmets when he came on deck for dinner he saw a woman who looked as though she was posing for a photograph by reutlinger she appeared to have stepped to the deck directly from her electric victoria and the rue de la paix she was tall lithe gracefully erect with eyes of great loveliness and her hair brilliantly black drawn a la merode across a broad fair forehead she wore a gown and long coat of white lace as delicate as a bridal veil and a hat with a flapping brim from which in a curtain hung more lace when she was pleased she lifted her head and the curtain rose unmasking her lovely eyes around the white bare throat was a string of pearls they had cost the lives of many elephants cuthbert only a month from home saw madame ducret just as she was a parisienne elegant smart soigne he knew that on any night at madrid or darmenonville he might look upon twenty women of the same charming type they might lack that something this girl from maxims possessed the spirit that had caused her to follow her husband into the depths of darkness but outwardly for show purposes they were even as she but to everett she was no messenger from another world she was unique to his famished eyes starved senses and feverdriven brain she was her entire sex personified she was the one woman for whom he had always sought alluring soothing maddening if need be to be fought for the one thing to be desired opposite across the table her husband the exwrestler chasseur dafrique elephant poacher bulked large as an ox men felt as well as saw his bigness captain hardy deferred to him on matters of trade the purser deferred to him on questions of administration he answered them in his big way with big thoughts in big figures he was fifty years ahead of his time he beheld the congo open to the world in the forests where he had hunted elephants he foresaw great factories mining camps railroads feeding gold and copper ore to the trunk line from the cape to cairo his ideas were the ideas of an empirebuilder but while the others listened fascinated hypnotized everett saw only the woman her eyes fixed on her husband her fingers turning and twisting her diamond rings every now and again she raised her eyes to everett almost reproachfully as though to say why do you not listen to him it is much better for you than to look at me when they had gone all through the sultry night until the sun drove him to his cabin like a caged animal everett paced and repaced the deck the woman possessed his mind and he could not drive her out he did not wish to drive her out what the consequences might be he did not care so long as he might see her again he jeered at the consequences of one thing he was positive he could not now leave the congo he would follow her to brazzaville if he were discreet ducret might invite him to make himself their guest once established in her home she must listen to him no man ever before had felt for any woman the need he felt for her it was too big for him to conquer it would be too big for her to resist in the morning a note from ducret invited everett and cuthbert to join him in an allday excursion to the waterfall beyond matadi everett answered the note in person the thought of seeing the woman calmed and steadied him like a dose of morphine so much more violent than the fever in his veins was the fever in his brain that when again he was with her he laughed happily and was grandly at peace so different was he from the man they had met the night before that the frenchman and his wife glanced at each other in surprise and approval they found him witty eager a most charming companion and when he announced his intention of visiting brazzaville they insisted he should make their home his own his admiration as outwardly it appeared to be for madame ducret was evident to the others but her husband accepted it it was her due and on the congo to grudge to another man the sight of a pretty woman was as cruel as to withhold the few grains of quinine that might save his reason but before the day passed madame ducret was aware that the american could not be lightly dismissed as an admirer the fact neither flattered nor offended for her it was no novel or disturbing experience other men whipped on by loneliness by fever by primitive savage instincts had told her what she meant to them she did not hold them responsible some worth curing she had nursed through the illness others who refused to be cured she had turned over with a shrug to her husband this one was more difficult of men of everetts traditions and education she had known but few but she recognized the type this young man was no failure in life no derelict no outcast flying the law or a scandal to hide in the jungle he was what in her maxim days she had laughed at as an aristocrat he knew her paris as she did not know it its history its art even her language he spoke more correctly than her husband or herself she knew that at his home there must be many women infinitely more attractive more suited to him than herself women of birth of position young girls and great ladies of the other world and she knew also that in his present state at a nod from her he would cast these behind him and carry her into the wilderness more quickly than she anticipated everett proved she did not overrate the forces that compelled him the excursion to the rapids was followed by a second dinner on board the nigeria but now as on the previous night everett fell into sullen silence he ate nothing drank continually and with his eyes devoured the woman when coffee had been served he left the others at table and with madame ducret slowly paced the deck as they passed out of the reach of the lights he drew her to the rail and stood in front of her i am not quite mad he said but you have got to come with me to everett all he added to this sounded sane and final he told her that this was one of those miracles when the one woman and the one man who were predestined to meet had met he told her he had wished to marry a girl at home but that he now saw that the desire was the fancy of a schoolboy he told her he was rich and offered her the choice of returning to the paris she loved or of going deeper into the jungle there he would set up for her a principality a state within the state he would defend her against all comers he would make her the queen of the congo i have waited for you thousands of years he told her his voice was hoarse shaken and thick i love you as men loved women in the stone age fiercely entirely i will not be denied down here we are cave people if you fight me i will club you and drag you to my cave if others fight for you i will kill them i love you he panted with all my soul my mind my body i love you i will not let you go madame ducret did not say she was insulted because she did not feel insulted she did not call to her husband for help because she did not need his help and because she knew that the exwrestler could break everett across his knee she did not even withdraw her hands although everett drove the diamonds deep into her fingers you frighten me she pleaded she was not in the least frightened she only was sorry that this one must be discarded among the incurables in apparent agitation she whispered tomorrow tomorrow i will give you your answer everett did not trust her did not release her he regarded her jealously with quick suspicion to warn her that he knew she could not escape from matadi or from him he said the train to leopoldville does not leave for two days i know whispered madame ducret soothingly i will give you your answer tomorrow at ten she emphasized the hour because she knew at sunrise a special train would carry her husband and herself to leopoldville and that there one of her husbands steamers would bear them across the pool to french congo tomorrow then whispered everett grudgingly but i must kiss you now only an instant did madame ducret hesitate then she turned her cheek yes she assented you must kiss me now everett did not rejoin the others he led her back into the circle of light and locked himself in his cabin at ten the next morning when ducret and his wife were well advanced toward stanley pool cuthbert handed everett a note having been told what it contained he did not move away but with his back turned leaned upon the rail everett his eyes on fire with triumph his fingers trembling tore open the envelope madame ducret wrote that her husband and herself felt that mr everett was suffering more severely from the climate than he knew with regret they cancelled their invitation to visit them and urged him for his healths sake to continue as he had planned to northern latitudes they hoped to meet in paris they extended assurances of their distinguished consideration slowly savagely as though wreaking his suffering on some human thing everett tore the note into minute fragments moving unsteadily to the ships side he flung them into the river and then hung limply upon the rail above him from a sky of brass the sun stabbed at his eyeballs below him the rush of the congo churning in muddy whirlpools echoed against the hills of naked rock that met the naked sky to everett the roar of the great river and the echoes from the land he had set out to reform carried the sound of gigantic hideous laughter a question of latitude
